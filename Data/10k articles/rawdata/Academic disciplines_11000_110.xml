The '''accelerating expansion of the universe''' is the observation that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[universe]] is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-20180311"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Donna |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=Measuring universe expansion reveals mystery – Is something unpredicted going on in the depths of space? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/measuring-universe-expansion-reveals-mystery |date=11 March 2018 |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory evidence has been found in [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its [[dark-energy-dominated era]] roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frieman |first=Joshua A. |last2=Turner |first2=Michael S. |last3=Huterer |first3=Dragan |year=2008 |title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=385–432 |arxiv=0803.0982 |bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |1=&lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}. The evolution of the scale factor is controlled by the dominant energy form: {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''w'')}} (for constant {{mvar|w}}). During the radiation-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; during the matter-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and for the dark energy-dominated era, assuming {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}, asymptotically {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ exp(''Ht'')}}."&lt;br /&gt;
p. 44: "Taken together, all the current data provide strong evidence for the existence of dark energy; they constrain the fraction of critical density contributed by dark energy, 0.76&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.02, and the equation-of-state parameter, {{mvar|w}}&amp;nbsp;≈ −1&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (stat) ±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (sys), assuming that {{mvar|w}} is constant.

These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}}
Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

==Background==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{further|Cosmological constant|Lambda-CDM model|Hubble's law|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann equations}}
In the decades since the detection of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) in 1965,&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A. A. |last2=Wilson |first2=R. W. |date=1965 |title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080&amp;nbsp;Mc/s |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=419–421 |bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P |doi=10.1086/148307}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Bang]] model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] defines how the [[energy]] in the universe drives its expansion.

:&lt;math&gt; H^2={\left ( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right )}^2=\frac{8{\pi}G}{3}\rho-\frac{{\Kappa}c^2}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Κ}} represents the [[curvature of the universe]], {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the total energy density of the universe, and {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hubble parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemiroff |first1=Robert J. |authorlink1=Robert J. Nemiroff |last2=Patla |first2=Bijunath |title=Adventures in Friedmann cosmology: A detailed expansion of the cosmological Friedmann equations |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1119/1.2830536 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703739 |bibcode=2008AmJPh..76..265N |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define a [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8{\pi}G} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[density parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;

We can then rewrite the Hubble parameter as

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

==Explanatory models==
[[File:Dark Energy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The expansion of the Universe accelerating. Time flows from bottom to top]]

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

===Alternative theories===
{{see also|Dark energy#Theories of dark energy}}
There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. [[Dark fluid]] is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anaelle |last1=Halle |first2=Hongsheng |last2=Zhao |first3=Baojiu |last3=Li |date=2008 |title=Perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal effects of modified gravity and dark matter |arxiv=0711.0958 |doi=10.1086/587744 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=177 |issue=1 |pages=1 |bibcode=2008ApJS..177....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive [[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]&lt;ref name="benoit-levy"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Benoit-Lévy |first2=G. |last2=Chardin |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/01/aa16103-10/aa16103-10.html |title=Introducing the Dirac–Milne universe |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=537 |issue=78 |page=A78 |year=2012 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201016103 |arxiv=1110.3054 |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...537A..78B }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hajdukovic"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/164008 |volume=28 |issue=16 |title=Backreaction: directions of progress |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |pages=164008 |arxiv=1102.0408 |bibcode=2011CQGra..28p4008R |last1=Räsänen |first1=Syksy |last2=Ratra |first2=Bharat |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104435 |volume=62 |issue=1 |title=Backreaction in Late-Time Cosmology |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |pages=57–79 |arxiv=1112.5335 |bibcode=2012ARNPS..62...57B |last1=Buchert |first1=Thomas |last2=Räsänen |first2=Syksy |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen:&lt;ref name="NS2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11498-is-dark-energy-an-illusion/ |title=Is dark energy an illusion? |date=2007 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title=Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue=25 |page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W |arxiv=0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony |author6=Sussman, Roberto |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2008 |arxiv=0708.2943 |bibcode=2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=42 |title=Dark energy as a mirage |issue=3 |pages=567–599 |year=2010 |arxiv=0711.4264 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42..567M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clifton |first=Timothy |author2=Ferreira, Pedro |date=April 2009 |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=300 |issue=4 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0409-48 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |pmid=19363920 |bibcode=2009SciAm.300d..48C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the [[equivalence principle]] to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

'''All-silica fiber''', or '''silica-silica fiber''', is an [[optical fiber]] whose [[Core (optical fiber)|core]] and cladding are made of [[silica glass]]. The [[refractive index]] of the core glass is higher than that of the cladding. These fibers are typically [[step-index fiber]]s. The cladding of an all-silica fiber should not be confused with the polymer overcoat of the fiber.

'''BeppoSAX''' was an [[Italy|Italian]]–[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[satellite]] for [[X-ray astronomy]] which played a crucial role in resolving the origin of [[gamma-ray bursts]] (GRBs), the most energetic events known in the universe. It was the first X-ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 decades of energy, from 0.1 to 300 [[kiloelectronvolt]]s (keV) with relatively large area, good (for the time) energy resolution and imaging capabilities (with a spatial resolution of 1 [[Minute of arc|arc minute]] between 0.1 and 10 keV). BeppoSAX was a major programme of the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI) with the participation of the [[Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes]] (NIVR). The prime contractor for the space segment was [[Alenia Aeronautica|Alenia]] while [[Telespazio|Nuova Telespazio]] led the development of the [[ground segment]]. Most of the scientific instruments were developed by the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|Italian National Research Council]] (CNR) while the Wide Field Cameras were developed by the [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research]] (SRON) and the LECS was developed by the astrophysics division of the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] facility.

BeppoSAX was named in honour of the Italian physicist [[Giuseppe Occhialini|Giuseppe "Beppo" Occhialini]]. SAX stands for "Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X" or "Satellite for X-ray Astronomy".

[[X-ray]] observations cannot be performed from ground-based telescopes, since [[Earth's atmosphere]] blocks most of the incoming radiation.

One of BeppoSAX's main achievements was the identification of numerous [[gamma ray burst]]s with extra-galactic objects. (See the linked article for details.)

Launched by an [[Atlas-Centaur]] on 30 April 1996 into a low [[inclination]] (&lt;4 degree) low-Earth orbit, the expected operating life of two years was extended to April 30, 2002 due to high scientific interest in the mission and the continued good technical status. After this date, the orbit started to decay rapidly and various subsystems were starting to fail making it no longer worthwhile to conduct scientific observations.

On April 29, 2003, the satellite ended its life falling into the Pacific Ocean.

== Spacecraft characteristics ==
BeppoSAX was a three axes stabilized satellite, with a pointing accuracy of 1'. The main attitude constraint derived from the need to maintain the normal to the solar arrays within 30° from the Sun, with occasional excursions to 45° for some WFC observations. Due to the low orbit the satellite was in view of the ground station of [[Broglio Space Centre|Malindi]] for only a limited fraction of the time. Data was stored on-board on a [[Magnetic tape|tape unit]] with a capacity of 450 Mbits and transmitted to ground every orbit during station passage. The average data rate available to instruments was about 60 kbit/s, but peak rates of up to 100 kbit/s can be retained for part of each orbit. With the solar panels closed, the spacecraft was 3.6 m in height and 2.7 m in diameter. The total mass amounts to 1400&amp;nbsp;kg, with a payload of 480&amp;nbsp;kg.

The structure of the satellite consisted of three basic functional subassemblies:
* the Service Module, in the lower part of the spacecraft, which housed all the subsystems and the electronic boxes of the scientific instruments.
* the Payload Module, which housed the scientific instruments and the [[star tracker]]s.
* the Thermal Shade Structure, that enclosed the Payload Module.

The primary sub-systems of the satellite are:
* The Attitude Orbital Control System (AOCS), that performed attitude determination and manoeuvred and operated the Reaction Control Subsystem in charge of orbit recovering. It included redundant [[Magnetometer|magnetomers]], Sun acquisition sensors, three star trackers, six [[gyroscope]]s (three of which are for redundancy), three [[Magnetorquer|magnetic torquers]] and four [[reaction wheel]]s, all controlled by a dedicated computer. The AOCS ensured a pointing accuracy of 1' during source observations and manoeuvres with a slew rate of 10° per min.
* The On Board Data Handler (OBDH) was the core for data management and system control on the satellite and it also managed the communication interfaces between the satellite and the ground station. Its computer supervised all subsystem processor activities, such as those of each instrument, and the communication busses.

== Instrumentation ==
BeppoSAX contained five science instruments:
* Low Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS)
* Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (MECS)
* High Pressure Gas Scintillation Proportional Counter (HPGSPC)
* Phoswich Detector System (PDS)
* Wide Field Camera (WFC)

The first four instruments (often called Narrow Field Instruments or NFI) point to the same direction, and allow observations of an object in a broad energy band of 0.1 to 300 keV (16 to 48,000 [[Joule|attojoule]]s (aJ)).

The WFC contained two [[coded aperture]] cameras operating in the 2 to 30 keV (320 to 4,800 aJ) range and each covering a region of 40 x 40 degrees (20 by 20 degrees full width at half maximum) on the sky. The WFC was complemented by the shielding of PDS which had a (nearly) all-sky view in the 100 to 600 keV (16,000 to 96,000 aJ) band, ideal for detecting [[gamma ray burst]]s (GRB).

The PDS shielding has poor angular resolution. In theory, after a GRB was seen in the PDS, the position was refined first with the WFC. However, due to the many spikes in the PDS, in practice a GRB was found using the WFC, often corroborated by a [[BATSE]]-signal. The position up to [[arcminute]] precision - depending on the signal to noise ratio of the burst - was found using the deconvoluted WFC-image. The coordinates were speedily sent out as an [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and Gamma-ray burst Coordinate Network Circular. After this, immediate follow-up observations with the NFI and optical observatories around the world allowed accurate positioning of the GRB and detailed observations of the X-ray, optical and radio afterglow.

The MECS contained three identical [[X-ray astronomy detector|gas scintillation proportional counter]]s operating in the 1.3 to 10 keV (208 to 1602 aJ) range. On 6 May 1997 one of the three identical MECS units was lost when a fault developed in the High Voltage power supply.

The LECS was similar to the MECS units, expect that it had a thinner window that allows photons with lower energies down to 0.1 keV (16 aJ) to pass through and operated in a "driftless" mode which is necessary to detect the lowest energy X-rays as these would be lost in the low field regime near the entrance window of a conventional GSPC. The LECS data above 4 keV (641 aJ) is not usable due to calibration issues probably caused by the driftless design. The LECS and MECS had imaging capability, whereas the high-energy narrow field instruments were non-imaging.

The HPGSPC was also a gas scintillation proportional counter, operating at a high (5 atmospheres) pressure. High pressure equals high density, and dense photon-stopping material allowed detection of photons up to 120 keV (19,000 aJ).

The PDS was a crystal ([[sodium iodide]] / [[caesium iodide]]) scintillator detector capable of absorbing photons up to 300 keV (48,000 aJ). The spectral resolution of the PDS was rather modest when compared to the gas detectors, but the low background counting rate resulting from the low inclination BeppoSAX orbit and good background rejection capabilities meant that the PDS remains one of the most sensitive high-energy instruments flown.

{{Tanakh OT |deutero}}
The '''Wisdom of Solomon''' or '''Book of Wisdom''' is a Jewish work, written in Greek, composed in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt). Generally dated to the 2nd century BC, the central theme of the work is "Wisdom" itself, appearing under two principal aspects. In its relation to man, Wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. In direct relation to God, Wisdom is with God from all eternity.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} It is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books|Sapiential]] or wisdom books included within the [[Septuagint]], along with [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), [[Book of Job|Job]], and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]], and is included in the canon of [[Deuterocanonical books]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the ''anagignoskomena'' (Gr. ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, meaning "those which are to be read") of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Structure, genre and content==
The structure can be divided into three sections:{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=22-23}}
# Book of [[Eschatology]]
#* exhortation to justice
#* speech of the impious, contrasts of the wicked and the just
#* exhortation to wisdom
# Book of Wisdom
#* Solomon's speech concerning wisdom, wealth, power and prayer
# Book of History
#* introduction, followed by diptychs of plagues
#* digression on God's power and mercy
#* digression on false worship and further plagues
#* recapitulation and concluding [[doxology]].

The book is addressed to the rulers of the earth, urging them to love righteousness and seek wisdom; the wicked think that all is chance and that they should enjoy each day, but they are deluded.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=13}} In the second section Solomon (not explicitly named, but strongly implied) tells of his search for wisdom.

The Wisdom of Solomon can be linked to several forms of ancient literature, both Jewish and non-Jewish, but it clearly belongs with biblical Wisdom books such as [[the Book of Job]], one of only five such books among ancient Jewish literature.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25}} In terms of classical genre it has been identified as an [[encomium]] and with the Greek genre of the "exhortatory discourse", by which a teacher attempts to persuade others to a certain course of action.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25-26}}

==Composition==
The Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek, in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt), in the late 1st century BC to early 1st century AD; the author's prime literary source was the [[Septuagint]], in particular the [[Wisdom literature]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]], and he was familiar with late Jewish works as the [[Book of Enoch]] and with Greek philosophical literature.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=763}} It is uncertain whether the book has a single author or comes from a school of writers, but recent scholarship has favoured regarding it as a unified work.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=24}} In either case its blend of Greek and Jewish features suggests a learned Hellenistic background, and despite the address to the "rulers of the world" the actual audience was probably members of the author's own community who were tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

==Themes==
The book opens with the opposed pairs righteousness/unrighteousness and death/immortality: those who do not follow righteousness will fall into "senseless reasoning" and will not be open to wisdom; wisdom is not an inherent human quality nor one that can be taught, but comes from outside, and only to those who are prepared through righteousness.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=764}} The suffering of the righteous will be rewarded with immortality, while the wicked will end miserably.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|pp=655-656}} The unrighteous are doomed because they do not know God's purpose, but the righteous will judge the unrighteous in God's presence.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} Lady Wisdom dominates the next section, in which Solomon speaks.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She existed from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], and God is her source and guide.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She is to be loved and desired, and kings seek her: Solomon himself preferred Wisdom to wealth, health, and all other things.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|p=658}} She in turn has always come to the aid of the righteous, from Adam to the Exodus.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} The final section takes up the theme of the rescue of the righteous, taking the Exodus as its focus: "You (God) have not neglected to help (your people the Jews) at all times and in all places." (Wisdom of Solomon, 19:22).{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">The '''Borghild Project''' was a hoax purported to be evidence for a [[Nazi Germany|German]] project during [[World War II]] aimed at combating the spread of [[syphilis]] among Nazi troops by supplying soldiers with [[sex dolls]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] supposedly approved the project to distribute inflatable [[sex doll]]s to his soldiers, which could be transported in their backpacks in order to give them an option to avoid places of prostitution in [[Paris]]. After years of being considered a real project, the lack of evidence supporting its existence led to it being deemed a hoax in the early 2000s, for various reasons.

==Background==
The project was supposedly inspired by [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s 1940 memo to [[Adolf Hitler]] that there was a [[syphilis]] problem in the houses of prostitution in [[Paris]]. In the report, he wrote, "The greatest danger in Paris is the widespread and uncontrolled presence of whores."&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; As a result, Hitler is said to have given approval to create smaller-than-life dolls, which was designated to be designed under the supervision of [[Adam Zimmerman]] at the [[German Hygiene Museum]]. According to Rudolf Chargeheimer, a psychiatrist involved in the project, the doll was to have synthetic flesh that mirrored real flesh and its body should be as flexible as a real human.

A total of fifty dolls were supposedly ordered for use in [[Jersey]] by officials, but the purported project was cancelled by Himmler after two years, after soldiers refused to carry them due to the fear of embarrassment if they were captured and one was found in their possession. The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] also supposedly destroyed the factories that were planned to build the dolls, as well as the records of the project.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;

==Hoax announcement==
According to supporters, the main supporting evidence for the project were two photographs purportedly rescued from the trash, which were later disproven as a hoax. Furthermore, the existence of a journalist named Norbert Lenz has also been questioned, as there is no proof that he ever existed in the first place, nor has any employee at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] ever recalled the project ever existing, when asked.&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;

==Film==
In 2009, a [[black comedy]] titled ''The Borghilde Project'' was released. Starring [[Jaye Davidson]], amongst other actors and actresses, the film presents the project as being factual, and was produced by [[Nobleman Films]].&lt;ref name=FF&gt;{{cite web|title=The Borghilde Project|url=http://www.festivalfocus.org/film/69709/the-borghilde-project|publisher=Festival Focus|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including [[iTunes U]], edX (where it is known as CS50x), and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS50 Moves Away from Traditional Lectures, Toward Virtual Reality|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/31/CS50-moves-from-lectures/|website=The Crimson|date=2016-08-31|author=Fahs, C.

[[File:Logo for CARTA (Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny).png|thumb|right|CARTA logo]]

The '''Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny''' (CARTA) is an Organized Research Unit (ORU) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].  Formally established in 2008, CARTA is a collaboration between faculty members of UCSD main campus, the [[UCSD School of Medicine]], the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]], and interested scientists at other institutions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306121005/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080410/news_1c10origins.html|title=Original kin|author=Scott LaFee|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via =Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080641/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/18518|title=New center for study of human origins opens|author=Debra Kain|publisher=UC Newsroom|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via =Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306131327/http://www.lajollalight.com/news/2008/sep/17/human-origins-focus-of-center/|title=Human origins focus of center|author=Staff|publisher=La Jolla Light|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via= Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CARTA was formed in order to promote [[transdisciplinary]] research into [[anthropogeny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454021a.html|title=Human evolution: Details of being human|author=Bruce Lieberman|publisher=Nature|date=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the study of human origins - drawing on methods from a number of traditional disciplines spanning the humanities, social, biomedical, biological, computational &amp; engineering and physical &amp; chemical sciences.

==History of CARTA==

Before CARTA became an established and formal UCSD recognized Organized Research Unit, a [[multidisciplinary]] effort to study human origins had already been underway in the [[La Jolla]] area for over a decade, coordinated by the UCSD Project for Explaining the Origin of Humans (POH). The group involved local experts in San Diego as well as many others throughout the world. The primary activity of the group was to organize multi-disciplinary interactions amongst members (via meetings in [[La Jolla]]), and via secure internet-based mechanisms. These efforts have now been converted into a larger and more publicly active research program, which facilitate graduate and postgraduate education in relevant departments and programs.

==Mission statement==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Use all rational and ethical approaches to seek all verifiable facts from all relevant disciplines to explore and explain the origins of the human phenomenon, while minimizing complex organizational structures and hierarchies, and avoiding unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy.  In the process, raise awareness and understanding of the study of human origins within the academic community and the public at large."&lt;ref&gt;[http://carta.anthropogeny.org/about/policies/full-mission-statement/ CARTA website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization and leadership==

The co-directors of the Institute are  [[Ajit Varki]], Professor of Medicine and Cellular &amp; Molecular  Medicine, UCSD,  [[Margaret Schoeninger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthropology.ucsd.edu/Faculty_Profiles/schoeninger.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616084421/http://anthropology.ucsd.edu/Faculty_Profiles/schoeninger.html |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and former Chair of the Department of  Anthropology, UCSD, and [[Fred Gage]], Professor, [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]], and Adjunct Professor of Neurosciences,  UCSD

==Activities==
The Center sponsors a symposium series on human origins&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.anthropogeny.org/symposia/past_list&lt;/ref&gt; for both researchers and the public. It also partners with other San Diego institutions and organizations in sponsoring public lectures

It offers a graduate specialization available to students in participating PhD programs at UC San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.anthropogeny.org/training/specialization-track&lt;/ref&gt;

It sponsors the {{visible anchor|Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny}} (MOCA), formerly known as the "Museum of Comparative Anthropogeny", an online compilation of comparative information that highlights the differences between humans and the “great apes,” with an emphasis on uniquely human features.&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca&lt;/ref&gt; It also compiles a chronological list of book titles relevant to exploring human origins and human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.anthropogeny.org/libraries/anthropogeny/biblio&lt;/ref&gt;

It houses the Museum of Primatology,&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.anthropogeny.org/museum&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of chimpanzee and human skeletons, which are currently undergoing 3D digitization and IT integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/jul/13/1c13chimps19498-skeleton-keys/?science&amp;zIndex=130932|title=Skeleton keys|author=Scott LaFee|publisher=UT San Diego|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/release.php?id=1555|title=CARTA to digitize extensive skeleton collection this summer|author=Calit2|publisher=California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology|date=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5974/43.summary|title=Cutting to the bone of human origins|author=Jon Cohen|publisher=Science|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CARTA does not directly fund or organize research by its members, but provides a forum for researchers in varied fields to come together "to explore and explain the human phenomenon.”

'''Centre for Fortean Zoology''' ('''CFZ''') is an organisation dedicated to [[cryptozoology]], and allied disciplines. According to the CFZ, it is a non-profit organisation founded in 1992 by [[Jonathan Downes]], and its honorary life president is the British explorer [[John Blashford-Snell]].&lt;ref&gt;About the CFZ http://www.cfz.org.uk/admin/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of the CFZ {{cite web |url=http://www.cfz.org.uk/admin/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206012555/http://www.cfz.org.uk/admin/history/ |archivedate=2007-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fortean zoology==
According to the CFZ, its primary focus involves unknown animals or cryptozoology, but they also examine unusual and aberrant [[Ethology|animal behavior]], [[Cattle mutilations|animal mutilations]], [[Animal colouration|animal colour variants]], [[teratology]], animal [[folklore]], classic [[Fortean]] subjects as [[Raining animals|creature falls]] (fafrotskies), and [[vampire]]/[[werewolf]] reports.&lt;ref&gt;Downes, J. The Owlman and Others (CFZ Press, Exeter, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes, J. The smaller mystery carnivores of the Westcountry (CFZ Press, Exeter, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expeditions==

'''Circle grid analysis''' ('''CGA'''), also known as '''circle grid strain analysis''', is a method of measuring the [[strain (mechanics)|strain]] levels of [[sheet metal]] after a part is formed by [[stamping (metalworking)|stamping]] or [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]]. The name itself is a fairly accurate description of the process. Literally, a grid of circles of known diameter is [[industrial etching|etched]] to the surface of the sheet metal to be formed. After the part is formed, the circles have been stretched into ellipses. By measuring the longest part of the ellipse (called the “major strain”) and the shortest part of the ellipse (called the “minor strain”), it is possible to determine how close any stamped part is to splitting or fracturing. 

The goal of using circle grid strain analysis is to predict potential problems before they become problems. Once you have a forming problem, chances are circle grid analysis won’t be able to help you, unless it’s intermittent enough to form a “good” part from time to time.

[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Oosterscheldekering]] sea wall, the Netherlands.]]

'''Coastal management''' is defence against [[flooding]] and [[erosion]], and techniques that stop erosion to claim lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/Natural_Disasters/coastalzones.htm|title=Coastal Zones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal zones occupy less than 15% of the Earth's land area, while they host more than 45% of the world population. Nearly 1.4 billion people live within 100&amp;nbsp;km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level, with an average density 3 times higher than the global average for population.{{sfn|Small|Nicholls|2003}} With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, human activities originating from this small land area will impose heavy pressure on coasts. Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and industrial activities.

In the [[European Union]], almost half of the population lives within 50 kilometres of the sea and coastal resources produce much of the Union's economic wealth. The fishing, shipping and tourism industries all compete for space along Europe's estimated 89,000&amp;nbsp;km of coastline and coastal zones contain some of Europe's most fragile and valuable natural [[habitat]]s.

Protection against rising sea levels in the 21st century is crucial, as [[sea level rise]] accelerates. Changes in sea level damage beaches and coastal systems are expected to rise at an increasing rate, causing coastal sediments to be disturbed by tidal energy.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Coastal engineering of [[harbour]]s began with the origin of maritime traffic, perhaps before 3500 B.C. [[Dock (maritime)|Dock]]s, [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and other harbour works were built by hand, often in a grand scale.

Ancient harbour works are still visible. Most of the grander ancient harbor works disappeared following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]].

Most coastal efforts were directed to port structures. [[Venice]] and its lagoon is an example of measures not related to ports. Protection of the shore in Nathan Heenan, England and the Netherlands began in the 6th century or earlier. The ancients understood phenomena such as Mediterranean currents and wind patterns and the wind-wave cause-effect link.

[[Roman engineering|The Romans]] introduced many innovations in harbor design. They built walls underwater and constructed solid [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]]. These structures were made using [[roman concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/04/why-roman-concrete-still-stands-strong-while-modern-version-decays Roman breakwaters were made with roman concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;In some cases wave reflection was used to prevent silting. They used surface-height breakwaters to trip the waves before they reached the main breakwater. They were the first dredgers in the Netherlands to maintain the harbour at [[Velsen]]. Silting problems there were solved when the previously sealed solid piers were replaced with new "open"-piled [[jetties]].

 Middle Ages 
Attack from the sea caused many coastal towns and their harbours to be abandoned. Other harbours were lost due to natural causes such as rapid silting, shoreline advance or retreat, etc. The [[Venetian Lagoon]] was one of the few populated coastal areas with continuous prosperity and development where written reports document the evolution of coastal protection works.

=== Modern Age ===
Little improvement took place beyond the Roman approach to harbour construction after the [[Renaissance]]. Then in the early 19th century, the advent of the [[steam engine]], the search for new lands and trade routes, the expansion of the [[British Empire]] through her colonies, and other influences, all contributed to the revitalization of sea trade and a renewed interest in port works.

=== Twentieth century ===
Prior to the 1950s, the general practice was to use hard structures to protect against [[beach erosion]] or [[storm]] damages. These structures included [[seawall]]s and [[revetment]]s or sand-trapping structures such as groynes. During the 1920s and '30s, private or local community interests protected many coastal areas using these techniques on an ad hoc basis. In certain resort areas, structures proliferated to such an extent that the protection impeded recreational uses. Erosion continued, but the structures remained, resulting in a loss of beach area.

The obtrusiveness and cost of these structures led in the late 1940s and early 1950s, to a more dynamic approach. Projects attempted to replicate the protective characteristics of natural beach and dune systems. The resultant use of artificial beaches and stabilized dunes as an engineering approach was economically viable and more environmentally friendly.

Limited knowledge of coastal sediment transport processes often resulted in inappropriate measures of coastal erosion mitigation. In many cases, measures worked locally, but exacerbated problems at other locations -up to tens of kilometers away- or generated other environmental problems.

==== European Code of Conduct ====
The essential source on coastal engineering is the ''European Code of Conduct for Coastal Zones'' issued by the [[European Council]] in 1999. This document was prepared by the Group of Specialists on Coastal Protection and underlies national legislation and practice.

The Group of Specialists originated in 1995, pursuant to a decision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It emphasized the need for integrated management and planning, but that coastal areas continued to deteriorate. The Group claimed that this was due to difficulties in implementing the concept of "integrated management". The Group proposed that the [[Council of Europe]], cooperate with the [[Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC)]] and [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

==Planning approaches==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:Fivepolicies.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Five general coastal management strategies]]
Five generic strategies are involved in coastal defense:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/table.htm|title=Shoreline Management Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Abandonment
* Managed retreat or realignment, which plans for retreat and adopts engineering solutions that accommodate natural processes of adjustment
* Armoring by constructing seawalls and other hard structures
* Construct defenses seaward of the coast
* Adapting vertically by elevating land and buildings

The choice of strategy is site-specific, depending on pattern of sea-level change, geomorphological setting, sediment availability and erosion, as well as social, economic and political factors.

Alternatively, [[integrated coastal zone management]] approaches may be used to prevent development in erosion- or flood-prone areas, reducing the need to address the changes. [[Growth management]] can be a challenge for [[local governments|local authorities]] who must provide the [[infrastructure]] required by new residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seachangetaskforce.org.au/|title=Australian Coastal Councils Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managed retreat===
{{Main|Managed retreat}}

Managed retreat is an alternative to constructing or maintaining coastal structures. Managed retreat allows an area to erode. Managed retreat is often a response to a change in [[sediment budget]] or to [[sea level rise]]. The technique is used when the land adjacent to the sea is low in value. A decision is made to allow the land to erode and flood, creating new shoreline habitats. This process may continue over many years.

The earliest managed retreat in the UK was an area of 0.8 ha at [[Northey Island]] flooded in 1991. This was followed by [[Tollesbury]] and Orplands in [[Essex]], where the sea walls were breached in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.uea.ac.uk/~e130/Tollesbury.htm|title=The Tollesbury and Orplands Managed Retreat Sites|website=archive.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ebro Delta]] (Spain) coastal authorities planned a managed retreat.&lt;ref&gt;MMA 2005, Sitges, Meeting on Coastal Engineering; [http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/table.htm EUROSION project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cost is generally the purchase of land to be abandoned. Relocation compensation may be needed. Human-made structures that will be engulfed by the sea may need to be removed. In some cases, armouring is used to protect land beyond the area to be flooded. Costs may be lowest if existing defences are left to fail naturally, but the realignment project may be more actively managed, for example by creating an artificial breach in existing defences to allow the sea in at a particular place in a controlled fashion, or by pre-forming drainage channels for created salt-marsh.

===Hold the line===
Holding the line typically involves shoreline hardening techniques, e.g., using permanent concrete and rock constructions. These techniques--[[seawall]]s, [[groynes]], detached [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], and [[revetments]]—represent more than 70% of protected shoreline in Europe.

Alternatively, soft engineering techniques supporting natural processes and relying on natural elements such as dunes and vegetation can prevent erosive forces from reaching the back-shore. These techniques include [[beach nourishment]] and [[sand dune stabilisation]].

Historically coastal strategies were heavily based on static structures, while coastal areas otherwise reflect a [[dynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Schembri|2009}} Armouring often has the unintended consequence of moving the problem to another part of the coast. Soft options such as [[beach nourishment]] protect coastlines and help to restore the natural dynamism, although they require repeated applications. Maintenance costs can eventually require a strategy change.

===Move seaward===
In some cases a seaward strategy can be adopted. Examples from erosion include: Koge Bay (Dk), Western [[Scheldt]] estuary (Nl), [[Chatelaillon]] (Fr) and Ebro delta (Sp).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

There is an obvious downside to this strategy. Coastal erosion is already widespread, and there are many coasts where exceptional high tides or storm surges result in encroachment on the shore, impinging on human activity. If the sea rises, many coasts that are developed with infrastructure along or close to the shoreline will be unable to accommodate erosion. They will experience a so-called "coastal squeeze" whereby ecological or geomorphological zones that would normally retreat landwards encounter solid structures and can migrate no further. Wetlands, salt marshes, mangroves and adjacent fresh water wetlands are particularly vulnerable to such a squeeze.

An upside to the strategy is that moving seaward (and upward) can create land of high value which can bring investment.

===Limited intervention===
Limited intervention is an action taken whereby the management only addresses the problem to a certain extent, usually in areas of low economic significance. Limited intervention often includes the succession of [[halosere]]s, including salt marshes and sand dunes. This normally results in protecting the land behind the halosere, as wave energy dissipates throughout the accumulated sediment and additional vegetation in the new habitat. Although the halosere is not strictly man-made, as many natural processes contribute to the succession, anthropogenic factors are partially responsible for the formation, since an initial factor was needed to help start the process of succession.

==Construction techniques==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}

===Hard engineering methods===

====Groynes====
[[File:Groyne at Mundesley, Norfolk.JPG|thumb|Groyne at [[Mundesley]], Norfolk, UK]]
{{Main|Groyne}}

Groynes are barriers or walls perpendicular to the coastline, often made of greenharts, concrete, rock or wood. Material builds up on the downdrift side, where [[longshore drift|littoral drift]] is predominantly in one direction, creating a wider and a more plentiful beach, thereby protecting the coast because the sand material filters and absorbs wave energy. However, there is a corresponding loss of beach material on the updrift side, requiring another groyne there. Groynes do not protect the beach against storm-driven waves and if placed too close together create currents that carry material offshore.

Groynes are cost-effective, require little maintenance and are one of the most common defences. However, groynes are increasingly viewed as detrimental to the aesthetics of the coastline and face opposition in many coastal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11762731.__47_3m_project_to_protect_Bournemouth___s_beaches_from_erosion_over_next_100_years/|title=£47.3m project to protect Bournemouth’s beaches from erosion over next 100 years|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groynes can be considered a "soft" solution because of the beach enhancement.

Groyne construction creates a problem known as terminal groyne syndrome. The terminal groyne prevents [[longshore drift]] from bringing material to other nearby places. This is a problem along the Hampshire and Sussex coastline in the UK; e.g., at [[Worthing]].

==== Seawalls ====
{{main|Seawall}}
Walls of concrete or rock, are used to protect a settlement against erosion or flooding. They are typically about {{convert|3|-|5|m|0}} high. Older-style vertical seawalls reflected all the energy of the waves back out to sea, and for this purpose were often given recurved crest walls which increased local turbulence, and thus increased entrainment of sand and sediment. During storms, sea walls help longshore drift.

Modern seawalls aim to re-direct most of the incident energy in the form of sloping revetments, resulting in low reflected waves and much reduced turbulence. Designs use porous designs of rock, concrete armour (Seabees, SHEDs, [[Xblocs]]) with flights of steps for beach access.

The location of a seawall, must consider the swept prism of the beach profile, the consequences of long-term beach recession and amenity crest level, including cost implications.

Sea walls can cause beaches to dissipate. Their presence also alters the landscape that they are trying to protect.

Modern examples can be found at Cronulla (NSW, 1985-6),&lt;ref&gt;Armour Units – Random Mass or Disciplined Array, – C.T.Brown ASCE Coastal Structures Specialty Conference, Washington, March 1979; The Design &amp; Construction of Prince St. Seawall, Cronulla, EHW Hirst &amp; D.N.Foster – 8th CCOE, Nov 1987, Launceston, Tasmania&lt;/ref&gt; Blackpool (1986–2001),&lt;ref&gt;Blackpool South Shore Physical Model Studies, ABP Research Report R 526, December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Lincolnshire (1992–1997)&lt;ref&gt;Mablethorpe to Skegness, Model tests of three design options, P Holmes et al., Imperial College, September 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallasey (1983–1993).&lt;ref&gt;M. N. Bell, P. C. Barber and D. G. E. Smith. The Wallasey Embankment. [http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/IssueContentPage.aspx?journalID=iicep&amp;Volume=58&amp;Issue=4 Proc. Instn Civ. Engrs 1975 (58)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} pp. 569—590.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sandwich, Kent]] the Seabee seawall is buried at the back of the beach under the shingle with crest level at road kerb level.

Sea walls typically cost £10,000 per metre (depending on material, height and width), £10,000,000 per km (depending on material, height and width).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

====Revetments====
{{Main|Revetments}}

Revetments are slanted or upright blockades, built parallel to the coast, usually towards the back of the beach to protect the area  beyond. The most basic revetments consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the revetments, which dissipate and absorb the energy. The shoreline is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the revetments trap some of the material. They may be watertight, covering the slope completely, or porous, to allow water to filter through after the wave energy has been dissipated. Most revetments do not significantly interfere with transport of longshore drift. Since the wall absorbs energy instead of reflecting, the surf progressively erodes and destroys the revetment; therefore, maintenance is ongoing, as determined by the structural material and product quality.

====Rock armour====
{{Main|Riprap}}
Rock armour is large rocks placed at the sea edge using local material. This is generally used to absorb wave energy and hold beach material. Although effective, this solution is unpopular for aesthetic reasons. Longshore drift is not hindered. Rock armour has a limited lifespan, is not effective in storm conditions and reduces recreational values.

====Gabions====
{{Main|Gabion}}
Boulders and rocks are wired into mesh cages and placed in front of areas vulnerable to erosion: sometimes at cliffs edges or at right angles to the beach. When the ocean lands on the gabion, the water drains through leaving sediment, while the structure absorbs a moderate amount of wave energy.

Gabions need to be securely tied to protect the structure.

Downsides include wear rates and visual intrusiveness.

====Offshore breakwater====
{{Main|Breakwater (structure)}}
Concrete blocks and/or boulders are sunk offshore to alter wave direction and to filter wave and tide energy. The waves break further offshore and therefore lose erosive power. This leads to wider beaches, which further absorb wave energy. [[Dolos]] has replaced the use of concrete blocks because it is more resistant to wave action and requires less concrete to produce a superior result. Similar concrete objects like Dolos are [[A-jack]], [[Akmon]], [[Xbloc]], [[Tetrapod (structure)|Tetrapod]] and [[Accropode]].

====Cliff stabilization====
{{Main|Cliff stabilization}}

[[Cliff stabilization]] can be accomplished through drainage of excess rainwater of through terracing, planting and wiring to hold cliffs in place.

====Entrance training walls====

{{Main|Training (civil)}}

Training walls are built to constrain a river or creek as it discharges across a sandy coastline. The walls stabilise and deepen the channel which benefits navigation, flood management, river erosion and water quality, but can cause coastal erosion by interrupting longshore drift. One solution is a sand bypassing system to pump sand under/around the training walls.

====Floodgates====
{{Main|Floodgate}}

Storm surge barriers, or [[floodgates]], were introduced after the [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea Flood of 1953]] and prevent damage from storm surges or any other type of natural disaster that could harm the area they protect. They are habitually open and allow free passage, but close under threat of a storm surge. The [[Thames Barrier]] is an example of such a structure.

===Soft engineering methods===

====Beach replenishment====
{{Main|Beach replenishment}}
Beach replenishment/nourishment involves importing sand from elsewhere and adding it to the existing beach. The imported sand should be of a similar quality to the existing beach material so it can meld with the natural local processes and without adverse effects. Beach nourishment can be used in combination with groynes. The scheme requires repeated applications on an annual or multi-year cycle.

====Dune stabilisation====

Stabilising dunes can help protect beaches by catching windblown sand, increasing natural beach formation. Dune stabilisation/sand dune management employs public amenities such as car parks, footpaths, [[Dutch sand ladder|Dutch Ladders]] and [[boardwalk]]s to reduce erosion and the removal of sand by humans. Noticeboards, leaflets and beach wardens explain to visitors how to avoid damaging the area. Beach areas can be closed to the public to reduce damage. Fences can allow sand traps to create [[Blowout (geology)|blowouts]] and increase windblown sand capture. Plants such as [[Ammophila (plant)|Ammophila]] (Marram grass) can bind the sediment.

====Beach drainage====&lt;!-- note [[Beach drainage]] links here --&gt;
Beach drainage or beach face dewatering lowers the [[water table]] locally beneath the beach face. This causes [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretion]] of sand above the drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105736/http://www.shoregro.com/P04_BD-how%20it%20works.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach watertables have an important bearing on deposition/erosion across the foreshore.{{sfn|Grant|1946}} In one study a high watertable coincided with accelerated beach erosion, while a low watertable coincided with pronounced aggradation of the foreshore. A lower watertable (unsaturated beach face) facilitates deposition by reducing flow velocities during backwash and prolonging laminar flow. With the beach in a saturated state, backwash velocity is accelerated by the addition of groundwater seepage out of the beach within the effluent zone.

However, no case studies provide indisputable evidence of positive results, although in some cases overall positive performance was reported. Long-term monitoring was not undertaken at a frequency high enough to discriminate the response to high energy erosive events.

A useful side effect of the system is that collected seawater is relatively pure because of sand's filtration effect. Such water may be discharged or be used to oxygenate stagnant inland lagoons/marinas or used as feed for heat pumps, desalination plants, land-based aquaculture, aquariums or swimming pools.

Beach drainage systems have been installed in many locations around the world to halt and reverse erosion trends in sand beaches. Twenty four beach drainage systems have been installed since 1981 in Denmark, USA, UK, Japan, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and Malaysia.

==== Costs ====
The costs of installation and operation vary due to:
* system length (non-linear cost elements)
* pump flow rates (sand permeability, power costs)
* soil conditions (presence of rock or impermeable strata)
* discharge arrangement /filtered seawater utilization
* drainage design, materials selection &amp; installation methods
* geographical considerations (location logistics)
* regional economic considerations (local capabilities /costs)
* study requirements /consent process.

==Monitoring ==
Coastal managers must compensate for error and uncertainty in the information regarding the erosive processes. Video-based monitoring can collect data continuously and produce analyses of shoreline processes.

===Event warning systems===
Event warning systems, such as [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warnings]] and [[storm surge]] warnings, can be used to minimize the human impact of catastrophic events that cause coastal erosion. Storm surge warnings can help determine when to close [[floodgate]]s.

Wireless sensor networks can aid monitoring.

===Shoreline mapping===

Defining the shoreline is a difficult task due to its dynamic nature and the intended application.{{sfn|Graham|Sault|Bailey|2003}}{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} The relevant mapping scale is dependent on the context of the investigation.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Generally, the coast comprises the interface between land and sea, and the shoreline is represented by the margin between the two.{{sfn|Woodroffe|2002}} Investigators adopt the use of shoreline indicators to represent the true shoreline position.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}

====Shoreline indicator====

[[File:Mcwillizind.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Figure 1. A diagram representing the spatial relationship between many of the commonly used indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from {{harvnb|Boak|Turner|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The choice of shoreline indicator is a primary consideration. Indicators must be easily identified in the field and on [[aerial photography]].{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Shoreline indicators may be morphological features such as the [[berm]] crest, scarp edge, [[vegetation]] line, [[dune]] toe, dune crest and cliff or the bluff crest and toe. Alternatively, non-morphological features may be used such as water level (high water line (HWL), mean high water line) wet/dry boundary and the physical water line.{{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}} Figure 1 provides a sketch of the spatial relationships between commonly used shoreline indicators.

The HWL (H in Figure 1) is the most commonly used shoreline indicator because it is visible in the field, and can be interpreted on both colour and grey scale aerial photographs.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}}{{sfn|Crowell|Leatherman|Buckley|1991}} The HWL represents the landward extent of the most recent [[high tide]] and is characterised by a change in sand colour due to repeated, periodic inundation by high tides. The HWL is portrayed on aerial photographs by the most landward change in colour or grey tone.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}

====Importance and application====

The shoreline location and its changing position over time is of fundamental importance to coastal scientists, engineers and managers.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} {{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}} Shoreline monitoring campaigns provide information about historic shoreline location and movement, and about predictions of future change.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}} More specifically the position of the shoreline in the past, at present and where it is predicted to be in the future is useful for in the design of coastal protection, to calibrate and verify [[computer simulation|numerical models]] to assess [[sea level rise]], map hazard zones and to regulate coastal development. The location of the shoreline also provides information regarding shoreline reorientation adjacent to structures, [[beach]] width, volume and rates of historical change.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}{{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}}

====Data sources====

A variety of data sources are available for examining shoreline position. However, the availability of historical data is limited at many coastal sites and so the choice of data source is largely limited to what is available for the site at a given time.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Shoreline mapping techniques have become more automated. The frequent changes in technology prevented the emergence of one standard mapping approach. Each data source and associated method have capabilities and shortcomings.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

=====Historical maps=====

In the event that a study requires the shoreline position from before aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photographic coverage, historical maps provide an alternative.{{sfn|Moore|2000}} Many errors are associated with early maps and charts. Such errors may be associated with scale, [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] changes, distortions from uneven shrinkage, stretching, creases, tears and folds, different [[surveying]] standards, different publication standards and [[map projection|projection]] errors.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy of the map and the physical changes that occurred after it was made.{{sfn|Anders|Byrnes|1991}} The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates is the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey]]/[[National Ocean Service]] T-sheets and dates to the early-to-mid-19th century.{{sfn|Morton|1991}} In the United Kingdom, many pre-1750 maps and charts were deemed to be inaccurate. The founding of the [[Ordnance Survey]] in 1791 improved mapping accuracy.

=====Aerial photographs=====
Aerial photographs began to be used in the 1920s to provide [[topography|topographical]] data. They provide a good [[database]] for compilation of shoreline change maps. Aerial photographs are the most commonly used data source because many coastal areas have extensive aerial photo coverage.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}Aerial photographs generally provide good spatial coverage. However, temporal coverage is site specific. The interpretation of shoreline position is subjective given the dynamic nature of the coastal environment. This combined with various distortions inherent in aerial photographs can lead to [[statistical significance|significant]] error levels.{{sfn|Moore|2000}} The minimisation of further errors is discussed below.

======Object space displacements======

[[File:Displacement1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Figure 2. An example of relief displacement. All objects above ground level are displaced outwards from the centre of the photograph. The displacement becomes more evident near the edges.]]

Conditions outside of the camera can cause objects in an image to appear displaced from their true ground position. Such conditions may include ground relief, camera [[tilt (optics)|tilt]] and [[atmospheric refraction]].

Relief displacement is prominent when photographing a variety of [[elevation]]s. This situation causes objects above sea level to be displaced outward from the centre of the photograph and objects below ground level to be displaced toward the centre of the image (Figure 2). The severity of the displacement is negatively associated with decreases in flight altitude and as [[radial distance (geometry)|radial distance]] from the centre of the photograph increases. This distortion can be minimised by photographing multiple [[swath width|swaths]] and creating a [[mosaic]] of the images. This technique creates a focus for the centre of each photograph where distortion is minimised. This error is not common in shoreline mapping as the relief is fairly constant. It is however important to consider when mapping cliffs.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

Ideally aerial photographs are taken so the [[optical axis]] of the camera is perfectly [[perpendicular]] to the ground surface, thereby creating a [[Vertical direction|vertical]] photograph. Unfortunately this is often not the case and virtually all aerial photographs experience tilt up to 3°.{{sfn|Camfield|Morang|1996}} In this situation the scale of the image is larger on the upward side of the tilt axis and smaller on the downward side. Many coastal researchers do not consider this in their work.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

======Radial lens distortion======
[[photographic lens|Lens]] distortion varies as a function of radial distance from the iso-centre of the photograph meaning that the centre of the image is relatively distortion free, but as the [[angle]] of view increases distortion. This is a significant source of error in earlier aerial photography. Such a distortion is impossible to correct for without knowing the details of the lens used to capture the image. Overlapping images can be used to resolve errors.{{sfn|Crowell|Leatherman|Buckley|1991}}

====== Shoreline delineation ======
The dynamic nature of coasts compromises shoreline mapping. This uncertainty arises because at any given time the position of the shoreline is influenced by the immediate tidal effects and a variety of long-term effects such as relative sea-level rise and along [[shore]] [[littoral zone|littoral]] [[sediment]] movement. This affects the accuracy of computed historic shoreline position and predictions.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}} HWL is most commonly used as a shoreline indicator. Many errors are associated with using the wet/dry line as a proxy for the HWL and shoreline. The errors of largest concern are the short-term migration of the wet/dry line, interpretation of the wet/dry line on a photograph and measurement of the interpreted line position.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}}{{sfn|Moore|2000}} Systematic errors such as the migration of the wet/dry line arise from tidal and [[seasonal]] changes. [[Erosion]] may cause the wet/dry line to migrate. Field investigations have shown that these changes can be minimised by using only summertime data.;{{sfn|Moore|2000}} {{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Furthermore, the error bar can be significantly reduced by using the longest record of reliable data to calculate erosion rates.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Errors may arise due to the difficulty of measuring a single line on a photograph. For example, where the pen line is 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm thick this translates to an error of ±2.6 m on a 1:20000 scale photograph.

=====Beach profiling surveys=====
Beach profiling surveys are typically repeated at regular intervals along the coast in order to measure short-term (daily to annual) variations in shoreline position and beach volume.{{sfn|Smith|Zarillo|1990}} Beach profiling is a very accurate source of information. However, measurements are generally subject to the limitations of conventional surveying techniques. Shoreline data derived from beach profiling is often spatially and temporally limited due to the high cost associated with that labour-intensive activity. Shorelines are generally derived by [[interpolation|interpolating]] from a series of discrete beach profiles. The distance between the profiles is usually quite large, limiting the accuracy of the interpolating. Survey data is limited to smaller lengths of shoreline generally less than ten kilometres.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Beach profiling data is commonly available in from regional councils in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071017223708/http://www.hbrc.govt.nz/PORTALS/0/CHA/CHA%20Vol%203%20Appendix%20A.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Remote sensing=====
A range of airborne, [[satellite]] and land based [[remote sensing]] techniques can provide additional, mappable data.{{sfn|Smith|Zarillo|1990}} Remotely sensed data sources include:

*[[Multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral]] imaging
*[[Microwave]] sensors
*[[Global positioning system]] (GPS)
*[[LIDAR|Airborne light detection and ranging technology]] (LIDAR)

Remote sensing techniques can be cost effective, reduce manual error and reduce the subjectivity of conventional field techniques.{{sfn|Maiti|Bhattacharya|2009}} Remote sensing is a relatively new concept, limiting extensive historical observations. Coastal morphology observations must be quantified by coupling remotely sensed data with other sources of information detailing historic shoreline position from archived sources.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}}

=====Video analysis=====
[[Video]] analysis provides quantitative, cost-effective, continuous and long-term monitoring beaches.{{sfn|Turner|Aarninkhof|Dronkers|McGrath|2004}} The advancement of coastal video systems in the twenty-first century enabled the extraction of large amounts of geophysical data from images. The data describes coastal morphology, surface currents and wave parameters. The main advantage of video analysis lies in the ability to reliably quantify these parameters with high resolution space and time coverage. This highlights their potential as an effective coastal monitoring system and an aid to coastal zone management.{{sfn|Van Koningsveld|Davidson|Huntly|Medina|2007}} Interesting case studies have been carried out using video analysis. One group used a video-based ARGUS coastal imaging system{{sfn|Turner|Aarninkhof|Dronkers|McGrath|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalwiki.org/coastalwiki/Argus_video_monitoring_system|title=Argus video monitoring system - Coastal Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor and quantify the regional-scale coastal response to sand nourishment and construction of the world-first [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] artificial surfing [[reef]] in Australia. Another assessed the added value of high [[Image resolution|resolution]] video observations for short-term predictions of near shore hydrodynamic and morphological processes, at temporal scales of meters to kilometres and days to seasons.{{sfn|Smit|Aarninkhof|Wijnberg|Gonzalez|2007}}

Video analysis gives coastal zone managers the opportunity to obtain [[bathymetry]].{{sfn|Plant|Holland|Haller|2008}}{{sfn|Holman|Plant|Holland|2013}}{{sfn|Bergsma|Conley|Davidson|O'Hare|2016}} It can be used to obtain inter-tidal topographies and sub-tidal bathymetries and measure coastal zone resilience [as in available beach volume as well as sub-tidal bar configuration]. Video-based depth estimations were applied in micro/meso tidal environments at DUCK, NC{{sfn|Holman|Plant|Holland|2013}} and highly energetic wave climates with a macro tidal regime at Porthtowan in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Bergsma|Conley|Davidson|O'Hare|2016}} The latter showed the application of video-based depth estimations during extreme storms.{{sfn|Masselink|Scott|Poate|Russell|2016}}{{sfn|Castelle|Marieu|Bujana|Splinter|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5720">'''Cognitive infocommunications''' ('''CogInfoCom''')&lt;ref name="CICwebsite"&gt;[http://www.coginfocom.hu Cognitive infocommunications]&lt;/ref&gt; investigates the link between the research areas of [[infocommunications]] and the [[cognitive science]]s, as well as the various engineering applications which have emerged as the synergic combination of these sciences.

The primary goal of CogInfoCom is to provide a systematic view of how [[cognitive process]]es can co-evolve with infocommunications devices so that the capabilities of the [[human brain]] may not only be extended through these devices, irrespective of [[geographical distance]], but may also interact with the capabilities of any [[Artificial cognition|artificially cognitive system]]. This merging and extension of cognitive capabilities is targeted towards engineering applications in which artificial and/or natural [[cognitive system]]s are enabled to work together more effectively.

Two important dimensions of cognitive infocommunications are the '''mode''' of communication and the '''type''' of communication.
The mode of communication refers to the actors at the two endpoints of communication:

* '''Intra-cognitive communication''': [[information transfer]] occurs between two cognitive beings with equivalent cognitive capabilities (e.g.: between two humans).
* '''Inter-cognitive communication''': [[information transfer]] occurs between two cognitive beings with different cognitive capabilities (e.g.: between a human and an artificially cognitive system).

The type of communication refers to the type of information that is conveyed between the two communicating entities, and the way in which this is done:

* '''Sensor-sharing communication''': entities on both ends use the same [[sensory modality]] to perceive the communicated information.
* '''Sensor-bridging communication''': [[sensory information]] obtained or experienced by each of the entities is not only transmitted, but also transformed to an appropriate and different sensory modality.
* '''Representation-sharing communication''': the same [[information representation]] is used on both ends to communicate information.
* '''Representation-bridging communication''': sensory information transferred to the receiver entity is filtered and/or adapted so that a different information representation is used on the two ends.

==Remarks==

#A sensor-sharing application of CogInfoCom brings novelty to traditional infocommunications in the sense that it can convey any kind of signal normally perceptible through the actor's senses (i.e., without a distance to communicate across) to the other end of the communication line. The transferred information may describe not only the actor involved in the communication, but also the environment in which the actor is located. The key determinant of sensor-sharing communication is that the same sensory modality is used to perceive the sensory information on the receiving end of communication as would be used if the two actors were on the same end (in which case there would be no need for infocommunication).
#Sensor bridging can in cases reflect not only the way in which the information is conveyed (i.e., by changing sensory modality), but also the kind of information that is conveyed. Whenever the transferred information type is imperceptible to the receiving actor due to the lack of an appropriate sensory modality (e.g., because its cognitive system is incompatible with the information type) the communication of information will necessarily occur through sensor bridging.
#A CogInfoCom application can be regarded as an instance of representation sharing even if it bridges between different sensors. For example, if text is conveyed to a blind person using Braille writing, the tactile sensory modality is used instead of vision, but the representation still consists of a linear succession of textual elements which represent individual characters in the alphabet. By the same token, a CogInfoCom application can be regarded as representation bridging even if it uses sensor sharing.

[[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] discovered that [[mammal]]ian [[brain]]s contained specific neural [[Cortical column|cortical columns]] which were attuned to specific spatial frequencies, specific colors, specific shapes, specific motions (up and down, left and right, inward and outward, etc.). Thus the brain could be viewed as a collection of '''tuned filters'''.

Their discovery occurred accidentally. In 1962, Hubel and Wiesel were attempting to discover that triggered neurophysiological activity in a cat's brain. The cat they were testing showed no results until they displayed a ''crack'' to the cat, whereupon the cat's brain starting reacting to the stimulus. This began a long series of discoveries which continues to the present day. Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for their discovery.

[[Primate]] [[brain]]s like our own display even more arcane forms of tuning, which are occasionally discovered by [[fMRI]] or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans of impaired patients. These range from the recognition of faces, to the recognition of emotions, to other social, cultural, linguistic skills, etc.

A '''community land trust''' ('''CLT''') is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing, community gardens, civic buildings, commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community. “CLTs” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability, economic diversity and local access to essential services.

== Historical overview ==
The community land trust (CLT) is a neutral and sustainable model of affordable housing and community development that has slowly spread throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom over the past 40 years. The model was originated in the United States by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and [[Robert Swann (land trust pioneer)|Robert Swann]], drawing upon earlier examples of planned communities on leased land including the [[Garden city movement]] in the United Kingdom, single tax communities in the US, [[Gramdan]] villages in India, and [[moshav]] communities on lands owned by the [[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel. [[New Communities]], Inc., the prototype for the modern-day community land trust, was formed in 1969 near [[Albany, Georgia]], by leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] who were seeking a new way to achieve secure access to land for [[African American farmer]]s.

== History ==
According to the [[Schumacher Center for a New Economics]] website, "Swann was inspired by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and by Borsodi's work with [[J. P. Narayan]] and [[Vinoba Bhave]], both disciples of [[Gandhi]]. Vinoba walked from village to village in rural [[India]] in the 1950s and 1960s, gathering people together and asking those with more land than they needed to give a portion of it to their poorer sisters and brothers. The initiative was known as the [[Bhoodan]] or Land gift movement, and many of India's leaders participated in these walks.

Some of the new landowners, however, became discouraged. Without tools to work the land and seeds to plant it, without an affordable [[Credit (finance)|credit system]] available to purchase these necessary things, the land was useless to them. They soon sold their deeds back to the large landowners and left for the cities. Seeing this, Vinoba altered the Boodan system to a [[Gramdan]] or Village gift system. All donated land was subsequently held by the village itself. The village would then lease the land to those capable of working it. The lease expired if the land was unused. The Gramdan movement inspired a series of regional village land trusts that anticipated Community Land Trusts in the United States.

The first organization to be labeled with the term 'community land trust' in the U.S., called [[New Communities]], Inc., was founded with the purpose of helping [[African-American]] farmers in the rural South to gain access to farmland and to work it with security.

A precursor to this was the [[Celo Community]] in North Carolina, which was founded in 1937 by [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]].&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;Hicks, George L. Experimental Americans: Celo and Utopian Community in the Twentieth Century. University of Illinois Press: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Communities ===
{{Main|New Communities}}

Robert Swann worked with [[Slater King]], president of the [[Albany Movement]] and a cousin of [[Martin Luther King]], Jr., [[Charles Sherrod]], an organizer for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], his wife [[Shirley Sherrod]], and individuals from other southern civil rights organizations in the South to develop [[New Communities]], Inc., "a nonprofit organization to hold land in perpetual trust for the permanent use of rural communities".

Their vision for New Communities Inc. drew heavily on the example and experience of the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF) in making land available through 99-year ground leases for the development of planned communities and agricultural cooperatives.  The JNF was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in [[Ottoman Palestine]] (later Israel) for Jewish settlement.  By 2007, the JNF owned 13% of all the land in Israel.  It has a long and established legal history of leasing land to individuals, to [[cooperative]]s, and to [[intentional communities]] such as [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im. Swann, Slater King, Charles Sherrod, Faye Bennett, director of the National Sharecroppers Fund, and four other Southerners travelled to Israel in 1968 to learn more about ground leasing. They decided on a model that included individual leaseholds for [[homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] and [[cooperative]] leases for farmland. New Communities Inc. purchased a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near [[Albany, Georgia]] in 1970, developed a plan for the land, and farmed it for 20 years. The land was eventually lost as a result of [[Pigford v. Glickman|USDA]] racial discrimination, but the example of New Communities inspired the formation of a dozen other rural community land trusts in the 1970s. It also inspired and informed the first book about community land trusts, produced by the International Independence Institute in 1972.

Ralph Borsodi, Robert Swann, and Erick Hansch founded the International Independence Institute in 1967 to provide training and technical assistance for rural development in the United States and other countries, drawing on the model of the Gramdan villages being developed in India. In 1972, Swann, Hansch, Shimon Gottschalk, and Ted Webster proposed a "new model for land tenure in America" in ''The Community Land Trust'', the first book to name and describe this new approach to the ownership of land, housing, and other buildings. One year later, they changed the name of the International Independence Institute to the Institute for Community Economics (ICE).

In the 1980s, ICE began popularizing a new notion of the CLT, applying the model for the first time to problems of affordable housing, gentrification, displacement, and neighborhood revitalization in urban areas. From 1980–1990, [[Chuck Matthei]], an activist with roots in the [[Catholic Worker movement]] and the [[peace movement]], served as Executive Director of ICE, then based in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], MA and now an affiliate of the National Housing Trust and located in [[Washington, DC]]. ICE pioneered the modern community land trust and community loan fund models. During Matthei's tenure, the number of community land trusts increased from a dozen to more than 100 groups in 23 states, creating many hundreds of permanently affordable housing units, as well as commercial and public service facilities. With colleagues Matthei guided the development of 25 regional loan funds and organized the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, later known as the National Community Capital Association. From 1985–1990, Matthei served as a founding Chairman of the Association and from 1983–1988 he served as a founding board member of the [http://www.socialinvest.org/ Social Investment Forum], the national professional association in the field of socially responsible investment. Matthei also launched an effort in the early to mid-1980s to address many of the legal and operational questions about CLTs that were arising as banks, public officials and1 by an ecumenical association of churches and ministries created to prevent the displacement of low-income, African-American residents from their neighborhood. During the 1980s, the number of urban CLTs increased dramatically. They were sometimes formed, as in Cincinnati, in opposition to the plans and politics of municipal government. In other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Syracuse, New York, community land trusts were formed in partnership with a local government. One of the most significant city-CLT partnerships was formed in 1989 when a CLT subsidiary of the Dudley Neighborhood Initiative was granted the power of eminent domain by the City of Boston. others encountered the growing effort to create such community-based organizations around the country.

The first urban CLT, the Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati, was founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati (CLCC) |url=https://community-wealth.org/content/community-land-cooperative-cincinnati-clcc|access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 250 community land trusts in the United States. In 2006, a national association was established in the United States to provide assistance and support for CLTs: the National Community Land Trust Network. Also established that year to serve as the Network’s training and research arm was the National CLT Academy. Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in England, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Kenya and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111127232235/http://www.communitylandtrusts.co.nz/ New Zealand]. Similar nationwide networks for promoting and supporting CLTs have recently been formed in the United Kingdom and in Australia.

[[File:Community Land Trusts.png|thumbnail|right|The basic mechanisms of community land trusts]]

== Defining features in the United States ==
Since 1992, the defining features of the CLT model in the United States have been enshrined in federal law ([[s:Housing and Community Development Act of 1992/Title II#Sec. 213. Housing Education and Organizational Support for Community Land Trusts.|Section 213, Housing and Community Development Act of 1992]]). There is considerable variation among the hundreds of organizations that call themselves a community land trust, but ten key features are to be found in most of them.

=== Nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation ===
A community land trust is an independent, nonprofit corporation that is legally chartered in the state in which it is located. Most CLTs are started from scratch, but some are grafted onto existing nonprofit corporations such as community development corporations. Most CLTs target their activities and resources toward charitable activities like providing housing for low-income people and redeveloping blighted neighborhoods, making them eligible to receive [[501(c)(3)]] designation from the IRS.

=== Dual ownership ===
A nonprofit corporation, the CLT, acquires multiple parcels of land throughout a targeted geographic area with the intention of retaining ownership of the parcels forever. Any building already located on the land or later constructed on the land can be held by the CLT or sold off to an individual homeowner, a [[Housing cooperative|cooperative housing corporation]], a nonprofit developer of rental housing, or some other nonprofit, governmental, or for-profit entity.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|title= Affordable Housing, Always|first= Alana |last= Semuels|work= [[The Atlantic]]|date= July 7, 2015| url= http://www.routefifty.com/2015/07/collective-land-ownership-cities/117061/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leased land ===
Although CLTs intend never to resell their land, they can provide for the exclusive use of their land by the owners of any buildings located thereon. Exclusive use of parcels of land can be conveyed to individual homeowners or to the owners of other types of residential or commercial structures by long-term ground leases. The two-party contract between the landowner (the CLT) and a building's owner protects the owner's interests in security, privacy, legacy, and equity and enforces the CLT's interests in preserving the appropriate use, the structural integrity and the continuing affordability of any buildings on its land.

=== Perpetual affordability ===
The CLT retains an option to repurchase any residential (or commercial) structures on its land if their owners ever choose to sell. The resale price is set by a formula contained in the ground lease that is designed to give present homeowners a fair return on their investment but giving future homebuyers fair access to housing at an affordable price. By design and by intent, the CLT is committed to preserving the affordability of housing (and other structures), one owner after another, one generation after another, in perpetuity.

=== Perpetual responsibility ===
The CLT does not disappear once a building is sold. As owner of the underlying land and as owner of an option to repurchase any buildings located on its land, the CLT has an abiding interest in what happens to the structures and to the people who occupy them. The ground lease requires owner-occupancy and responsible use of the premises. Should buildings become a hazard, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and force repairs. Should property owners default on their mortgages, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and cure the default, forestalling foreclosure. The CLT remains a party to the deal, safeguarding the structural integrity of the buildings and the residential security of the occupants.

=== Community base ===
The CLT operates within the physical boundaries of a targeted locality. It is guided by and accountable to the people who call the locale their home. Most commonly, any adult who resides on the CLT’s land and any adult who resides within the area deemed by the CLT to be its community can become a voting member of the CLT. The community may encompass a single neighborhood, multiple neighborhoods, or, in some cases, an entire town, city, or county.

=== Governance ===
Typically, CLTs are run by a [[board of directors]] whose members include three groups of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s: residents or leaseholders, people who reside within its targeted community but do not live on its land, and lastly the broader public interest. This third group is frequently represented by government officials, funders, housing agencies, and social service providers. Organization [[bylaws]] may designate each of these groups a specific and equal number of seats, and they may be elected separately by their constituent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-29/community-land-trust-models-housing-coops-around-world/ |quote=Like many other CLTs, the CHT has a governing board divided in thirds and elected by residents: one-third of its membership is constituted by CHT residents; another third from surrounding communities; and the final third is {{sic|comprised |hide=y}} of municipal officials and a regional representative who are presumed to speak for the public interest (in other CLTs this final third is often {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} technical specialists like engineers, accountants, planners, architects, social workers or lawyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=25330 |quote=CLT trusts are usually divided into thirds, where one third of the trust leadership is residents from the CLT community, one third is people from the neighborhood surrounding the CLT, and one third is made up of technical experts and municipal officials who provide particular expertise (legal, architectural, engineering, political, etc.) and speak in the general public interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prosper.org.au/2008/05/29/community-land-trusts-explained/ |quote=those representing resident members, those representing members who are not CLT residents, and those representing the broader community interest here members includes neighbors who are interested, supportive, or may become residents}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cltnetwork.org/faq/ |quote=CLTs are nonprofit organizations—governed by a board of CLT residents, community residents and public representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saratogacommunityhousing.org/what-is-a-community-land-trust/ |quote=residents of trust owned lands, other community members and public-interest representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Control of the CLT’s board is diffused and balanced to ensure that all interests are heard but that no interest predominates.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

=== Expansionist acquisition ===
CLTs are not focused on a single project located on a single parcel of land. They are committed to an active acquisition and development program aimed at expanding the CLT's holdings of land and increasing the supply of affordable housing (and other types of buildings) under the CLT's stewardship. A CLT's holdings are seldom concentrated in one corner of a community but tend to be scattered throughout its service area, indistinguishable from other owner-occupied housing in the same neighborhood.

== Flexible development ==
There is enormous variability in the types of projects that CLTs pursue and in the roles they play in developing them. Many CLTs do development with their own staff. Others delegate development to nonprofit or for-profit partners, confining their own efforts to assembling land and preserving the affordability of any structures located upon it. Some CLTs focus on a single type and tenure of housing, like detached, owner-occupied houses. Others take full advantage of the model’s unique flexibility. They develop housing of many types and tenures or they focus more broadly on comprehensive community development, undertaking a diverse array of residential and commercial projects. CLTs around the country have constructed (or acquired, rehabilitated, and resold) single-family homes, duplexes, condos, co-ops, SROs, multi-unit apartment buildings, and mobile home parks. CLTs have created facilities for neighborhood businesses, nonprofit organizations, and social service agencies. CLTs have provided sites for community gardens. vest-pocket parks, and affordable working land for entry-level agriculturalists. Permanently affordable access to land is the common ingredient, linking them all. The CLT is the social thread, connecting them all.

== Development elsewhere ==
Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3499">In [[statistical mechanics]], '''configuration entropy''' is the portion of a system's [[entropy]] that is related to the position of its constituent particles rather than to their [[velocity]] or [[momentum]].  It is physically related to the number of ways of arranging all the [[particle]]s of the system while maintaining some overall set of specified system properties, such as [[energy]].

It can be shown&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{ cite book
 | last = Young | first = Hugh
 |author2=Roger Freedman
 | year = 2008
 | title = University Physics
 | edition = 12th
 | publisher = Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the variation of configuration entropy of [[thermodynamic systems]] (e.g., ideal gas, and other systems with a vast number of internal degrees of freedom) in [[thermodynamic process]]es is equivalent to the variation of the ''macroscopic entropy'' defined as ''dS = δQ/T'', where ''δQ'' is the [[heat]] exchanged between the system and the surrounding media, and ''T'' is temperature. Therefore, a change in configuration entropy corresponds to the same change in macroscopic entropy.

== Calculation ==
The configurational entropy in the [[microcanonical ensemble]] is related to the number of possible configurations W at a given energy E by [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;S = k_B \, \ln W,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''W'' is the number of possible configurations. In a more general formulation, if a system can be in states ''n'' with probabilities ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the configurational entropy of the system is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S = - k_B \, \sum_{n=1}^W P_n \ln P_n, &lt;/math&gt; 
which in the perfect disorder limit (all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W'') leads to Boltzmann's formula, while in the opposite limit (one configuration with probability 1), the entropy vanishes. This formulation is called the [[Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula|Gibbs entropy formula]] and is analogous to that of [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon's information entropy]].

The mathematical field of [[combinatorics]], and in particular the [[mathematics]] of [[combination]]s and [[permutation]]s is highly important in the calculation of configurational entropy.  In particular, this field of mathematics offers formalized approaches for calculating the number of ways of choosing or arranging discrete objects; in this case, [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s.  However, it is important to note that the positions of molecules are not strictly speaking ''discrete'' above the quantum level.  Thus a variety of approximations may be used in discretizing a system to allow for a purely combinatorial approach.  Alternatively, integral methods may be used in some cases to work directly with continuous position functions.

A second approach (most often in computer simulations, but also analytically) is to determine the change in configurational entropy using the [[Widom insertion method]].

The '''cosmic neutrino background''' ('''CNB''', '''CνB'''{{ref|nu}}) is the universe's background particle radiation composed of [[neutrino]]s. They are sometimes known as '''relic neutrinos'''.

The CνB is a relic of the [[big bang]]; while the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) dates from when the universe was 379,000 years old, the [[Neutrino decoupling|CνB decoupled]] (separated) from matter when the universe was just one second old. It is estimated that today, the CνB has a temperature of roughly {{val|1.95|ul=K}}.

As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today. They have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[electron volt|eV]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], and the CνB has energies around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller, so the CνB may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CνB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the CνB exists.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

==Derivation of the CνB temperature==
Given the temperature of the CMB, the temperature of the CνB can be estimated. Before [[neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decoupled]] from the rest of matter, the universe primarily consisted of neutrinos, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[photon]]s, all in [[thermal equilibrium]] with each other. Once the temperature dropped to approximately {{val|2.5|ul=MeV}}, the neutrinos decoupled from the rest of matter. Despite this decoupling, neutrinos and photons remained at the same temperature as the universe expanded. However, when the temperature dropped below the mass of the electron, most [[electron-positron annihilation|electrons and positrons annihilated]], transferring their heat and entropy to photons, and thus increasing the temperature of the photons. So the ratio of the temperature of the photons before and after the electron-positron annihilation is the same as the ratio of the temperature of the neutrinos and the photons today. To find this ratio, we assume that the entropy of the universe was approximately conserved by the electron-positron annihilation. Then using

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \propto gT^3&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''''σ''''' is the entropy, '''''g''''' is the effective [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and '''''T''''' is the temperature, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{g_0}{g_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{T_1}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' denotes the temperature before the electron-positron annihilation and '''''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''''' denotes after. The factor '''''g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is determined by the particle species:

*2 for photons, since they are massless [[bosons]]&lt;ref name=Weinberg_Cosmology&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48C-ym2EmZkC&amp;pg=PA3 |author=Steven Weinberg |title=Cosmology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=151 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-852682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2×(7/8) each for electrons and positrons, since they are [[fermions]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg_Cosmology /&gt;

'''''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is just 2 for photons. So

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_\nu}{T_\gamma} = \left(\frac{2}{2 + 2 \times 7/8 + 2 \times 7/8}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given the current value of '''''T&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = {{val|2.725|u=K}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dale|last=Fixsen|author2=Mather, John|title=The Spectral Results of the Far-Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer Instrument on COBE|year=2002|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=581|issue=2|pages=817–822|bibcode=2002ApJ...581..817F|doi=10.1086/344402}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that '''''T&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' ≈ {{val|1.95|u=K}}.

The above discussion is valid for massless neutrinos, which are always relativistic. For neutrinos with a non-zero rest mass, the description in terms of a temperature is no longer appropriate after they become non-relativistic; i.e., when their thermal energy 3/2 '''''kT&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' falls below the rest mass energy '''''m&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''. Instead, in this case one should rather track their energy density, which remains well-defined.

== Indirect evidence for the CνB ==
Relativistic neutrinos contribute to the radiation energy density of the universe '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''''', typically parameterized in terms of the effective number of neutrino species '''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''':
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{\rm R} = \frac{\pi^2}{15} \, T_\gamma^4 (1+z)^4 \left[ 1 + \frac{7}{8} N_{\rm \nu} \left( \frac{4}{11} \right)^{4/3} \right],&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''z''''' denotes the [[redshift]]. The first term in the square brackets is due to the CMB, the second comes from the CνB. The [[Standard Model]] with its three neutrino species predicts a value of 
'''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' ≃ {{val|3.046}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gianpiero | last = Mangano | title =  Relic neutrino decoupling including flavor oscillations | year = 2005  | journal = Nucl.

The radiation density had a major impact on various physical processes in the early universe, leaving potentially detectable imprints on measurable quantities, thus allowing us to [[inference|infer]] the value of '''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' from observations.

=== Big Bang nucleosynthesis ===
Due to its effect on the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion rate]] of the universe during [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] (BBN), the theoretical expectations for the primordial abundances of light elements depend on '''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'''''. Astrophysical measurements of the primordial {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|link=yes}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|Deuterium|link=yes}} abundances lead to a value of '''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = {{val|3.14|+0.70|-0.65}} at 68% [[confidence interval|c.l.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Cyburt | title =  New BBN limits on physics beyond the standard model from He-4 | year = 2005  | journal = Astropart.

=== CMB anisotropies and structure formation ===
The presence of the CνB affects the evolution of CMB anisotropies as well as the growth of matter perturbations in two ways: due to its contribution to the radiation density of the universe (which determines for instance the time of matter-radiation equality), and due to the neutrinos' anisotropic stress which dampens the acoustic oscillations of the spectra. Additionally, [[free-streaming]] massive neutrinos suppress the growth of structure on small scales. The [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] spacecraft's five-year data combined with type Ia [[supernova]] data and information about the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] scale yielded '''''N&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = {{val|4.34|+0.88|-0.86}} at 68% c.l.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Eiichiro | last = Komatsu | title =  Seven-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Cosmological Interpretation | year = 2010 | arxiv = 1001.4538|bibcode = 2011ApJS..192...18K |doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/192/2/18 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume = 192 | issue = 2 | pages = 18 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing an independent confirmation of the BBN constraints.

===Indirect evidence from phase changes to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)===

Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CνB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillation]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] - ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301 First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background] -
Follin, Knox, Millea, Pan, pub. 
Phys. Rev. Lett. 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

==Prospects for the direct detection of the CνB==
Confirmation of the existence of these relic neutrinos may only be possible by directly detecting them using experiments on Earth. This will be difficult as the neutrinos which make up the CνB are non-relativistic, in addition to interacting only weakly with normal matter, and so any effect they have in a detector will be hard to identify. One proposed method of direct detection of the CνB is to use capture of cosmic relic neutrinos on [[tritium]] i.e. &lt;math&gt;^3\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to an induced form of [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=A.J.|last2=Lunardini|first2=C.|last3=Sabancilar|first3=E.|title=Detecting non-relativistic cosmic neutrinos by capture on tritium: phenomenology and physics potential|journal=JCAP|date=2014|volume=1408|issue=8|page=038|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/038|arxiv=1405.7654|bibcode=2014JCAP...08..038L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neutrinos of the CνB would lead to the production of electrons via the reaction &lt;math&gt; \nu + ^3\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^3\mathrm{He} + e^{-} &lt;/math&gt;, while the main background comes from electrons produced via natural beta decay &lt;math&gt; ^3\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^3\mathrm{He} + e^{-} + \bar{\nu} &lt;/math&gt;. These electrons would be detected by the experimental apparatus in order to measure the size of the CνB. The latter source of electrons is far more numerous, however their maximum energy is smaller than the average energy of the CνB-electrons by twice the average neutrino mass. Since this mass is tiny, of the order of a few [[Electronvolt|eV]]s or less, such a detector must have an excellent energy resolution in order to separate the signal from the background. One such proposed experiment is called PTOLEMY, which will be made up of 100g of tritium target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1307.4738|last1= Betts|first1= S. |display-authors=etal|title= Development of a Relic Neutrino Detection Experiment at PTOLEMY: Princeton Tritium Observatory for Light, Early-Universe, Massive-Neutrino Yield|class= astro-ph.IM|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016 PTOLEMY prototype is being built.&lt;ref&gt;Cocco, Alfredo G.

An '''epitome''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|əm|iː}}; {{lang-gr|ἐπιτομή}}, from ἐπιτέμνειν ''epitemnein'' meaning "to cut short") is a summary or miniature form, or an instance that represents a larger reality, also used as a [[synonym]] for embodiments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Epitomacy represents, "to the degree of." An [[abridgment]] differs from an epitome in that an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed, as opposed to the epitome, which is an original summation of a work, at least in part.

Many documents from the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds survive now only "in epitome", referring to the practice of some later authors (epitomators) who wrote distilled versions of larger works now lost. Some writers attempted to convey the stance and spirit of the original, while others added further details or anecdotes regarding the general subject. As with all secondary historical sources, a different [[bias]] not present in the original may creep in.

Documents surviving in epitome differ from those surviving only as fragments quoted in later works and those used as unacknowledged sources by later scholars, as they can stand as discrete documents but refracted through the views of another author.

Epitomes of a kind are still produced today when dealing with a corpus of literature, especially classical works often considered dense and unwieldy and unlikely to be read by the average person, to make them more accessible: some are more along the lines of abridgments, such as many which have been written of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon's]] ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', a work of eight large volumes (some 3600 pages), often published as one volume of about 1400 pages

Some are of the same type as the ancient epitome, such as various epitomes of the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' of [[St Thomas Aquinas]], originally written as an introductory textbook in theology, and now accessible to very few except for the learned in [[theology]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]], such as ''A Summa of the Summa'' and ''A Shorter Summa''. Many epitomes today are published under the general title, "The Companion to...", such as ''The Oxford Companion to Aristotle'' or "An Overview of" or "guides", such as ''An Overview of the Thought of [[Immanuel Kant]]'', ''How to Read [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]'', or, in some cases, as an introduction, in the cases of ''An Introduction to [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'' or ''A [[Very Short Introduction]] to the [[New Testament]]'' (many philosophical "introductions" and "guides" share the epitomic form, unlike general "introductions" to a field).

==Examples of epitomes for lost works==
* [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]] epitomes of [[Manetho]]'s ''[[Manetho#Aegyptiaca|Aegyptiaca]]''
* [[John Xiphilinus]]'s precis of the missing portions of [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History''
* [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]'s abridged version of the ''Philippic History'' by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]], one of the main sources for the life of [[Alexander the Great]]

A '''hapaxanth''' is a [[plant]] species whose individuals [[flower]] only once in their lifetimes and die subsequently. Other terms with the same meaning are ''[[Reproduction#Other types of reproductive strategies|semelparous]]'' and ''[[monocarpic]]''. The term was first used by [[Alexander Braun]].

This term is used for plants that only have one flowering event and then die. It is used most often in conjunction with describing some of the [[taxa]] of [[Arecaceae]] (palms) and some species of [[bamboo]], but rarely used otherwise. Many [[annual plant|annuals]] flower over a period of time and can have flowers and seeds on the same plant at the same time, thus they are not hapaxanthic, because flowering does not lead to death. A related term is [[pleonanth]]ic, again used with Arecaceae (palms) and some bamboos for stems that flower more than once. Its antonym is often given as ''[[pollakanth]]'', although ''pleonanth'' is also seen.

'''Historicism''' or also '''historism''' ({{lang-de|Historismus}}) comprises artistic styles that draw their inspiration from recreating historic styles or imitating the work of historic artisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward]]. ''The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1988, p. 100. {{ISBN|0-500-20222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as [[revival architecture]]. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus it offers a great variety of possible designs.

In the [[history of art]], after [[Neoclassicism]] which in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked by an interpretation not only of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[classicism]], but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of [[history painting]], in which historical subjects were treated of with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the end of the century, in the ''[[fin de siècle]]'', [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]] followed by [[Expressionism (architecture)|Expressionism]] and [[Modernism]] acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles.

Influences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries. When [[postmodern architecture]] became widely popular in the 1980s, a movement of [[Neo-Historism]] followed, that is still prominent and can be found around the world, especially in [[Representation (arts)|representative]] and upper-class buildings.

Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
When a school district fails its legal obligations to students with disabilities, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] permits the parent to seek a hearing before an impartial hearing officer.  A school district may also request a due process hearing against parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html/ Schaffer v Weast], Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005) (Justice O’Connor, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hearings are rare.  Only 5 in 10,000 students seek a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03897.pdf/ GAO 03-0897], United States Government Accountability Office.  “GAO Report 03-897,” September 2003.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Expert witnesses have a critical role at due process hearings.  They provide the technical expertise about the student’s disability and the care and educational services the student needs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 

In 1986, Congress passed the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, allowing parents who prevail in due process hearings and litigation under the IDEA to recover their legal fees and costs.  The language was modeled on similar provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5k).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94-970.pdf/ CRS Report 2008], Henry Cohen.  “Awards of Attorneys' Fees by Federal Courts and Federal Agencies” (Congressional Research Service), June 20, 2008.  Retrieved 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress’ Joint Conference Committee Report explained that the courts would have discretion to award attorneys’ fees as part of the costs of litigation.  It noted that “The conferees intend that the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref&gt;132 Congressional Record 16823-25 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute also directed the GAO to study the costs to parents, including costs of “attorneys and
consultants” in IDEA proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZD.html/ Murphy J. Souter Opinion] Arlington Central School District v.

Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, however, the Supreme Court decided the case of [[Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy]].  The Court ruled that because the statutory text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that expert witness fees were covered, parents could not recover them.  The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees.  This meant Congress had to declare in the body of the statute that parents could recover expert witness fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZO.html/ Murphy Majority Opinion] Arlington Central School District v.

Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of expert witness fees.

The IDEA permits parents who prevail in IDEA cases to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html/ 20 USC 1415] 20 United States Code 1415(i)(3)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will enable them to also recover the reasonable costs of expert witnesses.  It will amend Section 615(i)(3) of the IDEA by adding the following at the end, “Inclusion of expert witness fees and other expenses as attorneys' fees. In this paragraph, the term ‘attorneys' fees’ shall include the fees of expert witnesses, including the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Parents cannot recover fees if they do not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=E2419&amp;dbname=2007_record/ Cong Rec 2007], Congressman Chris Van Hollen.  “Introduction of the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act,” Congressional Record, November 14, 2007.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on introduction==
When Senator Harkin introduced the bill, he explained the reasons for enactment. He said, “This critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they pursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment...There are . . .times when schools have not fulfilled their responsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through mediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need access to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and testify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert witnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without access to them, families may be unable to make their case. ”&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=S1834&amp;dbname=2011_record/ Cong Rec 2011]  Senator Tom Harkin,   Congressional Record, March 17, 2011.

Institutional Learning and Change (ILAC) was an Initiative of the [[CGIAR]] created in 2003 and discontinued in 2015.
The Initiative was hosted by the CGIAR Center Bioversity International, in Rome, Italy.

The Initiative was funded by a series of Funders, such as Rockefeller Foundation, Germany (GIZ), Netherlands (DGIS), and later by IFAD.

Initially the Initiative focused on impact evaluation theories and practices, supporting CGIAR practitioners on experimenting with alternative methodologies, besides advocating for changes in impact studies methodologies. Later in 2010 the Initiative shifted its focus to work more towards monitoring for learning and adaptive management.

The main output of the Initiative was a study on CGIAR activities and partnerships, through analyzing interactions of researchers and non-researchers of the CGIAR with their partners.

'''Integrative communication theory''' is a theory of cross-cultural adaptation proposed by [[Young Yun Kim]]. The first widely published version of Kim's theory is found in the last three chapters of a textbook authored by William Gudykunst with Young Yun Kim as second author.  See [[acculturation]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].  

==Background of integrative communication theory==
'''Young Yun Kim's''' assimilation Theory of Cross-Cultural Adaptation maintains that human transformation takes only one path, assimilative.  Kim argues that all human beings experience conformity as they move into a new and culturally unfamiliar environment and that they do so by "unlearning" who they were originally. The concept, cross-cultural adaptation, refers to a process in and through which an individual achieves an increasing level of psychological and functional fitness with respect to the receiving environment. Kim's theory postulates a zero-sum process whereby assimilation or "adaptation" occurs only to the extent that the newcomer lose the characteristics of their original cultural identity, such as language, customs, beliefs and values.  

Kim's theory however is self-contradictory for on one hand Kim argues that the newcomer "evolves" toward becoming exactly like the host majority by internalizing the majority's ways of thinking, feeling and behaving while unlearning their own.  But on the other hand Kim argues that out of this transformation emerges an ''intercultural identity,'' that somehow exists beyond all the contingencies of culture and language itself.  Kim claims that individuals that enter a new culture for varying lengths of time, and to include migrant workers, diplomats, and expatriates alike &lt;ref name="kim1988"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1988). Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation: An Integrative Theory. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters. It is important to note that this book is a trade paperback that has been out-of-print since 1988, that it is not an academic work and it is very difficult to find through interlibrary loan or anywhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim2001"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2001). Becoming Intercultural: An Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim2005"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2005). Adapting to a New Culture. In Gudykunst, W (Ed.), Theorizing about intercultural communication. [[Thousand Oaks, California]]: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigative efforts===
Kim's research into cross-cultural adaptation began in the 1970s through a survey of Korean immigrants in the Chicago area.  It subsequently expanded to study other immigrant and refugee groups in the United States to include American Indians, Japanese and Mexican Americans, and Southeast Asian refugees.  In addition to studying groups of immigrants, Young Yun Kim researched groups of students studying abroad in the United States, as well as international students in Japan, Korean expatriates in the United States and American expatriates in South Korea. The first outline of her theory was found in an article titled, "Toward an Interactive Theory of Communication - Acculturation",&lt;ref name="kim1979"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1979). Toward an interactive theory of communication-acculturation. In B. Ruben (Ed.), Communication Yearbook 3, 435-453.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a complete rendition of the theory in ''Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation:  An Integrative Theory'',&lt;ref name="kim1988"/&gt; which was further refined and updated with ''Becoming Intercultural:  An Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation''.&lt;ref name="kim2001"/&gt;

Kim states that there are five key "missing links" in [[cross-cultural]] adaptation literature, which her theory attempts to cover:{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

# Lack of attention to macro-level factors, such as the cultural and institutional patterns of the host environment
# Need to integrate the traditionally separate areas of investigation of long-term and short-term adaptation
# Cross cultural adaptation must be viewed in the context of new learning and psychological growth to provide a more balanced and complete interpretation of the experiences of individuals in an unfamiliar environment
# Efforts must be made to sort and consolidate the factors constituting and/or explaining the cross-cultural adaptation process of individuals
# Divergent ideological premises of assimilationalism and pluralism need to be recognized and incorporated into a pragmatic conception of cross-cultural adaptation as a condition of the host environment as well as of the individual adapting to that environment.

===Organizing principles===
*Adaptation as a Natural and Universal Phenomenon
**The theory of integrative communication rests on the human instinct to struggle for equilibrium when met with adversarial environmental conditions as experienced in a new culture.  This experience is not limited to any one region, cultural group, or nation, but is a universal concept of the basic human tendencies that accompany the struggle on each individual when they are faced with a new and challenging environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Adaptation as an All-Encompassing Phenomenon
**Before efforts at racial and cultural integration in the United States, the main thrust was assimilation.  The stress was on the ideology of the "model minority" which states that the only standard for "appropriate," "effective," and "competent" thinking (cognition), feeling (affect), and behavior (functional fit) was a presumed majority mainstream culture.  The immigrant newcomer was compelled to internalize mainstream ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving or be marginalized.  Beginning even before World War II and certainly after, efforts at racial and ethnic integration grew dramatically and the model minority ideology became untenable (Kramer, 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Kramer, E. (Ed.) (2003). ''The Emerging Monoculture: Assimilation and the "Model Minority"''. Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt;).  But even into the twenty-first century we see remnants of it.  An example is Young Yun Kim's cross-cultural adaptation theory.  Borrowing extensively from Gordon and Park's work, especially Milton Gordon's 1954 book ''Assimilation in American Life'' where he outlines seven stages in the assimilative process, Kim presents a reiteration of the 1950s era notion in her theory of cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process.  The theory focuses on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional personal environment interdependence.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  This view takes into account micro-psychological and macro-social factors into a theoretical fusion "vertical integration" of theory.  While cross-cultural adaptation theory itself is a fusion of previous ideas, it is not about racial or ethnic integration but instead assimilation.  And as such it is unlike the works of Bateson, Ruesch and Bateson, Watzlawick Beavin, and Jackson, and Buss and Kenrick&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Kim's approach is unilinear.  The sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be "communicatively competent."  Gudykunst and Kim (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; equate integration, adaptation and assimilation writing, "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable" (p.&amp;nbsp;360).  In biological science adaptation means the random mutation of new forms of life, not convergence on a single form or monoculture (Kramer, 2003).  The term adaptation is used by Gudykunst and Kim to mean simple conformity to the coercive power (pp.&amp;nbsp;360,371) of what they call a single form of "mainstream culture" with its "objective" "external" reality (p.&amp;nbsp;378) -- "what is real, what is true, what is right, what is beautiful, and what is good" (p.&amp;nbsp;376).  As they define reality, the newcomer's perspective is false, a delusion or "self-deception" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) and any attempt to maintain one's original false values, beliefs, ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitute the mental illness of "maladaptation" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the way of "upward-forward" (p.&amp;nbsp;382) evolution toward functional fitness and psychological health is for the newcomer to willfully "unlearn" and "deculturize" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) herself.  They propose psychotherapy as well as the abandonment of all ethnic relations and associations with ethnic ties as well as avoidance of "ethnic media" use (pp.&amp;nbsp;365–368) to help immigrants (p.&amp;nbsp;382) achieve "integrative" conformity.  This is not ecological integration but simple disintegration of the newcomer until their identity is erased.  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the more the newcomer is disintegrated the better, even if it leads to extreme distress for the immigrant.  As Gudykunst and Kim (2003) put it, "Even extreme mental illness [caused by "conformity pressure" p.&amp;nbsp;371] can be viewed as a process of a potentially positive disintegration that will be reintegrated with new material at a higher level" (p.&amp;nbsp;381).  No matter how unjust or cruel, Gudykunst and Kim (2003) argue that the host way of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitutes the "higher level" of psychic evolution and any resistance to pressure to conform, to disintegration on the part of a minority person indicates that the immigrant is communicatively incompetent, immature (p.&amp;nbsp;381), mentally ill (pp.&amp;nbsp;365, 372-373, 376), weak (p.&amp;nbsp;369), irrationally aggressive or hostile (pp.&amp;nbsp;371, 376), lacking in self-control (p.&amp;nbsp;369), cynical (p.&amp;nbsp;380), pessimistic (p.&amp;nbsp;369), closed-minded (p.&amp;nbsp;369), simple minded (pp.&amp;nbsp;382–383) and "ethnocentric" (pp.&amp;nbsp;376, 382).  Evolutionary progress for the individual requires the individual to "abandon identification with the cultural patterns that have constituted who one is and what one is" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).  These patterns are not just behavioral but "appropriate" ways of thinking as defined by the majority mainstream reality.

Grace (Ed.), ''Comparative Cultures and Civilizations (Vol. 3)''. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton.&lt;/ref&gt;) maintains clear conceptual separation between assimilation, adaptation, and integration. Only assimilation involves conformity to a pre-existing form. Kramer's (2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2003, 2009, 2011) theory of Cultural Fusion, which is based on systems theory and hermeneutics, argues that first it is impossible for a person to unlearn themselves and second that "growth" is, by definition, not a zero sum process that requires the disillusion of one form for another to come into being but rather a process of learning new languages and cultural repertoires (ways of thinking, cooking, playing, working worshipping, and so forth).  One need not unlearn a language in order to learn a new one.  Nor does one have to unlearn who one is in order to learn new ways of dancing, cooking, talking and so forth.  Cognitive complexity involves the ability to code switch between repertoires, not a zero growth, zero-sum process as Gudykunst and Kim claim (2003, p 383).  Learning is growth, not unlearning.
*Adaptation as a Communication-Based Phenomenon
**A person begins to adapt only as they communicate with others in their new environment.  Integration relies on that interaction with the host society and the degree to which an individual adapts depends on the amount and nature of communication with members of the host society.
*Theory as a System of Description and Explanation
**The present theory is designed to identify the patterns that are commonly present within a clearly defined set of individual cases and to translate these patterns into a set of generalized and interrelated statements.  The fact that humans will adapt in a new environment was not questioned, but rather how and why individuals adapt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*Theorizing at the Interface of Deduction and Induction
**Kim's research has switched between deductive and inductive processes – between the conceptual realm of logical development of ideas from a set of basic assumptions about human adaptation and empirical substantiation of the ideas based on proofs available in social science literature.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  In her research, Kim introduced anecdotal stories and testimonials of immigrants and sojourners available in non-technical sources such as reports, biographies, letters, diaries, dialogues, commentaries, and other materials in magazines, newspapers, fiction and nonfiction books, radio programs, and televisions programs.   These individual accounts are not scientific data, but rather serve as a vital source of insights into the "lived experiences" of cross cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Focal Concepts and Boundary Conditions
**Kim employs two central terms in Integrative Communication Theory, [[adaptation]] and [[wiktionary:stranger|stranger]], in order to help define the theory.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  Stranger incorporates in it all individuals who enter and resettle in a new cultural or sub-cultural environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

==Process of cross-cultural adaptation==
All human beings are born into an unfamiliar environment and are brought up to become part of a culture.  This process is known as [[enculturation]], and refers to the organization, integration, and maintenance of a home environment throughout the formative years along with the internal change that occurs with increasing interaction of the individual in its cultural environment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Entering a new culture===
The transition into a new culture can be shocking, and internal conflicts often arise.  The individual must learn to adapt and grow into the new environment, as they are often faced with situations that challenge their cultural norms and worldview.  This is the process known as [[acculturation]] as described by Shibutani and Kwan in 1965.  According to Kim, as new learning occurs, deculturation or unlearning of some of the old cultural elements has to occur, at least in the sense that new responses are adopted in situations that previously would have evoked old ones.  The individual is forced to develop new habits, which may come in conflict with the old ones. Kim states that the ultimate theoretical directionality of adaptive change is toward [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], a state of the maximum possible convergence of strangers' internal and external conditions to those of the natives.  Assimilation is an ongoing process and is not usually fully attained, regardless of the amount of time spent in the new culture.

Integrative communication theory suggests that these varying levels of integration within a culture directly impact the individual's experience in the new culture, which other research suggests.  According to '''Don C. Locke''', one major difference among members of various cultural groups within America is the degree to which they have immersed themselves into the culture of the United States.  He states that members of culturally diverse groups can be placed into several categories.  Bicultural individuals are able to function as competently in the dominant culture as their own while holding on to manifestations of their own culture.  Traditional individuals hold on to a majority of cultural traits from the culture of origin and reject many traits of the dominant culture.  A third type of individual will acculturate and give up most cultural traits of the culture of origin and traits of the dominant culture.  Finally, a marginal individual does not fit into the culture of origin nor into the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;Locke, D (1998). Increasing Multicultural Understanding. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stress-adaptation-growth dynamic===
Kim has developed an integrative communication theory of cross-cultural adaptation which conceives adaptation as a [[dialectic]] process of the "stress-adaptation-growth" dynamic that gradually leads to greater functional fitness and psychological health with regards to the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; This portion of Kim's theory focuses on the [[Stress (biological)|stress]] that inevitably accompanies a cross-cultural move, as the individual strives to retain aspects of their old culture while also attempting to integrate into the new one.  The internal conflict that arises results in a state of disequilibrium of emotional "lows" of uncertainty confusion, and anxiety.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
People handle this change in various ways, to include avoidance, denial, and withdrawal, as well as regression into pre-existing habits in order to eliminate discomfort in the new environment. Others develop new habits and begin the process of [[adaptation]], allowing them to become better suited to their environment.  Once this occurs, a period of growth often accompanies.  The stress adaptation growth dynamic, therefore, is not a linear process but a back and forth endeavor that will entail periods of regression and subsequent progression. Assimilation can be defined as the process by which a person takes material into their mind from the environment, which may mean changing the evidence of their senses to make it fit, whereas accommodation is the difference made to one's mind or concepts by the process of assimilation.&lt;ref name="atherton"&gt;Atherton J.S. (2005) Learning and Teaching:  Piaget's developmental theory.  Retrieved May 2, 2008, from http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/piaget.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure of cross-cultural adaptation==

===Personal communication: host communication competence===
Communication is a prerequisite for successful adaptation of individuals into a new environment.  This relies on [[Code|decoding]], or the capacity of strangers to receive and process information, as well as [[encoding]], or the designing and executing mental plans in initiating or responding to messages.
There are three commonly recognized categories:
#Cognitive: Includes such internal capabilities as the knowledge of the host culture and language, history, institutions, worldviews, beliefs, norms, and rules of interpersonal conduct.
#Affective: Affective competence facilitates cross-cultural adaptation by providing a motivational capacity to deal with various challenges of living in the host environment, the openness to new learning, and the willingness to participate in emotional and physical aspects of the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
#Operational: Operational competence relates to the other aspects of host communication competence and facilitates strangers' outwardly expressing their cognitive and affective experiences.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Host social communication===
Participation in the interpersonal and [[mass communication]] activities of the host society is crucial. '''Host interpersonal communication''' helps strangers to secure vital information and insight into the mind-sets and behaviors of the local people, thereby providing strangers a reference point for their own behaviors,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} while '''host mass communication''' relies on integrating the individual into the host society via media, radio, television, etc...and serves as an important source of cultural and language learning without relying heavily on individual participation and exposure.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Ethnic social communication===
In the initial phase of integration, ethnic communities serve to allow strangers to receive some of the comforts of their previous culture, and serve to facilitate adaptation.  After the initial phase, ethnic social communication allows individuals to maintain connectedness to their original culture. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Environment===
Some cultures make it easier to assimilate than others, and the host environment has a direct impact on the nature of an individual's integration.  Some societies display more openness and warmth to outsiders than others.  The degree to which a given host environment exerts receptivity and conformity pressure on a stranger is closely influenced by the overall ethnic group strength, which is a measure of a given stranger's ethnic group's capacity to influence the surrounding host environment at large.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Predisposition===
An individual can better prepare themselves to enter a new environment, both physically and emotionally, which will have a positive effect on their ability to transition.  This takes into account the mental, emotional, and motivational readiness to deal with the new environment, including understanding of the new language and culture.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Having an open mind helps to alleviate some of the [[culture shock]] that is associated with assimilation into the new environment.

'''Isaac Dudley Fletcher''' (1844 – 1917) was a US businessman, art collector and museum benefactor.

He had the mansion built that is called today the [[Harry F. Sinclair House]]. He was president of Barrett Manufacturing Company and acquired a large art collection which he bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3253700.pdf.bannered.pdf|format=PDF|title=1918 museum bulletin describing the bequeathed collection|website=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Frick library, he owned work by "David, Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, and Rubens, Alexander H Wyant, Corot and Daubigny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7443|title=Fletcher, Isaac Dudley, 1844-1917|website=Research.frick.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "work by David" referred to the ''[[Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes (Marie-Denise Villers)|Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes]]'', which at the time of the bequest in 1917 was still attributed to Jacques-Louis David, but since 1995 has been attributed to [[Marie-Denise Villers]].

Besides the collection itself, the bequest included a large sum of money to start a fund for the purchase of art. According to the 1994 Museum guidebook, several of the paintings listed were purchased through the ''Fletcher Fund'', most notably the ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zoM2KmG_ndgC&amp;pg=PA169|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|first1=Philippe De|last1=Montebello|date=28 August 1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Religion and Film''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that "examines the description, critique, and embodiment of [[religion]] in film". The [[editor-in-chief]] is John C. Lyden ([[Grand View University]]). It was established in 1997 by William L. Blizek and [[Ronald Burke (theologian)|Ronald Burke]] ([[University of Nebraska at Omaha]]), who became interested in the subject of religion and film after hearing [[Andrew Greeley]] speak about images of God in popular movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Edit1.1.htm |title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Vol 1, No. 1 Editorial |publisher=Unomaha.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths.

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J.

TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug.

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur.

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'']] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms.

=====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''=====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]].

Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics.

{{Stone Age}}
'''Lithic technology''' includes a broad array of techniques and styles in [[archaeology]], which are used to produce usable tools from various types of stone. The earliest stone tools were recovered from modern [[Ethiopia]] and were dated to between two-million and three-million years old. The [[archaeological record]] of lithic technology is divided into three major time periods: the [[Paleolithic]] (Old Stone Age), [[Mesolithic]] (Middle Stone Age), and [[Neolithic]] (New Stone Age). Not all cultures in all parts of the world exhibit the same pattern of lithic technological development, and stone tool technology continues to be used to this day, but these three time periods represent the span of the archaeological record when lithic technology was paramount. By analysing modern stone tool usage within an ethnoarchaeological context insight into the breadth of factors influencing lithic technologies in general may be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedman|first1=Kathryn|title=An ethnoarchaeological study of hafting and stone tool diversity among the Gamo of Ethiopia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory |date=2006|pages=198–238|jstor=20177539|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[Stone tool]]. For example, for the Gamo of Southern Ethiopia, political, environmental, and social factors influence the patterns of technology variation in different subgroups of the Gamo culture; through understanding the relationship between these different factors in a modern context, archaeologists can better understand the ways that these factors could have shaped the technological variation that is present in the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedman|first1=Kathryn|title=An ethnoarchaeological study of hafting and stone tool diversity among the Gamo of Ethiopia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory |date=2006|pages=198–238|jstor=20177539|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raw materials==
Some types of raw materials are:
*[[Agate]]
*[[Basalt]]
*[[Chalcedony]]
*[[Chert]]
*[[Diorite]]
*[[Flint]]
*[[Greenstone (archaeology)|Greenstone]]
*[[Jadeite]]
*[[Jasper]]
*[[Obsidian]]
*[[Onyx]]
*[[Quartz]]
*[[Quartzite]]
*[[Sandstone]]
*[[Schist]]
*[[Silcrete]]

These raw materials all have common characteristics which make them ideal for stone tool production.  To make a stone material ideal for tool production, it must be non-crystalline or glassy, which allows for conchoidal fracturing.  These characteristics allow the person forming the stone ("flintknapper") to control the reduction precisely in order to make a wide variety of tools.

There are numerous factors as to why some raw materials would be chosen over others and can result in the use of low quality materials.  A few examples of such factors include the availability of materials, the proximity to materials, and the quality of materials.  To help understand this, archaeologists have applied models of risk management to stone artifacts.  Theories have suggested that in times of high risk, more effort will be put into acquiring high quality material that is more reliable and can be maintained over longer periods of time.  In times of low risk, lower quality materials may be acquired from  closer sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrence|first1=Robin|title=Time, Energy, and Stone Tools|date=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Mackay and Marwick (2011) found that this pattern does not always hold true in their application of this theory to the South African Pleistocene record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Alex|last2=Marwick|first2=Ben|title=Keeping your Edge: Recent Approaches to the Organisation of Stone Artefact Technology|date=2011|chapter=Costs and benefits in technological decision making under variable conditions: examples from the late Pleistocene in southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They then used computer simulations to understand why the relationship between the time put into producing technology and subsistence acquisition would produce the patterns they saw.  Mackay and Marwick found that when less time was put into acquiring material for and producing technology, that extra time increased the chances of encounters and thus increases the chances of acquiring more resources in a shorter period of time. This demonstrates that raw material choice is not always straightforward, nor are high quality materials always sought out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=Understanding quartz technology in early prehistoric Ireland|date=2010|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/phd_quartz_lithic_technology_chap_4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==  
Stone tools are manufactured using a process known as [[lithic reduction]].  The technique used is dependent upon the level of detail required for the desired tool. The technique with the least detail is conducted using a [[hammerstone]], in which a hard rock (often [[sandstone]]) is struck against the raw material in order to chip off large flakes, and begin to shape the stone.  Using a hammerstone produces what is known as a preform, which is the core of the tool in need of more detailed refinements. The next technique allows for an increased level of detail; using a soft hammer (often made of wood or bone), one can chip away flakes of material with more precision.  The most precise technique is known as [[pressure flaking]].  This technique involves pressing small flakes off rather than by means of percussion.  Bone and antlers are often used as punches in order to create a very precisely detailed tool.  Another technique, known as indirect percussion, combines the use of a punch and a hammer in order to apply pressure to a precise area of the stone.  For the most part, stone cores can only be used to a certain extent before they become [[exhausted cores]].  As such, it is typically the flakes, or [[debitage]], that are the basis for stone tools. The flakes are shaped using the lithic reduction techniques, allowing for creation of various tools such as [[arrowhead]]s and [[handaxe]]s.

Two stone characteristics will determine whether one is able to chip away big enough flakes to make tools out of: whether the stone is of a [[cryptocrystalline]] structure, and how conchoidally the stone fractures.  A cryptocrystalline stone is one that is made up of minute crystals that can only be seen with a microscope.  Conchoidal fractures are described as smooth, curved breaks from the base stone.  Stones that have both of these characteristics allow for flakes that are big and sharp enough for a variety of tools to be made.  Obsidian is a great example of a material that is perfect for making tools with, as it is both cryptocrystalline and it fractures conchoidally.  Many early Middle Eastern and American civilizations used obsidian as a basis for tools as its internal structure made it easier to chip away than most of the other stones in the area.

During an experiment conducted by Dibble and Whittaker, they found that even the angle hit at the exterior platform would produce different flake types. The exterior platform angle is an angle formed by hitting the intersection of the platform surface and the exterior of the core. When hitting the core at a low exterior platform angle, a feather termination is produced. When the exterior platform angle is hit near a mid-range to low angle, a hinge termination is produced. The highest exterior platforms produce the overshoots. The desired termination, however, is generally the feather termination due to its sharp edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dibble|first1=Harold|last2=Whittaker|first2=John|title=New Experimental Evidence on the Relation Between Percussion Flaking and Flake Variation|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1981|pages=283–296|url=http://www.oldstoneage.com/pubs/HLD/dibwhit.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2017|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(81)90004-2|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emanuel Leutze - Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way - Capitol.jpg|thumb|[[Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way]] mural was made using '''stereochromy''' technique]]
'''Mineral painting''' also known as '''Stereochromy''' is a [[mural]] painting technique that uses a [[water glass]] based paint.

The original technique was called Stereochromy where [[pigment]]s were applied to [[plaster]] or stone and sealed with [[water glass]] to preserve and enhance the colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way |url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/other-paintings-and-murals/westward-course-empire-takes-its-way |website=Architect of the Capitol {{!}} United States Capitol |accessdate=30 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stereochromy - definition, etymology and usage, examples and related words |url=http://www.finedictionary.com/Stereochromy.html |website=www.finedictionary.com |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was first used about 1825 by [[Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs]] and Schlotthaurer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doerner |first1=Max |title=The Materials of the Artist and Their Use in Painting: With Notes on the Techniques of the Old Masters, Revised Edition |date=1984 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=9780156577168 |edition= First |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Spcd1-cZpsMC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=J.+Fuchs+and+Schlotthaurer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8ZbiEjEbV&amp;sig=fNDXBjOb4yNy0Um3C2v1sJtyzgY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ3P-z9pTdAhVIWq0KHQKOBW0Q6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=J.%20Fuchs%20and%20Schlotthaurer&amp;f=false |language=English|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then improved in the 1880's by [[Adolf Wilhelm Keim]] and renamed as ''mineral painting''&lt;ref name=CAMEO &gt;{{cite web |title=Mineral painting - CAMEO |url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Mineral_painting |website=cameo.mfa.org |accessdate=30 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph.

[[Image:Parallel Scale Nomogram.svg|right|400px|thumb|A typical parallel-scale nomogram. This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65.]]

A '''nomogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμος ''nomos'', "law" and γραμμή ''grammē'', "line"), also called a '''nomograph''', '''alignment chart''' or '''abaque''', is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne|Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne]] (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel [[coordinate system]] invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard [[Cartesian coordinates]].

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an ''index line'' or ''isopleth''.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a [[slide rule]], or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit [[domain knowledge]] into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|An impedance [[Smith chart]] (with no data plotted)]]

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy  they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. 

Other types of graphical calculators such as '''intercept charts''', '''trilinear diagrams''' and '''hexagonal charts''' are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the [[Smith chart]], a graphical calculator used in [[electronics]] and [[systems analysis]], [[thermodynamic diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==
[[Image:Components of a Nomogram.png|right|300px|thumb|Components of a parallel-scale nomogram]]
A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off.  The simplest such equation is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for the three variables ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be [[linear]], [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of ''T'' when ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.30 and ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for ''T'' at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.

==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes

* The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated [[cut and fill]] calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and weirs for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of [[Lawrence Henderson]], in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of [[Sputnik 1]] by P.E. Elyasberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=2007-10-18 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*[[Seismology]], where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake [http://web.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog458558/labs/nomogram.html magnitude]

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===
[[Image:Nomogramparallelresistance.svg|right|200px|thumb|Parallel [[electrical resistance]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below performs the computation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\frac{AB}{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of [[graph paper]].

''A'' and ''B'' are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale.  Being proportional to the [[harmonic mean]] of ''A'' and ''B'', this formula has several applications.  For example, it is the [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel-resistance formula]] in [[electronics]], and the [[Thin lens|thin-lens equation]] in [[optics]].

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s have a combined resistance of 24&amp;nbsp;ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;cm from a [[lens (optics)|lens]] whose [[focal length]] is 24&amp;nbsp;cm forms a [[real image]] at a distance of 42&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Chi-squared test computation===
[[Image:chisquarenomo3.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Chi-squared distribution]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of

:(9 &amp;minus; 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of

:(81 &amp;minus; 70)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, [[Yates's correction for continuity]] is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each "observed" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.

===Food risk assessment===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food [[risk assessment]] nomogram]]
Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived.  The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively.  This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk.  The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This [[risk assessment]] nomogram was developed by the [[Public analyst|UK Public Analyst Service]] with funding from the [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.

===Sample size estimation===
[[File:Power0501.pdf|thumb|Nomograph for Sample Size Estimation]]

This nomograph can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: ''&amp;alpha;'' (fixed), effect size (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;''), statistical power, and number of cases ''N'' (two scales for ''&amp;alpha;'' = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)).

The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (''&amp;rho;'') or a normalized difference in means (''&amp;delta;'') for a [[T-test]]. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (''&amp;mu;''₁ &amp;minus; ''&amp;mu;''₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (''s'').

The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;beta;'', where ''&amp;beta;'' is equal to the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;II error. A [[type II error|''Type&amp;nbsp;II'' error]] is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)&lt;ref name=Cohen_1977&gt;Cohen, J. (1977). ''Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences'', 2nd.&amp;nbsp;ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a ''&amp;beta;'' = 0.20&amp;nbsp;.

The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of ''&amp;alpha;'' is the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;I error. A [[type I error|''Type&amp;nbsp;I'' error]] is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact it ''is'' true (the value ''is'' zero) in the population and should ''not'' be rejected. The most commonly used values of &amp;alpha; are 0.05 or 0.01&amp;nbsp;.

To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'') on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values.

Where the line intersects with either the ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.05 or ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters).

For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (''&amp;rho;'') to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be ''N'' = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68&amp;nbsp;cases using interpolation).

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleobotany''', also spelled as '''palaeobotany''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''paleon'' = old and "[[botany]]", study of plants), is the branch of [[paleontology]] or [[paleobiology]] dealing with the recovery and identification of [[plant]] remains from [[geology|geological]] contexts, and their use for the biological reconstruction of [[paleogeography|past environments (paleogeography)]], and both the [[evolutionary history of plants]], with a bearing upon the [[evolution of life]] in general. A synonym is '''paleophytology'''. Paleobotany includes the study of [[Embryophyta|terrestrial plant]] [[fossils]], as well as the study of [[prehistoric]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[photoautotroph]]s, such as [[photosynthetic]] [[algae]], [[seaweed]]s or [[kelp]]. A closely related field is [[palynology]], which is the study of [[fossilized]] and [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[spore]]s and [[pollen]].

Paleobotany is important in the reconstruction of ancient [[Ecology|ecological]] systems and [[climate]], known as [[paleoecology]] and [[paleoclimatology]] respectively; and is fundamental to the study of green [[Plantae|plant]] [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[evolution]]. Paleobotany has also become important to the field of [[archaeology]], primarily for the use of [[phytolith]]s in [[relative dating]] and in [[paleoethnobotany]].

The emergence of paleobotany as a scientific discipline can be seen in the early 19th century, especially in the works of the German palaeontologist [[Ernst Friedrich, Baron von Schlotheim|Ernst Friedrich von Schlotheim]], the Czech (Bohemian) nobleman and scholar [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg]], and the French botanist [[Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brongniart, Adolphe-Théodore|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/brongniart-adolphe-theodore-0|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=22 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleal|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Lazarus|first2=Maureen|last3=Townsend|first3=Annette|editor1-last=Bowden|editor1-first=A.

==Overview of the paleobotanical record==
[[Macrofossil|Macroscopic remain]]s of true [[vascular plants]] are first found in the [[fossil]] record during the [[Silurian]] Period of the [[Paleozoic]] era. Some dispersed, fragmentary fossils of disputed affinity, primarily [[spores]] and [[cuticles]], have been found in rocks from the [[Ordovician]] Period in [[Oman]], and are thought to derive from [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]- or [[moss]]-grade fossil plants ({{Harvnb|Wellman|Osterloff|Mohiuddin|2003}}).

[[File:Rhynie chert.jpg|thumb|An unpolished hand sample of the Lower Devonian Rhynie Chert from Scotland]]

An important early land plant fossil locality is the [[Rhynie chert|Rhynie Chert]], found outside the village of [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]] in [[Scotland]].  The Rhynie chert is an Early [[Devonian]] sinter ([[hot spring]]) deposit composed primarily of [[silica]]. It is exceptional due to its preservation of several different [[clade]]s of plants, from [[mosses]] and [[lycopods]] to more unusual, problematic forms. Many fossil animals, including [[arthropods]] and [[arachnids]], are also found in the Rhynie Chert, and it offers a unique window on the history of early terrestrial life.

Plant-derived [[macrofossil]]s become abundant in the Late [[Devonian]] and include [[tree]] trunks, [[frond]]s, and [[root]]s. The earliest tree was thought to be ''[[Archaeopteris]]'', which bears simple, [[fern]]-like [[leaves]] spirally arranged on branches atop a [[conifer]]-like [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] ({{Harvnb|Meyer-Berthaud|Scheckler|Wendt|1999}}), though it is now known to be the recently discovered ''[[Wattieza]]''.&lt;ref name="Devonian"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/devonian/devonian.php |title = The Devonian Period |author = Speer, Brian R. |publisher = |date = 10 June 1995 |work = |accessdate= 12 May 2012|postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread [[coal]] swamp deposits across North America and Europe during the [[Carboniferous]] Period contain a wealth of fossils containing [[Lepidodendron|arborescent lycopods]] up to 30 meters tall, abundant [[Gymnosperm|seed plants]], such as [[conifers]] and [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]], and countless smaller, [[herbaceous]] plants.

[[Angiosperms]] ([[flowering plants]]) evolved during the [[Mesozoic]], and flowering plant pollen and leaves first appear during the Early [[Cretaceous]], approximately 130 million years ago.

==Plant fossils==
A [[plant]] [[fossil]] is any preserved part of a [[plant]] that has long since died. Such fossils may be prehistoric impressions that are many millions of years old, or bits of [[charcoal]] that are only a few hundred years old. Prehistoric plants are various groups of plants that lived before recorded [[history]] (before about [[3500 BC]]).

===Preservation of plant fossils===
[[File:Gingkoites huttoni 1.jpg|thumb|''Ginkgoites huttonii'', Middle Jurassic, Yorkshire, UK. Leaves preserved as compressions. Specimen in Munich Palaeontological Museum, Germany.]]
Plant fossils can be preserved in a variety of ways, each of which can give different types of information about the original parent plant.  These modes of preservation are discussed in the general pages on [[fossil]]s but may be summarised in a palaeobotanical context as follows.
#'''Adpressions (compressions - impressions).'''  These are the most commonly found type of plant fossil.  They provide good morphological detail, especially of dorsiventral (flattened) plant parts such as leaves.  If the cuticle is preserved, they can also yield fine anatomical detail of the epidermis.  Little other detail of cellular anatomy is normally preserved.  [[File:Rhynia stem.jpg|thumb| ''Rhynia'', Lower Devonian Rhynie Chert, Scotland, UK. Transverse section through a stem preserved as a silica petrifaction, showing preservation of cellular structure.]]
#'''Petrifactions (permineralisations or anatomically preserved fossils).'''  These provide fine detail of the cell anatomy of the plant tissue.  Morphological detail can also be determined by serial sectioning, but this is both time consuming and difficult.
#'''Moulds and casts.'''  These only tend to preserve the more robust plant parts such as seeds or woody stems.  They can provide information about the three-dimensional form of the plant, and in the case of casts of tree stumps can provide evidence of the density of the original vegetation.  However, they rarely preserve any fine morphological detail or cell anatomy.  A subset of such fossils are '''pith casts''', where the centre of a stem is either hollow or has delicate pith.  After death, sediment enters and forms a cast of the central cavity of the stem.  The best known examples of pith casts are in the Carboniferous Sphenophyta (''Calamites'') and cordaites (''Artisia'').  [[File:Crossotheca nodule.JPG|thumb| ''Crossotheca hughesiana'' Kidston, Middle Pennsylvanian, Coseley, near Dudley, UK. A lyginopteridalean pollen organ preserved as an authigenic mineralization (mineralized ''in situ''). Specimen in Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, UK.]]
#'''Authigenic mineralisations.''' These can provide very fine, three-dimensional morphological detail, and have proved especially important in the study of reproductive structures that can be severely distorted in adpressions.  However, as they are formed in mineral nodules, such fossils can rarely be of large size.
#'''Fusain'''. Fire normally destroys plant tissue but sometimes charcoalified remains can preserve fine morphological detail that is lost in other modes of preservation; some of the best evidence of early flowers has been preserved in fusain.  Fusain fossils are delicate and often small, but because of their buoyancy can often drift for long distances and can thus provide evidence of vegetation away from areas of sedimentation.

===Fossil-taxa===
Plant fossils almost always represent disarticulated parts of plants; even small herbaceous plants are rarely preserved whole.  Those few examples of plant fossils that appear to be the remains of whole plants in fact are incomplete as the internal cellular tissue and fine micromorphological detail is normally lost during fossilisation.  Plant remains can be preserved in a variety of ways, each revealing different features of the original parent plant.

Because of these difficulties, palaeobotanists usually assign different taxonomic names to different parts of the plant in different modes of preservation. For instance, in the subarborescent Palaeozoic [[Calamites|sphenophytes]], an impression of a leaf might be assigned to the genus ''Annularia'', a compression of a cone assigned to ''Palaeostachya'', and the stem assigned to either ''Calamites'' or ''Arthroxylon'' depending on whether it is preserved as a cast or a petrifaction. All of these fossils may have originated from the same parent plant but they are each given their own taxonomic name. This approach to naming plant fossils originated with the work of [[Alexandre Brongniart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brongniart|1822}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has stood the test of time.

For many years this approach to naming plant fossils was accepted by palaeobotanists but not formalised within the ''International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Briquet |first=J. |year=1906 |title=Règles internationales de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique de Vienne 1905 |publication-place=Jena |publisher=Fischer |oclc=153969885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, {{Harvtxt|Thomas|1935}} and {{Harvtxt|Jongmans|Halle|Gothan|1935}} proposed a set of formal provisions, the essence of which was introduced into the 1952 [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lanjouw|Baehni|Merrill|Rickett|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These early provisions allowed fossils representing particular parts of plants in a particular state of preservation to be referred to organ-genera.  In addition, a small subset of organ-genera, to be known as form-genera, were recognised based on the artificial taxa introduced by {{Harvtxt|Brongniart|1822}} mainly for foliage fossils.  Over the years, the concepts and regulations surrounding organ- and form-genera became modified within successive codes of nomenclature, reflecting a failure of the palaeobotanical community to agree on how this aspect of plant taxonomic nomenclature should work (a history reviewed by {{Harvtxt|Cleal|Thomas|2010}}). The use of organ- and fossil-genera was abandoned with the ''St Louis Code'' ({{Harvnb|Greuter|McNeill|Barrie|Burdet|2000}}), replaced by "morphotaxa".

The situation in the ''Vienna Code'' of 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that any plant taxon whose type is a fossil, except [[Diatom]]s, can be described as a '''morphotaxon''', a particular part of a plant preserved in a particular way. Although the name is always fixed to the type specimen, the circumscription (i.e. range of specimens that may be included within the taxon) is defined by the taxonomist who uses the name.  Such a change in circumscription could result in an expansion of the range of plant parts and/or preservation states that can be incorporated within the taxon.  For instance, a fossil-genus originally based on compressions of ovules could be used to include the multi-ovulate cupules within which the ovules were originally borne.  A complication can arise if, in this case, there was an already named fossil-genus for these cupules.  If palaeobotanists were confident that the type of the ovule fossil-genus and of the cupule fossil-genus could be included in the same genus, then the two names would compete as to being the correct one for the newly emended genus.

Morphotaxa were introduced to try to overcome the issue of competing names that represented different plant parts and/or preservation states.  What would you do if the species-name of a pollen-organ was pre-dated by the species name of the type of pollen produced by that pollen organ.  It was argued that palaeobotanists would be unhappy if the pollen organs were named using the taxonomic name whose type specimen is a pollen grain.  As pointed out by {{Harvtxt|Cleal|Thomas|2010}}, however, the risk of the name of a pollen grain supplanting the name of a pollen organ is most unlikely.  Palaeobotanists would have to be totally confident that the type specimen of the pollen species, which would normally be a dispersed grain, definitely came from the same plant that produced the pollen organ.  We know from modern plants that closely related but distinct species can produce virtually indistinguishable pollen.  It would seem that morphotaxa offer no real advantage to palaeobotanists over normal fossil-taxa and the concept was abandoned with the 2011 botanical congress and the 2012 [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]].

Some plants have remained almost unchanged throughout earth's geological time scale. [[Horsetail]]s had evolved by the Late Devonian,&lt;ref name="Elgorriaga 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elgorriaga |first1=A. |first2=I.H. |last2=Escapa |first3=G.W. |last3=Rothwell |first4=A.M.F. |last4=Tomescu |first5=N.R. |last5=Cúneo |year=2018 |title=Origin of Equisetum: Evolution of horsetails (Equisetales) within the major euphyllophyte clade Sphenopsida |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1125 |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=105 |pages=1–18 |pmid=30025163 |doi=10.1002/ajb2.1125 |issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; early [[fern]]s had evolved by the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pinophyta|conifers]] by the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]. Some plants of prehistory are the same ones around today and are thus [[living fossil]]s, such as ''[[Ginkgo|Ginkgo biloba]]'' and ''[[Sciadopitys|Sciadopitys verticillata]]''.

[[File:Henri Rousseau - Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''In a Tropical Forest Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo'', 1908-1909, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==

Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55745">'''Protein engineering''' is the process of developing useful or valuable [[protein]]s. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of [[protein folding]] and recognition for [[protein design]] principles.  It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/speeding-up-the-protein-assembly-line/5418/ |title= Speeding Up the Protein Assembly Line |last= Liszewski|first= Kathy |date= 15 February 2015 |work= [[Gen.

There are two general strategies for protein engineering: [[protein design|rational protein design]] and [[directed evolution]].  These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both.  In the future, more detailed knowledge of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], and advances in [[high-throughput screening]], may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering.  Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as [[expanded genetic code]], that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.

==Approaches==

=== Rational design ===
{{main|Protein design}}
In rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since [[site-directed mutagenesis]] methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as [[Folding@home]] and [[Foldit]] have utilized [[crowdsourcing]] techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Tylar|last2=Bohse|first2=Patrick|last3=Kerr|first3=Diane|title=Rational Design Protein Engineering Through Crowdsourcing|journal=Journal of Student Research|date=2017|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.jofsr.com/index.php/path/article/view/377/168|accessdate=27 April 2018|issn=2167-1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Computational protein design [[algorithm]]s seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

===Multiple Sequence Alignment===

Without structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. [[Multiple sequence alignment]] utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poluri|first1=Krishna Mohan|last2=Gulati|first2=Khushboo|title=Protein Engineering Techniques|date=2017|publisher=Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-10-2732-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

This method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using [[k-tuple]] or [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm|Needleman–Wunsch]] methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Clustal Omega====

This method is capable of aligning up to 190,00 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the [[UPGMA]] method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====MAFFT====
This method utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====K-Align====

This method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log Expectation (MUSCLE)====

This method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====T-Coffee====

This method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5-10% more accurate than Clustal W.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Coevolutionary Analysis===

Coevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences also sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Structural Prediction===

''De Novo'' synthesis of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes:  ''ab initio,'' fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====''Ab initio''====

These methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. ''Ab initio''  methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of ''ab initio'' methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for  ''ab initio'' methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Fragment based====

These methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are listed here: I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|72}}

====Homology modeling====

These methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refirnment and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Protein threading====

Protein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

For more information on rational design see [[Site-directed mutagenesis]].

=== Directed evolution ===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
In directed evolution, random [[mutagenesis]], e.g. by [[error-prone PCR]] or [[Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis]], is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits.  Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied.  This method mimics natural [[evolution]] and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed [[DNA shuffling]], mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results.  Such processes mimic the [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs naturally during [[sexual reproduction]].  Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have.  Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect.  The drawback is that they require [[high-throughput screening]], which is not feasible for all proteins.  Large amounts of [[recombinant DNA]] must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits.  The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process.  Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.

Natural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jäckel|first=Christian|last2=Kast|first2=Peter|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2008-05-07|title=Protein Design by Directed Evolution|url=http://annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=153–173|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects  of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shivange|first=Amol V|last2=Marienhagen|first2=Jan|last3=Mundhada|first3=Hemanshu|last4=Schenk|first4=Alexander|last5=Schwaneberg|first5=Ulrich|title=Advances in generating functional diversity for directed protein evolution|url=http://za2uf4ps7f.search.serialssolutions.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.atitle=Advances%20in%20generating%20functional%20diversity%20for%20directed%20protein%20evolution&amp;rft.aufirst=Amol%20V.&amp;rft.aulast=Shivange&amp;rft.date=2009&amp;rft.epage=25&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.issn=1367-5931&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.jtitle=CURRENT%20OPINION%20IN%20CHEMICAL%20BIOLOGY&amp;rft.pages=19-25&amp;rft.spage=19&amp;rft.stitle=CURR%20OPIN%20CHEM%20BIOL&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/www.isinet.com:WoK:UA&amp;rft.au=Marienhagen,%20Jan&amp;rft.au=Mundhada,%20Hemanshu&amp;rft.au=Schenk,%20Alexander&amp;rft.au=Schwaneberg,%20Ulrich&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/19261539&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Directed evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.

=== Asexual Methods ===
Asexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.

==== Random Mutagenesis ====
Random mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.

====Error Prone PCR====

Error prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Rates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}
# Increase concentration of magnesium chloride, which stabilizes non complementary base pairing.
# Add manganese chloride to reduce base pair specificity. 
# Increased and unbalanced addition of dNTPs.
# Addition of base analogs like dITP, 8 oxo-dGTP, and dPTP.
# Increase concentration of Taq polymerase.
# Increase extension time.
# Increase cycle time.
# Use less accurate Taq polymerase.

====Rolling circle error-prone PCR====

This PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear  DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29  DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Chemical mutagenesis====

Chemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow:

&lt;u&gt;Sodium Bisulfate&lt;/u&gt; - This mutagenic agent is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Ethyl Methane Sulfonate&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Nitrous Acid&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

The dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the ''in vivo'' chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Targeting Glycosylases to Embedded Arrays for Mutagenesis (TaGTEAM)====

This method has been used to create targeted  ''in vivo'' mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenesis by Random Insertion and Deletion====

This method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Transposon Based Random Mutagenesis====

Recently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-Random Circular Permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Mutagenesis Methods Altering the Target DNA Length====

These methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutator strains====

Mutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== Focused mutagenesis ====
Focused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.

====Site saturation mutagenesis====

Site saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.

Whole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Overlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====[[Sequence saturation mutagenesis]] (SeSaM)====

This technique results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3' termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Single primer reactions in parallel (SPRINP)====

This site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mega Primed and Ligase Free Focused Mutagenesis====

This site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Ω-PCR====

This site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====PFunkel-Ominchange-OSCARR====

This method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for One Pot Simple Methodology for Cassette Randomization and Recombination. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.

====Trimer-Dimer Mutagenesis====

This method removes redundant codons and stop codons.

====Cassette Mutagenesis====

This is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends.  Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion  of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Sexual Methods ===
Sexual methods of directed evolution involve ''in vitro'' recombination which mimic natural ''in vivo'' recombination. Generally these techniques require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vitro'' Homologous Recombination ====
Homologous recombination can be categorized as either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro. In vitro'' homologous recombination mimics natural ''in vivo'' recombination. These ''in vitro'' recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====DNA shuffling====

This ''in vitro'' technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random priming ''In vitro'' recombination (RPR)====

This ''in vitro'' homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Truncated Metagenomic Gene-Specific PCR====

This method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Staggered Extension Process (StEP)====

This ''in vitro'' method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Chimeragenesis on Transient Templates (RACHITT)====

This method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Synthetic shuffling====

Shuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vivo'' Homologous Recombination ====
'''&lt;small&gt;Cloning Performed in Yeast&lt;/small&gt;'''

This method involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenic Organized Recombination Process by Homologous ''In Vivo'' Grouping (MORPHING)====

This method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE)====

This method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage's life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== ''In Vitro'' Non-Homologous Recombination Methods ===
These methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.

===Exon Shuffling===

Exon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Incremental Truncation for the Creation of Hybrid Enzymes (ITHCY)====

Fragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITHCY is a modified ITHCY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as α-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by  exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an α-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====SCRATCHY====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITHCY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Recombined Extension on Truncated Templates (RETT)====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Homology-Independent Protein Recombination (SHIPREC)====

This method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5' and 3' end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Independent Site Directed Chimeragenesis (SISDC)====

This method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Degenerate Homo-Duplex Recombination (DHR)====

This method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Multi-Recombinant PCR (RM-PCR)====

This method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====User Friendly DNA Recombination (USERec)====

This method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Golden Gate Shuffling (GGS) Recombination====

This method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened  for expression levels.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phosphoro Thioate-Based DNA Recombination Method (PRTec)====

This method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5' ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Integron====

This system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Y-Ligation Based Shuffling (YLBS)====

This method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch  region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5' and 3' half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5' end in 3' half strands are then ligated with free 3' ends in 5' half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5' half  and pre 3' half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5' end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated  5' half strands and non-biotinylated 3' half strands are used as 5' and 3' half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

== Semi-Rational Design ==
Semi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Stefan|date=2017-04-20|title=Beyond directed evolution - semi-rational protein engineering and design|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=734–743|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011|issn=0958-1669|pmc=2982887|pmid=20869867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Biochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Directed evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Screening and Selection Techniques ==
Once a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell free display systems have been developed to exploit ''in vitro'' protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and ''in vitro'' compartmentalization.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Another computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of [[Conformational isomerism|rotamers]], and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.&lt;ref&gt;The iterative nature of this process allows IPRO to make additive mutations to a protein sequence that collectively improve the specificity toward desired substrates and/or cofactors. Details on how to download the software, implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and experimental testing of predictions are outlined in this paper: {{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly.&lt;ref name="Ardejani"&gt;{{Citation|title=Stabilization of a Protein Nanocage through the Plugging of a Protein–Protein Interfacial Water Pocket|date=April 2011|last1=Ardejani|last2=Li|last3=Orner|first1=MS|first2=NX|first3=BP|journal=Biochemistry|volume=50|issue=19|pages=4029–4037|doi=10.1021/bi200207w|pmid=21488690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its [[Protein homology|homologs]], it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average [[Protein dimer|dimeric interface]] on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the [[wild type]] EcBfr.  This computational study also converges on the water-bridged [[asparagine]]s. Replacing these two asparagines with [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] amino acids results in proteins that fold into [[Alpha helix|alpha-helical]] monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability.  One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="Ardejani" /&gt;

An R-value can be given for a material (e.g. for  [[polyethylene]] foam), or for an assembly of materials (e.g. a wall or a window). In the case of materials, it is often expressed in terms of R-value per unit length (e.g. per inch of thickness). The latter can be [[R-value_(insulation)#R-Value_Rule_in_the_U.S.|misleading]] in the case of low-density building thermal insulations, for which R-values are not additive: their R-value per inch is not constant as the material gets thicker, but rather usually decreases.&lt;ref name="Oak Ridge" /&gt; 

The units of an R-value (see [[R-value_(insulation)#Units:_metric_(SI)_vs._inch-pound_(I-P)|below]]) are usually not explicitly stated, and so it is important to decide from context which units are being used: an R-value expressed in [[United States customary units|I-P (inch-pound) units]]&lt;ref name="Heating, Cooling, Lighting I-P"&gt;{{cite book

The more a material is intrinsically able to conduct heat, as given by its [[thermal conductivity]], the lower its R-value. On the other hand, the thicker the material, the higher its R-value. Sometimes heat transfer processes ''other'' than conduction (namely, 
[[convection]] and [[Radiative transfer|radiation]]) significantly contribute to heat transfer within the material. In such cases, it is useful to introduce an ″apparent thermal conductivity″, which captures the effects of all three kinds of processes, and to define the R-value in general as &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\scriptstyle\text{thickness of the specimen}}{\scriptstyle\text{apparent thermal conductivity}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="CRCThermal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rathore" /&gt; This comes at a price, however: R-values that include non-conductive processes may no longer be additive and may have significant temperature dependence. In particular, for a loose or porous material, the R-value per inch generally depends on the thickness, almost always so that it decreases with increasing thickness&lt;ref name="Oak Ridge" /&gt; ([[polyisocyanurate]] (″polyso″) being an exception; its R-value/inch ''increases'' with thickness&lt;ref name="polyso LLTR" &gt;{{Citation

 | access-date = 5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For similar reasons, the R-value per inch also depends on the temperature of the material, usually increasing with decreasing temperature (polyso again being an exception); a nominally R-13 [[Building_insulation_materials#Fiberglass_batts_and_blankets_(glass_wool)|fiberglass batt]] may be R-14 at -12° C (10° F) and R-12 at  +43° C (110° F).&lt;ref name="R-Value vs T" &gt;{{Citation

The R-value is the reciprocal of the [[thermal transmittance]] ([[R-value (insulation)#U-factor.2FU-value|U-factor]]) of a material or assembly. The U.S. construction industry preferes to use R-values, however, because they are additive and because bigger values mean better insulation, neither of which is true for U-factors.&lt;ref name="Standardization" /&gt;

The ''U-factor'' or ''U-value'' is the [[Heat transfer coefficient#Overall heat transfer coefficient|overall heat transfer coefficient]] that describes how well a building element conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure.&lt;ref name="U-Value Measurement Case Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenteg.com/applications/heat-flux-sensing/building-physics//|title=U-Value Measurement Case Study| accessdate=2014-10-29| offline= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a building element over a given area under standardised conditions.  The usual standard is at a temperature gradient of 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75.2&amp;nbsp;°F), at 50% [[humidity]] with no wind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2000insulation.com|title=P2000 Insulation|website=www.p2000insulation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a smaller ''U-factor'' is better at reducing heat transfer). It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin (W/m²K). This means that the higher the U-value the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope. A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as it is a way of predicting the composite behavior of an entire building element rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.

In most countries the properties of specific materials (such as insulation) are indicated by the [[thermal conductivity]], sometimes called a k-value or lambda-value (lowercase λ). The thermal conductivity (k-value) is the ability of a material to conduct heat; hence, the lower the k-value, the better the material is for insulation. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has a k-value of around 0.033 W/mK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isover.com/Our-solutions/Insulation-materials/Polystyrene-insulation|title=Foams|website=www.isover.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, phenolic foam insulation has a k-value of around 0.018 W/mK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epfa.org.uk/properties.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523154711/http://www.epfa.org.uk/properties.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-05-23|title=European phenolic foam association: Properties of phenolic foam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while wood varies anywhere from 0.15 to 0.75 W/mK, and steel has a k-value of approximately 50.0 W/mK. These figures vary from product to product, so the UK and EU have established a 90/90 standard which means that 90% of the product will conform to the stated k-value with a 90% confidence level so long as the figure quoted is stated as the 90/90 lambda-value.

Note that the term "U-factor" (which redirects here) is usually used in the U.S. and Canada to express the heat flow through entire assemblies (such as roofs, walls, and windows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficient Windows Collaborative|url=http://www.efficientwindows.org/ufactor.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, energy codes such as ASHRAE 90.1 and the IECC prescribe U-values. However, R-value is widely used in practice to describe the thermal resistance of insulation products, layers, and most other parts of the building enclosure (walls, floors, roofs). Other areas of the world more commonly use U-value/U-factor for elements of the entire building enclosure including windows, doors, walls, roof, and ground slabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/st/fl/st/b1500v10/st_fl_st_b1500v10_4_par007.htm|title =Public Codes Cyberregs.|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065655/http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/st/fl/st/b1500v10/st_fl_st_b1500v10_4_par007.htm|archivedate =2016-03-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units: metric (SI) vs. inch-pound (I-P)==

The SI (metric) unit of R-value is 
: [[square metre|square-metre]] [[kelvin]] per [[watt]] (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·K/W or, equally, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·°C/W), 

whereas the I-P (inch-pound) unit is 
:[[square foot|square-foot]]·[[degree Fahrenheit]]·[[hour]]/[[British thermal unit]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·°F·h/BTU).&lt;ref name="Heating, Cooling, Lighting I-P" /&gt; 

For R-values there is [[Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|no difference]] between [[United States customary units|US customary units]] and [[imperial units]], so the same I-P unit is used in both. 

Some sources use ″RSI″ when referring to R-values in SI units.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Weights" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbook Low-Energy Buildings RSI" /&gt;

R-values expressed in I-P units are approximately 5.68 times as large as R-values expressed in SI units.&lt;ref name="Handbook Low-Energy Buildings conversion" /&gt; For example, a window that is R-2 in the I-P system is about RSI 0.35, since 2/5.68 &amp;#8776; 0.35.

In countries where the SI system is generally in use, the R-values will also normally be given in SI units. This includes the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

I-P values are commonly given in the U.S. and Canada, though in Canada normally both I-P and RSI values are listed.&lt;ref name="Canada I-P and RSI" &gt;{{Citation

Because the units are usually not explicitly stated, one must decide from context which units are being used. In this regard, it helps to keep in mind that I-P R-values are 5.68 times larger than the corresponding SI R-values.

==Different insulation types==

The Australian Government explains that the required total R-values for the building fabric vary depending on climate zone. "Such materials include aerated concrete blocks, hollow expanded polystyrene blocks, straw bales and rendered extruded polystyrene sheets."&lt;ref&gt;"Building Code of Australia (BCA)". BCA 2013, Volume Two, Part 3.12 &lt;http://www.yourhome.gov.au/passive-design/insulation&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, after the law Energieeinsparverordnung (EnEv) introduced  in 2009 (October 10) regarding energy savings, all new buildings must demonstrate an ability to remain within certain boundaries of the U-value for each particular building material. Further, the EnEv describes the maximum coefficient for each new material if parts are replaced or added to standing structures.&lt;ref&gt;&lt; https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?startbk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&amp;jumpTo=bgbl107s1519.pdf#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl107s1519.pdf%27%5D__1495584126681&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Energy has recommended R-values for given areas of the USA based on the general local energy costs for heating and cooling, as well as the climate of an area. There are four types of insulation: rolls and batts, loose-fill, rigid foam, and foam-in-place.  Rolls and batts are typically flexible insulators that come in fibers, like fiberglass. Loose-fill insulation comes in loose fibers or pellets and should be blown into a space.  Rigid foam is more expensive than fiber, but generally has a higher R-value per unit of thickness.  Foam-in-place insulation can be blown into small areas to control air leaks, like those around windows, or can be used to insulate an entire house.&lt;ref&gt;"Insulation".  U.S. Department of Energy. USA.gov. October 2010. 14 November 2010. &lt;http://www.energysavers.gov/tips/insulation.cfm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thickness==
Increasing the thickness of an insulating layer increases the thermal resistance. For example, doubling the thickness of fiberglass batting will double its R-value, perhaps from 2.0&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W for 110&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness, up to 4.0&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W for 220&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness.  Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to adding resistance to a series circuit with a fixed voltage. However, this only holds approximately because the effective thermal conductivity of some insulating materials depends on thickness.  The addition of materials to enclose the insulation such as sheetrock and siding provides additional but typically much smaller R-value.

==Factors==
There are many factors that come into play when using R-values to compute heat loss for a particular wall. Manufacturer R-values apply only to properly installed insulation.  Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a fiberglass batt decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat conduction path that is unaffected by the insulation's R-value.  The practical implication of this is that one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50 percent reduction in heat loss.  When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the conductive heat loss through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, heat losses due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.

==Primary role==
The R-value is a measure of an insulation sample's ability to reduce the rate of heat flow under specified test conditions.
The primary mode of heat transfer impeded by insulation is conduction, but insulation also reduces heat loss by all three heat transfer modes: conduction, convection, and radiation.
The primary heat loss across an uninsulated air-filled space is [[natural convection]], which occurs because of changes in air density with temperature. Insulation greatly retards natural convection making conduction the primary mode of heat transfer. Porous insulations accomplish this by trapping air so that significant convective heat loss is eliminated, leaving only conduction and minor radiation transfer.
The primary role of such insulation is to make the thermal conductivity of the insulation that of trapped, stagnant air.  However this cannot be realized fully because the glass wool or foam needed to prevent convection increases the heat conduction compared to that of still air. 
The minor radiative heat transfer is obtained by having many surfaces interrupting a "clear view" between the inner and outer surfaces of the insulation such as visible light is interrupted from passing through porous materials.  Such multiple surfaces are abundant in batting and porous foam.  Radiation is also minimized by low emissivity (highly reflective) exterior surfaces such as aluminum foil.
Lower thermal conductivity, or higher R-values, can be achieved by replacing air with argon when practical such as within special closed-pore foam insulation because [[argon]] has a lower thermal conductivity than air.

== General ==

Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to [[electrical resistance]]. The heat transfers can be worked out by thinking of resistance in series with a fixed potential, except the resistances are thermal resistances and the potential is the difference in temperature from one side of the material to the other. The resistance of each material to heat transfer depends on the specific thermal resistance [R-value]/[unit thickness], which is a property of the material (see table below) and the thickness of that layer. A thermal barrier that is composed of several layers will have several thermal resistors in the analogous with circuits, each in series. Analogous to a set of resistors in parallel, a well insulated wall with a poorly insulated window will allow proportionally more of the heat to go through the (low-R) window, and additional insulation in the wall will only minimally improve the overall R-value. As such, the least well insulated section of a wall will play the largest role in heat transfer relative to its size, similar to the way most current flows through the lowest resistance resistor in a parallel array. Hence ensuring that windows, service breaks (around wires/pipes), doors, and other breaks in a wall are well sealed and insulated is often the most cost effective way to improve the insulation of a structure, once the walls are sufficiently insulated.

Like resistance in electrical circuits, increasing the physical length (for insulation, thickness) of a resistive element, such as graphite for example, increases the resistance linearly; double the thickness of a layer means double the R-value and half the heat transfer; quadruple, quarters; etc. In practice, this linear relationship does not hold for compressible materials such as glass, wool, and cotton batting whose thermal properties change when compressed. {{clarify|reason=The relationship should hold as long the material is not compressed or stretched, shouldn't it?|date=May 2015}}

== Calculating heat loss ==

To find the average heat loss per unit area, simply divide the temperature difference by the R-value for the layer.

If the interior of a home is at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and the roof cavity is at 10&amp;nbsp;°C then the temperature difference is 10&amp;nbsp;°C (or 10&amp;nbsp;K). Assuming a ceiling insulated to RSI 2.0 (R = 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W), energy will be lost at a rate of 10&amp;nbsp;K / (2&amp;nbsp;K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W) = 5&amp;nbsp;watts for every square meter of ceiling. The RSI-value used here is for the actual insulating layer (and not per unit thickness of insulation).

==Relationships==

===Thickness===
R-value should not be confused with the [[intrinsic property]] of thermal resistivity and its inverse, [[thermal conductivity]].  The SI unit of thermal resistivity is K·m/W.  Thermal conductivity assumes that the heat transfer of the material is linearly related to its thickness.

===Multiple layers===
In calculating the R-value of a multi-layered installation, the R-values of the individual layers are added:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202600/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_02.html |archivedate=2007-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:R-value&lt;sub&gt;(outside air film)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(brick)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(sheathing)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(insulation)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(plasterboard)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(inside air film)&lt;/sub&gt; = R-value&lt;sub&gt;(total)&lt;/sub&gt;.

To account for other components in a wall such as framing, first calculate the U-value (=1/R-value) of each component, then the area-weighted average U-value.  The average R-value will be 1/(this average U-value).  For example, if 10% of the area is 4 inches of softwood (R-value 5.6) and 90% is 2 inches of silica aerogel (R-value 20), the area-weighted U-value is 0.1/5.6 + 0.9/20 = 0.0629 and the weighted R-value is 1/0.0629 = 15.9.

== Controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}

=== Thermal conductivity versus apparent thermal conductivity ===

[[Thermal conductivity]] is conventionally defined as the rate of thermal conduction through a material per unit area per unit thickness per unit temperature differential (ΔT). The inverse of conductivity is resistivity (or R per unit thickness). [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal conductance]] is the rate of heat flux through a unit area at the installed thickness and any given ΔT.

Experimentally, thermal conduction is measured by placing the material in contact between two conducting plates and measuring the energy flux required to maintain a certain temperature gradient.

For the most part, testing the R-value of insulation is done at a steady temperature, usually about {{convert|70|F|C}} with no surrounding air movement.  Since these are ideal conditions, the listed R-value for insulation will almost certainly be higher than it would be in actual use, because most situations with insulation are under different conditions

A definition of R-value based on apparent thermal conductivity has been proposed in document C168 published by the American Society for Testing and Materials.  This describes heat being transferred by all three mechanisms—conduction, radiation, and convection.

Debate remains among representatives from different segments of the U.S. insulation industry during revision of the U.S. FTC's regulations about advertising R-values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/rvalue/review.shtm|title=Consumer Information|website=Consumer Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the complexity of the issues.

=== Surface temperature in relationship to mode of heat transfer ===

There are weaknesses to using a single laboratory model to simultaneously assess the properties of a material to resist conducted, radiated, and convective heating.  Surface temperature varies depending on the mode of heat transfer.

In the absence of radiation or convection, the surface temperature of the insulator should equal the air temperature on each side.

In response to thermal radiation, surface temperature depends on the thermal [[emissivity]] of the material.  Light, reflective, or metallic surfaces that are exposed to radiation tend to maintain lower temperatures than dark, non-metallic ones.

Convection will alter the rate of heat transfer (and surface temperature) of an insulator, depending on the flow characteristics of the gas or fluid in contact with it.

With multiple modes of heat transfer, the [[sol-air temperature|final surface temperature]] (and hence the observed energy flux and calculated R-value) will be dependent on the relative contributions of radiation, conduction, and convection, even though the total energy contribution remains the same.

This is an important consideration in building construction because heat energy arrives in different forms and proportions.  The contribution of radiative and conductive heat sources also varies throughout the year and both are important contributors to [[thermal comfort]]

In the hot season, solar radiation predominates as the source of heat gain.  According to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], radiative heat transfer is related to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (measured in [[kelvin]]s: ''T'' [K] = ''T'' [°C] + 273.16).  Therefore, such transfer is at its most significant when the objective is to cool (i.e. when solar radiation has produced very warm surfaces). On the other hand, the conductive and convective heat loss modes play a more significant role during the cooler months. At such lower ambient temperatures the traditional fibrous, plastic and cellulose insulations play by far the major role: the radiative heat transfer component is of far less importance, and the main contribution of the radiation barrier is in its superior air-tightness contribution.
In summary: claims for radiant barrier insulation are justifiable at high temperatures, typically when minimizing summer heat transfer; but these claims are not justifiable in traditional winter (keeping-warm) conditions.

===The limitations of R-values in evaluating radiant barriers===
{{See also|Cool roofs}}

Unlike bulk insulators, [[radiant barrier]]s resist conducted heat poorly.  Materials such as reflective foil have a high thermal conductivity and would function poorly as a conductive insulator.
Radiant barriers retard heat transfer by two means: by reflecting radiant energy away from its surface and by reducing the emission of radiation from its opposite side.

The question of how to quantify performance of other systems such as radiant barriers has resulted in controversy and confusion in the building industry with the use of R-values or 'equivalent R-values' for products which have entirely different systems of inhibiting heat transfer. (In the U.S., the federal government's R-Value Rule establishes a legal definition for the R-value of a building material; the term 'equivalent R-value' has no legal definition and is therefore meaningless.)  According to current standards, R-values are most reliably stated for [[Building insulation materials|bulk insulation]] materials.  All of the products quoted at the end are examples of these.

Calculating the performance of [[radiant barrier]]s is more complex. With a good radiant barrier in place, most heat flow is by convection, which depends on many factors other than the radiant barrier itself. Although radiant barriers have high [[reflectivity]] (and low [[emissivity]]) over a range of electromagnetic spectra (including visible and UV light), their thermal advantages are mainly related to their emissivity in the infra-red range.  Emissivity values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electro-optical.com/bb_rad/emissivity/matlemisivty.htm#Metals+and+Conversion+Coatings|title=FAQ     - EOI|website=www.electro-optical.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the appropriate metric for radiant barriers.  Their effectiveness when employed to resist heat gain in limited applications is established,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-CR-1231-01-es/|title=FSEC-CR-1231-01-ES|website=www.fsec.ucf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
even though R-value does not adequately describe them.

==Deterioration==

===Insulation aging===
R-values of products may deteriorate over time. For instance the compaction of loose fill cellulose creates voids that reduce overall performance; this may be avoided by densely packing the initial installation.  Some types of [[foam]] insulation, such as polyurethane and polyisocyanurate are blown with heavy gases such as [[Haloalkane|chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs).  However, over time a small amount of these gases diffuse out of the foam and are replaced by air, thus reducing the effective R-value of the product. There are other foams which do not change significantly with aging because they are blown with water or are open-cell and contain no trapped CFCs or HFCs (e.g., half-pound low density foams).  On certain brands, twenty-year tests have shown no shrinkage or reduction in insulating value.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

This has led to controversy as how to rate the insulation of these products. Many manufacturers will rate the R-value at the time of manufacture; critics argue that a more fair assessment would be its settled value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The foam industry {{When|date=August 2011}} adopted the LTTR (Long-Term Thermal Resistance) method,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalroofing.net/archives/past/feb02/polyisofeature.asp  "Thermal resistance and polyiso insulation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609025242/http://www.professionalroofing.net/archives/past/feb02/polyisofeature.asp |date=2012-06-09 }} by John Clinton, ''Professional Roofing'' magazine, February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which rates the R-value based on a 15-year weighted average. However, the LTTR effectively provides only an eight-year aged R-value, short in the scale of a building that may have a lifespan of 50 to 100 years.

===Infiltration===
Correct attention to air sealing measures and consideration of vapor transfer mechanisms are important for the optimal function of bulk insulators.  Air infiltration can allow convective heat transfer or condensation formation, both of which may degrade the performance of an insulation.

One of the primary values of spray-foam insulation is its ability to create an airtight (and in some cases, watertight) [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] directly against the substrate to reduce the undesirable effects of air leakage.

==R-value in-situ measurements==

The deterioration of R-values is especially a problem when defining the energy efficiency of an existing building. Especially in older or historic buildings the R-values defined before construction might be very different than the actual values. This greatly affects energy efficiency analysis. To obtain reliable data, R-values are therefore often determined via U-value measurements at the specific location (in situ). There are several potential methods to this, each with their specific trade-offs: thermography, multiple temperature measurements, and the heat flux method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.greenteg.com/wp-content/uploads/gSKIN_Application-note_U-Value-measurement-case-study.pdf|title=Case study: U-value measurement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermography===
Thermography is applied in the building sector to assess the quality of the thermal insulation of a room or building. By means of a thermographic camera thermal bridges and inhomogeneous insulation parts can be identified. However, it does not produce any quantitative data. This method can only be used to approximate the U-value or the inverse R-value.
[[File:GreenTEG U-value set-up.jpg|thumb|Heat flux measurement set-up]]
[[File:Software GreenTEG U-value Kit.JPG|thumb|Heat flux measurement results]]

===Multiple temperature measurements===
This approach is based on three or more temperature measurements inside and outside of a building element. By synchronizing these measurements and making some basic assumptions, it is possible to calculate the heat flux indirectly, and thus deriving the U-value of a building element. The following requirements have to be fulfilled for reliable results:

*	Difference between inside and outside temperature, ideal &gt; 15 K
*	Constant conditions
*	No solar radiation

===Heat flux method===
The U-value can be calculated as well by using a heat flux sensor in combination with two temperature sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenteg.com/U-Value/|title=U-value and building physics|publisher=greenTEG|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the heat that is flowing through a building element and combining this with the inside and outside temperature, it is possible to define the U-value precisely. A measurement that lasts at least 72 hours with a temperature difference of at least 5&amp;nbsp;°C is required for a reliable result according to ISO 9869 norms, but shorter measurement durations give a reliable indication of the U-value as well. The progress of the measurement can be viewed on the laptop via corresponding software and obtained data can be used for further calculations. Measuring devices for such heat flux measurements are offered by companies like FluxTeq,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.FluxTeq.com/|title=Thermal Monitoring of Buildings|publisher=FluxTeq|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlborn, greenTEG and Hukseflux.

==Example values==

{{Globalize/North America|date=January 2010}}

[[Vacuum insulated panel]]s have the highest R-value, approximately R-45 (in U.S. units) per inch; [[aerogel]] has the next highest R-value (about R-10 to R-30 per inch), followed by polyurethane (PUR) and phenolic foam insulations with R-7 per inch. They are followed closely by [[polyurethane|polyisocyanurate]] (PIR) at R-5.8, graphite impregnated expanded polystyrene at R-5, and [[polystyrene|expanded polystyrene]] (EPS) at R-4 per inch. Loose cellulose, fibreglass (both blown and in batts), and rock wool (both blown and in batts) all possess an R-value of roughly R-2.5 to R-4 per inch.

Straw bales perform at about R-1.5 per inch. However, typical [[Straw-bale construction|straw bale]] houses have very thick walls and thus are well insulated. Snow is roughly R-1 per inch. Brick has a very poor insulating ability at a mere R-0.2 per inch; however it does have a relatively good [[thermal mass]].

Note that the above examples all use the U.S. (non-SI) definition for R-value.

In practice the above surface values are used for floors, ceilings, and walls in a building, but are not accurate for enclosed air cavities, such as between panes of glass. The effective thermal resistance of an enclosed air cavity is strongly influenced by radiative heat transfer and distance between the two surfaces. See [[insulated glazing]] for a comparison of R-values for windows, with some effective R-values that include an air cavity.

=== ''R-Value Rule'' in the U.S. ===
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) governs claims about R-values to protect consumers against deceptive and misleading advertising claims.  "The Commission issued the R-Value Rule&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/r-value-rule&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the rule is to ensure that the home insulation marketplace provides this essential pre-purchase information to the consumer.  The information gives consumers an opportunity to compare relative insulating efficiencies, to select the product with the greatest efficiency and potential for energy savings, to make a cost-effective purchase and to consider the main variables limiting insulation effectiveness and realization of claimed energy savings.

The rule mandates that specific R-value information for home insulation products be disclosed in certain ads and at the point of sale.  The purpose of the R-value disclosure requirement for advertising is to prevent consumers from being misled by certain claims which have a bearing on insulating value.  At the point of transaction, some consumers will be able to get the requisite R-value information from the label on the insulation package.  However, since the evidence shows that packages are often unavailable for inspection prior to purchase, no labeled information would be available to consumers in many instances.  As a result, the Rule requires that a fact sheet be available to consumers for inspection before they make their purchase.

====Thickness====
The R-value Rule specifies:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=21b94eefe259df18ad38c9a6400665cd&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt16.1.460&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|In labels, fact sheets, ads, or other promotional materials, do not give the R-value for one inch or the "R-value per inch" of your product. There are two exceptions:
:a. You can do this if you suggest using your product at a one-inch thickness.
:b. You can do this if actual test results prove that the R-values per inch of your product does not drop as it gets thicker.
You can list a range of R-value per inch. If you do, you must say exactly how much the R-value drops with greater thickness. You must also add this statement: "The R-value per inch of this insulation varies with thickness. The thicker the insulation, the lower the R-value per inch."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">A '''sacred natural site''' is a natural feature or a large area of land or water having special [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oviedo, G. and Jeanrenaud, S. (2007) 'Protecting sacred natural sites of indigenous and traditional peoples', in Mallarach, J.M. and Papayannis, T. (eds) (2007) Protected Areas and Spirituality, IUCN and Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, [[Sacred grove|groves]], [[Tree worship|trees]], rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. The interest in sacred natural sites, from the perspective of [[nature conservation]], lies in the component of [[biological diversity]] that they harbor.

== Overview ==
Sacred natural sites are natural features in or areas of land or water having special spiritual significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt; This working definition is broad and can be used as a basis for more specific articulations. Whilst “sacred natural sites” is the main term used, for reasons of variety and readability, other terms are used interchangeably, including [[sacred site]], [[sacred place]] and sacred area.

The interest in sacred natural sites from the perspective of [[nature conservation]] lies in the components of [[biological diversity]] that they harbour, such as the species of animals and plants, the [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, as well as the ecological dynamics and functions that support life within and outside the places. Linked to such biological diversity is the array of distinct [[human culture]]s that care for them and hold them sacred.&lt;ref name=v&gt;Verschuuren, B., Wild, R., McNeely, J., Oviedo G. (eds.), 2010. Sacred Natural Sites, Conserving Culture and Nature. EarthScan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, groves, rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. They can vary in size from the very small: an individual tree, small spring, or a single rock formation, to whole landscapes and mountain ranges.  They consist of [[geological formation]]s, distinct [[landform]]s, specific [[ecosystem]]s and [[natural habitat]]s.  They are predominantly [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] but are also found in inshore [[Ocean|marine]] areas, [[island]]s and [[archipelago]]s.  They may also be the location of [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, and they can incorporate other features such as [[pilgrimage]] trails.  In some sites nature is itself sacred, while in others sanctity is conferred by connections with spiritual heroes, religious structures or sacred histories.

== Sacred natural sites and religion==
Sacred natural sites are just one of many domains where religions or belief systems interact with nature. Most if not all religions have [[mythology]], [[cosmology]], [[theology]] or [[ethics]] related to earth, nature and land. Contemporarily, such connections are increasingly being revived or rearticulated through ethical positions expressed for example in statements that many of the mainstream faiths have produced, setting out their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility towards the planet.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Sacred sites associated with living cultures always have institutions and rules associated with them. These institutions are usually religious or spiritual in nature and may be distinct from other parts of society, while in some communities of indigenous and traditional peoples, sacred site institutions are closely integrated within society with little distinction between the sacred and secular, the religious and civil.

The vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or [[folk religion]]s and [[spirituality|spiritualities]], but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. There is consequently a considerable 'layering' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. Within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. While fifty per cent of the world's population profess to belong to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] and many others are [[Hindu]]s or [[Buddhist]]s, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. and Palmer, M. (1997)'The Atlas of Religion', University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.

==Sacred natural sites, indigenous peoples and mainstream faiths==
Establishing a duality between '[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]', in the sense of being native or belonging to a place, and 'mainstream', while pragmatic for discussion, does present some problems. Several mainstream faiths can be considered indigenous in much of their range e.g. [[Daoism]], [[Shinto]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], while [[Zoroastrianism]] now has very few followers and is essentially no longer 'mainstream'. More problematic is that this duality renders invisible the many merged or [[syncretic]] faiths and folk variants of mainstream religions where elements of the preceding indigenous beliefs are still practiced. These folk religions can have much stronger nature ethics than the more symbolic orthodox form.

Within human history, religion has been used (or abused) as a tool of domination. These issues, although much reduced, have not gone away and some faiths still seek converts from other faiths. The destruction of [[sacred site]]s has been part of that domination and still continues today. Conversely, most faiths over long periods of time have peaceably co-existed and shared sacred sites. Mutual respect and accommodation have often been reached. Further compassion and peace-building lie at the heart of many religious traditions and belief systems.

==The distribution of sacred natural sites==
Sacred natural sites are, with the exception of [[Antarctica]], found on every continent and probably in every country. Some of them are surely among the oldest venerated places of earth and at the same time new sacred natural sites are still being established, in some cases by migrants to new countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-anthropological evidence indicates that earlier humans such as [[Neanderthal]]s practised the cult of ancestors in burial sites over 60,000 years ago, which is arguably one of the origins of sacred sites. [[Ancestor worship]] and veneration of [[burial ground]]s seem to be a common trait of every culture of modern humans, as well as the adoration of natural features of great significance such as high mountains or large rivers. Australian sacred sites may go back at least 50,000 years; [[rock art]] considered of a sacred nature date to 20,000 years ago, and some of the [[Neolithic]] [[henge]]s date from 5,000 years ago.

At a landscape level, [[anthropologist]]s have long recognized the sacred status that cultures have given to nature not only in specific sacred sites,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but also in larger areas of cultural significance and entire landscapes. Interest on the importance of sacred sites for living cultures has seen an upsurge since the mid 1990s, which has contributed to the exploration of new paradigms and multidisciplinary views to the advantage of both the understanding and conservation of sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, F. (1999) ‘Sacred Ecology, Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management’, Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, D.L., Hubert, J., Reeves, B. and Schanche, A. (1994) ‘Sacred Sites, Sacred Places’, Routledge, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posey, D. (ed.) (1999) ‘Cultural and Spiritual Values of Biodiversity’, a comprehensive contribution to the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment. Intermediate Technology Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of their diversity, origins, and different and varying degrees of sacrality of their elements, it is not really possible to have full knowledge about the number of sacred sites existing in the world today. Exhaustively documenting sacred natural sites would have to be done by bottom-up identification at the community level, which is not really practicable. However, estimates have been made for some countries, notably India, where at least 13,720 [[sacred grove]]s have been reported and experts estimate that the total number for the country may be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S. (2001) ‘Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India’, INSA: New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; India may be exceptional because of its size, cultural diversity and widespread practices about sacred groves, but it would not be unrealistic to estimate that sacred natural sites must exist in the hundreds of thousands.

==Importance for the conservation of nature and culture==
Many sacred natural sites have been well protected over long time periods and have seen low levels of utilization.  Many are demonstrably high in [[biodiversity]] and represent a strong biodiversity conservation opportunity.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Sacred natural sites also represent ancient and profound [[cultural]] values. The roles of sacred sites’ custodians from indigenous, local community and mainstream religions are expressions of dedicated efforts that cultures that have specifically, if not always consciously, cared for nature in various ways.

While sacred natural sites are connected to the [[human spirit]] and intangible heritage they also have strong material components. In addition to being places where animals and plant species survive,  they provide resources such as water and medicines and other [[ecosystem service]]s, they are the location of events and ceremonies, and traditionally are sites of education. They link to livelihoods in many ways and the concepts of cultural services and human wellbeing are associated with them.{{cn|date=February 2017}} They support [[pilgrimage]]s and [[tourism]], both of which have large associated service sectors and generate significant economic activity.

==A brief history in conservation==
Following a seminal workshop organized by [[UNESCO]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Lee C, Schaaf T. (2003) ‘The Importance of Sacred Natural Sites for Biodiversity Conservation’, Proceedings of the International Workshop held in Kunming and Xishuangbanna Biosphere Reserve, People’s Republic of China, 17–20 February 2003. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf T., and Lee, C. (2006) ‘Conserving Cultural and Biological Diversity: The Role of Sacred Natural Sites and Cultural Landscapes’ Proceedings of UNESCO-IUCN International Conference, Tokyo, Japan. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; international conservation organisations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[IUCN]], working with indigenous groups and networks such as the [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation]], started to explore ways to integrate sacred natural sites in their conservation work. A number of international events and processes followed, and case studies and scientific and practitioner articles started to appear in books and journals. In 2003 IUCN’s Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA) and UNESCO started work on guidelines for the management of sacred natural sites.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt;  This Group has advanced a significant amount of work on sacred natural sites, including through specific projects such as the [[Delos Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallarach, J M. and Papayannis, T. (eds.) (2007) ‘Protected Areas and Spirituality’, IUCN and Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat. Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Papayannis, T. and Mallarach, J M. (eds) (2009) ‘The Sacred Dimension of Protected Areas’, Proceedings of the Second Workshop of the Delos Initiative – Ouranoupolis 2007. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN and Athens, Greece: Med-INA.&lt;/ref&gt; Among international conservation NGO’s, The [[Nature Conservancy]] has developed a planning tool for the conservation of sacred sites and cultural heritage in protected areas and tested it across countries in [[Central America]] such as [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Secaira, E. and &amp; Molina M E, (2005) ‘Planning for the Conservation of Sacred Sites in the Context of Protected Areas’, an adaptation of a Methodology and lessons from its application in the Highlands of Western Guatemala. The nature conservancy, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF studied sacred sites in one hundred protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International importance of sacred natural sites==
The urgent need for the protection of sacred natural sites has also been recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. The CBD in 2004 developed the Akwe Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding proposed developments that may affect sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2004, Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities’, CBD Guidelines Series, Montreal, 25p.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, as described before, the adoption of the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] &lt;ref name=UNDRIP/&gt; is an important benchmark.  Article 12 in particular provides significant political leverage for developing appropriate policies for the protection and recognition of sacred natural sites at the national level. It states:  “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.”.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP&gt;UNDRIP (2007) ‘Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations’, General Assembly, 61st session, agenda item 68, Report of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred natural sites and the ethics of research and inventory==
It is particularly important to raise the concept of free prior, [[informed consent]] (FPIC), which has emerged as a standard for engaging with [[indigenous people]] and local communities. This is particularly important with regard to sacred natural sites.  For many custodians of sacred natural sites [[secrecy]] is of the utmost importance and needs serious consideration and respect.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;  At the same time it needs to be recognised that research and inventory can be powerful tools for the communication and conservation of sacred natural sites.

==Sacred natural sites and global change==
Verschuuren et al. (2010) identified significant global changes, many of which affect sacred natural sites and their custodian communities.  These include:&lt;ref name=v/&gt;
*global human [[population increase]],
*modernity and erosion of traditional [[culture]],
*[[biodiversity loss]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat]] and species declines, [[species extinction]] and [[ecosystem]] damage,
*[[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]],  [[forestry]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] or other types of [[Land use|land]] and sea use,
*[[Mining|extractive]] and energy industries,
*growth of cities, [[urbanization]] and transport networks,
*increased conflict over [[natural resource]]s,
*weakened livelihood systems and [[poverty]],
*[[Social change|social]] and political changes and conflicts in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] realm,
*[[globalization]] of the dominant economic model based on continual growth, detached from ecological realities,
*decline in [[spirituality|spiritual]] values,
*[[climate change]].

Many of the drivers of these global changes are mutually reinforcing and affect cultural and [[biological diversity]] and the many services that sacred natural sites provide to human well-being. 

Generating a greater recognition of the sacred dimensions of nature focused on sacred natural sites is expected to be an important means of building public support for the policies that conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the diversity of human adaptations to a changing environment.

      <comment>Actually, I'm just going to take the unreferenced claim out of here because it doesn't have anything to do with the "history" of the facility (despite being in the history section), and the website doesn't support this claim. Why would something closed to the public have a gift shop?</comment>

[[Image:Science Center of Pinellas County (exterior view).jpg|frame|The Science Center of Pinellas County]]
The '''Science and Technology Education Innovation Center''', formerly known as the Science Center of Pinellas County, is an educational center in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], United States.  It occupies {{convert|7|acre|m2}} of land located on 22nd Avenue North, in West St. Petersburg, located near the Tyrone Mall.

==History==
[[File:St Petersburg FL Science Center02.jpg|thumb]]
The Science Center is a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg in 1959 by [[William Guild (scientist)|William Guild]] and [[Nell Rodgers Croley]].  It was the first science center of its kind in the world , and it operates on donations and grants.  Its mission is to inspire interest in and to promoting the understanding of all sciences.

In 1966 the present main building was completed.  During the 1960s and early 70s, the center offered after-school and weekend classes for students from Kindergarten through middle school in such subjects as biology, chemistry, electronics and astronautics. Today about 22,000 children visit the building each school year during field trips.  The Science Center frequently works with Pinellas County schools, and all summer camp classes and science camps taught at the Science Center meet FCAT guidelines.  



==Features==

=== Margaret Ewell Dickins Marine Exhibit ===
In 2000 the Margaret Ewell Dickins Marine Room opened. The exhibit includes numerous [[aquarium]]s filled with marine creatures such as a [[snowflake moray]] and a [[black sea bass]]. The most popular feature is a 600-gallon touch tank where visitors can touch [[starfish]], [[horseshoe crab]]s, [[guitarfish]], [[slipper lobster]]s, [[hermit crab]]s and [[sea urchin]]s. In addition, the Science Center holds marine biology classes for children in this room during science summer camps and school breaks.

=== Observatory ===
In 1997, the [[Carol Samuels Observatory]] opened.  The observatory provides visitors with a view of cosmic events and features through a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} Meade telescope.  The research-grade telescope is the only one available to the public in Pinellas County in a non-university setting.  The [[St. Petersburg Astronomy Club]] holds a handful of events at the Science Center throughout the year, and helps the public use the Meade Telescope to view comets, eclipses, or planets.

===White Gardens===
The idea for the White Gardens came from [[Starley M. White]], Chairman of the Board of the former [[National Bank]].  Surrounding the White Gardens is a "Walk of States", a [[mosaic]] tile walkway made up of more than 50 sections, one section for each state in the United States. A segment of the walk is dedicated to the [[Seminole]] tribe and [[Andrew Jackson]].  Each of the 50 states are displayed in order of their admission into the union. The walkway shows an image of the state, including the state's bird and flower. Beside each state's tile walk the state's rock is on display.  The Walk of States was created by [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] artist [[Attillio Puglisi]]. It was moved to the Science Center in 1971.

==Planetarium==
In 1971 the Discovery Center was built. This building houses the Columbia Planetarium.  In 2003 the Spirit of Columbia Theater and [[Planetarium]] opened.  The Planetarium offers a showing daily which is included in the $5 admission fee.  The Science Center's digital planetarium is the only one available to the public in Pinellas County.  It can show the sky as it was on any specific date in history and when the Center is rented out for birthday parties or anniversaries, it is often set to show the night sky as it appeared the night of the event commemorated.

==Optical lab==
The Science Center houses the only optical lab for the public to grind [[telescope]] [[mirror]]s in the southeastern United States.  The lab is operated by the St. Petersburg Astronomy Club.  The club welcomes the public to visit the optical lab on Saturdays between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. to build a homemade telescope from scratch.

==Gift shop==
A small gift shop features science and space-themed toys which are available to purchase at reasonable prices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28915">'''Sex work''' is "the exchange of [[sexual services]], performances, or products for material compensation. It includes activities of direct physical contact between buyers and sellers as well as indirect sexual stimulation".&lt;ref name="Weitzer"&gt;''Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry'', edited by Ronald Weitzer, Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The term emphasizes the labor and economic implications of this type of work. Furthermore, some prefer the use of the term because it seemingly grants more agency to the sellers of these services. 
[[File:Red Light District.jpg|thumb|The Red Light district in Amsterdam]]

Because of the agency associated with the term, "sex work" generally refers to voluntary sexual transactions; thus the term does not refer to [[human trafficking]] and other coerced or nonconsensual sexual transactions.&lt;ref name="Trafficking"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alternet.org/story/84987/sex_work_vs._trafficking%3A_understanding_the_difference|title=Sex Work vs. Trafficking: Understanding the Difference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the legal status of some forms of sex work and the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with sex work, the population is difficult to access; thus there has been relatively little academic research done on the topic. Furthermore, the vast majority of academic literature on sex work focuses on [[prostitution]], and to a lesser extent, [[stripper|exotic dancing]]; there is little research on other forms of sex work. These findings cannot necessarily be generalized to other forms of sex work. Nonetheless, there is a long documented history of sex work and its personal and economic nature.

==Types==
Types of sex work include, but are not limited to, street prostitution, indoor prostitution (escort services, [[brothel]] work, massage parlor-related prostitution, bar or casino prostitution), [[phone sex]] operation, exotic dancing, [[lap dancing]], webcam nude modeling, [[pornographic film]] performing, and nude [[peepshow]] performing. The list is sometimes expanded to include jobs in the [[sex industry]] that less directly involve the sexuality of the worker in the exchange of sexual performances, services, and products, such as the producers and directors of adult films, manufacturers and sellers of [[sex toy]]s, managers in exotic dance clubs, escort agents, bouncers, etc.
[[File:Porn Set 5.jpg|thumb|On the set of a pornographic film]]

In 2004, a Medline search and review of 681 "prostitution" articles was conducted in order to create a global typology of types of sex work using arbitrary categories. 25 types of sex work were identified in order to create a more systematic understanding of sex work as a whole. Prostitution varies by forms and social contexts including different types of direct and indirect prostitution. This study as conducted in order to work towards improving the health and safety of [[sex worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, B. &amp; Harcourt, C. 2005. "The Many Faces of Sex Work." Sexually Transmitted Infections 81(3):201-206.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sex work, in many different forms, has been practiced since ancient times. It is reported that even in the most primitive societies, there was transactional sex. Prostitution was widespread in ancient Egypt and Greece, where it was practiced at various socioeconomic levels. [[Hetaera]] in Greece and [[geisha]] in Japan were seen as prestigious members of society for their high level of training in companionship. Attitudes towards prostitution have shifted through history. 
[[File:NAMA Courtisane &amp; client.jpg|thumb|An Ancient Greek urn depicts a prostitute and her client]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was tolerated but not celebrated. It wasn't until the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century that attitudes turned against prostitution on a large scale and bodies began to be regulated more heavily. These moral reforms were to a large extent directed towards the restriction of women's autonomy. Furthermore, enforcement of regulations regarding prostitution disproportionately impacted the poor.&lt;ref name="Ditmore"&gt;Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volumes 1 &amp; 2, edited by Melissa Hope Ditmore, Greenwood Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work has a long history in the United States, yet laws regulating the sale of sex are relatively new. In the 18th century, prostitution was deeply rooted from Louisiana to San Francisco. Despite its prevalence, attitudes towards prostitutes were negative and many times hostile. Although the law did not directly address prostitution at this time, law enforcement often targeted prostitutes. Laws against lewdness and [[sodomy]] were used in an attempt to regulate sex work. [[Red-light district]]s formed in the 19th century in major cities across the country in an attempt by sex workers to find spaces where they could work, isolated from outside society and corresponding stigma.

Ambiguity in the law allowed for prostitutes to challenge imprisonment in the courts. Through these cases prostitutes forced a popular recognition of their profession and defended their rights and property. Despite sex workers efforts, social reformers looking to abolish prostitution outright began to gain traction in the early 20th century. New laws focused on the third-party businesses where prostitution took place, such as saloons and brothels, holding the owners culpable for the activities that happened within their premises. Red-light districts began to close. Finally, in 1910 the [[Mann Act]], or "White Slave Traffic Act" made illegal the act of coercing a person into prostitution or other immoral activity, the first federal law addressing prostitution. This act was created to address the trafficking of young, European girls who were thought to have been kidnapped and transported to the United States to work in brothels, but criminalized those participating in consensual sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of American History: With the Complete Text of the Constitution of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqG-B4jsMIAC|first1=Michael Rheta|last1=Martin|first2=Leonard|last2=Gelber|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1978|isbn=9780822601241|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the start of the First World War, a Navy decree forced the closure of sex-related businesses in close proximity to military bases. Restrictions and outright violence led to the loss of the little control workers had over their work. In addition to this, in 1918, the Chamberlain-Kahn Act made it so that any woman found to have a [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) would be quarantined by the government. The original purpose of this act was to stop the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann|first1=Moseley|title=Cather Studies, Volume 11|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803296992|pages=384|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 under this act, prostitutes, or those perceived to be prostitutes could be stopped, inspected, and detained or sent to a rehabilitation facility if they were found to test positive for any venereal disease. During the [[World War I]], an estimate 30,00 women were detained and examined. The state had made sex workers into legal outcasts.&lt;ref name="Crime"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=Melissa Gira |title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America |url=https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america |website=[[AlterNet]] |accessdate=31 May 2018 |date=18 February 2013| author-link=Melissa Gira Grant }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], black women in New York City accounted for more than 50 percent of arrests for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanshard|first1=Paul|title=Negro Deliquency in New York|journal=The Journal of Educational Sociology|date=October 1942|volume=16|page=115-123|doi=10.237/2262442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of sex work expanded in the 21st century. Film and later the internet provided new opportunities for sex work. In 1978, [[Carol Leigh]], a prostitute and activist, coined the term "sex work" as it is now used. She looked to combat the anti-porn movement by coining a term that reflected the labor and economic implications of the work. The term came into popular use in the 1980s. (bayswan). [[COYOTE]] (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) and other similar groups formed in the 1970s and 80s to push for women's sexual freedom and [[sex workers' rights]]. A rift formed within feminism that continues today, with some arguing for the abolishment of sex work and others working for acceptance and rights for sex works.

The [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic presented a new challenge to sex workers. The criminalization of exposing others to AIDS significantly impacted sex workers. Harm reduction strategies were organized providing testing, counseling, and supplies to stop the spread of the disease. This experience organizing helped facilitate future action for social justice. The threat of violence persists in many types of sex work. Unionization of legal types of sex work such as exotic dancers, lobbying of public health officials and labor officials, and human rights agencies has improved conditions for many sex workers. Nonetheless, the political ramifications of supporting a stigmatized population make organizing around sex work difficult. Despite these difficulties, actions against violence and for increased visibility and rights persist drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.&lt;ref name="swaay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|title=Sex Work Activists, Allies, and You History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal status of sex work is reliant on the type of sex work and the location in question. In the United States sex work is largely regulated at the state level. Prostitution is illegal in almost every state, with Nevada being the only exception (see [[Prostitution law]]). Most other forms of sex work&amp;nbsp;– those which do not involve engagement in sex acts via bodily contact&amp;nbsp;– are legal if the sex worker is 18 or older and consenting.

==Emotional labor==
[[Emotional labor]] is an essential part of many service jobs, including many types of sex work. Through emotional labor sex workers engage in different levels of acting known as surface acting and deep acting. These levels reflect a sex worker's engagement with the emotional labor. Surface acting occurs when the sex worker is aware of the dissonance between their authentic experience of emotion and their managed emotional display. In contrast deep acting occurs when the sex worker can no longer differentiate between what is authentic and what is acting; acting becomes authentic.&lt;ref name="Hochschild"&gt;Hochschild, A. ''The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling'', University of California Press, LTD, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Woman lying on bed, looking at mirror, Berlin 2001.jpg|thumb|A prostitute in Berlin in 2001]]

Sex workers engage in emotional labor for many different reasons. First, sex workers often engage in emotional labor to construct performances of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, K. ''G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire'', Duke University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders |first=T. |year=2005 |title='It's Just Acting': Sex Workers' Strategies for Capitalizing of Sexuality |journal=Gender, Work, and Organization |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=319–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trautner |first=M. |year=2005 |title=Doing Gender, Doing Class: the Performance of Sexuality in Exotic Dance Clubs |journal=Gender and Society |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=771–788 |doi=10.1177/0891243205277253}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances frequently reflect the desires of a clientele which is mostly composed of heterosexual men. In the majority of cases, clients value women who they perceive as normatively feminine. For women sex workers, achieving this perception necessitates a performance of gender and (hetero)sexuality that involves deference to clients and affirmation of their [[masculinity]], as well as physical embodiment of traditional femininity.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis"&gt;Brewis, J., &amp; Linstead, S. ''Sex, Work and Sex Work'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional labor involved in sex work may be of a greater significance when race differences are involved. For instance Mistress Velvet, a black, femme [[dominatrix]] advertises herself using her most fetishized attributes. She makes her clients, who are mostly white cis males, read Black feminist theory before their sessions. This allows the clients to see why their participation, as white cis males, contributes to the fetishization of black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duberman|first1=Amanda|title=Meet The Dominatrix Who Requires The Men Who Hire Her To Read Black Feminist Theory|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mistress-velvet_us_5a822b50e4b00ecc923d4eba|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both within sex work and in other types of work, emotional labor is gendered in that women are expected to use it to construct performances of normative [[femininity]], whereas men are expected to use it to construct performances of normative masculinity.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt; In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. It fosters a better experience for the client and protects the worker thus enabling the worker to make the most profit.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sijuwade |first=P. |year=1996 |title=Counterfeit Intimacy: Dramaturgical Analysis of an Erotic Performance |journal=International Journal of Sociology of the Family |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=29–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sex workers often engage in emotional labor as a self-protection strategy, distancing themselves from the sometimes emotionally volatile work.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt; Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade" /&gt;

== Intimate relationships ==
A study in Melbourne, Australia found that sex workers typically experience relationship difficulties as a result of their line of work. This primarily stems from the issue of disclosure of their work in personal relationships. Some sex workers noted that dating ex-clients is helpful as they have had contact with sex workers and they are aware of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellhouse |first1=Clare |last2=Crebbin |first2=Susan |last3=Fairley |first3=Christopher K. |last4=Bilardi |first4=Jade E. |title=The Impact of Sex Work on Women’s Personal Romantic Relationships and the Mental Separation of Their Work and Personal Lives: A Mixed-Methods Study |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |website=PLOS ONE |accessdate=31 May 2018 |pages=e0141575 |language=en |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little empirical evidence characterizing clients of sex workers, but they may share an analogues problem. A Scientific American article on sex buyers summarises a limited field of research which indicates that Johns have a normal psychological profile matching the makeup of the wider male population, but view themselves as mentally unwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-buy-sex-2012-10-23|title=Why Do Men Buy Sex?|first=Nikolas|last=Westerhoff|date=1 October 2012|journal=Scientific American|volume=21|issue=2s|pages=60–65|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanbrain0512-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative studies indicate that repeat buyers become romantically attached and idealise sex workers of choice as their perfect partners.

=== Commodified intimacy ===
In clients' encounters with prostitutes or exotic dancers (and potentially other sex workers as well), many seek more than sexual satisfaction. They often seek, via their interactions with sex workers, an affirmation of their masculinity, which they may feel is lacking in other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; This affirmation comes in the form of (a simulation of) affection and sexual desire, and "smooth, intimate, affective space, wherein the way that time is managed is governed only by mutual desire and enjoyment."&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; Partly because they are engaged in work during these interactions, prostitutes' experience and interpretation of time tends to be structured instead by desires to maximize income, avoid boredom, and/or avoid detriment to self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt;

For sex workers, commodified intimacy provides different benefits. In Brazil, sex workers prioritize foreign men over local men in terms of forming intimate relationships with sex workers. This is a result of local men regarding sex workers as having no worth beyond their occupation. In contrast, foreign men are often accompanied by wealth and status, which are factors that can help a sex worker become independent. Hence sex workers in Brazil are more likely to seek out "ambiguous entanglements" with the foreign men they provide services for, rather than the local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Erica|title=Sex Tourism in Bahia: Ambiguous Entanglements|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252079443|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
Interviews with men and women escorts illuminate gender differences in these escorts' experiences.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; On average, women escorts charged much more than men.&lt;ref name="Fogg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://andrewfogg.com/2014/10/14/gender-differences-amongst-sex-workers-online/ | title=Gender differences amongst sex workers online | last=Fogg | first=A. | date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}} Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this disparity in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely than women to disclose their occupation.{{cn|date=September 2018}} This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients out of necessity, because the vast majority of clients are men.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt;

==Risks==
The potential risks sex work poses to the worker vary greatly depending on the specific job they occupy. Compared to outdoor or street-based sex workers, indoor workers are less likely to face violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krusi|first1=A|title=Negotiating safety and sexual risk reduction with clients in unsanctioned safer indoor sex work environments: a qualitative study|journal=Am J Public Health|date=Jun 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1154–9|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300638|pmid=22571708|pmc=3484819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street sex workers may also more likely to use addictive drugs, to have unprotected sex, and to be the victim of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; HIV affects large numbers of sex workers who engage in prostitution, of all genders, globally. Rape and violence, poverty, stigma, and social exclusion are all common risks faced by sex workers in many different occupations.&lt;ref name="Ditmore" /&gt; A study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04|title=Prostitution|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|pages=29|year=2008|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are also in a high risk of murder. According to Salfati's study, sex workers are 60 to 120 times more likely to be murdered than nonprostitute females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0886260507312946|pmid=18319375|title=Prostitute Homicides: A Descriptive Study|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=23|issue=4|pages=505|year=2008|last1=Salfati|first1=C. G.|last2=James|first2=A. R.|last3=Ferguson|first3=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these features tend to apply more to sex workers who engage in full service sex work, stigma and safety risks are pervasive for all types of sex work, albeit to different extents.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krusi|first1=A|title=Negotiating safety and sexual risk reduction with clients in unsanctioned safer indoor sex work environments: a qualitative study|journal=Am J Public Health|date=Jun 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1154–9|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300638|pmid=22571708|pmc=3484819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the varied legal status of some forms of sex work, sex workers in some countries also face the risk of incarceration.

==Feminist/liberalist debate==
{{POV-section|date=January 2017}}
Feminist debates on sex work (see [[Feminist views of pornography]] and [[Feminist views on prostitution|prostitution]]) focus primarily on pornography and prostitution. Feminist arguments against these occupations tend to be founded in the notion that these types of work are inherently degrading to women, perpetuate the sexual objectification of women, and/or perpetuate male supremacy.&lt;ref name="Dworkin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/aclu/dworkin/michlawjouri.html | title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy | last=Dworkin | first=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response, proponents of sex work argue that these claims deny women sex workers' agency, and that choosing to engage in this work can be empowering. They contend that the perspectives of anti-sex work feminists are based on notions of sexuality constructed by the patriarchy to regulate women's expressions sexuality.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell Davidson, J. ''Prostitution, Power, and Freedom.'' Polity Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many feminists who support the sex industry claim that criminalizing sex work causes more harm to women and their sexual autonomy. An article in the Touro Law Review 2014, focuses on the challenges faced by prostitutes in the U.S and the need for prostitution reform. "[By criminalizing prostitution] women lose the choice to get paid for having consensual sex. A woman may have sex for free, but once she receives something of value for her services, the act becomes illegal".&lt;ref&gt;Carrasquillo, Tesla. "Understanding Prostitution and the Need for Reform." Touro Law Review 30.3 (2014): 697-721. Ebscohost&lt;/ref&gt; Those who see this as an attack on a women's sexual autonomy also worry about the recent attacks on liberal social policy, such as same sex marriage and abortion on demand, in the U.S.  Paradoxically, liberals argue that since a disproportionate share of those who choose sex work as a means of income are the poor and disadvantaged, public officials should focus on social policies improving the lives of those choosing to do so rather than condemnation of the "private" means which those victims of society employ.&lt;ref name="Feministe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/29/7-key-american-sex-worker-activist-projects/ | title=Audacia Ray in Feministe "7 Key American Sex Worker Activist Projects"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debates on sex worker agency ===
The topic of sexual labor is often contextualized within opposing abolitionist and sex-positive perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|year=2015|title=Economies of Desire: Sexuality and the Sex Industry in the 21st Century|url=http://www.catherinehakim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EconomicAffairs-2015-Economies-of-Desire.pdf|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=35|pages=329–348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex|last=Bernstein|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionist perspective typically defines sex work as an oppressive form of labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comte|first=Jacqueline|year=2013|title=Decriminalization of Sex Work: Feminist Discourses in Light of Research|url=|journal=Sexuality and Culture|volume=|pages=196–217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to opponents of prostitution, it is not only the literal purchase of a person's body for sexual exploitation, it also constitutes exertion of power over women both symbolically and materially. This perspective views prostitution and trafficking as directly and intimately connected and therefore calls for the abolition of prostitution in efforts to eliminate the overall sexual exploitation of women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Opponents also refute the idea of consent among sex workers by claiming that such consent is merely a submissive acceptance of the traditional exploitation of women. For these reasons, opponents believe that the [[Decriminalizing sex work|decriminalization of sex work]] would utterly harm women as a class by maintaining their sexual and economic exploitation while "serving the interests of pimps, procurers and prostitutors".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sex-positive feminism|Sex positive feminists]] recognize sex workers as situated within a modern Western sexual hierarchy where a married man and woman are respected while transsexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, fetishists, and sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models are viewed as sexual deviants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|year=1984|title=Thinking Sex: Notes toward a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|url=|journal=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|volume=|pages=275–284|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sex positive feminists, sex law incorporates a prohibition against mixing sex and money in order to sustain this hierarchy. Therefore, the individuals who practice these "deviant" sexual acts are deemed as criminals and have limited institutional support and are subjected to economic sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sex-positive perspectives challenge this hierarchy by appreciating [[sexual diversity]] and rejecting any notion of "normal" sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Matters: Future Visions for a Sex-Positive Society|last=Windsor|first=Elroi|publisher=Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-93586-8|location=New York|pages=691–699|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this understanding, people who choose to engage in criminalized sex acts are seen as autonomous sexual beings rather than victims of the sex industry. For black women, agency is viewed as contextual due to historical considerations, and can be regarded as one facet of a complex system of ideals that encompass black women's sexuality over time. One result of this is the way that race relations impact the mobility of black people in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller-Young|first1=Mireille|title=A Taste for Brown Sugar, Black Women in Pornography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4_uBQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Duke University Press Book|isbn=978-0822358282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal feminists believe that a "democratic morality" should judge sexual activity (as if the proclivities of the majority, as well as their proficiency in providing sexual pleaure(s), should determine the direction of a society's moral compass) "by the way partners treat one another, the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They propound that it should not be an ethical concern whether sex acts are coupled or in groups, same or mixed sex, with or without consensual acts of violence or video, commercial or free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Solar physics''' is the branch of astrophysics that specializes in the study of the [[Sun]]. It deals with detailed measurements that are possible only for our closest star.  It intersects with many disciplines of pure [[physics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[computer science]], including [[fluid dynamics]], [[plasma physics]] including [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[seismology]], [[particle physics]], [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[stellar evolution]], [[space physics]], [[spectroscopy]], [[radiative transfer]], [[optics|applied optics]], [[signal processing]], [[computer vision]], [[computational physics]], [[stellar physics]] and [[solar astronomy]].

Because the Sun is uniquely situated for close-range observing (other stars cannot be resolved with anything like the spatial or temporal resolution that the Sun can), there is a split between the related discipline of observational astrophysics (of distant stars) and observational solar physics.

The study of solar physics is also important as it is believed that changes in the solar atmosphere and solar activity can have a major impact on Earth's climate. The Sun also provides a "physical laboratory" for the study of plasma physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solar Physics|first=Marshall Space Flight Center|title=Why we study the Sun|url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/whysolar.shtml|work=NASA|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
Babylonians were keeping a record of solar eclipses, with the oldest record originating from the ancient city of Ugarit, in modern-day Syria. This record dates to about 1300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littman|first=M.|title=Totality: Eclipses of the Sun|date=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=2nd|author2=Willcox, F |author3=Espenak, F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Chinese astronomers were also observing solar phenomena (such as solar eclipses and visible sunspots) with the purpose of keeping track of calendars, which were based on lunar and solar cycles. Unfortunately, records kept before 720 BC are very vague and offer no useful information. However, after 720 BC, 37 solar eclipses were noted over the course of 240 years.&lt;ref name="ancient china"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sten|first=Odenwald|title=Ancient eclipses in China|url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2009eclipse/ancienteclipses.php|work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
Astronomical knowledge flourished in the Islamic world during medieval times. Many observatories were built in cities from Damascus to Baghdad, where detailed astronomical observations were taken. Particularly, a few solar parameters were measured and detailed observations of the Sun were taken. Solar observations were taken with the purpose of navigation, but mostly for timekeeping. Islam requires its followers to pray five times a day, at specific position of the Sun in the sky. As such, accurate observations of the Sun and its trajectory on the sky were needed. In the late 10th century, Iranian astronomer [[al-Khujandi|Abu-Mahmud Khojandi]] built a massive observatory near Tehran. There, he took accurate measurements of a series of meridian transits of the Sun, which he later used to calculate the obliquity of the ecliptic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab and Islamic astronomy|url=http://www.starteachastronomy.com/arab.html|work=StarTeach Astronomy Education|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe was cut from all sources of ancient scientific knowledge, especially those written in Greek. This, plus de-urbanisation and diseases such as the Black Death led to a decline in scientific knowledge in Medieval Europe, especially in the early Middle Ages. During this period, observations of the Sun were taken either in relation to the zodiac, or to assist in building places of worship such as churches and cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Portal to the heritage of astronomy|title=Theme: medieval astronomy in Europe|url=http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-theme?idtheme=16|work=UNESCO|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance period===
In astronomy, the renaissance period started with the work of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He proposed that planets revolve around the Sun and not around the Earth, as it was believed at the time. This model is known as the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor Redd|first=Nola|title=Nicolaus Copernicus biography: facts &amp; discoveries|url=http://www.space.com/15684-nicolaus-copernicus.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was later expanded by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. Particularly, Galilei used his new telescope to look at the Sun. In 1610, he discovered sunspots on its surface. In the autumn of 1611, [[Johannes Fabricius]] wrote the first book on sunspots, "De Maculis in Sole Observatis" (On the spots observed in the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunspots|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/sunspots.html|work=The Galileo Project|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
Modern day solar physics is focused towards understanding the many phenomena observed with the help of modern telescopes and satellites. Of particular interest are the structure of the solar photosphere, the coronal heat problem and sunspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Pinghzi|title=Solar physics research trends|date=2008|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royEo2yT9XMC&amp;pg=PA358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The [[Solar Physics Division]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]] boasts 555 members (as of May 2007), compared to several thousand in the parent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Solar Physics Division|title=Membership|url=http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|work=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=28 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013145/http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major thrust of current (2009) effort in the field of solar physics is integrated understanding of the entire [[solar system]] including the Sun and its effects throughout interplanetary space within the [[heliosphere]] and on [[planet]]s and planetary [[atmosphere]]s. Studies of phenomena that affect multiple systems in the heliosphere, or that are considered to fit within a heliospheric context, are called [[heliophysics]], a new coinage that entered  usage in the early years of the current millennium.

This article is about the concept in biology. For the concept in physics, see [[Symmetry breaking]].

'''Symmetry breaking''' is the process by which uniformity is broken, or the number of points to view invariance are reduced, to generate a more structured and improbable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Rong|author2=Bruce Bowerman |title=Symmetry Breaking in Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003475|pmid=20300216|pages=a003475|pmc=2829966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, symmetry breaking is the event where symmetry along a particular axis is lost to establish a polarity.  [[Cell polarity|Polarity]] is a measure for a biological system to distinguish poles along an axis.  This measure is important because it is the first step to building complexity.  For example, during organismal development, one of the first steps for the embryo is to distinguish its [[Ventral#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal-ventral axis]].  The symmetry-breaking event that occurs here will determine which end of this axis will be the ventral side, and which end will be the dorsal side.  Once this distinction is made, then all the structures that are located along this axis can develop at the proper location.  As an example, during human development, the embryo needs to establish where is ‘back’ and where is ‘front’ before complex structures, such as the spine and lungs, can develop in the right location (where the lungs is placed ‘in front’ of the spine).  This relationship between symmetry breaking and complexity was articulated by [[P.W. Anderson]].  He speculated that increasing levels of broken symmetry in many-body systems correlates with increasing complexity and functional specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|year=1972|volume=177|issue=4047|pages=393–396|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a biological perspective, the more complex an organism is, the higher number of symmetry-breaking events can be found.  Without symmetry breaking, building complexity in organisms would be very difficult.

The importance of symmetry breaking in biology is also reflected in the fact that it’s found at all scales.  Symmetry breaking can be found at the macromolecular level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Fei|title=The Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Cell Polarity and Chemotaxis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002980|pmid=20066099|pages=a002980|pmc=2773618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the subcellular level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Jonathan|title=Cellular Polarity in Prokaryotic Organisms|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=6|pmid=20457568|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003368|pages=a003368|pmc=2882128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and even at the tissues and organ level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=James W.|title=Remodeling epithelial cell organization: Transitions between front-rear and apical-basal polarity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000513|pages=a000513|pmc=2742086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s also interesting to note that most asymmetry on a higher scale is a reflection of symmetry breaking on a lower scale.  Cells first need to establish a polarity through a symmetry-breaking event before tissues and organs themselves can be polar.  For example, one model proposes that left-right body axis asymmetry in vertebrates is determined by asymmetry of [[Cilium|cilia]] rotation during early development, which will produces a constant, unidirectional flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babu|first=Deepak|author2=Sudipto Roy |title=Left–right asymmetry: cilia stir up new surprises in the node|journal=Open Biology|year=2013|volume=3|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=A.

There are several examples of symmetry breaking that are currently being studied.  One of the most studied examples is the cortical rotation during ''Xenopus'' development, where this rotation acts as the symmetry-breaking event that determines the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo.  This example is discussed in more detail below.
&lt;br&gt;Another example that involves symmetry breaking is the establishment of dendrites and axon during [[neuron]] development, and the PAR protein network in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. It is thought that a protein called shootin-1 determines which outgrowth in neurons eventually becomes the axon, at it does this by breaking symmetry and accumulating in only one outgrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toriyama|first=Michinori|author2=Tadayuki Shimada |author3=Ki Bum Kim |author4=Mari Mitsuba |author5=Eiko Nomura |author6=Kazuhiro Katsuta |author7=Yuichi Sakumura |author8=Peter Roepstorff |author9=Naoyuki Inagaki  |title=Shootin1: A protein involved in the organization of an asymmetric signal for neuronal polarization|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=2006|volume=175|issue=1|pages=147–157 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200604160 |pmid=17030985 |pmc=2064506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PAR protein network works under similar mechanisms, where the certain PAR proteins, which are initially homogenous throughout the cell, break their symmetry and are segregated to different ends of the zygote to establish a polarity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motegi|first=Fumio|author2=Geraldine Seydoux |title=The PAR network: redundancy and robustness in a symmetry-breaking system|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=2013|volume=368|issue=1629|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0010|pages=20130010|pmc=3785961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cortical Rotation==
'''Cortical rotation''' is a phenomenon that seems to be limited to ''Xenopus'' and few ancient [[Teleostei|teleosts]], however the underlying mechanisms of cortical rotation have conserved elements that are found in other [[chordate]]s.  Research in this area is on-going and changes to the model described below are to be expected.
In fact, the origin of asymmetry in cell division, cell polarity and the mechanism that breaks the symmetry continue to be topics of intense research.  Since the early 1990s, many discoveries have been made leading to a sound model of the mechanism for symmetry breaking.  This article will focus solely on symmetry breaking in the ''[[Xenopus]]'' embryo, an animal model that has wide application.

A sperm can bind a ''Xenopus'' egg at any position of the pigmented animal hemisphere; however once bound this position then determines the dorsal side of the animal.  The dorsal side of the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is always directly opposite the [[sperm]] entry point.  The reason being the sperm's [[centriole]] acts as an organizing center for the egg’s [[microtubule]]s. While this observation has been known for quite some time, the question of how all of this works is more complicated.  The molecular mechanisms driving dorsal-ventral asymmetry are a fine example of simplicity and complexity inherent in biology.

==Molecular mechanisms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Xenopus cortical rotation.jpg|thumb|Schematic of ''Xenopus'' embryo showing some of the molecular mechanisms during cortical rotation.  The sperm centriole acts as a (-) end organizer for microtubules in the cytoplasm of the embryo.  The microtubules grow outward toward the plus end and interact with an area of the embryo call the cortex, which has microtubules that organize (+ end) in the direction of the cortical rotation.  The cortex and cytoplasm are differentiated by density, as the cytoplasm contains the dense yolk of the embryo.
During cortical rotation, microtubules are linked via kinesin motors to elements within the cortex (which are linked to the plasma membrane) and the movement along the microtubules allow the kinesin motors to physically shift the cortex.  This alone does not explain dorsal-ventral axis development, as it has been shown to occur without polymerized microtubules, thus movement of these dorsal-determining elements can occur independent of the cortical microtubule array.  These elements, a signalosome which incompasses Dsh, Wnt 11 (mRNA), β-catenin (mRNA), Fz-7, GSK3, likely occur together in vessicles. VegT acts with Wnt 11 at the dorsal side to activate Xnr1 and Nodal genes that propagate development. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
A series of experiments utilizing UV irradiation, cold temperature and pressure (all of which cause microtubule depolymerization) demonstrated that without polymerized microtubules cortical rotation did not occur and resulted in a mutant ventral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhart J, Danilchik M, Doniach T, Roberts S, Rowning B, Stewart R |title=Cortical rotation of the ''Xenopus'' egg: consequences for the anteroposterior pattern of embryonic dorsal development |journal=Development |volume=107 |issue=Suppl |pages=37–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2699856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study also revealed that mutant phenotype could be rescued (returned to normal) by physically turning the embryo, thus mimicking cortical rotation and demonstrating that microtubules were not the determinant of dorsal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(80)90082-2 |vauthors=Scharf SR, Gerhart JC |title=Determination of the dorsal-ventral axis in eggs of ''Xenopus laevis'': complete rescue of UV-impaired eggs by oblique orientation before first cleavage |journal=Dev.

To identify these elements, researchers looked for mRNA and protein that demonstrated localization to either the vegetal pole or the dorsal side of the embryo to find candidates.  The early candidates for the determinant were β-catenin and disheveled (Dsh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heasman J, Crawford A, Goldstone K, Garner-Hamrick P, Gumbiner B, McCrea P, Kintner C, Noro CY, Wylie C |title=Overexpression of cadherins and underexpression of beta-catenin inhibit dorsal mesoderm induction in early ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=79 |issue= 5|pages=791–803 |year=1994 |pmid=7528101 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90069-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.146.2.427 |vauthors=Miller JR, Rowning BA, Larabell CA, Yang-Snyder JA, Bates RL, Moon RT |title=Establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in ''Xenopus'' embryos coincides with the dorsal enrichment of dishevelled that is dependent on cortical rotation |journal=J.

The Dsh protein was fused to a GFP and tracked during cortical rotation, it was observed to be in vesicles that were couriered along microtubules to the dorsal side.  This led researchers to look into other candidates of the Wnt pathway.  Wnt 11 was found to be located specifically at the vegetal pole prior to cortical rotation and is moved to the dorsal side where it activates the [[wnt signaling pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tao Q, Yokota C, Puck H, Kofron M, Birsoy B, Yan D, Asashima M, Wylie CC, Lin X, Heasman J |title=Maternal wnt11 activates the canonical wnt signaling pathway required for axis formation in ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue= 6|pages=857–71 |year=2005 |pmid=15797385 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT, a T-box transcription factor, is localized to the vegetal cortex and upon cortical rotation is released in a gradient fashion into the embryo to regulate mesoderm development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang J, King ML |title=''Xenopus'' VegT RNA is localized to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis and encodes a novel T-box transcription factor involved in mesodermal patterning |journal=Development |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=4119–29 |date=December 1996 |pmid=9012531 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9012531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT activates Wnt expression, so while not acted on or moved during cortical rotation, it is active in dorsal-ventral axis formation.

The question still remains, how are these molecules being moved to the dorsal side?  This is still not completely known, however evidence suggests that microtubule bundles within the cortex are interacting with kinesin (plus-end directed) motors to become organized into parallel arrays within the cortex and this motion of the motors is the cause of the rotation of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marrari Y, Rouviere C, Houliston E |title=Complementary roles for dynein and kinesins in the ''Xenopus'' egg cortical rotation |journal=Dev Biol |volume=271 |issue= 1|pages=38–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15196948 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also unclear is whether Wnt 11 is the main dorsal determinant or is β-catenin also required, as these two molecules have both been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for dorsal development.  This along with all of the other factors are important for activating Nodal genes that propagate normal dorsoventral development.

'''Translation''' as a [[rhetorical device]] is a form of [[parody]], where a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] [[paraphrase]] of a source quotation is given to mock its author; to enhance the [[irony]], it is furthermore stated that the version being given is merely a translation into the speaker's language, implying that the original speaker was unduly obscure or [[Monologue|ranting]]. Given the nature of [[Usenet]] forums, parodic translation is prevalent in [[flame wars]], where remarks such as "Translation: 'I do not have a clue and am throwing mud'" are used to imply &amp;mdash; on very little ground &amp;mdash; that another poster is not making any appreciable contribution to the subject.

Unlike other forms of parody, translation has a relatively recent history; early usages of the device can be seen in the work of the Viennese literary critic and journalist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]],  who claimed to translate from other journalists' &amp;mdash; famously former friend [[Maximilian Harden|Harden]] &amp;mdash; and from ''Moskauderwelch'' &amp;mdash; a derisive term for the highly elaborate [[Marxist]] [[jargon]] of the time, a pun on ''Moskau'', Moscow, and ''Kauderwelch'', gibberish. Kraus' influence is notable in [[Karl Popper]]; while translation of scientific theories into [[principle of verification|verificationist]] terms had been a standard procedure in [[logical positivism]] for some time, Popper's criticism of several philosophers and scientists that failed to comply with his notion of the [[scientific method]] took a mocking quality reminiscent of the former.

==History==
In 1904 [[John Garstang]] established the Institute of Archaeology, the first centre for the academic study of the methods and practice of [[Archaeology]] alongside [[Egyptology]] and [[Classical Archaeology]] in the UK. [[Robert Carr Bosanquet]] taught at the University of Liverpool from 1906 to 1920 as the first holder of the Chair of Classical Archaeology. [[John Percival Postgate]] served as Professor of Latin at the University from 1909 to 1920 while [[Frank William Walbank]] was Rathbone Professor of Ancient History and Classical Archaeology from 1951 to 1977. Other notable academics who laid the foundations for excellence in the study of archaeology and ancient civilisations at Liverpool include [[Alan Ralph Millard]] (Rankin Professor Emeritus of Hebrew and Ancient Semitic languages), [[Elizabeth Slater]] (Garstang Professor of Archaeology and Dean of the Faculty of Arts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Emeritus Professor Elizabeth Slater|url=https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2014/09/25/in-memoriam-emeritus-professor-elizabeth-slater/|website=University of Liverpool News|publisher=University of Liverpool|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Kitchen]] (Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and Honorary Research Fellow), Christopher B. Mee (Charles W. Jones Professor of Classical Archaeology)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halstead|first1=Paul|title=Christopher B. Mee|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/tributes/mee.html|website=Antiquity Journal|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Davies (Rathbone Professor Emeritus of Ancient History and Classical Archaeology and Honorary Senior Fellow).

At present, members of the Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology engage in interdisciplinary research in the fields of Old World prehistory (particularly of [[Southwest Asia]], [[Mediterranean Europe]] and [[Africa]]), [[human evolution]] and [[palaeoanthropology]], [[bioarchaeology]], [[environmental archaeology]], archaeomaterials, [[Egyptology]], the archaeology, languages, history and cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] and the [[Mediterranean]], later [[British prehistory]], [[heritage management]], medieval &amp; post-medieval archaeology, and the history, literature, language, culture and post-antique receptions of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Since 2010 the Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology has been part of the School of Histories, Languages and Cultures, one of the four Schools in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The School also includes the departments of History, Modern Languages &amp; Cultures, Irish Studies and Politics.

In the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]] 100% of Liverpool’s research in Archaeology and 94% in Classics were judged as internationally outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REF2014|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByUoa/17|website=UoA 17 - Geography, Environmental Studies and Archaeology|publisher=REF2014|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REF2014|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByUoa/31|website=UoA 31 - Classics|publisher=REF2014|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major focus of the departmental research, teaching and outreach activities is the Garstang Museum of Archaeology, one of the most important collections of antiquities in the UK including objects excavated in Egypt, the Aegean, Anatolia, the Levant, Sudan and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garstang Museum of Archaeology|url=https://garstangmuseum.wordpress.com/|website=Garstang Museum of Archaeology|publisher=University of Liverpool|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the department's science-based archaeology facilities were substantially expanded, with the establishment of the Elizabeth Slater Archaeology Research Laboratories. These facilities support research by staff and students on stable isotopes and palaeodiet, human remains, anthracology and archaeobotany, archaeozoology, archaeomaterials, lithics and ceramics, experimental archaeology, post-excavation analysis and GIS applications in archaeology.

'''Woz U''' is a tech education platform launched by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] that focuses on both students and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/steve-wozniak-announces-tech-education-platform-woz-u/|title=Steve Wozniak announces tech education platform Woz U|last=Crook|first=Jordan|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woz U is Arizona-based with plans to launch physical locations for learning in more than 30 cities across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171013005008/en/Apple-Co-Founder-Steve-Wozniak-Forms-Woz-Reprogram|title=Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Forms 'Woz U' to Reprogram Tech Education, Address Skills Gap|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16474170/apple-steve-wozniak-woz-u-launch-tech-education-online-university|title=Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak launches his own online tech education platform|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/steve-wozniak-created-online-university/|title=Steve Wozniak just created his own online university|work=Engadget|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the company is registered in Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=885230|title=WOZ U EDUCATION LLC  - Arizona Corporations Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=ecorp.azcc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it works through its Texas-based partner, [[Southern Careers Institute|Southern Careers Institute.]] Less than a week after the launch announcement, the company came under scrutiny by state regulators about the lack of state accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2017/10/18/woz-u-arizona-state-regulators-have-questions-key-paperwork-unfinished/773509001/|title=Woz U: AZ state regulators have questions, key paperwork unfinished|last=Jeong|first=Yihyun|date=2017-10-18|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-10-13|last2=Ryman|first2=Anne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date. One student described the 33-week online program as "a $13,000 e-book". A former "enrollment counselor" described a high-pressure sales environment, which the company denied. In a prepared statement, Woz U president Chris Coleman admitted the documentation errors and said quality control efforts were being implemented, and said curriculum was reviewed by Wozniak. The founder declined interview requests, then dodged a reporter's unannounced appearance at a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woz-u-steve-wozniak-former-students-employees-raise-concerns/|title=Some former students, employees say Apple co-founder's Woz U doesn't live up to promises|last=|first=|date=2018-10-01|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniaks-woz-u-is-a-13000-e-book-former-students-say/|title=Steve Wozniak’s Woz U is 'a $13,000 e-book,' former students say|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|date=2018-10-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
