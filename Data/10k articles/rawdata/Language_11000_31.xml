In [[abstract algebra]], '''Abhyankar's conjecture''' is a 1957 [[conjecture]] of [[Shreeram Abhyankar]], on the [[Galois group]]s of [[algebraic function field]]s of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Abhyankar |first=Shreeram |year=1957 |title=Coverings of Algebraic Curves |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=825–856 |doi=10.2307/2372438 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Serre | first=Jean-Pierre | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Construction de revêtements étales de la droite affine en caractéristique p | language=French | zbl=0726.14021 | journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série I | volume=311 | number=6 | pages=341–346 | year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of [[Michel Raynaud]] and [[David Harbater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michel |last=Raynaud |title=Revêtements de la droite affine en caractéristique p &gt; 0 |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=116 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=425–462 | doi=10.1007/BF01231568 | zbl=0798.14013 |bibcode=1994InMat.116..425R }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Harbater |year=1994 |title=Abhyankar's conjecture on Galois groups over curves |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 | doi=10.1007/BF01232232 | zbl=0805.14014 |bibcode=1994InMat.117....1H }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FJ70&gt;{{citation | last1=Fried | first1=Michael D. | last2=Jarden | first2=Moshe | title=Field arithmetic | edition=3rd | series=Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3. Folge | volume=11 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-3-540-77269-9 | zbl=1145.12001 | page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem involves a [[finite group]] ''G'', a [[prime number]] ''p'', and the [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of nonsingular integral [[algebraic curve]] ''C'' defined over an [[algebraically closed]] [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' of characteristic ''p''.

The question addresses the existence of [[Galois extension]]s ''L'' of ''K''(''C''), with ''G'' as Galois group, and with restricted [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramification]]. From a geometric point of view ''L'' corresponds to another curve ''C''&amp;prime;, and a [[morphism]]

:π : ''C''&amp;prime; → ''C''.

Ramification geometrically, and by analogy with the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, consists of a finite set ''S'' of points ''x'' on ''C'', such that π restricted to the complement of ''S'' in ''C'' is an [[étale morphism]]. In Abhyankar's conjecture, ''S'' is fixed, and the question is what ''G'' can be. This is therefore a special type of [[inverse Galois problem]].

The subgroup ''p''(''G'') is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the [[Sylow subgroup]]s of ''G'' for the prime number ''p''. This is a [[normal subgroup]], and the parameter ''n'' is defined as the minimum number of generators of

:''G''/''p''(''G'').

Then for the case of ''C'' the [[projective line]] over ''K'', the conjecture states that ''G'' can be realised as a Galois group of ''L'', unramified outside ''S'' containing ''s'' + 1 points,  if and only if

:''n'' ≤ ''s''.

This was proved by Raynaud.

For the general case, proved by Harbater, let ''g'' be the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] of ''C''. Then ''G'' can be realised if and only if

:''n'' ≤ ''s'' + 2 ''g''.

{{Other uses|Abomination (disambiguation){{!}}Abomination}}
'''Abomination''' (from [[Latin]] ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#abdominare|abominare]]'', "to deprecate as an ill omen") is an [[English language|English]] term used to translate the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical Hebrew]] terms '''shiqquts''' שיקוץ and '''sheqets''' שקץ,&lt;ref&gt;Stone Edition Chumash {{ISBN|1-57819-107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are derived from '''shâqats''', or the terms תֹּועֵבָה, '''tōʻēḇā''' or '''to'e'va''' (noun) or '''ta'ev''' (verb).  An abomination in English is that which is exceptionally loathsome, [[hate]]ful, [[sin]]ful, [[evil|wicked]], or vile.

The Biblical words usually translated as "abomination" do not always convey the same sense of moral exceptionalism as the English term does today, as it often may signify that which is forbidden or unclean according to the religion (especially ''sheqets''). Linguistically in this case, it may be closer in meaning to the Polynesian term [[taboo]] or ''tapu'', signifying that which is forbidden, and should not be eaten, and or not touched, and which sometimes was a capital crime. The word most often translated "abomination" to denote grave moral offenses is ''Tōʻēḇā.'' This article examines the term as it is used in English translations of the [[Bible]], and also the actual senses of the words which are being translated into this term in English.&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew/English dictionaries.  Strong's Concordance of the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''shiqquts'' is translated ''abomination'' by almost all translations of the Bible.  The similar words, ''sheqets'', and ''shâqats'', are almost exclusively used for dietary violations.

The common but slighty different Hebrew term, ''tōʻēḇā'', is also translated as ''abomination'' in the [[Authorized King James Version]], and sometimes in the [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]].  Many modern versions of the Bible (including the [[New International Version|NIV]] and [[New English Translation|NET]]) translate it ''detestable''; the [[New American Bible|NAB]] translates it ''loathsome''.  It is mainly used to denote idolatry; and in many other cases it refers to inherently [[evil]]&lt;ref&gt;"inherently evil":  things, words, deeds which ''of their very nature'' ["[[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic property]]"] are always harmful, degrading, debasing, dehumanizing or lethal to the human person (but frequently deemed by some opportunists to be most useful and convenient, thinking "the end always justifies the means") and which,by extension, are always harmful and eventually lethal to the nature and stability of human culture and society--"evil".  Biblical references:  Leviticus 18:6-30; Leviticus 20.  Deuteronomy 12:29-31; 23:17-19; 25:13-16; 27:16-25.  Compare Romans 1:23; 3:8; 13:9-10; Galatians 5:19-21.&lt;/ref&gt; things such as illicit sex, lying, murder, deceit, etc.; and for unclean foods.

Another word which can signify that which is abhorred is '''zâ‛am'''. There are less used Hebrew words with a similar conveyance, as well as Greek terms for such.

__TOC__

==Analysis of the term==

===Shiqquts===
''Shiqquts'' is used in the following ways:

# In Daniel's prophecies in {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:31|NIV}} (cf. 12:11), it is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that were to fall on the [[Jew]]s in the time of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], saying "And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate."  Jerome, and most of the Christian fathers, suppose that the reference is to Antiochus as the type of Antichrist, and that the description passes from the type to the antitype.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Idolatry is presented as the chief [[sin]] in the Bible, and shiqquts is often used to describe such.
# In his campaign of [[Hellenistic|Hellenization]], [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] caused an altar to be erected on the altar for burnt-offerings of the [[Second Temple]], on which pig sacrifices were offered to [[Zeus]] [[Mount Olympus|Olympios]]. (Comp. [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Maccabees#Chapter 1|1 Maccabees 1:54]]). Following the wording of {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:27|NIV}}, this may have been the [[abomination of desolation]] of [[Jerusalem]].
&lt;!-- UNSOURCED STATEMENT FROM August 2008 *** # In {{bibleverse||Matthew|24:15|NIV}}, the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the Temple (70 AD), and to which they paid homage. "Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} These ensigns were an "abomination" to the Jews, the "abomination of desolation." *** --&gt;
#sinful sacrifices ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|66:3|NIV}})
#idolatry ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|29:17|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|20:7,8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||1Kings|11:5-7|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|13:27|KJV}})
#witchcraft ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:24|KJV}})

The word ''sheqets'' is used with eating:
#seafood that lacks fins and scales ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:10-12|NASB}})
#all insects except for locust, crickets and grasshoppers ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:20-23|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:41|NASB}})
#eagles, [[ossifrage]], and the osprey ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13|KJV}})
other biblically [[unclean animals]] or touching certain things,({{bibleverse||Leviticus|7:21|NASB}})

''Shâqats'' is rendered in the KJV as follows:

#abominable ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:43|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:25|KJV}})
#abomination ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:11|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13|KJV}})
#abhorred ({{bibleverse||Psalms|22:24|KJV}})
#detest ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:26|KJV}})

===Tōʻēḇā===
''Tōʻēḇā'' is used in the following ways:

#Every [[shepherd]] was "an abomination" unto the [[Egyptians]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|46:34|NASB}}).
# [[Pharaoh]] was so moved by the [[Plagues of Egypt|fourth plague]], that while he refused the demand of [[Moses]], he offered a compromise, granting to the [[Israelites]] permission to hold their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not be accepted, because [[Moses]] said they would have to sacrifice "the abomination of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|8:26|NASB}}); i.e., the cow or ox, which all the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held as sacred and so regarded as [[sacrilegious]] to kill.
#{{bibleverse||Proverbs|6:16-19|NASB}} lists seven things which are also abominations: "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, a false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers."

''Tōʻēḇā'' is also used in Jewish (and Christian Old Testament) scriptures to refer to:

#[[idolatry]] or idols ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:25|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|13:14|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|44:19|NASB}})
#illicit sex (e.g prostitution, adultery, incest) ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:22,58|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|22:11|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|33:26|NASB}})
#illicit marriage ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:2-4|NASB}})
#male [[prostitution]] and/or other [[Gay|male homosexual acts]] (see [[Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible]]) ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:27-30|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|NASB}})
#[[temple prostitution]] ({{bibleverse||1Kings|14:24|KJV}})
#offerings from the above ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:18|NASB}})
#[[child sacrifice]] to Molech ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|32:35|KJV}})
#[[cross-dressing]] ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:5|NASB}})
#cheating in the market by using rigged weights ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:13-19|NASB}}, {{bibleverse||Proverbs|11:1|NAS}})
#dishonesty ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|12:22|NASB}})
#dietary violations ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:3|KJV}})
#stealing, murder, and adultery, breaking covenants ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:9,10|KJV}})
# [[usury]], violent robbery, murder, oppressing the poor and needy, etc. ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|18:10-13|KJV}})

''Tâ‛ab'' is rendered the following ways in the KJV

#abhor, 9 Deu_7:26, Deu_23:7 (2), Job_9:31, Job_30:10, Psa_5:6, Psa_119:163, Amo_5:10, Mic_3:9;
#abominable, 6 1Ch_21:6, Job_15:16, Psa_53:1 (2), Isa_14:19, Eze_16:52;
#abhorred, 3 Job_19:19, Psa_106:40, Eze_16:25;
#abhorreth, 2 Psa_107:18, Isa_49:7;
#abominably, 1 1Ki_21:26;
#committed, 1 Eze_16:52.

'''Adverse''' or '''adverse interest''', in [[law]], is anything that functions contrary to a [[party (law)|party]]'s [[interest]]. This word should not be confused with [[wikt:averse|averse]].

==Adverse possession==
In [[property]] law, [[adverse possession]] refers to an interest in real property which is contrary to the in-fact owner of the property.  For example, an [[easement]] may permit some amount of access to property which might otherwise constitute a [[trespass]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}
{{primary|date=February 2018}}
Publishers have different conventions regarding the '''capitalization of ''Internet''''' versus '''''internet''''', when referring to ''the'' [[Internet]], as distinct from generic [[internetworking|internet]]s, or internetworks.

Since the widespread deployment of the [[Internet protocol suite]] in the 1980s, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), the [[Internet Society]], the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), the [[W3C]], and others have consistently spelled the name of the worldwide network, the Internet, with an initial [[capital letter]] and treated it as a [[proper noun]] in the English language; the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes that the global network is usually "the Internet", and most of the historical sources it cites use the capitalized form (in one case "the DARPA internet").&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the transformation of the [[ARPANET]] into the modern Internet, the term ''internet'' in its lower case spelling was a common short form of the term [[internetwork]], and this spelling and use may still be found in discussions of networking.

The spelling "internet" has become commonly used, as the word virtually always refers to the global network; the generic sense of the word has become rare.

In some of the first printed mentions of the Internet, like many other US government projects of the period, it was referred to in [[all caps]] as INTERNET, despite not being an acronym.&lt;ref name="The History of the Internet, Typography Division, Cont’d"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Post|first1=David|title=The History of the Internet, Typography Division, Cont’d|url=http://volokh.com/2013/11/12/history-internet-typography-division-contd/|website=[[Volokh Conspiracy]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Internet versus generic internets==
The Internet standards community historically differentiated between ''the'' [[Internet]] and ''an'' [[internetworking|internet]] (or internetwork), treating the former as a [[proper noun]] with a capital letter, and the latter as a [[common noun]] with lower-case first letter. An internet is any internetwork or set of inter-connected [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks. The distinction is evident in [[Request for Comments]] documents from the early 1980s, when the transition from the ARPANET to the Internet was in progress, although it was not applied with complete uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 871 (1982) "The 'network' composed of the concatenation of such subnets is sometimes called 'a catenet,' though more often—and less picturesquely—merely 'an internet.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 872 (1982) "[TCP's] next most significant property is that it is designed to operate in a 'catenet' (also known as the, or an, 'internet')"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example from that period is IBM's ''TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview'' ({{ISBN|0-7384-2165-0}}) from 1989, which stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The words internetwork and internet is {{sic}} simply a contraction of the phrase interconnected network. However, when written with a capital "I," the Internet refers to the worldwide set of interconnected networks. Hence, the Internet is an internet, but the reverse does not apply. The Internet is sometimes called the connected internet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Request for Comments]] documents that define the evolving Internet Protocol standards, the term was introduced as a [[noun adjunct]], apparently a shortening of "internetworking"&lt;ref&gt;The form first occurring in the RFC series is "internetworking protocol", RFC 604: "Four of the reserved link numbers are hereby assigned for experimental use in the testing of an internetworking protocol." The first use of "internet" is in RFC 675, in the form "internet packet".&lt;/ref&gt; and is mostly used in this way.

As the [[wikt:impetus|impetus]] behind IP grew, it became more common to regard the results of internetworking as entities of their own, and ''internet'' became a noun, used both in a generic sense (any collection of computer networks connected through internetworking) and in a specific sense (the collection of computer networks that internetworked with ARPANET, and later [[National Science Foundation Network | NSFNET]], using the IP standards, and that grew into the connectivity service we know today).

In its generic sense, ''internet'' is a common noun, a synonym for [[internetwork]]; therefore, it has a plural form (first appearing in the RFC series RFC 870, RFC 871 and RFC 872) and is not capitalized.

In a [[Morris Worm|1991 court case]], Judge [[Jon O. Newman]] used it as a mass noun: "[[Robert Tappan Morris|Morris]] released the [[Morris worm|worm]] into INTERNET, which is a group of national networks that connect university, governmental, and military computers around the country."&lt;ref name="The History of the Internet, Typography Division, Cont’d" /&gt;

==Argument for common noun usage==
In 2002 a ''New York Times'' column said that ''Internet'' has been changing from a proper noun to a generic term.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz |first=John |title=Who Owns the Internet? You and i Do |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/weekinreview/29SCHW.html |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=29 December 2002 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |quote=Allan M. Siegal, a co-author of The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage and an assistant managing editor at the newspaper, said that 'there is some virtue in the theory' that Internet is becoming a generic term, 'and it would not be surprising to see the lowercase usage eclipse the uppercase within a few years.' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417131137/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/weekinreview/29SCHW.html |archivedate=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Words for new technologies, such as ''phonograph'' in the 19th century, are sometimes capitalized at first, later becoming uncapitalized.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; In 1999 another column said that ''Internet'' might, like some other commonly used proper nouns, lose its capital letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Wilbers | title=Errors put a wall between you and your readers | work=Orange County Register | location=Santa Ana, California | date=13 September 1999 | page=c.20 | quote=If you like being ahead of the game, you might prefer to spell internet and web as internet and web, but according to standard usage they should be capitalized. Keep in mind, however, that commonly used proper nouns sometimes lose their capital letters over time and that Internet and Web may someday go the way of the french fry. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalization of the word as an adjective also varies. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective, e.g., "internet resources".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web|title=MIT Libraries House Style |url=http://libstaff.mit.edu/publications/housestyle.html |work=MIT Libraries Staff Web |publisher= |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426122506/http://libstaff.mit.edu/publications/housestyle.html |archivedate=26 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument for proper noun usage==
According to English capitalization rules, all proper nouns should be capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lukyanchuk|first1=Marina|title=Capitalization|url=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-rules/|website=Grammarly.com|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is only one global "Internet", when one speaks about the Internet itself, it should be capitalized.

==Usage examples==
Examples of media publications and news outlets that capitalize the term include ''[[Time (magazine) | Time]]'', the [[United States Government Printing Office]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-6.htm | title = U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | publisher = [[United States Government Printing Office]] | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | quote = Internet, Intranet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Times of India]]''. In addition, many [[peer review | peer-review]]ed journals and professional publications such as ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' capitalize "Internet", and this style guideline is also specified by the [[American Psychological Association]] in its electronic media spelling guide. The [[Modern Language Association]]'s ''[[MLA Handbook]]'' does not specifically mention capitalization of Internet, but its consistent practice is to capitalize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers | year = 2009 | publisher = Modern Language Association of America | location = New York | isbn = 9781603290241 | edition = Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of publications do not capitalize ''internet''. Among them are ''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[The Times|''The Times'' of London]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/i#id-3026449 | title = Guardian and Observer style guide | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate = 19 April 2008 | quote = internet, net, web, world wide web. See websites.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=23 April 2014 
 |page=33 
 |quote=Viewers and listeners complain most loudly when they hear the wrong word used, and now scripts are widely available on the internet, misspellings, too, are public. 
 |deadurl=yes

 |archivedate=3 June 2013 
 |df=dmy 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. As of 2011, most publications using "internet" appear to be located outside [[North America]], but the gap is closing. ''[[Wired News]]'', an American news source, adopted the lower-case spelling in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Tony |title=It's Just the 'internet' Now |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/08/64596 |work=Wired |publisher= |date=16 August 2004 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |quote=... what the internet is: another medium for delivering and receiving information. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429065340/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/08/64596 |archivedate=29 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media companies like [[BuzzFeed]] and [[Vox Media]] avoid capitalizing the "internet" similarly.&lt;ref name="OD2016"/&gt; Around April 2010, [[CNN]] shifted its house style to adopt the lowercase spelling. The [[Associated Press]] announced that the 2016 ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' will no longer capitalize "internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poynter.org/2016/ap-style-change-alert-dont-capitalize-internet-and-web-any-more/404664/ | title = AP Style alert: Don’t capitalize internet and web anymore | publisher = The Poynter Institute | access-date = 3 April 2016 | quote = The changes reflect a growing trend toward lowercasing both words, which have become generic terms
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced their decision in May 2016 to decapitalize all instances of "internet" for reasons similar to AP's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bromwich | first = Jonah | date = May 24, 2016 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/media/internet-to-be-lowercase-in-new-york-times-and-associated-press.html | title = Bulletin! The 'Internet' Is About to Get Smaller | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Internet connectivity has expanded, it has started to be seen as a service similar to television, radio, and telephone, and the word has come to be used in this way (e.g. "I have the internet at home" and "I found it on the internet").

==Regional differences==
According to [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries Online]], as of April 2016 the spelling ''Internet'' remains more usual in the US, while ''internet'' has become predominant in the UK.&lt;ref name="OD2016"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2016/04/should-you-capitalize-internet/ | title=Should you capitalize the word Internet? | publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries Online]] | date=5 April 2016 | accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1645">'''Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange''' (中文資訊交換碼) or '''CCCII''' is a character set developed specifically to address the problem of interchange of Chinese information. It is used mostly by [[library|libraries]] because the code contains various properties considered to be desirable by libraries.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

CCCII is a superset of [[ASCII]] designed to conform to [[ISO 2022]].
Each Chinese character is represented by a 3-byte code in which each byte is 7-bit. Thus, the maximum number of Chinese characters representable in CCCII is 94&amp;times;94&amp;times;94 = 830584. 
In practice the number of characters encodable by CCCII would be less than this number, because variant characters are encoded in related ISO 2022 planes under CCCII, so most of the code points would have to be reserved for variants.

The code is adopted as the character set for [[Library of Congress]] with the name '''East Asia Coded Character''' ('''EACC''', ANSI/NISO Z39.64). However, some CCCII characters don't have EACC equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://hkiug.ln.edu.hk/meetings/am2005/presentations/2-Unicode-project.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jesús María José Dalmacio Iglesias García''' (1879-1933) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Carlism|Carlist]] politician, active almost exclusively in [[Catalonia]]. His career climaxed during one term in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] (1910-1914) and one term in the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] (1918-1919). He did not manage to build his personal following; in historiography he is considered a rather unique case of a right-wing revolutionary who strove to launch a Christian, violent, urban, working class, anti-establishment movement. The bid has ultimately failed and in the 1920s Iglesias withdrew from active politics.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Praza Maior, Ourense, 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Orense, around 1900]]
The ancestors of Dalmacio Iglesias were related to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. His paternal family originated from [[Orense]]; his grandfather, [[Victorio Iglesias Fernández]], served as oficial primero of Tesorería de Hacienda in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Xosé A. Fraga Vázquez, ''Luis Iglesias Pardo. Un especialista en Medicina naval'', [in:] ''Consello de Cultura Gallega'' service 02.05.14,, available [http://culturagalega.gal/albumdaciencia/imprimir-detalle.php?id=996 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He married Vicenta Pardo&lt;ref&gt;see Iglesias' birth certifice, available at the official website of the Spanish senate [http://www.senado.es/cgi-bin/verdocweb?tipo_bd=HI20&amp;PWIndice=6&amp;Signatura=HIS-0229-07&amp;Contenido=2 here] and a copy of birth certificate available [https://postimg.org/image/y0xj788wf/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple had at least two sons; both of them studied medicine. The younger one, Luis Iglesias Pardo, served as physician in the Spanish navy; he gained some recognition in the maritime and local Galician realm as author of scientific works on medicine, sanitation and hygiene in the navy, all published in the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;for the list of Iglesias Pardo's works see Fraga Vázquez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The older brother, [[Antonio Iglesias Pardo]] (1844-1902),&lt;ref&gt;for birth date see Dalmacio's birth certificates referenced above; in 1879 his father was 35 years old. For death date see ''El Noroeste'' 08.02.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7116441&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; opted for a civilian career; in the 1870s he served in [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]], but in 1885 he left [[Extremadura]]&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín oficial de la provincia de Cáceres'' 09.01.85, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000049184&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to his native Orense. Until the mid-1890s he worked as surgeon in the city and in some neighboring locations, including these already in the [[Salamanca province]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 02.05.94, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7100319&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he commenced practice in the [[Santiago de Compostela]] hospital,&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 23.06.98, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000258132&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; where he served until his premature death.&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 15.11.98, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000258250&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

At unspecified time though probably prior to mid-1870s Antonio Iglesias married María Asunción García Legond, a native of Santiago and member to another family related to military medical services.&lt;ref&gt;''Semanario Farmaceutico'' VI/24 (1878), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026910798&amp;page=16 here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how many children the couple had. Dalmacio was born during the Cáceres spell of his father, where he probably spent his childhood years. In the mid-1880s he moved with his parents to Orense, living at calle Cervantes 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín oficial de la provincia de Orense'' 30.11.94, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1115773&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is there where in the local Insituto – the secular secondary school – he was rewarded with high grades upon his bachillerato.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified time yet most likely in the late 1890s he enrolled at the faculty of law at [[Universidad de Santiago]], where his career was punctuated by a brief period of military service.&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 31.08.98, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000258187&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; As a university student he performed brilliantly; Iglesias obtained governmental prize in course of the curriculum, was rewarded for his study on legal rights of married woman and got premio etraordinario when graduated in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 01.10.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000259101&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Erasmo de Janer.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Erasmo Janer Gironella|Erasmo Janer]]]]
Upon passing entry exams in early 1903 Iglesias was admitted to [[:es:Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas|Ministerio de Hacienda]]&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Burgos'' 09.02.03, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000435461&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here], and ''El Eco de Santiago'' 29.04.03, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000259568&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 06.11.03, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000259723&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; soon to be placed as the ministry delegate in [[Barcelona]].

They had one child, María de las Mercedes, who married a navy officer Federico Caso Montaner.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 19.10.35, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/04/05/pagina-8/33145356/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Dalmacio Iglesias did not live to see his only grandson, Alberto Caso Iglesias,&lt;ref&gt;born 1935, died 2015; for date of birth see ''La Vanguardia'' 19.10.35, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/04/05/pagina-8/33145356/pdf.html here], for date of death see ''Albert María Caso Iglesias'' entry, [in:] ''Capgros'' service, available [http://www.capgros.com/necrologiques/alberto-maria-caso-iglesias_613221_102.html# here]&lt;/ref&gt; who would later become a physician.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 20.10.60, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1960/10/20/pagina-22/32727001/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Dalmacio's sister-in-law María gained name as a Carlist propagandist and activist,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Roldán Suanzes-Carpegna 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while his brother-in-law [[:ca:Ignasi de Janer i Milà de la Roca|Ignacio]] became a locally known writer. Cousins of his wife [[:ca:Erasme de Lasarte i de Janer|Erasme]] and [[:ca:Josep Maria de Lasarte i de Janer|José Lasarte Janer]] turned recognized Catalan artists, respectively a painter and a writer. It is not clear whether a well-known singer [[Julio Iglesias]], who also originated from Orense, was his distant relative.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Iglesias' paternal grandfather, Ulpiano Iglesias Sarria (born in Orense in 1877), was a military and a pharmacist. No information on Iglesias Sarria's ancerstors is readily available&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early public activity (before 1910)==
[[File:Redacción de Gaceta de Galicia 1904.jpg|thumb|left|''[[:es:Gaceta de Galicia|Gaceta de Galicia]]'' editorial borad, around 1904 (Iglesias not present)]]
The young Dalmacio has early developed a penchant for letters and already in 1893 he contributed to local periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;the local Galician dailies that Iglesias contributed to were ''El Eco de Orense, La Voz Católica, El Derecho'' and ''La Nueva Epoca''; the weekly was ''La Bruja''; all this information has been provided by Iglesias himself, ''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt; During his academic period he kept publishing&lt;ref&gt;''El Noroeste, La Gaceta de Galicia'' and ''El Pensamiento Gallego'', ''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt; and founded an ephemeral literary weekly ''Santiago''. He practiced his oratory skills in Ateneo Escolar Compostelano, where he became first the secretary and then the president, and in Ateneo Leon XIII.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt; Inclined towards literature, he used to read out his own poetry&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 10.12.97, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000258565&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], also ''El Eco de Santiago'' 09.12.01, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000259455&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote prosaic pieces in [[Galician language|Gallego]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 24.02.98, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000258035&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; his works were flavored with militant religious zeal. In 1902 he took part in the Catholic Congress in Santiago and presented a paper at a section dedicated to religious orders.&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 14.07.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000259037&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the academic period when Iglesias was fascinated by the personality of [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]] and got attracted to Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that upon arrival in Catalonia Iglesias engaged in Carlist youth structures; in 1904 he was noted as giving lectures in Círculo Tradicionalista of Barcelona&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de Santiago'' 17.10.94, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000260883&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in late 1905 he became vice-president of Juventud Tradicionalista in the city,&lt;ref&gt;''El Tradicionalista'' 04.11.05, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1009587&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; delivering addresses also elsewhere in Catalonia, e.g. in [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Norte'' 10.12.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3066121&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Catalan Carlists were more than ever prepared to swallow their skepticism about alliance with other anti-governmental parties, especially the regionalists from [[Regionalist League of Catalonia|La Lliga]]; the strategy produced a broad electoral alliance known as [[Catalan Solidarity (1906)|Solidaridad Catalana]]. Iglesias spoke vehemently against this "hermandad vulgo pisto rabioso pactada"; his highly emotional harangues earned him attention of the [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberal]] and [[Republicanism in Spain|Republican]] press, as already in early 1906 he featured as a negative point of reference.&lt;ref&gt;''La Lucha'' 02.03.06, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1077997&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his duties as a Ministry of Finance delegate Iglesias practiced also as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;''El Tradicionalista'' 16.06.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1009284&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 he got involved in a controversial and widely discussed case known as "caso Rull". Rull was an undercover police operative who penetrated the world of Barcelona proletarian conspiracy but was himself charged with terrorism, perhaps related to some extreme party or organization.&lt;ref&gt;the explosives that Rull was associated with were planted in obscure and unfrequented passages apparently with little harm intended, which led some to suspect he was on service of an unidentified extreme party aiming at bringing police forces into disrepute, compare ''El Pais'' 09.04.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002325258&amp;page=2 here], see also Eduardo González Calleja, ''La razón de la fuerza: orden público, subversión y violencia política en la España de la Restauración (1875–1917)'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788400077785}}, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias first represented some of the defendants in court&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 26.03.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7119285&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and later defended Rull himself in an appeal case.&lt;ref&gt;''El Bien Público'' 25.04.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000138325&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The two seemed to have developed sort of friendship yet the prosecutor had his way and Rull was eventually executed;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Debates'' 10.08.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1045667&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the affair Iglesias was widely quoted speaking on terrorism and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 27.05.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000239277&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rull affair gained Iglesias a name in Barcelona, since in 1909 he emerged as expert on "antrolopología criminal".&lt;ref&gt;''La Bandera Regional' 27.11.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000373158&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Semana Trágica en Barcelona.jpg|thumb|burning churches during [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Semana Tragica]], [[Barcelona]] 1909]]
Once the city was rocked by riots known as [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Semana Trágica]] Iglesias voiced against "doctrinas positivistas" and secular teaching, identified as primary roots of urban unrest.&lt;ref&gt;''La Bandera Ragional'' 27.11.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000373158&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 and in response to left-wing violence Iglesias engaged in Catholic social action&lt;ref&gt;''El Social'' 03.04.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2098864&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the founders of Carlism-related Comité de Defensa Social,&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 26.11.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000315040&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; an hybrid organisation with characteristics of a cultural centre, a mutual help organization, a militia and a trade union. As a joint CdDS and Carlist representative&lt;ref&gt;''El Norte'' 19.04.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3066548&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; supported by other right-wing groupings&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; he ran in the [[Spanish general election, 1910|Cortes elections]] from Gerona in 1910; riding the wave of anti-Left backlash which followed The Tragic Week he somewhat unexpectedly emerged triumphant.&lt;ref&gt;in 1910 Iglesias received 2,957 votes out of 8,653 votes cast and 11,344 voters entitled, compare the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2855870%29.NDIP. here] Iglesias defeated a Republican Eduardo Fernández del Pozo and liberals, Jaime Roura and Pablo Bosch y Barrau&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political climax (1910-1914)==
[[File:TTV.87.11.jpg|thumb|left|Catalan [[requetés]], 1910s]]
The 1910-1914 Cortes service proved the period of Iglesias' hectic if not frenetic activity, especially during the first two years of his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;between June and December of 1910 Iglesias was noted at least 750 times in the press. In 1911 he was mentioned around 600 times, in 1912 around 450 times, in 1913 around 170 times and in 1914 around 110 times, compare ''prensahistorica'' service, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/estaticos/contenido.cmd?pagina=estaticos/presentacion here], and ''hemerotecadigital'' service, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/index.vm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though he focused also on topics like the army&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Tortosa'' 27.10.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1032274&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and economy&lt;ref&gt;''La Tarde'' 30.11.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1116667&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was mostly bent on confronting the [[Radical Republican Party|Radicals]] of [[Alejandro Lerroux|Lerroux]], whom he presented as a threat not only to public order but also to the entire civilization.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in July 1910 Iglesias demanded that all lerrouxista centres in Barcelona are closed as threat to public order, ''La Defensa'' 04.07.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1143662&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], and blamed the lerrouxistas fpr Semana Trágica, ''El Noticiero'' 07.07.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2044497&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Many times he clashed with Radicals in the Cortes, compare ''Las Provincias'' 07.07.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000313267&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], including oral skirmishes with Lerroux himself, ''El Eco de Navarra'' 08.06.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=6005259&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; His own rhetoric was inflammatory; [[José Canalejas (politician)|Canalejas]] noted that in his counter-revolutionary zeal he was carried away by hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;Canalejas noted Iglesias' promise that he would "iba a matar la hidra revolucionaria con la punta de su espada", ''La Juventud'' 03.09.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000431005&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. In revenge Iglesias denounced Canalejas as a masonic tool of the English, ''El Clamor'' 08.04.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2245549&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. His claims about the English and the freemasonry made some impact in the Vatican diplomacy, Ramon Corts i Blay, ''La Setmana Tràgica de 1909: l'Arxiu Secret Vaticà'', Montserrat 2009, {{ISBN|9788498831443}}, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Though member of the diet, Iglesias emerged as leader of right-wing Catalan obrerismo, a working class violent anti-establishment movement.&lt;ref&gt;it is not clear how Iglesias' militant obrerismo translated into his parliamentary activity. In 1912 he proposed a draft law on "passive classes", yet no details are available, compare ''La Atalaya'' 09.03.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000394030&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. He was also in favor of regulations which legitimized strike action, ''La Región Cantabra'' 26.10.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000425846&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Confronting both radical lerrouxistas and bourgeoisie La Lliga, Iglesias started to champion what looked like a nascent Christian, urban, aggressive, proletariant protest crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Iglesias is considered "clearest example" of the fact that radical Carlists "dropped their usual conterrevolutionary guise, revealing a Carlist potential to evolve toward eplicitly right revolutionary positions", Colin. M. Winston, ''Carlist workers groups in Catalonia, 1900-1923'', [in:] Stanley G. Payne (ed.), ''Identidad y nacionalismo en la España contemporánea: el carlismo, 1833-1975'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8487863469}}, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; His zeal to do away with the regime would soon lead him to advancing theories of Carlists and republicans joining ranks to topple the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] system,&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 09.12.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5068525&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; quickly quashed by the party hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Collin Winston, ''The Proletarian Carlist Road to Fascism: Sindicalismo Libre'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 17 (1982), p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected by the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 09.12.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5068525&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iglesias's name soon became tantamount to an explosive conflict. Due to violent language employed and logic which instigated rebellion his press articles gave rise to many official enquiries.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''El Radical'' 26.06.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2140240&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''Las Provincias'' 04.01.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000310745&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagin here], ''El Grano de Arena'' 03.02.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3002744&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''El Cantabrico'' 23.02.13, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000409444&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''Las Provincias'' 06.11.13, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000315354&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1910s he managed himself two weeklies: ''La Voz de la Tradición''&lt;ref&gt;José Navarro Cabanes, ''Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista'', Valencia 1917, pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La Trinchera'';&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 13.05.13, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000240839&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; especially the latter emerged as the chief platform of violent obrerista propaganda&lt;ref&gt;Winston 2001, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; which indulged in "fantasies of civil war in which Carlism triumphed".&lt;ref&gt;Winston 2001, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Police prevented sale of his discourses&lt;ref&gt;''El Salmantino'' 03.08.10, availavle [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5038736&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was among the most investigated MPs, by far surpassing the first ever [[PSOE|socialist]] MP in the Spanish parliament, [[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]].&lt;ref&gt;in 1912 he was the 5th most interrogated deputy in the Cortes, with 46 cases against him, ''La Información'' 28.02.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2126854&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every second rally Iglesias attended ended up in riots, usually between the Carlist [[requetés]] and the Radical Jovenes Barbaros.&lt;ref&gt;some of his pamphlets might have triggered violence, compare ''La Correspondencia de España'' 03.08.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7121584&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=7&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Clashes were not limited to Catalonia, as they occurred even when he did show up in his native Orense, ''El Progreso'' 26.10.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3096571&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Some incidents were clearly provoked by Iglesias, e.g. when leading a group of requetés he used to interrupt movie showings or assaulted orchestra playing ''La Marseillaise'', ''El Adelanto'' 26.05.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7500122&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]; 1911 his Blona meeting and discourse on pornography ended up – as usual – in skirmishes, ''El Cantábrico'' 22.05.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000408807&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. As a result, the lerrouxistas awaited him to stage their own provocations, ''La Correspondencia de Alicante'' 02.10.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=4008233&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. The list of clashes, skirmishes or riots related to him as listed in the press would cover tens of incidents&lt;/ref&gt; Even his expected attendance might have led to violent clashes, e.g. with two dead left in [[Eibar]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Noticiero'' 08.04.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2042671&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a few times assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Caraselva Iglesias was assaulted on the street, see ''El Salmantino'' 21.09.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5040571&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. In 1911 a train he was travelling at was shoot at, or at least it was believed so, ''El Noroeste'' 13.09.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7106505&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most deadly turned out to be a [[:ca:Enfrontament entre carlins i lerrouxistes de Sant Feliu de Llobregat|1911 urban battle in Sant Feliu de Llobregat]]; following his address at a Carlist rally hundreds of requetés and lerrouxistas engaged in a melee which left 6 people killed,&lt;ref&gt;''El Restaurador'' 02.06.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1014188&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the incident investigated later in the parliament. It is with his personal contribution that "from 1911 to 1916 scuffling and occasional shoot-outs between Carlist and Radical youth were an accepted part of the Barcelona scene",&lt;ref&gt;Winston 1982, p. 560, Winston 2001, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; especially that in 1913 he hailed "the club and the browning, the two indispensable companions of Jaimist youth".&lt;ref&gt;Winston 1982, pp. 560, 561. Iglesias intended to build requeté as shock troops used in a revolutionary insurgence which was expected to topple the republic, González Calleja 1998, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Els morts a Sant Feliu 1911.jpg|thumb|victims of [[:ca:Enfrontament entre carlins i lerrouxistes de Sant Feliu de Llobregat|Sant Feliu clashes]], 1911]]
Iglesias' radicalism estranged the Catalan Carlist leadership and the regional party jefe [[Manuel de Llanza y Pignatelli|Duque de Solferino]] a few times tried to mitigate him;&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo González Calleja, ''Paramilitarització i violencia politica a l'Espanya del primer terc de segle: el requeté tradicionalista (1900-1936)'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 37 (1991), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; despite being Gerona MP Iglesias did not head the provincial Gerona organisation.&lt;ref&gt;the provincial Carlist Gerona jefe was José María Vilahur, Albert Balcells, Joan B. Culla, Conxita Mir, ''Les eleccions generals a Catalunya de 1901 a 1923'', Barcelona 1982, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias himself started to dream of old-fashioned party leaders killed in a civil war and making room for the youth.&lt;ref&gt;Winston 2001, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1912 he entered the national Carlist executive&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2012, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; and also in 1912 in [[Biarritz]] he met [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|his king]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Córdoba'' 10.05.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5000582&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. He claimed he had not known Don Jaime before, see ''El Porvenir'' 02.07.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2151733&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here], though one year earlier, in September 1911, he had been reported as departing to Frohsdor to speak with Don Jaime on organization of Carlism, ''La Atalaya'' 24.09.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000393864&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Iglesias' stand versus Don Jaime is not clear. On the one hand it does not seem marked by particular loyalty; upon his 1910 election he refused to send a customary Carlist telegram message of adhesion and claimed he had to wait for approval from Comité de Defensa Social, ''La Correspondencia de España'' 14.04.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7124409&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. On the other hand, in June 1912 Iglesias felt competent to discuss Don Jaime's private issues and declare that he would soon marry a foregin princess, ''La Atalaya'' 01.06.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000394112&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He did not seem engaged in struggle for power within the party top echelons and is not listed as protagonist of a raging conflict between his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the official party leader, [[:es:Bartolomé Feliu|Bartolomé Feliu]].&lt;ref&gt;the most detailed work on Carlist history at the turn of the centuries, Fernández Escudero 2012, barely mentions Iglesias. A work on Mellismo does not mention Iglesias prior to the Great War period, see Andres Martin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the verge of loyalty (1914-1919)==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|left|Carlist standard]]
In the [[Spanish general election, 1914|1914 electoral campaign]] Iglesias stood as a Carlist candidate in Gerona&lt;ref&gt;in 1910 a Republican daily claimed that Gerona was "feudo de don Dalmacio Iglesias" and agonised about his inquisitorial methods against the Liberals, ''El Pueblo'' 21.07.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1149488&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here], but given his 1914 defeat the claims seem exaggerated or outdated&lt;/ref&gt; and though proportionally he was more successful than 4 years earlier, ultimately he failed to renew his deputy ticket.&lt;ref&gt;in 1910 Iglesias gained 2.957 votes (34,15% of voters and 26,06% of those entitled to vote). In 1914 he gained 2,954 votes (respectively 36,31% and 26,5%) and lost to a Republican contender, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, pp. 546, 534&lt;/ref&gt; It would soon turn out that he failed in his later bids – also from Gerona - of 1916&lt;ref&gt;in 1916 Iglesias gained 2,465 votes (29,81% of the voters and 21,39% of the electorate) and lost to a Republican contender, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;in 1918 Iglesias gained 2,241 votes (25,98% of the voters and 19,26% of the electorate) and lost to a Lliguero contende, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias acknowledged defeat, resumed his suspended duties as Hacienda delegate and re-opened the law office in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Gerona'' 15.06.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1085073&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. He was member of colegios in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona, ''Heraldo Alaves'' 01.12.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2289231&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Always skeptical about courting La Lliga, in the mid-1910s Iglesias started to lead an anti-Catalanist group within the local party. Though he declared himself a regionalist and even in favor of autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir'' 07.06.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2151733&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; by scholars he is considered a champion of anti-regionalist españolismo;&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; opponent of the new Catalan Carlist leader [[:es:Miguel Junyent|Miguel Junyent]]&lt;ref&gt;in January 1915 Iglesias was still recorded as speaking with Junyent during the same rally, ''El Porvenir'' 14.01.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2151816&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his daily ''El Correo Catalan'', Iglesias openly challenged his line of seeking understanding with the [[Catalanism|Catalanists]]. The rift became clear when in 1915 he founded ''El Legitimista Catalan'';&lt;ref&gt;''La Correponsencia de España'' 02.05.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7135081&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=7&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the national party jefe [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|Cerralbo]] disauthorised the paper&lt;ref&gt;''La Correpospondencia de Valencia'' 12.06.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000241539&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''Montejurra'' 50 (1970), p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened these taking part in a related meeting with expulsion;&lt;ref&gt;''El Cantabrico'' 13.06.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000410258&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the meeting took place and invariably ended in riots,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 13.06.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000241540&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; but the weekly was eventually closed after just 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;''El Legitimista'' was issued between October 1915 and December 1915, Jaime del Burgo, ''Bibliografia del Siglo XIX'', Pamplona 1978, {{ISBN|8423503429}}, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias found himself on the verge of loyalty to the party, yet Cerralbo&lt;ref&gt;perhaps influenced by de Mella, as some scholars suggest that during his second tenure de Cerralbo was a front-man with de Mella actually running the party, compare Fernández Escudero 2012&lt;/ref&gt; preferred not to escalate the conflict; in 1916 he confirmed Iglesias as the party candidate from Gerona,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cantabrico'' 26.03.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000410545&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn triggered protest resignation of the local Carlist Junta Provincial.&lt;ref&gt;Conxita Mir, ''Lleida (1890-1936): caciquisme polític i lluita electoral'', Montserrat 1985, {{ISBN|9788472027169}}, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias kept lambasting a policy which according to him melted Carlism in a broad Catalanism;&lt;ref&gt;''El Debate'' 28.03.64, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2282956&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; upon the 1917 emergence of [[:es:Asamblea de Parlamentarios|Parliamentary Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;the Assembly was attended by some fellow Gerona Carlists like Pedro Llosas Badía&lt;/ref&gt; he strongly voiced against the initiative&lt;ref&gt;''El Adelanto'' 02.08.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7506585&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; as giving in to the likes of Lerroux and [[Cambó]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir'' 09.08.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2151794&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two other threads which rendered Iglesias a key protagonist of internal conflict in regional Carlism. One was his continued penchant for social radicalism; he remained active in Comité de Defensa Social and even built its militia,&lt;ref&gt;''La Esquella de la Torratxa'' 03.03.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=4034836&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=28&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. In early 1919 Iglesias was Inspector General de Requeté de Catalunya, ''El Norte'' 07.02.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3066170&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; apart from reverting to a theory that the Carlists should close ranks with "extrema izquierda" in order to do away with the corrupted regime.&lt;ref&gt;''El Gironés'' 15.04.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3064182&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Another conflictive issue was the Great War. While the party officially supported neutrality most Catalan Carlists harbored [[francophone]] feelings; Iglesias emerged as leader of the local pro-German faction, noted for his cries of ''viva Alemania''&lt;ref&gt;''El Noroeste'' 02.08.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7107955&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and even for declaration that he was prepared to shed blood if the time comes.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 27.06.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7135137&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]; the English have been traditionally considered the enemies of Spain and other nations, compare [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains paradoxical that despite his extremely conflictive personality Iglesias remained on at least formally correct terms with other party leaders; in 1917 together with Junyent he entered Comité de Acción Política of the Catalan Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;contrary to usual opinions of Iglesias as anti-Catalanist españolista, he supported the concept that internal Carlist Catalan documents be written in Catalan, ''El Norte'' 30.12.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3064401&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; a new body of somewhat unclear role.&lt;ref&gt;in early 1918 the Comité personal setup seems to have changed; Solferino and Junyent disappeared, while Teodoro Más emerged as president and Iglesias is secretary, which might be indicative of the body taken over by the Mellistas, ''El Norte'' 05.01.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3065675&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems even more surprising that following defeat in 1918 elections Iglesias managed to ensure support of conservative parties when competing for seat in the Senate from [[Tarragona]]; it seems that he owed success&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 12.03.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3048662&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Antonio Maura|Maura]] and his ruling faction rather than to his own party.&lt;ref&gt;it seems that Iglesias got was running for senate as the official governmental candidate, Isidre Molas, ''Els senadors carlins de Catalunya'', Barcelona 2009, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; During a short term between mid-1918 and mid-1919 he basked in prestige of a senator and contributed to a few legal solutions adopted, e.g. to the law on civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt;

==In search of a new political identity (1919-1923)==
[[File:Jaime de Borbón, in El Mundo Grafico 7 10 1931 página 24.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], around 1919]]
Conflict between the key party theorist Vázquez de Mella and the claimant [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], the strife which was tearing Carlism apart since the late 1900s, came to an abrupt end in early 1919: the [[Mellismo|Mellistas]] broke away to build their own party. Iglesias has always remained fascinated with de Mella yet he did not count among his partisans in course of internal conflict;&lt;ref&gt;compare Fernandez Escudero 2012, Andres Martin 2000&lt;/ref&gt; it was only during the [[First world war|Great War]] that he emerged as key Catalan Mellista. In February 1919 he was expulsed from Comunión Tradicionalista&lt;ref&gt;''El Cantábrico'' 04.02.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000411579&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately engaged in work to built a new Mellista organization. After [[:es:Teodoro de Mas y Nadal|Teodoro Más]], leader of the Catalan secessionists,&lt;ref&gt;''La Opinión'' 28.09.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1157430&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Iglesias was the most prominent exponent of the breakaways in the region and some count him among the most prominent secessionists also nationwide;&lt;ref&gt;in 1919 he was considered one of key promellistas with [[Victor Pradera Larumbe|Pradera]], Garcia Guijarro, [[Jaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió|Chicharro]], Careaga and [[José Pascual de Liñán y Eguizábal|Doña Marina]]; in February 1919 they united in senate and declared themselves anti-Jaimistas, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; some authors name him a leader of "dalmacistas", one of a few mostly personalist factions allegedly making up the Mellista group.&lt;ref&gt;according to a Jaimista author in early 1919 the Mellistas were nothing but a bunch of personalist following groups like "doñamarinistas, dalmacistas, o chicharristas", Andrés Martín 2000, p. 162. However other authors suggest that at this point Iglesias parted ways with the radical Barcelona Carlists. Though earlier he was their most recognizable personality, in 1919 most of them remained loyal to Don Jaime, Colin Winston, ''Workers and the Right in Spain'', Princeton 2014, {{ISBN|9781400858095}}, pp. 157-158&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon expiration of the senator mandate in May 1919 Iglesias for the 5th time tried to obtain the deputy ticket from Gerona and for the 4th time failed;&lt;ref&gt;when running from Gerona Iglesias got 2241 votes, ''El Norte'' 13.05.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3066421&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], which amounts to 31,6% of the voters and 20,0% of the electorate, see the official Cortes service [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDBuscHisDip?_piref73_1340033_73_1340032_1340032.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXDSP.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%40ELEN%26gt%3B%3D%2250%22+%26+%40ELEN%26lt%3B%3D%2250%22+%26+%28%22GERONA%22%29.DIST. here]&lt;/ref&gt; initially reported to run for a consolation prize in the senate from Tarragona&lt;ref&gt;''El Restaurador'' 10.05.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1009791&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;''El Eco de la Comarca'' 22.06.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1025148&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to local efforts of forging a new party within a grand right-wing coalition and specified his program as "religión, unidad de la Patria española, Orden social y Monarquía tradicional y, por tanto, regionalista";&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 172, ''ABC'' 18.05.19&lt;/ref&gt; indeed he supported the autonomous statute drafted by [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Mancomunitat]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Balcells, ''El projecte d'autonomia de la Mancomunitat de Catalunya del 1919 i el seu context històric'', Barcelona 2010, p. 94. In 1919 in front of Mancomunitat Iglesias defended the right of castellano-speaking children to education in castellano, Balcells 2010, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; During a grand assembly of Catalan Mellistas in Badalona of 1920 he hoped they would serve as agglutinatory factor for all Catholic forces,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 197-198&lt;/ref&gt; yet such a union was slow to materialize: in 1921 he was denied the Maurista support during one more bid for the senate.&lt;ref&gt;during the 1921 electoral campaign Iglesias was reportedly denied supported of the Mauristas, which he considered treason, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As usual his appearances led to unrest, though in 1921 his rally was interrupted by his former darlings requetés, who shouted "viva Jaime Tercero".&lt;ref&gt;''El Noticiero Gaditano'' 04.06.21, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2064494&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mella en Barcelona 1921.png|thumb|[[Mellismo|Mellista]] meeting, Barcelona 1921]]
In mid-1922 Iglesias was still reported as heart and soul of the new emerging Mellista party and seemed prepared to go to great lengths when seeking allies, most likely the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]]; he admitted that having broken all ties with Don Jaime, he was prepared to recognize [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Don Alfonso]] as a legitimate king given he swears allegiance to the [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;''El Debate'' 19.06.22, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2284163&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here], Andres Martin 2000, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; However, at some point he apparently lost any hope about the Mellista project. Tempted by [[:es:Partido Social Popular|Partido Social Popular]] of [[Salvador Minguijón Adrián|Salvador Minguijón]] and other breakaway Carlists, he considered it a would-be embodiment of "sumarse al partido católico" plan.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he neared an initiative to launch a non-dynastical monarchist party, though still remained cautious that the Traditionalists should not lose their own identity. In late 1922 Iglesias was missing among participants of overdue Mellista party launch in [[Zaragoza]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 237-239&lt;/ref&gt; and joined Unión Monárquica Nacional instead.&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 he was once again rumored to run – as independent – for deputy ticket from Gerona.&lt;ref&gt;''La Opinión'' 23.04.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1053101&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; His political bewilderment was eventually terminated by the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Sáenz de Heredia|Primo de Rivera]] coup and ban on all party activity.

==Primoderiverista and afterwards (1923-1933)==
[[File:Gobierno-primorivera.jpg|thumb|left|Directorio, 1925]]
Iglesias had no doubt about adhering to the new regime. Already in late 1923 he took part in homage feasts celebrating Primo as savior of the fatherland;&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 21.11.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000192953&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]; himself as self-proclaimed representative of Catalan people together with other Barcelona personalities he presented the dictator with a historical sword, ''Diario de Burgos'', 03.12.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000441807&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly exalting "golpe de estado" he offered his services to the military directorio.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario Palentino'' 03.12.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2213415&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; During a 1924 rally of Juventud de Acción Tradicionalista&lt;ref&gt;''El Noticiero Gaditano'' 15.07.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2058286&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he hailed the coup as doing away with the old regime and as a deed spirited by traditionalist principles.&lt;ref&gt;''La Rioja'' 17.07.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3079545&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact scale of Iglesias' engagement in the primoderiverista regime is not clear. He later claimed that during personal meetings with the dictator he had tried to impose upon Primo his own social concerns and that he had repeatedly suggested that the regime should lower the cost of life for the middle- and working class.&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz de Aragón'' 21.05.30, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000377246&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Press information confirms only his meetings with the Catalan [[:ca:emilio barrera|capitán general]], yet their purpose was not revealed.&lt;ref&gt;''La Atalaya'' 19.12.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000398348&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Active in [[Patriotic Union (Spain)|Union Patriotica]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 21.05.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000223253&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here], for 1929 see also ''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 09.09.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000223321&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;presentacion=pagina here], Winston 2014, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1920s he seemed less enthusiastic about the dictatorial regime and criticized the constitution draft as the one which reproduced most defects of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1876|1876 document]];&lt;ref&gt;''Nuevo Día'' 24.07.29, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000040046&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1930 pamphlet, ''Política de la dictadura'', Iglesias charged Primo with giving in to capitalist pressure and abandoning the cause of the working people;&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz de Aragón'' 21.05.30, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000377246&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;presentacion=pagina here], Shlomó Ben-Amí, ''Fascism from above: the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in Spain, 1923-1930'', New York 1983, {{ISBN|9780198225966}}, pp. 307-308&lt;/ref&gt; another pamphlet read like an offer to a centre-left political party.&lt;ref&gt;Dalmacio Iglesias, ''La carestía de la vida: sus causas y sus remedios. Programa económico para cualquier partido político'' (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

In private Iglesias was confirmed at his job of Ministry of Finance delegate to Catalonia; his career was not ruined even by a fistfight with another official over his allegedly unsubstantiated absence in the office, perhaps the last manifestation of Iglesias' notorious inflammatory personality.&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 31.10.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=5042566&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1920s he competed for position of Jefe de la sección de Hacienda&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 05.01.26, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000192243&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;presentacion=pagina here]; according to an encyclopaedia note in 1920 he was nominated "jefe de negociado de Hacienda, ''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1927 he was promoted to Jefé Superior de Administración Civil in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 08.10.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3053130&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he emerged as expert on canon law and author of a few related works,&lt;ref&gt;''La Palanca'' 24.09.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2161338&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Iglesias juridical works published were ''Existencia legal de las Órdenes religosas en España'' (1902), ''Capacidad jurídica de la mujer casada ante el derecho natural'' (1906), ''Nociones de administración y contabilidad de la Hacienda pública'' (1906), ''Educación y dirección de las nuevas multitudes'' (1909), ''Oposiciones al cuerpo de aspirantes a la judicatura y ministerio fiscal: contestación a las preguntas relativas a derecho civil'' (with José Morell y Terry, 1915) and ''Instituciones de Derecho eclesiástico con arreglo al nuevo Código del Derecho canónico'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; which probably earned him Cruz de Oro of [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] order, awarded by the pope.&lt;ref&gt;''La Reconquista'' 17.07.20, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1015342&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the late 1920s he was noted in public mostly as engaged in numerous religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 08.02.26, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000223134&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here], see also ''La Vanguardia'' 11.01.30, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1929/03/09/pagina-10/33211873/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; As expert in juridical science he edited a number of entries in ''Enciclopedia Espasa'', including the one on himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 940&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, he was not missing during the 1928 funeral of his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the acts related.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 28.02.28, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1928/02/28/pagina-9/33201434/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:4columnes fotoantiga.jpg|thumb|Barcelona, 1929]]
There is scarce information on Iglesias' public activity during the last few years of his life. Until death he remained employed as the Catalan delegado de Hacienda.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 27.01.32, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/01/19/pagina-6/33189077/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1931 he was rumored to run on a joint right-wing ticket for the Cortes&lt;ref&gt;''La Galeria'' 03.06.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3062115&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=14&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed later that year he was once noted as speaking at a Traditionalism-flavored rally,&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 29.10.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3059037&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet unlike many former Mellistas, Iglesias has not been reported as engaged in a re-united Carlist organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;no press information confirms his activity within Carlism after 1931, he is also missing in the most comprehensive work on Carlism of the era, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1920s he was plagued by health problems,&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 11.09.24, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000319397&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet their nature is not clear and it is not known what caused his premature death. Many periodicals noted his passing away, including at least one Carlist paper.&lt;ref&gt;the exception was ''[[El Siglo Futuro]]'', which printed a corteous and informative necrological note, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.01.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000506447&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Hanna''' (born April 2, 1953) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] film and television [[actress]], most notable for her [[voice acting]] work in [[animated film]]s.  She later complemented her voice acting skills by becoming a [[speech-language pathologist]].

== History ==

===Early history===
Elizabeth Hanna spent her early years in [[Ottawa]], where she graduated from [[Glebe Collegiate Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Where she was preceded by [[Luba Goy]], later of the [[Royal Canadian Air Farce]].  Both also graduated from the [[National Theatre School of Canada]]. Both also have done extensive voice-acting work in productions for [[Nelvana]], including performing together in such productions as ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended [[Carleton University]], where she graduated with a major in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;And where some of her undergraduate work was published.  See reference to her "The '6's' in the ''Tractatus''", published in Vol 1(2) of ''The Carleton University Student Journal of Philosophy'' (Summer, 1974), [https://carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp/paperissues.html CUSJP Issues Printed on Paper]; www.carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp, in which Hanna discusses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Ludwig Wittgenstein's]] sixth proposition from his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] ''.  Hanna's research and analytical orientations have continued in her later career as a speech-language pathologist:  see "Selected Recent Presentations/Publications" at [http://www.clearspeech.ca/profile.htm Profile of Elizabeth Hanna]; www.clearspeech.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of Hanna's contemporaries during her time at Carleton was comedian [[Dan Aykroyd]].&lt;/ref&gt;  She was then accepted into the [[National Theatre School of Canada]], based in [[Montreal]], Quebec, from which she graduated in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ent-nts.ca/en/alumni/all/acting/1970.aspx |title=Alumni, Acting: 1970-1979 |publisher=National Theatre School of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421213221/http://www.ent-nts.ca/en/alumni/all/acting/1970.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of Hanna's classmates at the National Theatre School was Canadian actor, writer and director [[Jack Blum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===
Hanna then relocated to [[Toronto]], where she continues to be based.  She initially commenced her professional acting career appearing in various Toronto stage productions.  She also began to obtain commercial [[voice-over]] work, contributing to national television and radio advertising campaigns.  This led to the development of her career as a [[Voice acting|voice actor]] in a number of [[animated films]] associated with such well-known characters as [[The Little Bear Movie|Little Bear]], the [[Care Bears]], [[Babar the Elephant]], and [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]].&lt;ref name = Hannabio&gt;[http://www.clearspeech.ca/profile.htm Profile of Elizabeth Hanna]; www.clearspeech.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Hanna's voice acting work has been in productions of the [[Nelvana]] group.

===As a speech-language pathologist===
Hanna later complemented her voice acting and voiceover skills by obtaining a [[Master of Health Science]] degree, majoring in [[Speech-Language Pathology]], from the [[University of Toronto]].  She commenced practising as a Speech-Language Pathologist in 1996 while continuing her voice and other contributions to film and television, as well as voice contributions to [[video game]]s.&lt;ref name = Hannabio/&gt;

'''Emilian''' is a group of [[dialect]]s of the [[Emilian-Romagnol language]] spoken in the area historically called [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], the western portion of today's [[Emilia-Romagna]] region in [[Italy]].

There is no standardised version of Emilian.

The default word order is [[subject–verb–object]]. There are two [[grammatical gender|gender]]s as well as a distinction between plural and singular. Emilian has a strong [[T–V distinction]] to distinguish varying levels of politeness, social distance, courtesy, familiarity or insult. Its alphabet uses a considerable number of [[diacritic]]s.

==Classification==
{{Main|Emilian-Romagnol language|Gallo-Italic languages}}
Emilian is a dialect of the [[Emilian-Romagnol language]], one of the [[Gallo-Italic languages]]. There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between the various varieties of Emilian and the other dialect, [[Romagnol dialect|Romagnol]]. The Gallo-Italic family has Emilian-Romagnol, [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and [[Lombard language|Lombard]].

==Dialects==
[[Linguasphere Observatory]] recognises the following dialects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://linguasphere.info/?page=inner&amp;id_inner=1017741| work=Linguasphere |title=51-AAA-ok. emiliano + romagnolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mantovano''', spoken in all but the very north of the [[Province of Mantua]] in Lombardy. It has a strong Lombard influence.
*'''Vogherese (Pavese-Vogherese)''', spoken in the [[Province of Pavia]] in Lombardy. It is closely related phonetically and morphologically to Piacentino. It is also akin to Tortonese.{{what|date=October 2013}}
*'''Piacentino''', spoken west of the [[Taro (river)|River Taro]] in the [[Province of Piacenza]] and on the border with the province of Parma. The variants of Piacentino are strongly influenced by Lombard, Piedmontese, and Ligurian.
*'''[[Parmigiano dialect|Parmigiano]]''', spoken in the [[Province of Parma]]. Those from the area refer to the Parmigiano spoken outside of Parma as Arioso or Parmense, although today's urban and rural dialects are so mixed that only a few speak the original. The language spoken in [[Casalmaggiore]] in the [[Province of Cremona]] to the north of Parma is closely related to Parmigiano. 
*'''Reggiano''', spoken in the [[Province of Reggio Emilia]], although the northern parts (such as [[Guastalla]], [[Luzzara]] and [[Reggiolo]]) of the province are not part of this group and closer to Mantovano.
*'''Modenese''', spoken in the [[Province of Modena]], although Bolognese is more widespread in the Castelfranco area. In the northern part of the province of Modena, the lowlands around the town of Mirandola, a Mirandolese sub-dialect of Modenese is spoken.
*'''[[Bolognese dialect|Bolognese]]''', spoken in the [[Metropolitan City of Bologna]] and in around [[Castelfranco Emilia]], Modena.
*'''Ferrarese''', spoken in the [[Province of Ferrara]], southern [[Veneto]], and [[Comacchio]].

Other definitions include the following:{{cn|date=October 2013}}
* '''Carrarese''' and '''Lunigiano''' dialects, spoken in [[Carrara]], [[Lunigiana]], in almost all of the [[Province of Massa and Carrara]] in northwestern [[Tuscany]], and a good portion of the [[Province of La Spezia]] in eastern [[Liguria]]. Historically, this region has been part of Tuscany and the duchies of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] at different times, so it has a close economic relationship with the Emilian area and is geographically proximate due to the [[Magra (river)|Magra]] and [[Vara (river)|Vara]] rivers.
* '''Massese''' (mixed with some Tuscan features)
* '''Casalasco''', spoken in [[Cremona]], [[Lombardy]].

==Writing system==
Emilian is written using a [[Latin script]] that has never been standardised. As a result, spelling varies widely across the dialects. The dialects are largely oral and rarely written. However, the [[Bible]] was published in Emilian-Romagnol in 1865; the work has since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-intl.net/find_a_bible/?Language=eml |title=Emiliano-Romagnolo [eml] |publisher=forum-intl.net

'''Enduring Voices''' is a project for documenting world's [[endangered language]]s and trying to prevent language extinction by identifying the most crucial areas where languages are endangered and embarking on expeditions to record these languages. Launched in 2007 by the joint effort of the [[Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages]] and the [[National Geographic Society]], it has organized expeditions to language "hotspots" around the world, e.g. to [[Australia]], [[Bolivia]], [[East India]]. Enduring Voices tries to understand the geographic dimensions of language distribution, determine how linguistic diversity is linked to biodiversity and bring wider attention to the issue of language loss. The Enduring Voices Project assists indigenous communities in their efforts to revitalize and maintain their threatened languages.

The Language Hotspots model for prioritizing language research was conceived and developed by Dr. Greg Anderson and K. David Harrison at the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages to identify most endangered and least studied languages. It is a new way to view the distribution of global linguistic diversity, to assess the threat of language extinction, and to. Hotspots are those regions of the world having the greatest linguistic diversity, the greatest language endangerment, and the least-studied languages. For the project, Doctors Anderson and Harrison are accompanied by Chris Rainier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisrainier.com/ Chris Rainier website about his involvement with National Geographic Enduring Voices Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a National Geographic Fellow and ethnographic photographer and filmmaker for helping in documenting various linguistic expedition on camera and film.

Identified hotspots with degrees of threat of language extinction include:
*Severe: North West Pacific Plateau (USA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionatlas.org/cultures/endangered-languages/enduring-voices-northwest-pacific-plateau/summary/paaACFE5138100630605 ActionAtlas: Discover and preserve endangered languages of the Northwest Pacific Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; Central South America, Central Siberia, Eastern Siberia and Northern Australia
*High: Oklahoma Southwest, Southern South America,
*Medium: Northern South America, Western Melanesia
*Low: MesoAmerica, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, Caucasus, Eastern India and Malaysia, SouthEast Asia, Eastern Melanesia and Taiwan-Philippines.
In each of these area, Enduring Voices has identified languages as priorities for research before it is too late.

Through the efforts of the Enduring Voices Project, the [[Koro language (India)|Koro language]] was discovered in India in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101005-lost-language-india-science National Geographic: Hidden language found in remote Indian tribe]&lt;/ref&gt; During a three-week trip in 2009, the Enduring Voices team recorded interviews with speakers of eleven indigenous languages of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/Linguistics/SlidePics/PapuaReport.pdf Living Tongues Institute: Enduring Voices—Papua New Guinea]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14312">Environmental personhood is a legal concept which designates certain environmental entities the status of a [[legal person]]. This assigns to these entities, the [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities and [[legal liability]] of a legal personality. Environmental personhood emerged from the evolution of legal focus in pursuit of the protection of [[nature]]. Over time, focus has evolved from human interests in exploiting nature, to protecting nature for future human generations, to conceptions that allow for nature to be protected as intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be used as a vehicle for recognising [[Indigenous peoples]]' relationships to natural entities, such as rivers.&lt;ref&gt;James DK Morris and Jacinta Ruru. "Giving Voice to Rivers: Legal Personality as a Vehicle for Recognising Indigenous Peoples' Relationships to Water." ''AILR'' 14 (2010): 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental personhood, which assigns nature (or aspects of it) certain rights, concurrently provides a means to individuals or groups such as Indigenous peoples to fulfill their human rights.

==Background==

The [[United States]] Professor Christopher D. Stone first discussed the idea of attributing legal personality to natural objects in the 1970s, in his article "Should trees have standing? Towards legal rights for natural objects".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D. Stone. "Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects." ''Southern California Law Review'' 45 (1972): 450.&lt;/ref&gt;  A legal person cannot be owned; therefore, no ownership can be attributed to an environmental entity with established legal personality. [[Standing (law)]] is directly related to legal personality. Entities with standing, or [[locus standi]], have the right or capacity to bring action or appear in court. Environmental entities cannot themselves bring action or appear in court. However, this action or standing can be achieved on behalf of the entity by a representing [[legal guardian]]. Representation could increase protection of culturally significant aspects of the natural environment, or areas vulnerable to exploitation and pollution.

==Domestic rights of nature==

===New Zealand===

In 2014, Te Urewera National Park was declared ''[[Te Urewera]]'', an environmental legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The area encompassed by ''Te Urewera'' ceased to be a government-owned national park and was transformed into freehold, inalienable land owned by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014, ss 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the same trend, [[New Zealand]]’s [[Whanganui River]] was declared to be a legal person in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This new legal entity was named ''Te Awa Tupua'' and is now recognised as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the Whanganui River and all of its physical and metaphysical elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 13(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The river would be represented by two guardians, one from the Whanganui iwi and the other from the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

The [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] Rivers are now considered legal persons in an effort to combat pollution. The rivers are sacred to [[Hindu]] culture for their healing powers and attraction of [[pilgrims]] who bathe and scatter the ashes of their dead.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Susan Bliss. "A river is a 'person'." 49 ''Geography Bulletin'' No 2 (2017): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers have been heavily polluted by 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage and 500 million litres of industrial waste entering the rivers daily.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The High Court in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities. The rivers would gain “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person.” This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This development of environmental personhood has been met with scepticism as merely announcing that the Ganges and Yamuna are living entities will not save them from significant, ongoing pollution. There is a possible need to change long-held cultural attitudes towards the Ganges, which hold that the river has self-purifying properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is further criticism that the guardianship of the rivers was only granted to Uttarakhand, a region in northern India which houses a small part of the rivers’ full extent. The Ganges flows for 2,525km through Uttarakhand, [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]], with only a 96km stretch running through Uttarakhand. Only a small section of the 1,376km Yamuna tributary runs through Uttarakhand – which also crosses through the states of [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of scepticism surrounding the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court, proclaiming these vulnerable rivers as legal entities invokes a movement of change towards environmental and cultural rights protection. The decisions may be built upon as a foundation for future environmental legislative change. 

===United States===

In 2006, a small community in [[Pennsylvania]] called [[Tamaqua]] Borough worked with a rights of nature group called Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF. https://celdf.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the groups drafted legislation to protect the community and its environment from the dumping of toxic sewage.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2006, CELDF has assisted with over 30 communities in ten states across the United States to develop local laws codifying the rights of nature. CELDF also assisted in the drafting of Ecuador's 2008 constitution following a national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF, Rights of Nature: Timeline. https://celdf.org/rights/rights-of-nature/rights-nature-timeline/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

The rights of nature “to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles” have been proclaimed under [[Ecuador]]’s [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|2008 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), http://therightsofnature.org/wpcontent/uploads/pdfs/Rights-for-Nature-Articles-in-Ecuadors-Constitution.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after a national referendum in 2008, allowing the Ecuador constitution to reflect rights for nature, a world first.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Revkin, Ecuador Constitution Grants Rights to Nature, New York Times, (September 29, 2008), http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/ecuador-constitution-grants-nature-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person and community has the right to advocate on nature's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution proclaims that the “State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an [[ecosystem]].”&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Article 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful case of the rights of nature implementation under Ecuador constitutional law was presented before the Provincial Court of Justice of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]] in 2011. This case involved the [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]] River as the plaintiff, representing itself with its own rights to ‘exist’ and ‘maintain itself’ – as it attempted to halt construction of a government highway project interfering with the natural health of the river.This case was brought before court by two individuals, Richard Frederick Wheeler and Eleanor Geer Huddle, as legal guardians acting in favour of nature – specifically the Vilcabamba River. A constitutional injunction was granted in favour of the Vilcabamba River and against the Provincial government of Loja, attempting to conduct the environmentally-harmful project. The project was forced to be halted and the area was to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt; Natalia Greene. "The first successful case of the Rights of Nature implementation in Ecuador." Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature. http://therightsofnature.org/first-ron-case-ecuador/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===

The constitutional change in Ecuador was followed legislatively by [[Bolivia]] in 2010, passing the ‘[[Law of the Rights of Mother Earth]]’ (''Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra''). This legislation designates [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] the character of ‘a collective subject of [[public interest]]’&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; with inherent rights specified in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Law of the Rights of Mother Earth give aspects of legal personhood to the natural environment. Judicial action can be taken for infringements against individuals and groups as part of Mother Earth as ‘a collective subject of public interest’.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;   The legislation states that “Mother Earth is the dynamic living system made up of the indivisible community of all living systems, living, interrelated, interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny.”&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Colombia===

The [[Colombia]] [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] found in November 2016 that the [[Atrato River]] basin possesses rights to "protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration." This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, impacting nature and harming of Indigenous peoples and their culture. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous people living in the basin.&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court stated:
:“''(I)t is the human populations that are interdependent of the natural world – and not the opposite – and that they must assume the consequences of their actions and omissions with the nature. It is a question of understanding this new sociopolitical reality with the aim of achieving a respectful transformation with the natural world and its environment, as has happened before with civil and political rights…Now is the time to begin taking the first steps to effectively protect the planet and its resources before it is too late…''”&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance for cultural human rights==

The recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal entity in New Zealand (''Te Awa Tupua'') encompassed a vivid sense of cultural “inalienable connection” to the local iwi and hapu of the river. Maori culture considers natural features such as the Whanganui River as ancestors and iwi hold deep connections with them as living entities. This inalienable connection of indigenous culture to their natural surroundings is apparent in other parts of the world such as Colombia where a similar environmental personhood declaration was made for the Atrato River basin.

The lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi, Gerrard Albert, said “we consider the river an ancestor and always have…treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt; James D K Morris and Jacinta Ruru suggest that giving “legal personality to rivers is one way in which the law could develop to provide a lasting commitment to reconciling with Maori.” This was the longest-running legal dispute in New Zealand. The Whanganui iwi had been fighting to assert their rights in harmony with the river since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/16/whanganui-river-becomes-first-in-the-world-to-be-recognised-as-a-legal-person-6512264/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a fundamental step forward for cultural rights as the environmental personhood status of the river means that if there was harm committed to the river, the law now sees no differentiation between harming the Whanganui iwi or harming the river as they are the same indivisible entity. The Whanganui iwi have a proverb which reads ''Ko au te Awa, ko te Awa ko au'': I am the River and the River is me - the iwi and hapu of the Whanganui River have an inalienable connection with, and responsibility to, ''Te Awa Tupua'' and its health and well-being.

'''Gayo''' is an Austronesian language spoken by some 100,000 people (2000) in the mountainous region of [[Aceh]] around [[Central Aceh]], [[Bener Meriah]] and [[Gayo Lues]] regencies. It is classified as belonging to the Western [[Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages]], but is not closely related to other languages. Ethnologue lists ''Deret'', ''Lues'', ''Lut'', and ''Serbejadi-Lukup'' as dialects.

Gayo is distinct from other languages in Aceh. The art and culture of the [[Gayo people]] is also significantly different compared with other ethnic groups in Aceh.

In 1907, G.A.J. Hazeu wrote a first Gayo–Dutch dictionary for the colonial authorities of the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Gajosch-Nederlandsch Woordenboek, by G.A.J. Hazeu, Landsdrukkerij Batavia 1907. It is available online as a Google scan.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8096">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[topology]], the '''Generalized Poincaré conjecture''' is a statement that a [[manifold]] which is a [[homotopy sphere]] 'is' a [[sphere]]. More precisely, one fixes a [[category (mathematics)|category]] of manifolds: [[topological manifold|topological]] ('''Top'''), [[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]] ('''PL'''), or [[differentiable manifold|differentiable]] ('''Diff'''). Then the statement is

:Every homotopy sphere (a closed ''n''-manifold which is [[homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to the ''n''-sphere) in the chosen category (i.e. topological manifolds, PL manifolds, or smooth manifolds) is isomorphic in the chosen category (i.e. homeomorphic, PL-isomorphic, or diffeomorphic) to the standard ''n''-sphere.

The name derives from the [[Poincaré conjecture]], which was made for (topological or PL) manifolds of dimension 3, where being a homotopy sphere is equivalent to being [[simply connected space|simply connected]] and [[closed manifold|closed]]. The Generalized Poincaré conjecture is known to be true or false in a number of instances, due to the work of many distinguished topologists, including the [[Fields medal]] recipients [[John Milnor]], [[Steve Smale]], [[Michael Freedman]] and [[Grigori Perelman]].

==Status==
Here is a summary of the status of the Generalized Poincaré conjecture in various settings.

* '''Top''': true in all dimensions.
* '''PL''': true in dimensions other than 4; unknown in dimension 4, where it is equivalent to Diff.
* '''Diff''': false generally, true in some dimensions including 1,2,3,5, and 6. First known counterexample is in dimension 7. The case of dimension 4 is equivalent to PL and is unsettled ({{As of|2018|lc=on}}).

A fundamental fact of [[differential topology]] is that the notion of isomorphism in Top, PL, and Diff is the same in dimension 3 and below; in dimension 4, PL and Diff agree, but Top differs. In dimension above 6 they all differ. In dimensions 5 and 6 every PL manifold admits an infinitely differentiable structure that is so-called ''Whitehead compatible''.&lt;ref name="msp.warwick.ac.uk"&gt;See
[http://www.msp.warwick.ac.uk/gt/gtmcontents6.html Fragments of Geometric Topology from the Sixties] by Sandro Buoncristiano, in  Geometry &amp; Topology Monographs, Vol. 6 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The case ''n'' = 1 and 2 has long been known, by classification of manifolds in those dimensions.

For a ''PL'' or ''smooth'' homotopy n-sphere, in 1960 [[Stephen Smale]] proved for ''n'' ≥ 7 that it was homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere and subsequently extended his proof to ''n'' ≥ 5;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Smale, ''Generalized Poincaré's conjecture in dimensions greater than four.''  Ann. of Math. (2) 74 1961 391--406. {{MathSciNet|id=0137124}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a [[Fields Medal]] for his work in 1966.  Shortly after Smale's announcement of a proof, [[John R. Stallings|John Stallings]] gave a different proof for dimensions at least 7 that a PL homotopy ''n''-sphere was homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere using the notion of "engulfing".&lt;ref&gt;John Stallings. [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183523757 ''Polyhedral homotopy spheres.''] [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 66 (1960), pp. 485&amp;ndash;488.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christopher Zeeman|E. C. Zeeman]] modified Stalling's construction to work in dimensions 5 and 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Erik Christopher|last= Zeeman|authorlink=Christopher Zeeman|  contribution=The Poincaré conjecture for ''n'' greater than or equal to 5|title= Topology of 3-manifolds and related topics (Proc.

Amer. J. Math. 84 1962 387--399. {{MathSciNet|id=0153022}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1966, [[Max Newman|M.H.A. Newman]] extended PL engulfing to the topological situation and proved that for ''n ≥ 5'' a ''topological'' homotopy ''n''-sphere is homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Newman|M.H.A. Newman]], ''The engulfing theorem for topological manifolds.'' Ann. of Math. (2) 84 1966 555--571. {{MathSciNet|id=0203708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grigori Perelman]] solved case ''n'' = 3 (where TOP, PL, and DIFF all coincide) in 2003 in a sequence of three papers.&lt;ref name="perelman200211"&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159 | date = 11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200303"&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=[[Ricci flow with surgery]] on three-manifolds|eprint=math.DG/0303109 | date = 10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200307"&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds|eprint=math.DG/0307245|date = 17 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered a Fields Medal in August 2006 and the [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Prize]] from the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] in March 2010, but declined both.

==Exotic spheres==
The Generalized Poincaré conjecture is true topologically, but false smoothly in some dimensions. This results in constructions of manifolds that are homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to the standard sphere, which are known as the [[exotic sphere]]s: you can interpret these as non-standard [[differentiable structure|smooth structure]]s on the standard (topological) sphere.

Thus the [[homotopy sphere]]s that [[John Milnor]] produced are homeomorphic (Top-isomorphic, and indeed piecewise linear homeomorphic) to the standard sphere &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;, but are not diffeomorphic (Diff-isomorphic) to it, and thus are [[exotic sphere]]s: they can be interpreted as non-standard differentiable structures on the standard sphere.

[[Michel Kervaire]] and Milnor showed that the [[orientability|oriented]] 7-sphere has 28 different smooth structures (or 15 ignoring orientations), and in higher dimensions there are usually many different smooth structures on a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal| first1 = Michel A. | last1 = Kervaire | authorlink1 = Michel Kervaire | first2 = John W. | last2 = Milnor | authorlink2 = John Milnor |  title = Groups of homotopy spheres: I | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | series=2nd Ser.| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | volume = 77 | year = 1963 | issue = 3 | pages = 504–537 | doi = 10.2307/1970128| jstor = 1970128| mr = 0148075}} This paper calculates the structure of the group of smooth structures on an n-sphere for &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that certain differentiable structures on the 4-sphere, called [[Gluck twist]]s, are not isomorphic to the standard one, but at the moment there are no known invariants capable of distinguishing different smooth structures on a 4-sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Gluck, ''The embedding of two-spheres in the four-sphere,'', Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 104 (1962) 308-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==PL==
For [[piecewise linear manifold]]s, the Poincaré conjecture is true except possibly in dimension 4, where the answer is unknown, and equivalent to the smooth case.
In other words, every compact PL manifold of dimension not equal to 4 that is homotopy equivalent to a sphere is PL isomorphic to a sphere.&lt;ref name="msp.warwick.ac.uk"/&gt;

The '''grid plan''', '''grid street plan''', or '''gridiron plan''' is a type of [[city]] plan in which [[street]]s run at [[Angle#Types of angles|right angle]]s to each other, forming a [[wikt:grid|grid]]. The infrastructure cost for regular grid patterns is generally higher than for patterns with discontinuous streets.

Costs for streets depend largely on four variables: street width, street length, [[city block|block]] width and pavement width. Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, facilitate [[pedestrian]] movement. The geometry helps with orientation and [[wayfinding]] and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.

In [[ancient Rome]], the grid plan method of land measurement was called [[centuriation]]. The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures; some of the earliest [[planned cities]] were built using grid plans.

==Ancient grid plans==
[[File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|thumb|right|The grid plan of [[Miletus|Milet]] in the Classical period]]
By 2600 BC, [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], major cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (in what is now Pakistan), were built with blocks divided by a grid of straight streets, running north-south and east-west. Each block was subdivided by small lanes.&lt;ref&gt;Jane McIntosh, ''The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives'' ; ABC-CLIO, 2008; {{ISBN|978-1-57607-907-2}} ; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA231 231], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA346 346].&lt;/ref&gt; The cities and monasteries of [[Gandhara]] (e.g. [[Sirkap]] and [[Taxila]]), dating from the 1st millennium BC to the 11th century AD, also had grid-based designs.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Pant and Shjui Fumo, "[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jaabe/4/1/4_1_51/_pdf The Grid and Modular Measures in The Town Planning of Mohenjodaro and Kathmandu Valley: A Study on Modular Measures in Block and Plot Divisions in the Planning of Mohenjodaro and Sirkap (Pakistan), and Thimi (Kathmandu Valley)]"; ''Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering'' 59, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamabad]], the capital of Pakistan since 1959, was also founded on the grid-plan of the nearby ruined city of Sirkap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitislamabad.net/islamabad/files/map-home.asp Islamabad City Guide . Map, at visitislamabad.net] Accessed 16 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A workers' village (2570-2500 BC) at [[Giza]], [[Egypt]], housed a rotating labor force and was laid out in blocks of long galleries separated by streets in a formal grid. Many pyramid-cult cities used a common orientation: a north-south axis from the royal palace and an east-west axis from the temple, meeting at a central plaza where King and God merged and crossed.

[[Hammurabi]] king of the [[Babylonia|Babylonian Empire]] in the 17th century BC, ordered the rebuilding of [[Babylon]]: constructing and restoring temples, city walls, public buildings, and irrigation canals. The streets of Babylon were wide and straight, intersected approximately at right angles, and were paved with bricks and [[bitumen]].

The tradition of grid plans is continuous in [[China]] from the 15th century BC onward in the [[Ancient Chinese urban planning|traditional urban planning]] of various ancient Chinese states. Guidelines put into written form in the [[Kaogongji]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-476 BC) stated: "a capital city should be square on plan. Three gates on each side of the perimeter lead into the nine main streets that crisscross the city and define its grid-pattern. And for its layout the city should have the Royal Court situated in the south, the Marketplace in the north, the Imperial Ancestral Temple in the east and the Altar to the Gods of Land and Grain in the west."

[[Teotihuacan]], near modern-day [[Mexico City]], is the largest ancient grid-plan site in the [[Americas]]. The city's grid covered 21 square kilometres(8 square miles).

Perhaps the most well-known grid system is that spread through the colonies of the Roman Empire. The archetypal [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] was introduced to Italy first by the Greeks, with such information transferred by way of trade and conquest.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski 116"&gt;Stanislawski, Dan (1946).  "The Grid-Pattern Town", Geog. Rev., xxxvi, pp. 105-120, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ancient Greek grid===
Although the idea of the grid was present in Hellenic societal and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form.&lt;ref name="Burns 39"&gt;Burns, Ross (2005), ''Damascus: A History'', Routledge, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were a step in the propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan,&lt;ref name="Burns 39"/&gt; that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points&lt;ref name="Burns 39"/&gt; and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60"&gt;Higgins, Hannah (2009) ''The Grid Book''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. p.60. {{ISBN|978-0-262-51240-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably best exemplified in [[Priene]], in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out{{clarify|date=July 2015}} towards a river and the city of [[Miletus]].&lt;ref&gt;Belozerskaya, Marina and Lapatin, Kenneth (2004), Ancient Greece: art, architecture, and history. Los Angeles: Getty Publications, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Roman civilization===

The [[Etruscan people]], whose territories in Italy encompassed what would eventually become Rome, founded what is now the city of [[Marzabotto]] at the end of the 6th century BC. Its layout was based on Greek Ionic ideas, and it was here that the main east-west and north-south axes of a town (the ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' respectively) could first be seen in Italy. According to Stanislawski (1946), the Romans did use grids until the time of the late Republic or early Empire, when they introduced ''[[Roman centuriation|centuriation]]'', a system which they spread around the Mediterranean and into northern Europe later on.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski 116"/&gt;
[[File:Spirano-Stezzano.jpg|thumb|left|Straight road in the [[Province of Bergamo]], [[Italy]], following line of [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] ]]

The military expansion of this period facilitated the adoption of the grid form as standard: the Romans established ''[[castra]]'' (forts or camps) first as military centres; some of them developed into administrative hubs. The Roman grid was similar in form to the Greek version of a grid, but allowed for practical considerations. For example, Roman ''castra'' were often sited on flat land, especially close to or on important nodes like river crossings or intersections of trade routes.&lt;ref name="Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60"/&gt; The dimensions of the ''castra'' were often standard, with each of its four walls generally having a length of {{convert|2150|ft|m|order=flip}}. Familiarity was the aim of such standardisation: soldiers could be stationed anywhere around the Empire, and orientation would be easy within established towns if they had a standard layout. Each would have the aforementioned ''[[decumanus maximus]]'' and ''[[cardo maximus]]'' at its heart, and their intersection would form the forum, around which would be sited important public buildings. Indeed, such was the degree of similarity between towns that Higgins states that soldiers "would be housed at the same address as they moved from ''castra'' to ''castra''".&lt;ref name="Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60"/&gt; Pompeii has been cited by both Higgins&lt;ref name="Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60"/&gt; and Laurence&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Ray (2007), ''Roman Pompeii: space and society'', p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2018}} as the best preserved example of the Roman grid.

Outside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically {{convert|2400|ft|m|order=flip}} per side (called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''centuria'']]), and contained 100 parcels of land (each called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''heredium'']]).&lt;ref name="Gelernter 15"&gt;Gelernter, Mark (2001), ''A history of American architecture: buildings in their cultural and technological context'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.&lt;ref name="Gelernter 15"/&gt;

While the imposition of only one town form regardless of region could be seen as an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and interchangeability, both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.

==Asia from the first millennium AD==
As [[Japan]] and the [[Korean peninsula]] became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning principles in numerous locations. In Korea, [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Unified Silla]], and [[Shangjing Longquanfu|Sanggyeong]], the capital of [[Balhae]], adapted the [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as [[Fujiwara-kyo|Fujiwara-Kyô]] (AD 694-710), [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (Heijô-Kyô, AD 710-784), and [[Kyoto]] (Heian-Kyô, AD 794-1868) also adapted from Tang's capital, [[Chang'an]]. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of [[Tokyo]] eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the [[Edo Castle]] grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the [[Japanese addressing system]] is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.

The grid-planning tradition in Asia continued through the beginning of the 20th century, with [[Sapporo]], Japan (est. 1868) following a grid plan under American influence.

==Europe and its colonies==
[[File:Schéma bastide modèle Gascon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bastide]] schema in [[Gascony]]]]
New [[Europe]]an towns were planned using grids beginning in the 12th century, most prodigiously in the [[bastides]] of southern [[France]] that were built during the 13th and 14th centuries. Medieval European [[new town]]s using grid plans were widespread, ranging from [[Wales]] to the [[Florence|Florentine]] region. Many were built on ancient grids originally established as Roman colonial outposts. In the British Isles, the planned new town system involving a grid street layout was part of the system of [[burgage]].

The Roman model was also used in Spanish settlements during the [[Reconquista]] of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was subsequently applied in the new cities established during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], after the founding of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (Canary Islands) in 1496. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041215070244/http://www.arc.miami.edu/Law%20of%20Indies.html Laws of the Indies] to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza's corners. Hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations.

The [[baroque]] capital city of [[Malta]], [[Valletta]], dating back to the 16th Century, was built following a rigid grid plan of uniformly designed houses, dotted with palaces, churches and squares.

The grid plan became popular with the start of the [[Renaissance]] in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of [[Mannheim]] in [[Germany]] was the first Renaissance city laid out on the grid plan. Later came the New Town in [[Edinburgh]] and almost the entire city centre of [[Glasgow]], and many [[planned communities]] and cities in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

[[Derry]], constructed in 1613–1618, was the first [[planned city]] in [[Ireland]]. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of [[British North America]].

== Russia ==
[[File:Homann MapSpb1716-17.png|thumb|The map of St. Petersburg (1717). The grid of 'lines' and 'prospekts' is seen across the whole triangle-shaped [[Vasilyevsky Island]], while actually only the eastern part has been accomplished]]
In [[Russia]] the first [[planned city]] was [[St. Petersburg]] founded in 1703 by [[Peter the Great|Peter I]]. Being aware of the modern European construction experience which he examined in the years of his [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|Grand Embassy to Europe]], czar ordered [[Domenico Trezzini]] to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for [[Vasilyevsky Island]] was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in [[Amsterdam]]), with three lengthwise thoroughfares, rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.

The shape of street blocks on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] is the same, as was later implemented in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] for [[Manhattan]]: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively narrow street with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called [[Lines of Vasilyevsky Island|''Liniya'' (Line)]]) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term ''[[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]'' was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named ''Bolshoi'' (''Big''), ''Sredniy ''(''Middle'') and ''Maly'' (''Small'') while the far ends of each lines cross with the embankments of [[Bolshaya Neva River|Bolshaya Neva]] and [[Smolenka River|Smolenka]] rivers in the delta of the [[Neva River]].

The peculiarity of 'lines' (streets) naming in this grid is that are each side of street has its own number, so one 'line' is a side of a street, not the whole street. The numbering is latently zero-based, however the supposed "zero line" has its proper name ''Kadetskaya liniya'', while the opposite side of this street is called the '1-st Line'. Next street is named the '2-nd Line' on the eastern side, and the '3-rd Line' on the western side. After the reorganization of house numbering in 1834 and 1858 the even house numbers are used on the odd-numbered lines, and respectively odd house numbers are used for the even-numbered lines. The maximum numbers for 'lines' in Petersburg are 28-29th lines.

Later in the middle of the 18th century another grid of rectangular blocks with the numbered streets appeared in the continental part of the city: 13 streets named from the '1-st Rota' up to the '13-th Rota', where the [[Company (military unit)|companies]] ({{lang-de|Rotte}}, {{lang-ru|рота}}) of the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]] were located.

==Early United States==

[[File:American Grid Comparison.jpg|thumbnail|left|Twenty American grids compared at a scale of 400 feet to the inch.]]
Many of the earliest cities in the United States, such as [[Boston]], did not start with a grid system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Back Bay]], [[Dorchester Heights]], and [[South Boston]] all have grid layouts.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in pre-revolutionary days some cities saw the benefits of such a layout. [[New Haven Colony]], one of the earliest colonies in America, was designed with a tiny 9-square grid at its founding in 1638. On a grander scale, [[Philadelphia]] was designed on a rectilinear street grid in 1682: one of the first cities in North America to use a grid system.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=3&amp;chapter=3&amp;page=2 ExplorePaHistory.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the urging of city founder [[William Penn]], surveyor [[Thomas Holme]] designed a system of wide streets intersecting at right angles between the [[Schuylkill River]] to the west and the [[Delaware River]] to the east, including five squares of dedicated parkland. Penn advertised this orderly design as a safeguard against overcrowding, fire, and disease, which plagued European cities. Holme drafted an ideal version of the grid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/kjohnso1/pictures/tholme1683inch9.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420061427/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/kjohnso1/pictures/tholme1683inch9.jpg |archivedate=2007-04-20 |df= }} Swarthmore College&lt;/ref&gt; but alleyways sprouted within and between larger blocks as the city took shape.
Another well known grid plan is the plan for [[New York City]] formulated in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], a proposal by the state [[legislature]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] for the development of most of [[Manhattan]]&lt;ref&gt;Landers, John ''Twelve Historical New York City Street and Transit Maps from 1860 to 1967'' {{ISBN|1-882608-16X}}&lt;/ref&gt; above [[Houston Street]].

[[File:Savannah Portland NewYork City Blocks.svg|right|thumb|A diagram of three city grids at the same scale showing the differences in dimensions and configuration]]

[[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]], was planned under [[French-American]] architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original [[District of Columbia]] was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. These diagonals are often connected by [[traffic circle]]s, such as [[Dupont Circle]] and [[Washington Circle]]. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the [[McMillan Plan]], led by Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], was adopted to build a [[National Mall]] and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.

Often, some of the streets in a grid are numbered (First, Second, etc.), lettered, or arranged in alphabetical order. Downtown [[San Diego]] uses all three schemes: north-south streets are numbered from west to east, and east-west streets are split between a lettered series running southward from A through L and a series of streets named after trees or plants, running northward alphabetically from Ash to Walnut. As in many cities, some of these streets have been given new names violating the system (the former D Street is now Broadway, the former 12th Avenue is now Park Boulevard, etc.); this has meant that 2nd, not 1st, is the most common street name in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-factoids/most-common-us-street-names NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES: Most Common U.S. Street Names at nlc.org] Accessed 16 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1733), known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]]. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large corner blocks, four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) is known as a ward.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan''. University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called [[fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;Batty, M. &amp; Longley, P. (1994) Fractal Cities: A Geometry of Form and Function (San Diego, Calif.: Academic)&lt;/ref&gt;  Its street configuration presages modern traffic calming techniques applied to uniform grids where certain selected streets become discontinuous or narrow, thus discouraging through traffic. The configuration also represents an example of functional [[shared space]], where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In the westward development of the United States, the use of the grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in [[Salt Lake City]] (1870), [[Dodge City]] (1872) and [[Oklahoma City]] (1890). In these western cities the streets were numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt;

One of the main advantages of the grid plan was that it allowed the rapid [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] and [[auction]] of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the [[Republic of Texas]] decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], the functioning of the government required the rapid population of the town, which was named [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Charged with the task, [[Edwin Waller]] designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6&amp;nbsp;km²). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, and by the end of the year the entire Texas government had arrived by [[cart|oxcart]] at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time of the grid's adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.

==Late 19th century to the present==
[[File:BCN01.JPG|thumb|[[Barcelona]]]]
[[File:Original design of Barcelona's city blocks.svg|right|thumb|The city blocks and streets of Barcelona as conceived by Ildefonso Cerdá. The blocks include wide open spaces that continue across the street to adjacent blocks.]]
[[Ildefonso Cerdá]], a Spanish civil engineer, defined a concept of urban planning, based on the grid, that he applied to the [[Eixample]] of [[Barcelona]]. The Eixample grid introduced innovative design elements which were exceptional at the time and even unique among subsequent grid plans:
* a very large block measuring {{convert|113|by|113|m|ft|abbr=on}}, far larger than the old city blocks and larger than any Roman, Greek blocks and their mutations (see drawing below);
* a {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} road width (right of way) compared to mostly 3 m in the old city;
* square blocks with truncated corners; and
* major roads, perpendicular and diagonal, measuring {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width.
These innovations he based on functional grounds: the block size, to enable the creation of a quiet interior open space (60 m by 60 m) and allow ample sunlight and ventilation to its perimeter buildings; the rectilinear geometry, the wide streets and boulevards to sustain high mobility and the truncated corners to facilitate turning of carts and coaches and particularly vehicles on fixed rails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/document/6806 'activity-38-1.pdf' World Heritage Papers 5: Identification and Documentation of Modern Heritage] Published in 2003 by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, p36 and multiple further pps, Including footnote: "See Ildefonso Cerdá, Teoría general de la urbanización y aplicación de sus principios y doctrina a la reforma y ensanche de Barcelona, Madrid, 1867." Accessed 17 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In maps of larger American cities the downtown areas are almost always grids. These areas represent the original land dimensions of the founded city, generally around one square mile. Some cities expanded the grid further out from the centre, but maps also show that, in general, as the distance from the centre increases, a variety of patterns emerge in no particular discernible order. In juxtaposition to the grid they appear random. These new patterns have been systematically classified and their design characteristics measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Southworth | first1 = Michael | last2 = Owens | first2 = Peter | lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1993 | title = The Evolving Metropolis: Studies of Community, Neighbourhood, and Street Form at the Urban Edge | url = | journal = JAPA | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 271–288 | doi=10.1080/01944369308975880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the grid system was widely used in most major cities and their [[suburb]]s until the 1960s. However, during the 1920s, the rapid adoption of the [[automobile]] caused a panic among [[urban planning|urban planners]], who, based on observation, claimed that speeding cars would eventually kill tens of thousands of small children per year. Apparently, at this early stage of the car's entry into the grid, the streets of major cities worldwide were the scene of virtual "slaughter" as the fatality rate in proportion to population was more than double the current rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factbook.net/EGRF_Regional_analyses_HMCs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165123/http://www.factbook.net/EGRF_Regional_analyses_HMCs.htm |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp6/pdfdocs/RAS_2007.pdf Statistics of Road Traffic Accidents in Europe and North America Published: January 2007 or Published: April 2007] Accessed 17 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, after several decades of road safety improvements and a continuous decline in fatalities, an estimated 33,963 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes and, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from 3 to 14 years old."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811291.PDF Early Estimate of Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities in 2009 at crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov] Accessed 16 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Planners, therefore, called for an inwardly focused "[[City block#Superblock|superblock]]" arrangement that minimized through automobile traffic and discouraged cars from traveling on anything but [[arterial road]]s; traffic generators, such as apartment complexes and shops, would be restricted to the edges of the superblock, along the arterial. This paradigm prevailed between about 1930 and 1960, especially in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where notable examples include [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California|Leimert Park]] (an early example) and [[Panorama City, Los Angeles, California|Panorama City]] (a late-period one).

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ouagadougou]] ([[Burkina Faso]], ex [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], [[Africa]]), 1930]]A prominent 20th century urbanist, [[Lewis Mumford]], severely criticized some of the grid's characteristics: "With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Mumford|Mumford, Lewis]] (1961) ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformation, and Its Prospects''. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. p.425.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineers]] and urban planners abandoned the grid virtually wholesale in favor of a "[[street hierarchy]]". This is a thoroughly "asymmetric" street arrangement in which a residential subdivision—often surrounded by a [[Noise barrier|noise wall]] or a [[gated community|security gate]]—is completely separated from the road network except for one or two connections to arterial roads. In a way, this is a return to [[medieval]] styles: as noted in [[Spiro Kostof]]'s seminal history of [[urban design]], ''The City Shaped'', there is a strong resemblance between the street arrangements of modern American suburbs and those of medieval [[Arab]] and [[Moorish]] cities. In each case, the community unit at hand—the clan or extended family in the [[Muslim]] world, the economically homogeneous [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] in modern suburbia—isolates itself from the larger urban scene by using dead ends and ''[[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]]''.
[[File:Milton Keynes Sector.jpg|right|thumb|A one km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sector in Milton Keynes framed by major roads in a grid configuration. The road network within the sector uses cul-de-sac streets complemented by bike and foot paths which connect the entire sector and beyond.]]

===Milton Keynes===
{{Main|Milton Keynes grid road system}}
One famous grid system is in the British new town of [[Milton Keynes]]. In this planned city, which began construction in 1967, a system of ten "horizontal" (roughly east-west) and eleven "vertical" (roughly north-south) roads was used, with [[roundabout]]s at each intersection. The horizontal roads were all given names ending in 'way' and H numbers (for 'horizontal', e.g. H3 Monks Way). The vertical roads were given names ending in 'street' and V numbers (for 'vertical', e.g. [[V6 Grafton Street]]). Each grid road was spaced roughly one kilometre along from the next, forming squares of approximately one square kilometre. Each square and each roundabout was given its own name. The system provided very easy transport within the city, although it confused visitors who were unfamiliar with the system. The grid squares thus formed are far larger than the city blocks described earlier, and the road layouts within the grid squares are generally 'organic' in form – matching the street hierarchy model described above.

== Benefits and criticisms ==

===Financial cost===
[[File:Block Sizes and Street Length.svg|thumb|right|Block sizes and street length]]
[[File:13½ Street.jpg|thumb|right|In a numbered grid system, adding an extra street can cause confusion]]

''Street width'', or right of way (ROW), influences the amount of land that is devoted to streets, which becomes unavailable for development and therefore represents an opportunity cost. The wider the street, the higher the opportunity cost. Street width is determined by circulation and aesthetic considerations and is not dependent on the pattern configuration. Any configuration can have wide or narrow streets.

''Street length'' influences proportionately the amount of street components that have to be constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.

''Pavement width'' influences the cost by affecting the amount of materials and labour required to provide a finished road surface. Pavement width is generally based on traffic engineering considerations and is not dependent on pattern configuration. As with the street width, any pattern can have wide or narrow pavements.
Of all three factors that affect cost, street width, street length and pavement width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that the other variables, though optional, can play a role.

Traditional orthogonal grid patterns generally have greater street frequencies than discontinuous patterns. For example, Portland's block is 200 feet × 200 feet while Miletus' is half that size and Timgad's half again (see diagram). Houston, Sacramento and Barcelona are progressively bigger reaching up to four times the area of Portland's block. New York's 1811 plan (see above) has blocks of {{convert|200|ft}}. in width and variable lengths ranging from about 500 to 900 feet. The corresponding frequency of streets for each of these block sizes affects the street length.

A simple example of a grid street pattern (see diagram) illustrates the progressive reduction in ''total'' street length (the sum of all individual street lengths) and the corresponding increase in block length. For a corresponding reduction of one, two, three and four streets within this {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel, the street length is reduced from an original total of 12,600 to 7,680 linear feet, a 39% reduction. Simultaneously, block lengths increase from 200 × 200 feet to 1240 × 200 feet. When all five blocks have reached the ultimate size of {{convert|1240 |feet}} four street lengths out of total eight have been eliminated. Block lengths of 1000 feet or larger rarely appear in grid plans and are not recommended as they hinder pedestrian movement (Pedestrianism, below). From the pedestrian perspective, the smaller the block is, the easier the navigation and the more direct the route. Consequently, the finer grids are preferred.

Patterns that incorporate discontinuous street types such as crescents and [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]] have not, in general, regarded pedestrian movement as a priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops and so does the ''total'' street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, it is not the street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.

An inherent advantage of the orthogonal geometry of a proper grid is its tendency to yield regular lots in well-packed sequences. This maximizes the use of the land of the block; it does not, however, affect street frequency. Any frequency of orthogonal streets produces the same [[packing problems|packing]] effect. Orthogonal geometry also minimizes disputes over lot boundaries and maximizes the number of lots that could front a given street. [[John Randal]] said Manhattan's grid plan facilitated "buying, selling and improving real estate".&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt;

Another important aspect of street grids and the use of rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.

===Ecological features, rain water absorption and pollutant generation===
[[File:Platslc.jpg|thumb|right|Surveyor's plan of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s - an example of a typical, uniform, square-grid street network]]
Typical uniform grids are unresponsive to [[topography]]. [[Priene]]'s plan, for example, is set on a hill side and most of its north-south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as [[San Francisco]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], follow Priene's example, ''e.g.''. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.

The same inflexibility of the grid leads to disregarding [[Natural environment|environment]]ally sensitive areas such as small streams and [[creek (stream)|creeks]] or mature woodlots in preference for the application of the immutable geometry. It is said of the NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, [[reductionist]] solution to a multifaceted issue.

The grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of [[impermeable surface]]s in the street pavement and the [[sidewalk]]s. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of [[rain|rain water]] on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty is compounded by the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.

Some cities, notably [[Seattle]], have devised means to improve a street's retention capacity. However, frequent intersections as they occur in a regular grid would pose an obstacle to their effective application.

A street network pattern can affect the production of pollutants by the amount of car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to [[pedestrian]]s. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of [[pollutant]] [[exhaust gas|emissions]]. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20&amp;nbsp;mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;Final Facility Specific Speed Correction Factors:M6.SPD.002 David Brzezinski, Constance Hart, Phil Enns Assessment and Standards Division, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.

===Social environment and security===

In his seminal study (1982) on livable streets that was conducted in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for [[traffic calming]] and for several initiatives such as [[living street]]s and [[Home Zone]]s, all of which are aimed at improving a street's social milieu. The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.

A key characteristic of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Langdon, 2006: Seaside Stews Over Street Connections. ''New Urban News'', September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |title=Traditional Neighborhood Development Street Design Guidelines |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] |date=October 1999 |location=Washington, DC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220174833/http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |access-date=May 23, 2017 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometry of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a [[Defensible Space Theory]] described ways to improve the social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.

The question of neighbourhood security has been a constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill and Sahbaz, Ozlem (March 2008) "An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once?" Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, [[University College London]]&lt;/ref&gt; did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.

A recent study in California&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Susan; Sommer, Samantha; Ogilvie, Julie; Cao, Xinyu; and Mokhtarian, Patricia (2007) "Cul-de-Sacs and Children's Outdoor Play: Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence" [[University of California Davis]]&lt;/ref&gt; examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Huttenmoser, Marco and Marie Meierhofer (1995) "Children and Their Living Surroundings for the Everyday Life and Development of Children." Children's Environments 12(4): 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veitch | first1 = Jenny | last2 = Salmon | first2 = Jo | last3 = Ball | first3 = Kylie | lastauthoramp= yes | year = 2010 | title = Individual, social and physical environmental correlates of children's active free-play: a cross-sectional study | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 11 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5868-7-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.

Traditional street functions such as kids' play, strolling and socializing are incompatible with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts car traffic on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.

===Pedestrian and bicycle movement===
[[File:Paris Street Network Segment.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A 2&amp;#215;2 km square segment of the street network of [[Paris]] that often, and erroneously, is characterized as a grid. It shows the highly irregular city blocks and the range of street orientations, both common attributes of many historic cities]]
Street networks of old cities that grew organically, though admired for being picturesque, can be confusing for visitors but rarely for the original inhabitants (see plan). Similarly confusing to visitors are the plans of modern subdivisions with discontinuous and curvilinear streets. Change of street orientation, particularly when gradual or arbitrary, cannot be "mapped" in the mind. Impasses, crescents or [[cul-de-sacs]] frustrate the traveler especially when they are long, forcing an arduous retracing of steps.

Frequency of intersections, however, becomes also a disadvantage for pedestrians and bicycles. It disrupts the relaxed canter of walking and forces pedestrians repeatedly onto the road, a hostile, anxiety-generating territory. People with physical limitations or frailties, children and seniors for example, can find a regular walk challenging. For bicycles this disadvantage is accentuated as their normal speed is at least double that of pedestrians. Frequent stops negate the speed advantage and the physical benefit of bicycling and add to frustration. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Intersections are not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Most [[traffic collisions]] and injuries occur at intersections and the majority of the injuries to pedestrians crossing ''with'' the right of way.

A dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as [[Vauban, Freiburg]] and [[Village Homes]], Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.

Examining the issue of walkability, a recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a grid plan and conventional suburban layout in a [[fused grid]] layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of dedicated pedestrian paths. It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set, an environmental benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Xiongbing Jin (2010) "Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods", [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
Perceived and actual safety play a role in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an inaccurate reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents' decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured by the total number of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.

Recent studies have found higher traffic fatality rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448007/pdf/0931541.pdf | pmc=1448007 | pmid=12948977 | volume=93 | issue=9 | title=Urban sprawl as a risk factor in motor vehicle occupant and pedestrian fatalities | year=2003 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1541–5 | last1 = Ewing | first1 = R | last2 = Schieber | first2 = RA | last3 = Zegeer | first3 = CV | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903234004/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of this disparity is the result of distance from [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical]] facilities (hospitals are usually built in a fairly late stage of the development of a suburban area), it is clear{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} that the lower speeds encouraged by the frequency of intersections decrease the severity of accidents occurring on streets within a grid plan.

An earlier study&lt;ref&gt;Eran Ben-Joseph, Livability and Safety of Suburban Street Patterns: A Comparative Study (Berkeley, CA: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California, Working Paper 641, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighbourhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included culs-de-sac and crescents. The frequency of accidents was significantly higher in the grid neighbourhoods.

Two newer studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study,&lt;ref&gt;Using Macrolevel Collision Prediction Models in Road SafetyPlanning Applications Gordon R. Lovegrove and Tarek Sayed Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1950, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C., 2006, pp. 73–82&lt;/ref&gt; cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one.
A second study&lt;ref&gt;Sun, J. &amp; Lovegrove, G. (2009). Research Study on Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, External Research Project for CMHC, Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt; found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns.

A 2009 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dumbaugh | first1 = Eric | last2 = Rae | first2 = Robert | year = 2009 | title = Safe Urban Form: Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 75 | issue = 3| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase '''total and injurious crashes''' significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.

Stringent adherence to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology of the land is not taken into account. This may be unsafe for drivers, pedestrians and bicycles since it is more difficult to control speed and braking, particularly in winter conditions.

===Reconstruction and development===
One of the greatest difficulties with grid plans is their lack of specialisation, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city's main arteries. Often grid plans are found in [[Ribbon development|linear settlements]], with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their grid plans. Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.

In general, an '''imaginary line''' is any sort of [[line (geometry)|geometric line]] that has only an [[abstraction|abstract]] definition and does not physically exist. In fact, is used to identify a [[map]] properly.

As a [[geography|geographical]] concept, an imaginary line may serve as an arbitrary division, such as a [[border]]. It may also be a standardized marking that serves as a measurement or line of reference, such as a [[circle of latitude]] or the [[Prime Meridian]].

'''Levantine Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|اللَّهْجَةُ الشَّامِيَّة}}, {{transl|ar|''ʾal-lahǧatu š-šāmiyyah''}}, autonym: ''il-lahje š-šāmiyye'') is a broad [[variety of Arabic]] and the main [[Vernacular language|vernacular]] spoken [[Arabic]] of the eastern coastal strip of the [[Levantine Sea]] that includes parts of [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=e19/&gt;&lt;ref name="Versteegh 2001"&gt;[[Kees Versteegh|Versteegh, Kees]], ''The Arabic language'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; With numerous dialects and over 30 million native speakers worldwide,&lt;ref name=e19/&gt; it is considered one of the five major varieties of Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, Reem, ''Arabic sociolinguistics'', Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Versteegh 2001"/&gt; In the frame of the general [[diglossia]] status of the [[Arab world]], Levantine Arabic is used for daily spoken use, while most of the written and official documents and media use [[Modern Standard Arabic]].

== Classification ==
Levantine Arabic is most closely related to [[North Mesopotamian Arabic]], Anatolian Arabic, and [[Cypriot Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabic Language|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-7486-1436-2|location=|page=212|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics|last=Jastrow|first=Otto O.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9789004177024|location=|pages=|chapter=Anatolian Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies.

== Geographical distribution ==
Levantine Arabic is spoken in the fertile strip on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. To the east, in the desert, [[Northwest Arabian Arabic]] varieties are spoken by [[Bedouin]]s. The transition to [[Egyptian Arabic]] in the south via the [[Negev]] and [[Sinai Peninsula]], where Northwest Arabian Arabic is spoken and then the dialect of [[Sharqia Governorate]], was described by de Jong in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf de Jong, Characteristics of Bedouin dialects in southern Sinai: preliminary observations, in, Manfred Woidich, Martine Haak, Rudolf Erik de Jong, eds., ''Approaches to Arabic dialects: a collection of articles presented to Manfred Woidich on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday'', BRILL, 2004, pp.151-176&lt;/ref&gt; In this direction, the Egyptian city of [[Arish]] is the last one to display proper Levantine features. In a similar manner, the region of el-Karak announces Hijazi Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Heikki Palva, ''Sedentary and Bedouin Dialects in Contact: Remarks On Karaki and Salti Dialects in Jordan'', Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies vol 9 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the North, the limit between Gilit [[Mesopotamian Arabic]] starts from the Turkish border near el-Rāʿi, and [[Sabkhat al-Jabbul]] is the north-eastern limit of Levantine Arabic, which includes further south [[al-Qaryatayn]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Behnstedt, ''Sprachatlas von Syrien I, Kartenband &amp; Beiheft'', Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1997, 1037 &amp; 242 pages&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damascus]], and the [[Hauran]].

== History ==
Although small communities of Arabic speakers were present prior to the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], it is widely accepted that during the Roman and Byzantine periods, varieties of Greek-influenced [[Aramaic]] were the dominant spoken language of Palestine. The [[language shift]] from Aramaic to Arabic, both [[Semitic languages]], that began in the 7th century after the conquests, was not a sudden switch from one language to another, but a long process over several generations, likely with an extended period of bilingualism. Some communities, such as the [[Samaritans]], retained Aramaic well into the Muslim period, and a few small Aramaic-speaking villages had remained until the recent [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lai8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281|title=Semitic Languages in Contact|first=Mila|last=Neishtadt|editor-last=Butts|editor-first=Aaron|pages=280-281|publisher=[[Brill publishers]]|isbn=9004300147|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Old Arabic ===
Ancient [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] was home to a continuum of [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic]] languages in antiquity which stretched from the southern [[Levant]] to [[Yemen]]. The isoglosses associated with [[Arabic]] are clustered at the northern end of this continuum, in the northern [[Hejaz|Hijaz]] and the southern Levant. This may be in part due to a lack of documentation, but it is clear that Central Arabia was home to languages quite distinct from Arabic. Thus, Arabic can be said to have emerged in the second millennium BC and spread into the peninsula, replacing its sister languages on the Central Semitic continuum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=What is Ancient North Arabian?|url=https://www.academia.edu/33917069/What_is_Ancient_North_Arabian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary division between Arabic dialects in ancient times was between Northern Old Arabic, spoken in the southern Levant, and [[Old Hijazi]], spoken in the northern, and later central Hijaz. The main representatives of Northern Old Arabic were [[Safaitic]], [[Hismaic]], and [[Nabataean Arabic]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tens of thousands of graffiti in the Safaitic and Hismaic scripts cover the deserts of southern [[Syria]] and present-day [[Jordan]]. The Safaitic inscriptions sometimes exhibit the article ʾ(l), a shared areal isogloss with the Arabic substrate of the Nabataean inscriptions. Many Safaitic inscriptions exhibit all of the features typical of Arabic. The Hismaic script was used to compose two long texts in an archaic stage of Arabic before the language acquired the definite article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=Al-Jallad. 2017. Graeco-Arabica I: the southern Levant|url=https://www.academia.edu/7583140/Al-Jallad._2017._Graeco-Arabica_I_the_southern_Levant|journal=Arabic in Context|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of Old Hijazi ===
Before the mid-sixth century, the coda of the definite article almost never exhibits assimilation to the following coronals and its onset is consistently given with an /a/ vowel. By the mid-sixth century CE in the dialect of [[Petra]], the onset of the article and its vowel seem to have become weakened. There, the article is sometimes written as /el-/ or simply /l-/. A similar, but not identical, situation is found in the texts from the [[Islam|Islamic]] period. Unlike the pre-Islamic attestations, the coda of the article in the conquest Arabic assimilates to a following coronal consonant. The Arabic transcribed in the 1st century AH papyri clearly represents a different strand of the Arabic language, likely related to Old Hijazi and the QCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=Al-Jallad. 2017. The Arabic of the Islamic Conquests: Notes on Phonology and Morphology based on the Greek Transcriptions from the First Islamic Century|url=https://www.academia.edu/24938389/Al-Jallad._2017._The_Arabic_of_the_Islamic_Conquests_Notes_on_Phonology_and_Morphology_based_on_the_Greek_Transcriptions_from_the_First_Islamic_Century|journal=BSOAS|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Damascus]] Psalm Fragment, dated to the mid- to late 9th century but possibly earlier, provides a glimpse of the vernacular of at least one segment of Damascene society during that period. Its linguistic features also shed light on a pre-grammarian standard of Arabic and the dialect from which it sprung, likely Old Hijazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=Al-Jallad (preview) The Damascus Psalm Fragment: Middle Arabic and the Legacy of Old Ḥigāzī|url=https://www.academia.edu/36679776/Al-Jallad_preview_The_Damascus_Psalm_Fragment_Middle_Arabic_and_the_Legacy_of_Old_%E1%B8%A4ig%C4%81z%C4%AB|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Modern Levantine Arabic ===
The ''Compendio'' of Lucas Caballero (1709) contains a description of spoken Damascene Arabic in the early 1700s. In some respects, the data given in this manuscript correspond to modern Damascene Arabic. For example, the allomorphic variation between -''a''/-''e'' in the feminine suffix is essentially identical. In other respects, especially when it comes to insertion and deletion of vowels, it differs from the modern dialect. The presence of short vowels in /zibībih/ and /sifīnih/ point to an earlier stage of linguistic development, before elision led to the modern ''zbībe'' and ''sfīne'', though the orthography of the manuscript is in this respect unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otto|first=Zwartjes,|last2=Manfred|first2=Woidich,|title=Damascus Arabic According to the Compendio of Lucas Caballero (1709)|url=https://www.academia.edu/25153573/Damascus_Arabic_according_to_the_Compendio_of_Lucas_Caballero_1709_|journal=Middle Arabic and Mixed Arabic|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contact with Northwest Semitic ==
=== Canaanite ===
The existence of Hismaic and Safaitic varieties without a definite article strongly suggests that their ancestor lacked a morphological means of definiteness. The definite article entered these varieties through contact with [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] languages in the southern Levant. Evidence for such contact is given by a possibly bilingual North Arabian-[[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] inscription containing a prayer to the gods [[Milcom|Malkom]], [[Chemosh|Kemōš]], and [[Qos (deity)|Qaws]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Aramaic ===
There is evidence that a peripheral variety of Aramaic with archaic phonology existed in the southern Levant and possibly northern Arabia during the late first millennium BCE. This variety retained a velar/uvular realization of *''ṣ́'', as evidenced by an inscription with a prayer to the deity ''[[Ruda (deity)|Rqy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=Al-Jallad. 2016. New evidence from a Safaitic inscription for a late velar/uvular realization of ṣ́ in Aramaic|url=https://www.academia.edu/28674853/Al-Jallad._2016._New_evidence_from_a_Safaitic_inscription_for_a_late_velar_uvular_realization_of_%E1%B9%A3_in_Aramaic|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Aramaic features in early Islamic literature have necessarily been mediated by Christians and Aramaic has a longer history in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9UuBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Cultural History of Aramaic: From the Beginnings to the Advent of Islam|last=Gzella|first=Holger|date=2015-01-08|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004285101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nabataean Aramaic]] was extremely close to, but not identical with, Achaemenid [[Old Aramaic language|Official Aramaic]] and may have been connected with the wider speech area. The use of the direct object marker ''yt'' /yāt/ seems to have been taken over from a [[Western Aramaic languages|Western form of Aramaic]] with which the inhabitants of the Nabataean kingdom may have been in contact. It may have entered Nabataean via a Syrian or Palestinian dialect through [[Moab]] or the [[Hauran|Hawran]] area where Aramaic had a longer history and would supposedly have been spoken more widely.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The coexistence of Nabataean and [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]] in contracts from the [[Dead Sea]] show that Nabataeans were indeed exposed to other forms of Aramaic. The continuity of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, the emergence of [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan]] as well as [[Christian Palestinian Aramaic]] as written languages, and the eventual development of vocalization traditions makes it possible to define Western Aramaic as a dialect group more clearly in the later Roman period than before.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The degree to which Aramaic survived as a vernacular in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after the 8th century CE is difficult to assess. One may suppose that the [[Western Neo-Aramaic|modern Western Aramaic]] dialects still spoken in the Christian mountain villages of [[Maaloula|Maʿlūla]], Baḫʿa, and [[Jubb'adin|Ǧubb ʿAdīn]] in the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains|Antilebanon]] once have evolved from the same linguistic matrix as the older, now extinct Western Aramaic varieties that appear in the inscriptions and manuscript traditions of late [[Syria Palaestina|Roman Palestine]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The existence of Aramaic substrate elements in [[Palestinian Arabic]], the supplanting language of Palestinian Aramaic dialects, is widely accepted and is especially evident in the lexical component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neishtadt|first=Mila|title=Neishtadt, Mila. “The Lexical Component in the Aramaic Substrate of Palestinian Arabic,” in Aaron Michael Butts (ed.), Semitic Languages in Contact (Leiden: 2015), 280-310.|url=https://www.academia.edu/17091277/Neishtadt_Mila._The_Lexical_Component_in_the_Aramaic_Substrate_of_Palestinian_Arabic_in_Aaron_Michael_Butts_ed._Semitic_Languages_in_Contact_Leiden_2015_280-310|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SGML]], [[HTML]] and [[XML]] documents, the logical constructs known as ''character data'' and ''attribute values'' consist of sequences of [[character (computing)|character]]s, in which each character can manifest directly (representing itself), or can be represented by a series of characters called a ''character reference'', of which there are two types: a ''[[numeric character reference]]'' and a '''''character entity reference'''''. This article lists the character entity references that are valid in HTML and XML documents.

A character entity reference refers to the content of a named entity. An entity declaration is created by using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;!ENTITY name "value"&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax in a [[Document type definition|Document Type Definition]] (DTD).

== Character reference overview ==

A ''numeric character reference'' refers to a character by its [[Universal Character Set]]/[[Unicode]] ''code point'', and uses the format:
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#&lt;/code&gt;''nnnn''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
or
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x&lt;/code&gt;''hhhh''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

where ''nnnn'' is the code point in [[decimal]] form, and ''hhhh'' is the code point in [[hexadecimal]] form. The ''x'' must be lowercase in XML documents. The ''nnnn'' or ''hhhh'' may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The ''hhhh'' may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style.

In contrast, a ''character entity reference'' refers to a character by the name of an ''[[SGML entity|entity]]'' which has the desired character as its ''replacement text''. The entity must either be predefined (built into the markup language) or explicitly declared in a [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD). The format is the same as for any entity reference:
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;''name''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

where ''name'' is the case-sensitive name of the entity. The semicolon is required.

==Standard public entity sets for characters==
'''ISO Entity Sets''': [[SGML]] supplied a comprehensive set of entity declarations for characters widely used in Western technical and reference publishing, for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts.  The [[American Mathematical Society]] also contributed entities for mathematical characters.

'''HTML Entity Sets''': Early versions of [[HTML]] built in small subsets of these, relating to characters found in three  Western 8-bit fonts.

'''MathML Entity Sets''':  The [[W3C]] developed a set of entity declarations for [[MathML]] characters.

'''XML Entity Sets''': The [[W3C]] MathML Working Group took over maintenance of the ISO public entity sets, combined with the MathML and documents them in [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/ XML Entity Definitions for Characters]. This set can support the requirements of [[XHTML]], [[MathML]] and as an input to future versions of HTML.

'''HTML 5''': [[HTML5]] adopts the XML entities as [http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#named-character-references named character references], however it restates them without reference to their sources and does not group them into sets. The HTML 5 specification additionally provides mappings from the names to Unicode character sequences using [[JSON]].

Numerous other entity sets have been developed for special requirements, and for major and minority scripts. However, the advent of [[Unicode]] has largely superseded them.

==Predefined entities in XML==

The XML specification does not use the term "character entity" or "character entity reference". The XML specification defines five "predefined entities" representing special characters, and requires that all XML processors honor them. The entities can be explicitly declared in a DTD, as well, but if this is done, the replacement text must be the same as the built-in definitions. XML also allows other named entities of any size to be defined on a per-document basis.

The table below lists the five XML predefined entities. The "Name" column mentions the entity's name. The "Character" column shows the character. To render the character, the format &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;name;&lt;/code&gt; is used; for example, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; renders as &amp;amp;. The "Unicode code point" column cites the character via standard UCS/Unicode "U+" notation, which shows the character's code point in hexadecimal. The decimal equivalent of the code point is then shown in parentheses. The "Standard" column indicates the first version of XML that includes the entity. The "Description" column cites the character via its canonical UCS/Unicode name, in English.

==Character entity references in HTML==
{{update|HTML 5|date=July 2018}}
The HTML 4 DTDs define 252 named entities, references to which act as mnemonic aliases for certain Unicode characters. The HTML 4 specification requires the use of the standard DTDs and does not allow users to define additional entities.

In the table below, the "Standard" column indicates the first version of the HTML DTD that defines the character entity reference. HTML 4.01 does not provide any new character references.

To use one of these character entity references in an HTML or XML document, enter an ampersand followed by the entity name and a semicolon, e.g., '''&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;''' for the ampersand ("&amp;").

Notes:
{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=
&lt;ref name=DTD&gt;
DTD: the full public DTD name (where the character entity name is defined) is actually mapped from one of the following three defined named entities:
* ''HTMLlat1'' maps to:
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin 1//EN//HTML"&lt;/code&gt; in HTML (the DTD is implicitly defined, no system URI is needed);
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin 1 for XHTML//EN" "&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-lat1.ent&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; in XHTML 1.0;
* ''HTMLsymbol'' maps to:
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbols//EN//HTML"&lt;/code&gt; in HTML (the DTD is implicitly defined, no system URI is needed);
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbols for XHTML//EN" "&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-symbol.ent&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; in XHTML 1.0;
* ''HTMLspecial'' maps to:
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Special//EN//HTML"&lt;/code&gt; in HTML (the DTD is implicitly defined, no system URI is needed);
** &lt;code&gt;PUBLIC "-//W3C//ENTITIES Special for XHTML//EN" "&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-special.ent&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; in XHTML 1.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=ISOsubset&gt;Old ISO subset: these are old (documented) character subsets used in legacy encodings before the unification within ISO 10646.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Description&gt;Description: the standard ISO 10646 and Unicode character name is displayed first for each character, with non-standard but legacy synonyms shown in italics between parentheses after an equal sign.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=spaces&gt;spaces: a blue background is used to display each space's width.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=proposed&gt;ISO proposed: these characters have been standardized in ISO 10646 after the release of HTML 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=ligature&gt;ligature: this is a standard misnomer as this is a separate character in some languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=black&gt;black: here it seems to mean ''filled'' as opposed to ''hollow''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=alefsym&gt;&lt;code&gt;alefsym&lt;/code&gt;: 'alef symbol' is ''not'' the same as U+05D0 'Hebrew letter alef', although the same glyph could be used to depict both characters.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=lArr&gt;&lt;code&gt;lArr&lt;/code&gt;: ISO 10646 does not say that 'leftwards double arrow' is the same as the 'is implied by' arrow, but also does not have any other character for that function. So &lt;code&gt;lArr&lt;/code&gt; can be used for 'is implied by' as ISOtech suggests.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=rArr&gt;&lt;code&gt;rArr&lt;/code&gt;: ISO 10646 does not say that 'rightwards double arrow' is the 'implies' character but does not have another character with this function, so &lt;code&gt;rArr&lt;/code&gt; can be used for 'implies' as ISOtech suggests.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=prod&gt;&lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt;: 'n-ary product' is ''not'' the same character as U+03A0 'Greek capital letter Pi' though the same glyph might be used for both.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sum&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;: 'n-ary summation' is ''not'' the same character as U+03A3 'Greek capital letter Sigma' though the same glyph might be used for both.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sim&gt;&lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt;: 'tilde operator' is ''not'' the same character as U+007E 'tilde', although the same glyph might be used to represent both.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sup&gt;&lt;code&gt;sup&lt;/code&gt;: note that &lt;code&gt;nsup&lt;/code&gt;, U+2283 'not a superset of', is not covered by the Symbol font encoding and is not included. Should it be, for symmetry? It is in the ISOamsn subset.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=perp&gt;&lt;code&gt;perp&lt;/code&gt;: Unicode only defines U+22A5 as the "up tack". The Unicode symbol for "perpendicular" is U+27C2. The two symbols look similar, but are separate in Unicode. However, HTML uses U+22A5 as its "perpendicular" symbol. This is a discrepancy between HTML and Unicode. As well, the U+22A4 character (the "down tack" symbol) rendered in a browser such as [[Firefox]] 3.6 can match the [[font]] of either "up tack" or "perpendicular", but not both, depending on whether a fixed-width or a proportional font is used. When viewed in Firefox 3.6, the symbols rendered in the order U+22A5, U+22A4, U+27C2 in a proportional font: ⊥ ⊤ ⟂ and a fixed width one: &lt;code&gt;⊥ ⊤ ⟂&lt;/code&gt;, shows that the "down tack" has a similar look to U+22A5 (HTML's "perpendicular") in the first case but matches U+27C2 in the second. This exemplifies the difficulties of the [[semiotics]] involved in interpreting [[glyphs]], [[symbols]] and [[Character (symbol)|characters]] generally.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sdot&gt;&lt;code&gt;sdot&lt;/code&gt;: 'dot operator' is ''not'' the same character as U+00B7 'middle dot'.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=lang&gt;&lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt;: U+2329 'left-pointing angle bracket' is ''not'' the same character as U+003C 'less than', U+2039 'single left-pointing angle quotation mark', U+27E8 'mathematical left angle bracket', or U+3008 'left angle bracket'. In HTML 5.0, &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; has been remapped to U+27E8 'mathematical left angle bracket', as U+2329 'left-pointing angle bracket' has been marked deprecated in Unicode ([https://www.unicode.org/review/pr-122.html Unicode.org - Proposal for Additional Deprecated Characters]).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=rang&gt;&lt;code&gt;rang&lt;/code&gt;: U+232A 'right-pointing angle bracket' is ''not'' the same character as U+003E 'greater than', U+203A 'single right-pointing angle quotation mark', U+27E9 'mathematical right angle bracket', or U+3009 'right angle bracket'. In HTML 5.0, &lt;code&gt;rang&lt;/code&gt; has been remapped to U+27E9 'mathematical right angle bracket', as U+232A 'right-pointing angle bracket' has been marked deprecated in Unicode ([https://www.unicode.org/review/pr-122.html Unicode.org - Proposal for Additional Deprecated Characters]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entities representing special characters in XHTML==
The [[XHTML]] [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s explicitly declare 253 entities (including the [[#Predefined_entities_in_XML|5 predefined entities of XML 1.0]]) whose expansion is a single character, which can therefore be informally referred to as "character entities". These (with the exception of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; entity) have the same names and represent the same characters as the [[#Character entity references in HTML|252 character entities in HTML]]. Also, by virtue of being [[XML]], XHTML documents may reference the predefined &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; entity, which is not one of the 252 character entities in HTML. Additional entities of any size may be defined on a per-document basis. However, the usability of entity references in XHTML is affected by how the document is being processed:

* If the document is read by a conforming HTML processor, then only the 252 HTML character entities can safely be used. The use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; or custom entity references may not be supported and may produce unpredictable results.
* If the document is read by an XML [[parser]] that does not or cannot read external entities, then only the five built-in XML character entities ([[#Predefined entities in XML|see above]]) can safely be used, although other entities may be used if they are declared in the internal DTD subset.
* If the document is read by an XML parser that does read external entities, then the five built-in XML character entities can safely be used. The other 248 HTML character entities can be used as long as the XHTML DTD is accessible to the parser at the time the document is read. Other entities may also be used if they are declared in the internal DTD subset.

Because of the special &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; case mentioned above, only &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will work in all processing situations.

'''''Mathilda'' Valeria Beatrix d'Orozco''' also by marriage known as '''Cenami''', '''Montgomery-Cederhjelm''' and '''Gyllenhaal''', (14 June 1796 – 19 October 1863) was a Swedish (originally Spanish-Italian) [[nobility|noble]] and [[salon (gathering)|salonist]], composer, poet, writer, singer, amateur actress and [[harpsichordist]]. In Sweden, she is perhaps most known under the name Mathilda Montgomery-Cederhjelm.

==Biography==
Mathilda was born in Italy to the Spanish [[ambassador]] in Milan, [[Count]] Nicolas Blasco d'Orozco and Sabina Lederer. She was first married to [[marquess]] Cenami, Stable Master of the court of the sister of [[Napoleon]], Princess [[Elisa Bonaparte]]. She was widowed before she was twenty. In 1817 in [[Vienna]], she married second to the Swedish Count [[colonel]] Josias Montgomery-Cederhjelm (d. 1825), with whom she had four children. In 1839, she married the Swedish [[Baron]] Carl Alexander Fredrik Gyllenhaal.

In connection with her second marriage (1817), Mathilda d'Orozco moved to Sweden, where she was to live the rest of her life. In Sweden, she became a noted socialite in the capital, later called ''"one of the most noted ornaments in the salons of high society during the first happy and vibrant period of the reign of [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles XIV John]]"'' (reign 1818–1844). Used to the warmer climate of Italy, she once remarked : ''"God was angry when he created the Swedish climate!"'' She was described as a warm person with great charm and talent within many fields of art, which she developed in her hectic social life. As a member of the nobility, she was presented at the royal court, and took part in the court life of King Charles John and Queen [[Désirée Clary|Désirée]], where she became a centre of the court's entertainment. She was an admired, versatile singer, who sometimes accompanied her singing by playing the harp; she also took part in the [[amateur theatre]] of the royal court, where she was described as an actress ''hors ligne'', and was seen as a natural, fairylike dancer. The Crown Prince, [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar]], as well as the British ambassador [[John Bloomfield, 2nd Baron Bloomfield]] were counted among her admirers. After her third marriage (1839), she withdrew from society life and moved to her husband's estate out in the countryside, except for annual visits to the [[Norrtälje]] seaside resort.  She died, aged 67, at [[Stora Ekeby]], [[Rytterne]], Sweden.

[[Gustaf Lagerbjelke]] dedicated to her the poem "L'une et l'autre".

'''Multimedia'''  is [[content (media)|content]] that uses a combination of different [[content format|content forms]] such as text, audio, images, animations, video and [[interactive]] content. Multimedia contrasts with [[Media (communication)|media]] that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by [[information]] content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.  Multimedia devices are [[electronic media]] devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from [[mixed media]] in [[fine art]]; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with [[interactive media|interactive multimedia]], and "hypermedia" was an application of multimedia.

== Terminology ==
The term ''multimedia'' was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later '[[Bobb Goldsteinn]]') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at [[Southampton]], Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badii|first=Atta|last2=Fuschi|first2=David|last3=Khan|first3=Ali|last4=Adetoye|first4=Adedayo|date=2009-11-09|title=Accessibility-by-Design: A Framework for Delivery-Context-Aware Personalised Media Content Re-purposing|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|journal=HCI and Usability for e-Inclusion|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=209–226|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|isbn=9783642103070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.switched.com/2010/06/03/tech-art-history-part-2/|title=Tech Art History, Part| author= Matthew Zuras| publisher= Switched| date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ''multi-media'' music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Albarino, "Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton," ''Variety'', August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

[[File:Ford Show 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Multimedia (multi-image) setup for the 1988 Ford New Car Announcement Show, August 1987, Detroit, MI]] In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of [[Multi-Image|multi-projector slide shows]] timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s 'multimedia' took on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of ''Multimedia: Making It Work'', Tay Vaughan declared "Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is ''interactive multimedia''. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes ''hypermedia''."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Tay, 1993, Multimedia: Making It Work (first edition, {{ISBN|0-07-881869-9}}), Osborne/McGraw-Hill, Berkeley, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German language society [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]] recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of [[Word of the year (Germany)|German 'Word of the Year']] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l23/l0/F.html#featuredEntry ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German) [[Spiegel Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute summed up its rationale by stating "[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1–7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, ''multimedia'' refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of [[education software|educational]] multimedia [[CD-ROM]]s.

The term "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. ''[[Video]]'' is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of ''"[[footage]]"''  which is used to distinguish motion [[photography]] from ''"[[animation]]"'' of [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish [[:wiktionary:static|static]] media from [[:wiktionary:active|active]] media. In the [[fine arts]], for example, [[Leda Luss Luyken]]'s [[ModulArt]] brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making ''ModulArt'' an [[interactive]] multimedia form of art. [[Performing arts]] may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and [[theatrical property|props]] are multiple forms of both content and media.

== Major characteristics ==
'''Multimedia presentations''' may be viewed by person on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[Image projector|projected]], [[transmitted]], or played locally with a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]] electronic media technology. Digital [[online]] multimedia may be downloaded or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.

'''Multimedia games and simulations''' may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online [[Computer networking|network]], or locally with an offline computer, [[game console|game system]], or [[simulator]].

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.

[[File:Classical spectacular laser effects.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Laser lighting display|lasershow]] is a live multimedia performance.]]
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. [[Online]] multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] [[User innovation|end-user innovation]] and [[personalized|personalization]] on multiple forms of content over time.  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, [[haptic technology]] enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of [[taste]] and [[odor|smell]] may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into '''linear''' and '''non-linear''' categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a [[movie theater|cinema presentation]];
*Non-linear uses [[interactivity]] to control progress as with a [[video game]] or self-paced [[computer-based training]]. [[Hypermedia]] is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia [[presentation]]s can be '''live''' or '''recorded''':
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a [[Spatial navigation|navigation system]];
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/application ==
[[File:Steven Koonin BP 2005-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|A presentation using [[Microsoft PowerPoint|Powerpoint]]. Corporate presentations may combine all forms of media content.]]
Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[art]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[business]], scientific [[research]] and [[Visual thinking|spatial temporal applications]]. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
[[Creative industries]] use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to [[journalism]], to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.

==== Commercial uses ====
Much of the electronic [[old media|old]] and [[new media]] used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in [[advertising]]. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by [[creative services]] firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for [[governmental services]] and [[Nonprofit|nonprofit services]] applications as well.

==== Entertainment and fine arts ====
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop [[special effect]]s in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some [[video game]]s also use multimedia features.
Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called ''interactive multimedia''.
In the [[arts]] there are [[multimedia art]]ists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be [[Peter Greenaway]] who is melding [[Film|cinema]] with [[opera]] and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an [[art gallery]]. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.

=== Education ===
In [[education]], multimedia is used to produce [[computer-based training]] courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. [[Edutainment]] is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. [[cognitive load]] and [[multimedia learning]].

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lboro.academia.edu/DRoberts|title=David Roberts {{!}} Loughborough University - Academia.edu|website=lboro.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.

==== Educational technology ====
&lt;p&gt;Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in [[multi-disciplinary]] settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology &lt;ref name=":032"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik and Agarwal|first=S. and A.|date=October 2012|title=Use of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology

Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of [[new media]] and [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andresen and Brink|first=Brent and Katja|date=2013|title=Multimedia in Education Curriculum|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002241/224187e.pdf|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizaiton|volume=|pages=140|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and [[digital media]] due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Betty|title=Anticipating the Impact of Multimedia in Education: Lessons from the Literature|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6401710/K26499__.PDF|journal=Computers in Adult Education and Training|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, [[interactive media]], communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. 

First introduced to [[social work]] education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. 

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. 

Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, "people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone." According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Weiyan|last2=Fang|first2=Fan|date=November 2008|title=Optimization of Multimedia English Teaching

Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on [[Howard Gardner|Gardner]]’s theory of the “[[Motivation in second-language learning|socio-educational model]] of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]].

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to [[The Seattle Globalist]], is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as [[Mojo (mobile journalist)|mojos]], from ''mo''bile ''jo''urnalist.

=== Engineering ===
[[Software engineer]]s may use multimedia in [[Simulations#Computer simulators|computer simulations]] for anything from entertainment to [[training]] such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for [[Graphical user interface|software interfaces]] are often done as a collaboration between [[creative professional]]s and software engineers.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===
In [[mathematics|mathematical]] and scientific [[research]], multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a [[scientist]] can look at a [[Molecular modelling|molecular model]] of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Multimedia]]''.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], [[Physician|doctors]] can get trained by looking at a virtual [[surgery]] or they can simulate how the [[human body]] is affected by [[disease]]s spread by [[virus]]es and [[bacterium|bacteria]] and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as [[virtual surgery|virtual surgeries]] also help doctors to get practical training.

== Associations and conferences ==

'''Pacaraos Quechua''' is a variety of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] spoken until the middle of the 20th century in the community of [[Pacaraos]] ([[Pacaraos District]]) in the [[Peru]]vian [[Lima Region]] in the [[Chancay]] valley up to 3000 m above sea level.

The Quechua of Pacaraos was investigated by the Dutch linguist [[Willem F. H. Adelaar]] in the 1970s, when it was still spoken by women in their sixties and older. Around the year 2000 there were possibly no active speakers left, but there are probably some people with passive knowledge who grew up with their grandparents.

A peculiarity of Pacaraos Quechua is that it does not belong to any of the two main branches of the Quechua family ([[Waywash]] and [[Wampuy]]). In contrast to other Quechua varieties, the Quechua of Pacaraos has phonemic word accent, which is either on the penultimate or the ultimate syllable. Like the Waywash varieties but in contrast to Wampuy, it distinguishes between short and long vowels.

The first person of the verb and the possessive form for nouns is expressed by accent on the last syllable and addition of -y, e.g.: tarpuy "to sow" (root: tarpu-) - tarpúy "I sow" (cf. Waywash: tarpuu, Wampuy: tarpuni) - tarpunki "you sow" - tarpun "he/she sows".

The vocabulary of Pacaraos Quechua corresponds in part with [[Southern Quechua]] (e.g. kunan "now"), and partially with Waywash (e.g. yarku- "to rise", akshu, "potato"). Furthermore there are many loanwords from [[Jaqaru]] or other [[Aymaran languages]] (e.g. achara "old", uni- "to hate", wilka "sun"). Some words of Pacaraos Quechua are unique, e.g. arapu- "to answer", chaqpa "clothes", rapqa- "both".

Pacaraos Quechua shares many suffixes with Waywash, e.g. -ĉaw "in, on, at" or -piqta, -piq "from, out of". The accusative suffix -kta has a long form -kta and a short form -k, the latter being combined with final stress. The negation suffix -su (&lt;*-chu) is often shortened to -s.

The gerund is expressed with -shpa, as in all Wampuy varieties.

The /q/ of Proto-Quechua is a fricative, at the end of a syllable or near a voiceless consonant it is voiceless [x] and otherwise voiced [g]. In contrast to other Quechua varianties it distinguishes between a simple [r] (tap, e.g. rapqan "they both") and a vibrant [rr] (e.g. rraqak "girl"). As in some dialects of [[Ancash Quechua]] /č/ has become [s] (e.g. say "that") and /s/ has turned to [h] (e.g. huti "name", haĉa "plant", rrahu "snow"). The [[retroflex]] /ĉ/ has been preserved.

[[Image:PentelPD345MechanicalPencil.jpg|right|thumb|A 0.5mm Pentel PD345|275px]]
The '''Pentel PD345''' is a [[mechanical pencil]]. It was first produced by [[Pentel]] in the 1980s, and is now available primarily online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pentel Online Store|url=http://www.pentel.com/store/quicker-clicker-mechanical-pencil-1640|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design features include a lead advance button on the side of the pencil body, a housing capable of holding dozens of leads at once, and a relatively wide eraser for heavy erasing. Due to the side mounted lead advance button, the pencil was marketed as the "Quicker Clicker" as the user didn't have to stop writing to advance the lead.

The successor to this pencil is the PD345-A with a wider, "[[ergonomic]]" grip and a redesigned tip so that the lead would not break as easily. Despite the original PD345 being widely replaced by the A variant, many users prefer it, finding it more comfortable and long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Reviews for Classic PD345|url=https://www.amazon.com/Classic-Pentel-Mechanical-Transparent-Original/product-reviews/B007AJWWSW/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=byRankDescending|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other classic designs from this period are the [[Pentel_PS535 | PS535]] and the [[Pentel_PS513 | PS513]].

'''[[Pliny the Younger]]''', the Roman governor of [[Bithynia et Pontus]] (now in modern Turkey) wrote a [[Epistulae (Pliny)|letter]] to [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] [[Trajan]] around 112 AD and asked for counsel on dealing with [[Early Christians|Christians]]. The letter (''Epistulae'' X.96) details an account of how Pliny conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asks for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated.&lt;ref name=Phil/&gt;&lt;ref name=Benko5/&gt;

Neither Pliny nor Trajan mentions the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to what that crime could be, but a likely element may be the stubborn refusal of Christians to worship Roman gods; making them appear as objecting to Roman rule.&lt;ref name=Heyman/&gt;&lt;ref name=EveFerguson/&gt;

Pliny states that he gives Christians multiple chances to affirm they are innocent and if they refuse three times, they are executed. Pliny states that his investigations have revealed nothing on the Christians' part but harmless practices and "depraved, excessive superstition." However, Pliny seems concerned about the rapid spread of this "superstition"; and views Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition.&lt;ref name=EveFerguson/&gt;

The letter is the first pagan account to refer to Christianity, providing key information on early Christian beliefs and practices and how these were viewed and dealt with by the Romans.&lt;ref name=Benko5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehrmab57&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman (Sep 23, 1999) {{ISBN|0195124731}} Oxford UP pages 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St. Croix" /&gt; The letter and Trajan's reply indicate that at the time of its writing there was no systematic and official Empire-wide [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]].&lt;ref name=Rives/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss145/&gt; Trajan's reply also offers valuable insight into the relationship between Roman provincial governors and Emperors  and indicates that at the time Christians were not sought out or tracked down by imperial orders, and that persecutions could be local and sporadic.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

== Context and overview==

===Background===
[[File:Bithynie et le Pont dans l'Empire romain.png|thumb|180px|Location of  [[Bithynia et Pontus]] within the Roman Empire]]

Pliny the Younger was the governor of [[Bithynia et Pontus]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast of Anatolia [[Turkey]]; having arrived there around September 111 as the representative of Roman Emperor [[Trajan]].&lt;ref name=Phil&gt;''The Early Christian Church'' Volume 1 by Philip Carrington (Aug 11, 2011) {{ISBN|0521166411}} Cambridge Univ Press page 429&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny likely wrote the letters from [[Amisus]] before his term ended in January 113.&lt;ref name=PK274/&gt; The origin of Christianity in that region is not known, but it has not been associated with [[Apostle Paul]]'s travels.&lt;ref name=Phil/&gt; Given the [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Peter|reference to Bithynia]] in the opening of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] (which dates to the 60s) Christianity in the region may have had some Petrine associations through [[Silas|Sylvanus]].&lt;ref name=Phil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New American Commentary: 1, 2 Peter, Jude'' by [[Thomas R. Schreiner]] (Sep 1, 2003) {{ISBN|0805401377}} page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 111 Bithynia et Pontus was known for being in disorder, and Pliny was selected by Trajan because of his legal training and his past experience.&lt;ref name=Benko5&gt;'' Pagan Rome and the Early Christians'' by Stephen Benko (1 Jul 1986) {{ISBN|0253203856}} pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny was familiar with the region, having defended two of their proconsuls for extortion in the Senate, one case being around AD 103.&lt;ref name=PK274&gt;Paul Krestez "Pliny, Trojan and the Christians" in ''Hitler und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' (Sep 1979) edited by  Hildegard Temporini, {{ISBN|3110078228}} page 274&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians, and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions, and saved his letters and Trajan's replies.&lt;ref name=Benko5/&gt; The way he expressed his lack of familiarity with the procedure may indicate that such prosecutions against Christians had taken place before (namely in Rome), but Pliny had not been involved in them.&lt;ref name=Benko5/&gt;

As governor, Pliny held large influence over all of the residents of his province.&lt;ref name=Barnes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study|year=1971|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=143–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true in the legal treatment of Christians. The Roman legal construct of [[Roman litigation|''cognitio extra ordinem'']] afforded governors a large amount of discretion in deciding legal cases.&lt;ref name="St. Croix"&gt;{{cite journal|last=St. Croix|first=G.E.M|title=Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?|journal=Past &amp; Present|date=Nov 1963|volume=26|pages=6–38|jstor=649902|doi=10.1093/past/26.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of Christians===
Prior to the 249 [[Decian persecution|Decius edict]] which would require all inhabitants of the Roman Empire to sacrifice to the Roman gods, the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] was based on local determinations.&lt;ref name=Rives&gt;J. B. Rives,  ''The Decree of Decius and the Religion of Empire'' The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 89, (1999), pp. 135-154 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/300738?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102061141227]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss145&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss |first=Candida |authorlink=Candida Moss |title=''[[The Myth of Persecution]]'' |year= 2013|publisher= HarperOne [[HarperCollins]]|location= New York |isbn=978-0-06-210452-6 |page=145 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Barnes]] characterized the situation by stating: "Actual persecution…was local, sporadic, almost random".&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; During this period, individual governors treated Christians very differently depending on the public and social issues, e.g. [[Tertullian]] wrote that no Christian blood was shed in Africa prior to 180.&lt;ref name="St. Croix" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rives/&gt;

Although it is clear that Pliny executed Christians, neither Pliny nor Trajan mention the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to this question.&lt;ref name=Heyman&gt;''The Power of Sacrifice: Roman and Christian Discourses in Conflict'' by George Heyman (Nov 2007) {{ISBN|0813214890}} pages xii-ix&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's response to Pliny makes it clear that being known as a "Christian" was sufficient for judicial action.&lt;ref name=Heyman/&gt;

Everett Ferguson states that the charges against Christians by Pliny may have been partly based on the "secret crimes" associated with Christianity, later characterized by [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] as atheism, cannibalistic feasts and incest.&lt;ref name=EveFerguson/&gt; The cannibalistic feasts and incest charges were based on misunderstanding of the [[Eucharist]]ic act and Christians being "brothers and sisters", even after marriage. However, the charge of atheism related to the failure to worship the state gods, and made Christianity a superstition and not a religion.&lt;ref name=EveFerguson&gt;''Backgrounds of Early Christianity'' by Everett Ferguson (Aug 19, 2003) {{ISBN|0802822215}} pages 504-596&lt;/ref&gt; George Heyman states that the refusal of Christians to participate in sacrificial rituals that honored the emperor and instead follow their own sacrificial rhetoric and practices conflicted with the Roman forms of social control, making them an undesirable minority.&lt;ref name=Heyman/&gt; Ferguson states that Pliny viewed the obstinacy (''[[contumacia]]'') of Christians as much of a threat to Roman rule and order as the divergence of their beliefs from the Romans; and considered Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition.&lt;ref name=EveFerguson/&gt;

==Letter and response==

=== Pliny's Letter to Trajan ===
{{Main article|Epistulae (Pliny)}}

==== Opening Questions ====
[[File:Pline le Jeune Lettres I Panckoucke 1826.djvu|thumb|150px|Letters of Pliny the Younger, Paris, 1826. (Click to read)]]
Pliny opens the letter (sections 1-4) with questions to Trajan concerning trials of Christians brought before him, since he says he has never been present at any trials of Christians. This may indicate that previous trials had taken place and that Pliny was unaware of any existing edicts under Trajan for prosecuting Christians.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, ''The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 694.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has three main questions: 
:* Should any distinction be made by the age of the Christian? Should the very young be treated differently from mature people? 
:* Does denying being a Christian mean the accused is pardoned? 
:* Is the “name” of Christianity itself enough to condemn the accused or is it the crimes associated with being a Christian? (''Nomen ipsum si flagitiis careat an flagitia cohaerentia nomini puniantur.'')

[[A.N. Sherwin-White]] states that “When the practice of a sect was banned...indictment of the ''nomen'' (“name”), i.e. of membership of a cult group, sufficed to secure conviction. This looked uncommonly like religious persecution to the victims themselves, but the underlying ground remained the ''flagitia'' (“shameful acts”) supposed to be inseparable from the practice of the cult.”&lt;ref name="A.N. Sherwin-White, 1966"&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, ''The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 696.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trial Format====
Pliny gives an account of how the trials are conducted and the various verdicts (sections 4-6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, for a total of three times, threatening them with death if they continue to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he has no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (''obstinatio'') and stubbornness, (''pertinacia'') deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, ''The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 699.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published anonymous document and not by Pliny nor the empire.

There were three categories of accused Pliny mentions with corresponding verdicts. If the accused denied that they had ever been a Christian, then once they had prayed to the Roman gods (in words dictated by Pliny himself), offered incense and wine to images of Trajan and the gods, and cursed Christ – which Pliny says true Christians are unable to do - they were then discharged. Accused who were at one point Christians but had quit the religion also followed the aforementioned procedure and were let go. Sherwin-White says the procedure was approved by Trajan but it was not a way to “compel conformity to the state religion or imperial cult,” which was a voluntary practice.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, ''The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who confessed to being Christians three times were executed.

==== Practices of Christians ====
[[File:Eucharistic bread.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Depiction of Christian [[Eucharistic]] bread, [[Catacomb of Callixtus]], 3rd century]]
Pliny then details the practices of Christians (sections 7-10): he says that they meet on a certain day before light where they gather and sing hymns to Christ as to a god. They all bind themselves by oath, "not to some crimes", says Pliny, as though that is what he would have expected; rather, they pledge ''not'' to commit any crimes such as fraud, theft, or adultery, and subsequently share a meal of "ordinary and innocent food". Pliny says, however, that all of these practices were abandoned by the Christians after Pliny forbade any political associations (''hetaeriai'' or “fraternities”). These clubs were banned because Trajan saw them as a “natural breeding ground for grumbling” about both civic life and political affairs. One such instance of a banned club was a firemen’s association; likewise, Christianity was seen as a political association that could be potentially harmful to the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Wilken, ''The Christians as the Romans Saw Them'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Christians seem to have willingly complied with the edict and halted their practices.

Pliny adds that he felt it necessary to investigate further by having two female slaves called deaconesses tortured, which was standard procedure in Roman interrogation of slaves, and discovered nothing but "depraved, excessive superstition" (''superstitio''). By using this word instead of ''religio'', religion, Pliny is "denigrating the Christians' position"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss |first=Candida |authorlink=Candida Moss |title=''The Myth of Persecution'' |year= 2013|publisher= HarperOne [[HarperCollins]]|location= New York |isbn=978-0-06-210452-6 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was outside the religious practices of Rome.&lt;ref name="Isaac2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin H. Isaac|title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA466|accessdate=27 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12598-5|pages=466–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent abandonment of the pagan temples by Christians was a threat to the ''pax deorum'' (the harmony or accord between the divine and humans), and political subversion by new religious groups was feared, which was treated as  a potential crime.&lt;ref name="Warrior2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie M. Warrior|title=Roman Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15eoNRxOrN8C&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=27 March 2013|date=16 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82511-5|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny ends the letter by saying that Christianity is endangering people of every age and rank and has spread not only through the cities, but also through the rural villages as well (''neque tantum...sed etiam''), but that it will be possible to check it. He argues for his procedure to Trajan by saying that the temples and religious festivals, which before had been deserted, are now flourishing again and that there is a rising demand for sacrificial animals once more – a dip and rise which A.N. Sherwin-White believes is an exaggeration of the toll Christianity had taken on the traditional cult.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Sherwin-White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 710.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trajan’s response===
[[File:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Trajan]] statue, [[Glyptothek]], Munich]]
Trajan’s short reply to Pliny overall affirms Pliny’s procedure and details four orders: (1) Do not seek out the Christians for trial. (2) If the accused are guilty of being Christian, then they must be punished. (3) If the accused deny they are Christians and show proof that they are not by worshipping the gods, then they will be pardoned. (4) Pliny should not allow anonymous accusations. Leonard L. Thompson calls the policy “double-edged,” since, “on the one hand, Christians were not hunted down. They were tried only if accusations from local provincials were brought against them. But if accused and convicted, then Christians...were killed simply for being Christians.”&lt;ref&gt;Leonard L. Thompson, “Ordinary Lives,” in ''Reading the Book of Revelation'', ed. David L. Barr (Leiden: Brill Academic, 2004), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Pliny’s view of Christians was not necessarily persecution but rather Christians were only executed when they were brought before him at trial and confessed; however, pardons were also given to those who denied such charges. Ste. Croix says the recommended course of action “was ‘accusatory’ and not ‘inquisitorial,’” so that it was never the governors themselves but instead private, local accusers (''[[delator]]es'') who brought forth accusations.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.M. Ste. Croix, ''Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Pliny's letter is the earliest pagan account to refer to early Christians and provides a key description of Roman administrative process and problems.&lt;ref name=Ehrmab57/&gt;&lt;ref name="St. Croix" /&gt; The correspondence between Pliny and Emperor Trajan shows that the Roman Empire, as a government entity, did not at this time “seek out” Christians for prosecution or persecution.&lt;ref name="mesacc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pliny the Younger on the Christ|url=http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/handouts/pliny.html|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Emperor Trajan gave Pliny specific advice about disregarding anonymous accusations, for example, he was deliberate in not establishing any new rules in regards to the Christians.&lt;ref name="St. Croix" /&gt; In doing so, Trajan allowed Pliny to try cases according to his discretion.

The letter supports the existence of the early Christian Church and its rapid growth and speaks to its belief system. It also provides valuable evidence as to the attitudes of the Roman authorities with regard to early Christianity.&lt;ref name=Moss143&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss |first=Candida |authorlink=Candida Moss |title=''[[The Myth of Persecution]]'' |year= 2013|publisher= HarperOne [[HarperCollins]]|location= New York |isbn=978-0-06-210452-6 |page=143 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Testament critic [[Hermann Detering]] has questioned the authenticity of Book 10,&lt;ref name="Zeugen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Detering|first=Hermann|title=Falsche Zeugen|year=2011|isbn=978-3-86569-070-8|pages=75–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that has not found acceptance within the mainstream scholarly community.

==Other Roman sources==
{{see also|Tacitus on Christ|Suetonius on Christians}}
Pliny is one of three key Roman authors who refer to [[early Christians]], the other two being [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref name=Ben1056/&gt;&lt;ref name=voorst69 &gt;[[Robert E. Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} page 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; These authors refer to events which take place during the reign of various Roman emperors, Suetonius writing about an [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|expulsion from Rome]] of Jews because of disturbances instigated by a certain "Chrestus" during the reign of [[Claudius]] (41 to 54), and also [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Nero#16|punishments by Nero]] (who reigned from 54 to 68), [[Tacitus]] referring to Nero's actions after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD, while Pliny writes to [[Trajan]].&lt;ref name=Ben1056/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Easterling, E. J. Kenney (general editors), ''The Cambridge History of Latin Literature'', page 892 (Cambridge University Press, 1982, reprinted 1996). {{ISBN|0-521-21043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the chronological order for the documentation begins with Pliny writing around 111 AD, then Tacitus writing in the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' around 115/116 AD and then Suetonius writing in the ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' around 122 AD.&lt;ref name=Ben1056&gt;[[Stephen Benko]] "Pagan Criticism of Christianity" in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' edited by Hildegard Temporin et al {{ISBN|3110080168}} page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak13&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 13 and 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8383">'''Pseudolocalization''' (or '''pseudo-localization''') is a [[software testing]] method used for testing [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]] aspects of software. Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of [[Language localisation|localization]], the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language. 

Example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Account Settings''' || [!!! Àççôûñţ  Šéţţîñĝš !!!]&lt;ref name="babblepseudo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibabbleon.com/copywriter-translator/2013/04/pseudolocalization-how-it-helps-prepare-your-app-for-localization/ |title=Pseudolocalization: Prepare your app for localization |author=Benjamin Zadik |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These specific alterations make the original words appear readable, but include the most problematic characteristics of the world's languages: varying length of text or characters, language direction, and so on.

== Localization process ==

Traditionally, localization of software is independent of the software development process. In a typical scenario, software would be built and tested in one base language (such as English), with any ''localizable'' elements being extracted into external resources. Those resources are handed off to a localization team for translation into different target languages.&lt;ref name="chenhistl10n"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/07/26/10333558.aspx |title=A brief and also incomplete history of Windows localization |author=Raymond Chen |date=26 July 2012 | accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this approach is that many subtle software bugs may be found during the process of localization, when it is too late (or more likely, too expensive) to fix them.&lt;ref name="chenhistl10n" /&gt;

The types of problems that can arise during localization involve differences in how written text appears in different languages. These problems include:

* Translated text that is significantly longer than the source language, and does not fit within the UI constraints, or which causes text breaks at awkward positions.
* Font glyphs that are significantly larger than, or possess [[diacritic]] marks not found in, the source language, and which may be cut off vertically.
* Languages for which the reading order is not [[Writing_system#Directionality|left-to-right]], which is especially problematic for user input.
* Application code that assumes all characters fit into a limited character set, such as [[ASCII]] or ANSI, which can produce actual logic bugs if left uncaught.

In addition, the localization process may uncover places where an element should be localizable, but is hard coded in a source language. Similarly, there may be elements that were designed to be localized, but should not be (e.g. the element names in an [[XML]] or [[HTML]] document.) &lt;ref name="kaplanpseudo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siao2.com/2011/04/11/10152035.aspx |title=One of my colleagues is the "Pseudo Man" |author=Michael Kaplan |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudolocalization is designed to catch these types of bugs during the development cycle, by mechanically replacing ''all'' localizable elements with a pseudo-language that is readable by speakers of the source language, but which contains most of the troublesome elements of other languages and scripts. This is why pseudolocalisation is to be considered an engineering or internationalization tool more than a localization one.

== Pseudolocalization in Microsoft Windows ==

Pseudolocalization was introduced at Microsoft during the Windows Vista development cycle.&lt;ref name="steelevista"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnste/archive/2006/06/27/647915.aspx |title=Pseudo Locales in Windows Vista Beta 2 |author=Shawn Steele |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of pseudo-language invented for this purpose is called a '''pseudo locale''' in Windows parlance. These locales were designed to use character sets and scripts characteristics from one of the three broad classes of foreign languages used by Windows at the time—basic ("Western"), mirrored ("Near-Eastern"), and CJK ("Far-Eastern").&lt;ref name="chenhistl10n" /&gt; Prior to Vista, each of these three languages had their own separate builds of Windows, with potentially different code bases (and thus, different behaviors and bugs.) The pseudo locales created for each of these language families would produce text that still "reads" as English, but is made up of script from another languages. For example, the text string

{{quote|Edit program settings}}

would be rendered in the "basic" pseudo-locale as

{{quote|[!!! εÐiţ Þr0ģЯãm səTτıИğ§ !!!]}}

This process produces translated strings that are longer, include non-ASCII characters, and (in the case of the "mirrored" pseudo-locale), are written right-to-left.&lt;ref name="steelevista" /&gt;

Note that the brackets on either side of the text in this example help to spot the following issues:

* text that is cut off (truncation)
* strings that are formed by combining (concatenation)
* strings that are not made localizable (hard-coding)

== Pseudolocalization process at Microsoft ==

Michael Kaplan (a Microsoft program manager) explains the process of pseudo-localization similar to:

{{quote|an eager and hardworking yet naive intern localizer, who is eager to prove himself [or herself] and who is going to translate every single string that you don't say shouldn't get translated.&lt;ref name="kaplanpseudo" /&gt;}}

One of the key features of the pseudolocalization process is that it happens automatically, during the development cycle, as part of a routine build. The process is almost identical to the process used to produce true localized builds, but is done ''before'' a build is tested, much earlier in the development cycle. This leaves time for any bugs that are found to be fixed in the base code, which is much easier than bugs not found until a release date is near.&lt;ref name="chenhistl10n" /&gt;

The builds that are produced by the pseudolocalization process are tested using the same QA cycle as a non-localized build. Since the pseudo-locales are mimicking English text, they can be tested by an English speaker. Beta version of Windows (7 and 8) have been released with some pseudo-localized strings intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/07/07/engineering-windows-7-for-a-global-market.aspx |title=Engineering Windows 7 for a Global Market |accessdate=26 July 2012 |author=Steven Sinofsky |date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2012/03/16/install-powershell-web-access-on-non-english-machines.aspx |author=Kriti Jindal |title=Install PowerShell Web Access on non-English machines |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these recent version of Windows, the pseudo-localized build is the primary staging build (the one created routinely for testing), and the final English language build is a "localized" version of that.&lt;ref name="kaplanpseudo" /&gt;

== Pseudolocalization tools for other platforms ==

Besides the tools used internally by Microsoft, other internationalization tools now include pseudolocalization options. These tools include Alchemy Catalyst from Alchemy Software Development, SDL Passolo from SDL and Globalyst from g11n. Such tools include pseudo-localization capability, including ability to view rendered Pseudo-localized dialogs and automating the testing process itself. While tools like Globalyst complete the whole process of creating pseudolocalised build and automate the testing, it can also be done by running a custom made pseudolocalization script on the extracted text resources and manually testing it.

There are a variety of free pseudolocalization resources on the Internet that will create pseudolocalized versions of common localization formats like iOS strings, Android xml, Gettext po, and others. These sites allow developers to upload strings file to a Web site and download the resulting pseudolocalized file.

In Canada, the statistical designation '''remote and isolated community''' refers to a settlement that is either a long distance from larger settlements or lacks transportation links that are typical in more populated areas. 

In responding to the [[avian flu outbreak of 2009]], a Canadian government body (the Remote and Isolated Task Group [RITG] of the Public Health Network H1N1 Task Force) published the following [[working definitions]]:
{{quote|Remote: describes a geographical area where a community is located over 350 km from the nearest service centre having year-round road access.

''Isolated'', by the Canadian government definition, means a geographical area that has scheduled flights and good telephone services, but is without year-round road access. Note that not all homes in a community have phones, and that flights may be cancelled or delayed due to weather.|RITG&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/guidance_lignesdirectrices/cdricp-cdeicp-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the above quote, the definition of isolated is borrowed from [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] (INAC) and the definition of remote is borrowed from [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref name="phac-aspc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/guidance_lignesdirectrices/cdricp-cdeicp-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada also has ''fly-in communities'' that lack road, rail, or water connections and rely entirely on [[bush aviation]]. Other remote communities lack road and rail but have water access, such as the [[Newfoundland outport]]s, and those that have road access part of the year on [[ice roads]], or can only be reached by [[gravel road]]. One academic measure of remoteness used in Canada is [[nordicity]], i.e. "northerliness".

== Healthcare in remote and isolated communities ==
{{see also|Rural health}}
In Canada, there were 76 [[nursing stations]] and over 195 [[health centres]] servicing remote communities in [[Northern Canada]] or on [[Indian reserves]] in the south. In about facilities, [[registered nurses]] are employed by [[Health Canada]], a ministry of the [[government of Canada]]. In the other communities, nurses are employed by the [[First Nations government|Band Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/services/nurs-infirm/index-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policing in remote and isolated communities ==
Policing in remote areas presents many challenges, most obviously logistical, but also social and even psychological.

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] had 268 "isolated posts" in 2009. Isolated posts are defined by the [[Treasury Board of Canada]] as communities that face "unique challenges" related to small populations, harsh climates, and/or limited access by commercial transportation or all-weather roads.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/gazette/vol71n1/vol71n5-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All posts located in Canada's [[Northern Canada|three northern territories]] are considered isolated as well as many in the ten provinces. Many of these posts are "fly-in only"; the police force has its own RCMP Air Services, which does everything from ferry prisoners to court to bring in new computers to offices. In 2009, in the territory of [[Nunavut]] there were 25 detachments, all fly-in (no roads), and only one RCMP airplane.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"/&gt;

'''Rengmitca''' is a highly endangered [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin]] language of [[Bangladesh]]. It is distinct but closely related to the nearby languages [[Khumi language|Khumi]] and [[Mro language|Mro]]. There are fewer than 30 speakers left as of 2014 (Peterson 2015).

Rengmitca is spoken to the northeast of [[Ali Kadam Upazila|Alikadam]] town in the southern [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Peterson2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4742">'''Retrocognition''' (also known as '''postcognition'''), from the [[Latin]] ''retro'' meaning "backward, behind" and ''cognition'' meaning "knowing," describes "knowledge of a past event which could not have been learned or inferred by normal means."&lt;ref&gt;Dale, L. A., &amp; White, R. A. (1977), or in other words someone gets knowledge about the past life of someone else without the known or ordinary sources but with some kind of power of the brain. It is also considered sixth sense by some people. Glossary of terms can be found in the literature of psychical research and parapsychology. In B. B. Wolman (Ed.), ''Handbook of Parapsychology'' (pp. 921-936). New York, NY, US: Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic W. H. Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Parapsychological Association]] (2007). [http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#r Glossary of Parapsychological terms - Retrocognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Retrocognition  has long been held by scientific researchers into psychic phenomena to be untestable, given that, in order to verify that an accurate retrocognitive experience has occurred, it is necessary to consult existing documents and human knowledge, the existence of which permits some contemporary basis of the knowledge to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;Rhine, J. B. (1977). History of experimental studies. In B. B. Wolman (Ed.), ''Handbook of Parapsychology'' (pp. 25-47). New York, NY, US: Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if you purport retrocognitive knowledge that "Winston Churchill killed a parrot", the only way of verifying that knowledge would be to consult extant sources of Churchill's activities. If it is found that he did, indeed, kill a parrot at one time, it could be said that you "simply" obtained contemporary knowledge of this fact (by clairvoyance or telepathy, if needs be, of the relevant documents or someone's knowledge of them), rather than directly perceived &amp;ndash; in the manner of retrocognition &amp;ndash; any event in Churchill's past. Given this fundamental logical difficulty, there has been very little experimental investigation by parapsychologists of retrocognition. The evidence for retrocognition has, therefore, been limited to naturalistic cases suggestive of the phenomenon.

The most popularly celebrated case of retrocognition concerns the visions in 1901 of [[Moberly–Jourdain incident|Annie Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain]] &amp;ndash; two scholars and early administrators of British university education for women &amp;ndash; as they tried to find their way to Marie Antoinette's private château, the Petit Trianon. Becoming lost on their way, they believed that they instead came unto the Queen's presence itself. They published an account of their experience in 1911 as ''An Adventure''. Moberly and Jourdain described how they had become convinced, over the following weeks, that persons they saw and even spoke to on that occasion &amp;ndash; given certain details of dress, accent, topography and architecture &amp;ndash; must have been of a presumed ''recollection'' by Marie Antoinette, on 10 August 1792, of her last days at Trianon in 1789. While often considered in popular literature as evidence for retrocognition, the book was immediately dismissed by Eleanor Sidgwick, a leading member of the British [[Society for Psychical Research]], in an article published in its ''Proceedings'', as the product of mutual [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, E. M. (1911). [Review of ''An Adventure'']. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', ''25''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iremonger, L. (1957). ''The ghosts of Versailles: Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain and their Adventure: A critical study''. London, UK: Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==

* Many fictional characters in television and movies exhibit this ability; examples of such would be [[Phoebe Halliwell]] of ''[[Charmed]]'', [[Allison DuBois]] from ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'' and Emery Waterman from ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]''.  Literary characters with the ability include the protagonist Sarah Parsons (and several of her maternal ancestors) in the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] [[time travel]] series [[Amber House Trilogy|''Amber House'']].
* The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' added "Retrocognition" to the various parapsychological terms appearing in its opening credits sequence in Season 3.

'''Sa'och''' ({{IPA-km|sa ʔoc}}, also, "Sauch") is an endangered, nearly extinct [[Pearic language]] of [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]] spoken only occasionally by a decreasing number of older adults. There are two dialects, one spoken in Veal Renh Village, [[Prey Nob District]], [[Sihanoukville Province]] (formerly known as Kampong Som Province), Cambodia and the other in [[Kanchanaburi Province]], Thailand. "Sa'och" is the Khmer [[exonym]] for the people and the language. The Sa'och, however, consider this label, which means "[[scarlet fever]]" or "pimply" in Khmer,&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus (2011), pg 39&lt;/ref&gt; pejorative and use the [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] "'''Chung'''" ({{IPA-all|t͡ɕʰṳˀŋ|Sa'och:}}) to refer to themselves and their language.&lt;ref&gt;Isara (2009), pg 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Sa'och is an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language. Within the Austroasiatic family, Sa'och is a member of the Pearic languages, a subgroup consisting of a handful of [[Language death|dying languages]], including [[Suoy language|Suoy]], [[Pear language|Pear]], [[Chong language|Chong]] and [[Samre language|Samre]], spoken by small numbers of ethnic minorities living mostly in far western Cambodia and adjacent areas of Thailand. In traditional classifications, the Pearic languages are most closely related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]] dialects,&lt;ref&gt;Huffman (1985), pg 355&lt;/ref&gt; but more conservative schemes place the Pearic subfamily on a level equally distant from all the branches of Austroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;Headley (1985), pg 466&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and geographical range==
After the [[Dark ages of Cambodia|breakup]] of the [[Khmer Empire]], the Cambodian central government was weak and neighboring Thailand and Vietnam vied for Cambodian territory. During this time, the Sa'och maintained a semi-autonomous territory centered on Veal Renh in Kampong Saom (modern-day Sihanoukville). According to Sa'och oral history, they prospered along the coast protected by their fortified settlement of Banteay Prey.&lt;ref name="Isara 2009, pg 72"&gt;Isara (2009), pg 72&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1830s, during the [[Siamese–Vietnamese War (1831–34)|Siamese-Vietnamese War]] for Cambodia, the Thai army defeated the Sa'och and took many prisoners of war back to Thailand where they were forced to resettle in [[Kanchanaburi Province]] along the Thai-Burmese border. This resulted in two disparate communities of Sa'och speakers separated by some 800&amp;nbsp;km.

The defeat and dispersal of the Sa'och led to a drastic decline in the use of the language. The Sa'och in Cambodia remained along the coast of Kampong Saom, living in their own villages such as Long Leh. The dialect that continued to evolve in Cambodia survived because the Sa'och were able to stay isolated from Cambodians, even through the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonial era]], until the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]] when the vast majority were either killed or relocated and forced to live among [[Khmer people|Khmers]].&lt;ref name="Isara 2009, pg 72"/&gt;

The Sa'och in Thailand were first resettled in the [[Si Sawat District]] of Kanchanaburi Province in their own villages along the [[Khwae Yai River]]. Their dialect evolved in relative isolation in the fertile valley for almost 140 years until construction of the [[Si Nakharin Dam]] which, completed in 1980, permanently inundated the valley. In making preparations for the dam, the Thai government again forced the Sa'och to relocate, this time to the [[gravel]]ly hills above the new reservoir. In their new villages, which were now mixed with [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Khmu people|Khmu]] and [[Thai people|Thai]], the Sa'och suddenly became minorities resulting in declining language use in favor of Thai. Additionally, young Sa'och are leaving the relatively barren isolated region to find work, causing an additional decline in language use. A paper published in 2009 reported that use of the Chung language in Thailand was only found among older generations remaining in the village and a few small children left in their care.&lt;ref&gt;Isara (2009), pp 70-72&lt;/ref&gt;

Both groups of Sa'och call their language simply ''chung''. To differentiate the two dialects, researches have arbitrarily designated the dialect found in Cambodia "Chung Yul" and that of Thailand "Chung Yuy", ''yul'' and ''yuy'' being their respective words for "sky".&lt;ref&gt;Isara (2009), pg 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Sa'och employs a phonemic inventory typical of modern Mon-Khmer languages and, along with the other Pearic languages, shows some phonological influences from the late [[Middle Khmer]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus (2011), pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the other Austoasiatic languages (outside of [[Vietic|Viet-Muong]]) Sa'och is not a tonal language. However, also similar to the other Pearic languages, Sa'och is marked by an unusual four-way contrast of vocal [[Register (phonology)|register]], or phonation, in its vowel system.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus (2011), pp 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isara (2009), pp 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
Sa'och has 21 consonant phonemes. They are listed in table form below.&lt;ref name="adapted from Isara 2009, pg 73"&gt;adapted from Isara (2009), pg 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Sa'och contrasts nine vowel qualities which can be either short or long, yielding a total of 18 vowel phonemes. Diphthongs do not occur in native Sa'och words, but the diphthongs {{IPA|/iə/}}, {{IPA|/ɯə/}}, and {{IPA|/uə/}} may be found in loan words from Thai and Khmer. The vowels of Sa'och are:&lt;ref name="adapted from Isara 2009, pg 73"/&gt;

===Phonation===
Similar to other modern and historical Austroasiatic languages such as [[Khmer language#Historical periods|Middle Khmer]], western dialects of [[Khmu language|Khmu]], and the [[Monic languages|Monic]] and [[Katuic languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Huffman (1985), pg 358&lt;/ref&gt; Sa'och employs a system of phonemic [[Register (phonology)|register]] in which words contrast according to their [[Phonation#State of the glottis|phonation]], or voice quality. However, unlike these languages, which mostly display a two-way contrast (e.g. between [[modal voice|clear]] and [[breathy voice]]), Sa'och and other Pearic languages contrast four different voice qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus (2011), pp 41, 42-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tonal language, an entire syllable carries the tone but in "register" languages, phonation is manifested only on the vowels. The four voice qualities in Sa'och and their transcriptions, using the base vowel /aː/ as an example, are clear voice (/a/), [[creaky voice]] (/aːˀ/), breathy voice (/a̤ː/) and breathy-creaky voice (a̤ːˀ).&lt;ref&gt;Isara 2009, pg ̀74&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">'''Seán Mac Mathúna''' is an Irish writer whose work has been published in both [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Tralee]], [[County Kerry]] and attended [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical note for Seán Mac Mathúna, Cois Life: http://www.coislife.ie/Udar.aspx?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his literary career as a writer of short stories, a number of which were published in Irish in ''[[Comhar]]'' and in English in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Irish Press]]''. In 1983 his first collection, entitled ''Ding'' (Wedge), was published by An Comhlacht Oideachais. His second Irish-language collection, ''Banana'',  was published by Cois Life in 1999, and won Gradam Uí Shúilleabháin /Irish Book of the Year Award. In 2005 his selected short stories were published by Cois Life under the title ''Úlla'' (Apples).&lt;ref&gt;Biographical note for Seán Mac Mathúna, Cois Life: http://www.coislife.ie/Udar.aspx?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac Mathúna has written four novels. One of them, entitled ''Gealach'' (Moon), was published by Leabhar Breac in 2012 and won an [[Oireachtas na Gaeilge|Oireachtas]] prize.

Mac Mathúna is also a playwright. In 1992 the [[Abbey Theatre]] produced ''The Winter Thief/Gadaí Géar na Geamhoíche'' in English and Irish on alternate nights, using the same cast. In 1999 the [[Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe|Taibhdhearc Theatre]] in [[Galway]] produced his play ''Hula Hul''.

A selection of his work can be heard on the audiobook ''Niall Tóibín ag léamh gearrscéalta le Seán Mac Mathúna'' ([[Niall Tóibín]] reading short stories by Seán Mac Mathúna) (Cois Life, 2009).

He has expressed the view that literary inspiration is something closely tied to the deepest sources of our humanity: “But writers are reluctant to talk about inspiration because it’s an acknowledgment, perhaps, that they didn’t write the story themselves but that it came into existence because of the will of a source which is higher than us”. He has also said that he prefers the Irish language versions of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with author, Gaelchultúr Newsletter #8: April 2011 : http://www.gaelchultur.com/en/newsletters/newsletterarticle.aspx?id=98&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10518">In syntax, '''shifting''' occurs when two or more [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] appearing on the same side of their common [[head (linguistics)|head]] exchange positions in a sense to obtain non-canonical order. The most widely acknowledged type of shifting is [[heavy NP shift]],&lt;ref&gt;See Ross (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; but shifting involving a heavy NP is just one manifestation of the shifting mechanism. Shifting occurs in most if not all European languages, and it may in fact be possible in all natural languages. Shifting is not [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], and inversion is not shifting, but the two mechanisms are similar insofar as they are both present in languages like English that have relatively strict word order. The theoretical analysis of shifting varies in part depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes relatively flat structures, shifting does not result in a [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuity]]. Shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The weight of a constituent is determined by a number of factors: number of words, contrastive focus, semantic content, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne (2007) concerning the weight of constituents.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic examples==
Shifting is illustrated with the following pairs of sentences. The first sentence of each pair shows what can be considered canonical order, whereas the second gives an alternative order that results from shifting:

::I gave '''the books which my uncle left to me as part of his inheritance''' to her.
:: I gave to her '''the books which my uncle left to me as part of his inheritance'''.

The first sentence with canonical order, where the object noun phrase (NP) precedes the oblique prepositional phrase (PP), is marginal due to the relative 'heaviness' of the NP compared to the PP. The second sentence, which shows shifting, is better because it has the lighter PP preceding the much heavier NP. The following examples illustrate shifting with particle verbs: 

::He picked '''it''' up. (compare: *He picked up '''it'''.)
::He picked up '''the flashlight'''.

::John took '''him''' on. (compare: *John took on '''him'''.)
::John took on '''the new player'''.

When the object of the particle verb is a pronoun, the pronoun must precede the particle, whereas when the object is an NP, the particle can precede the NP. Each of the two constituents involved is said to shift, whereby this shifting is motivated by the weight of the two relative to each other. In English verb phrases, heavier constituents tend to follow lighter constituents. The following examples illustrate shifting using pronouns, clauses, and PPs:

::She said '''that''' to her friends.
::She said to her friends '''that she had solved the problem'''.

::They hid '''that''' from me.
::They hid from me '''that I was going to pass the course'''.

When the pronoun appears, it is much lighter than the PP, so it precedes the PP. But if the full clause appears, it is heavier than the PP and can therefore follow it.

==Further examples==
The syntactic category of the constituents involved in shifting is not limited; they can even be of the same type, e.g.

::It happened '''on Tuesday''' due to the weather.
::It happened due to the weather '''on Tuesday'''.

::Sam considers '''him''' a cheater.
::Sam considers a cheater '''anyone who used Wikipedia'''.

In the first pair, the shifted constituents are PPs, and in the second pair, the shifted constituents are NPs. The second pair illustrates again that shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved; the NP ''anyone who used Wikipedia'' is heavier than the NP ''a cheater''.

The examples so far have shifting occurring in verb phrases. Shifting is not restricted to verb phrases. It can also occur, for instance, in NPs:

::the book '''on the shelf''' about linguistics
::the book about linguistics '''on the second shelf down from top'''

::the picture '''of him''' that I found
::the picture that I found '''of that old friend of mine with funny hair'''

These examples again illustrate shifting that is motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The heavier of the two constituents prefers to appear further to the right. 

The example sentences above all have the shifted constituents appearing after their [[head (linguistics)|head]] (see below). Constituents that precede their head can also shift, e.g.
 
::'''Probably''' Susan left.
::Susan '''probably''' left.

::'''Certainly''' that happened more than once.
::That '''certainly''' happened more than once.

Since the finite verb is viewed as the head of the clause in each case, these data allow an analysis in terms of shifting. The subject and modal adverb have swapped positions. In other languages that have many [[head-final]] structures, shifting in the pre-head domain is a common occurrence.

==Theoretical analyses==
If one assumes relatively flat structures, the analysis of many canonical instances of shifting is straightforward. Shifting occurs among two or more sister constituents that appear on the same side of their head.&lt;ref&gt;See Groß and Osborne (2009: 66-71).&lt;/ref&gt; The following trees illustrate the basic shifting constellation in a ''[[phrase structure grammar]]'' (= constituency grammar) first and in a [[dependency grammar]] second:  

::[[File:E-shift-01.jpg|Shifting (particle and object)]]

The two constituency-based trees show a flat VP that allows n-ary branching (as opposed to just binary branching). The two dependency-based trees show the same VP. Regardless of whether one chooses the constituency- or the dependency-based analysis, the important thing about these examples is the relative flatness of the structure. This flatness results in a situation where shifting does not necessitate a [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuity]] (i.e. no long distance dependency), for there can be no crossing lines in the trees. The following trees further illustrate the point:

::[[File:E-shift-02.jpg|NP-internal shifting]]

Again due to the flatness of structure, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. In this example, both orders are acceptable because there is little difference in the relative weight between the two constituents that switch positions.

An alternative analysis of shifting is necessary in a constituency grammar that posits strictly binary branching structures.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Larson (1988) and Kayne (1981, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The more layered binary branching structures would result in crossing lines in the tree, which means movement (or copying) is necessary to avoid these crossing lines. The following trees are (merely) representative of the type of analysis that one might assume given strictly binary branching structures:

::[[File:E-shift-03.jpg|Movement-analysis]]

The analysis shown with the trees assumes binary branching and leftward movement only. Given these restrictions, two instances of movement might be necessary to accommodate the surface order seen in tree b. The material in light gray represents copies that must be deleted in the phonological component.  
 
This sort of analysis of shifting has been criticized by [[Ray Jackendoff]], among others. &lt;ref&gt;See Jackendoff (1990) and Culicover and Jackendoff (2005) in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff and Culicover argue for an analysis like that shown with the flatter trees above, whereby heavy NP shift does not result from movement, but rather from a degree of optionality in the ordering of a verb's complements. The preferred order in English is for the direct object to follow the indirect object in a double-object construction, and for adjuncts to follow objects of all kinds; but if the direct object is "heavy", the opposite order may be preferred (since this leads to a more right-branching tree structure which is easier to process).

==A mystery==
From a generativist's perspective, a ''mysterious'' property of shifting is that in the case of ditransitive verbs, a shifted direct object prevents extraction of the indirect object via [[wh-movement]]:

:: Who did you give '''the books written by the venerable Professor Plum''' to?
:: *Who did you give to '''the books written by the venerable Professor Plum'''?

Some generativists use this example to argue against the hypothesis that shifting merely results from choice between alternative complement orders, a hypothesis that does not imply movement. Their analysis in terms of a strictly binary branching tree resulting from leftward movements would in turn be able to explain this restriction. However, there are at least two ways of countering this argument: 1) in case one wants to explain choice, if choice is assumed to be performed between possible orders, the impossible order is not in the linguistic potential and it cannot be chosen; however, 2) in case one wants to explain generation, that is, to explain how a linguistic potential comes to exist in a situation, one can explain this phenomenon in terms of generation and avoidance rules: for instance, one of the reasons for avoiding a wording in potentiality would be an ordering in which a preposition falls before a nominal group by accident as in the example above. In other words, from a functional perspective, we either recognise that these fake clauses are none of the clauses we can choose from (choice of possible clauses) or we say that they are generated and avoided because they might cause listeners to misunderstand what the speaker is saying (generation and avoidance).

'''Sven Delblanc''', born May 26, 1931 in [[Swan River, Manitoba|Swan River]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, died December 15, 1992 in [[Sunnersta]], [[Gottsunda Parish]], [[Uppsala]], Sweden was a Swedish author and professor of literature. He is buried in [[Hammarby kyrkogård]] in Uppsala, Sweden.

Delblanc was an [[associate professor]] in the [[history of literature]] at [[Uppsala university]] beginning in 1965. He received the [[Aftonbladet Literature Prize]] in 1965. Before his death he was pointed out as the anonymous writer [[Bo Balderson]].

In Sweden Delblanc is considered one of the foremost Swedish authors of the later half of the twentieth century, yet in English-speaking countries he is almost unknown.

He was born in Canada but grew up near [[Vagnhärad]], Sweden. His parents divorced and the father, Siegfried Axel Herman Delblanc, remarried. His paternal grandfather, Friedrich Hermann Delblanc, a [[Printer (publishing)|bookmaker]] in [[Stockholm]], was from [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], Germany. Sven Delblanc's maternal relatives were from [[Väse]] in [[Värmland]] in the West of Sweden. His maternal grandmother came from Norway. During the fourteenth century the Delblanc family lived in southern France in the vicinity of Le Puy, but during the [[Napoleonic Era]] a forefather deserted and went to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;There are several places in France called [[Le Puy (disambiguation)|Le Puy]], and at least three of them could be described as being in southern France. With the passage of time and movement between countries, it may never be known to which one the citations refer.&lt;/ref&gt; The maternal grandfather, Axel Nordfält, was the inspiration to the character Samuel in ''Samuels bok'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Delblanc, Sven. ''Livets ax''. Bonniers, 1991. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish television series ''Hedebyborna'' (1978) is based on Delblanc's series of novels ''Åminne'' (1970), ''Stenfågel'' (1973), ''Vinteride'' (1974) and ''Stadsporten'' (1976).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13931">'''[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]''' is a [[Turkic language]] spoken mostly in the west of [[China]].

Uyghur exhibits the [[agglutination]] characteristic to the Turkic family, and its basic [[word order]] is [[subject-object-verb]]. It lacks [[grammatical gender]] and does not use [[article (grammar)|articles]]. The language's inventory of 24 [[consonants]] and eight [[vowels]] features both [[vowel harmony]] and [[consonant harmony]]. Nouns are marked for ten [[case (grammar)|cases]], in general with suffixes, and are additionally [[inflected]] for [[number (grammar)|number]].

This article uses both the [[Arabic script]] (official for the language) and [[Latin script]] for Uyghur words.

==General characteristics==

The typical word order in Uyghur is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), as in the sentence "men
uyghurche oquymen", lit., "I Uyghur study." Compare this to [[English (language)|English]], where the sentence would be expressed with [[subject–verb–object]] order: "I study Uyghur".

Uyghur is an agglutinative language, meaning that potentially many suffixes (denoting [[person (grammar)|person]], number, case, [[mood (grammar)|mood]], etc.) are usually all attached to one word stem. For example "to your house," the main word, house, occurs first, and the modifying elements are attached directly to the right and written all in one word: öyingizge (öy-ingiz-ge, lit. "home-your-to"), and "having worked" ishlewatqan (ishle-wat-qan) "work-ing-INDEFINITE.PAST."

Nouns are not distinguished for gender (e.g. male, female), unlike in such languages as [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], [[French (language)|French]], and [[German (language)|German]]. Nouns are usually pluralized (with the suffix +lAr) except when preceded by a numeral: compare "atlar" ("horses") and "ikki at" (two horses). Instead of using articles (like English "a", "the"), Uyghur uses [[demonstrative]] pronouns ("this", "that") and no marker or the numeral one (bir) to indicate [[definiteness]] and indefiniteness, respectively, e.g. bu müshük "this cat/the cat" vs. bir müshük "a/one cat" or müshük "cat/cats."

Uyghur verbs take different suffixes, usually at least for [[tense (grammar)|tense]] (present, past) and person (I, you, s/he, they, etc.), for example oqu-y-men, lit. read-PRESENT.FUTURE-I, meaning "I read/study." Uyghur verbs can also take other suffixes to mark [[voice (grammar)|voice]] (causative, passive), [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]] (continuous), mood (e.g. ability), as well as suffixes that change verbs into nouns—sometimes many all together: oqu-wat-qan-im-da, lit. read-CONTINUOUS-INDEFINITE.P AST-my-at, meaning "When I was studying...." [[negation (grammar)|Negation]] usually also appears as a verb suffix, e.g. oqu-ma-y-men lit. read-NEG- PRESENT.FUTURE-I, "I don’t read."

Uyghur has vowel and consonant harmony, a system where vowels or consonants in a word come to match or become similar to each other, especially as suffixes and other elements are attached. Many but not all words and grammatical elements in Uyghur behave according to these harmonic principles. If a suffix is written with one or more capital letters (e.g. +DA, +lAr, +GA, etc.), these capital letters indicate that these sounds are harmonic, that is, variable: D= d/t, G= gh/q/g/k; K= k/q; A= a/e; I= i/u/ü or ø/i/u/ü.

==Sound system==

There are 32 basic sounds in Modern Uyghur.

===Consonants===

Uyghur has 24 consonants (listed here according to the Arabic-script alphabet): b, p, t, j, ch, x, d, r, z, zh, s, sh, gh, f, q, k, g, ng, l, m, n, x, h, w, y  (and 25 consonants if the [[glottal stop]] ‘ is counted). Most are not pronounced much differently than their English counterparts (e.g. Uyghur j in baj "tax" is pronounced like j in judge; Uyghur ch in üch "three" is pronounced like ch in itch; Uyghur h in he’e "yes" is pronounced like h in hello), except that l has [[palatal]] or [[velar]] variants. A few sounds are not found in English: q gh and x. The [[voiceless uvular stop]] q [qȹ] is pronounced like a back k, with the back of the tongue touching the soft palate, as in aq "white," Qeshqer "Kashgar." The sound gh {{IPA|[ʁ] ~ [ɣ]}} is typically a voiced [[fricative]] version of q, also pronounced at the very back of the mouth, and sounds like French or German r, as in Roissy or Ruhr. (Near front vowels, gh is often pronounced more front, like French Rue or German Rübe.) Finally, the Uyghur voiceless velar or [[uvular]] fricative x {{IPA|[x] ~ [χ]}} is pronounced like ch in Scottish loch, or further back in the mouth, like a back version of German ach.

The four sounds k, g, q, and gh are subject to consonant harmony: (1) within a stem (main word), they potentially determine its backness and (2) within a variable suffix, they conform to the backness and voicing of the preceding stem. Consonant harmony is discussed below.

The ژ zh {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (sounds like English garage), is only for foreign and onomatopoeic words like zhurnal ‘magazine, journal’, and pizh-pizh "sizzling." The letter ج j (normally pronounced {{IPA|[dʒ]}} as in baj ‘tax’) is in southern Xinjiang often pronounced {{IPA|[ʒ]}}. Initial y {{IPA|[j]}} can also be pronounced {{IPA|[ʒ]}} before i, e.g. yilan {{IPA|[ʒilan]}} ‘snake’.

In Uyghur words of Turkic origin, sh is rare, except as a suffix; similarly, since f was borrowed into Uyghur from [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] and [[Persian (language)|Persian]], it is often replaced by p, especially in colloquial and rural usage: fakultët~pakultët ‘academic department’.

===Vowels===

Uyghur has eight vowels. Vowels are [[roundedness|rounded]] (o, u, ü, ö) and unrounded (a, i, e, ë); this distinction is sometimes termed labial vs. non-labial; they are front (ü, ö, e) or back (u, o, a). These distinctions are critical for harmonic purposes, since Uyghur words are subject to vowel harmony.The orthographic vowel i represents both a front [i] and a back [ɨ], and is not subject to vowel harmony.

Uyghur [[accent (phonetics)|accent]] (stress or high pitch, which we will for convenience call stress) is not well understood, yet some general remarks can be made to aid language learning. In Uyghur, stress is mostly determined by the length of syllables. This means that a syllable which is closed (i.e., ends in consonants [CVC or CVCC]) tends to attract stress, while a syllable which is open (i.e. ends in a vowel [CV]) does not. A general rule of thumb is: stress the last syllable of the stem, e.g. ayagh "foot," Turpan'gha "to Turfan." (in the vocabulary lists, we underline stressed syllables.)

Word-internal harmony is relatively weak in Uyghur, but when suffixes are added to a word stem, certain suffix vowels and consonants harmonize with those of the stem. There are two variable vowels in Uyghur, A (a/e) and I (i/u/ü). There is one harmonically variable consonant type: G (k/g/q/gh). Uyghur’s harmony system has three relevant components: voicing, backness, and roundness harmony.

==Nouns==
Nouns in Uyghur have no [[grammatical gender]] or [[definiteness|definite marking]], although the number 'one' ''bir'' can be used to mark indefiniteness.  [[Plural]]s are marked by ''-lar'' or ''-ler'', with the vowel following the rules of vowel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jong|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases===
Uyghur has ten cases, all of which except the [[nominative case|nominative]] are marked by suffixation after possible plural or possessive suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jong|2007|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbs==

==Pronouns==

=== Personal pronouns ===
In Uyghur there is one set of [[personal pronoun]]s used for the first- and third [[grammatical person|person]], while there are three in the second person. The use of the three sets in the second person depends on the formality and politeness.&lt;ref name="EnYaDw.2009.40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Engesæth|Yakup|Dwyer|2009|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal pronouns are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical case|case]]. Follow the links of each of the personal pronouns to see them inflected.

|}

The second person personal pronoun mostly used among people is the polite سىز ''siz'', while the informal سەن ''sen'' is used between very close friends, or when parents are addressing their children. The informal سەن ''sen'' is also used when the speaker has a higher social rank than the addressed person.

The respectful سىلى ''sili'' is used for addressing respectul elders, grandparents or other notable persons of a community. Royalty is also addressed using سىلى ''sili'', and sometimes even customers in stores.&lt;ref name="EnYaDw.2009.40" /&gt;

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Uyghur has several [[demonstrative pronoun]]s with some of them being used for [[stress (linguistics)|emphasis]] or as [[intensifier]]s, while others have less specific uses. Common for all of the demonstrative pronouns is that their use depends on the distance between the speaker and the thing or person to which is referred.&lt;ref name="EnYaDw.2009.18-20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Engesæth|Yakup|Dwyer|2009|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hahn.1991.591-592"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=591–592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrative pronouns are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical case|case]]. In the table below, the demonstrative pronouns can be seen, although only in the singular. Follow the links of each of the demonstrative pronouns to see them inflected.

{{notelist}}

The most common demonstrative pronouns are بۇ ''bu'', ئۇ ''u'' and شۇ ''shu'', the first being translated as ''this'' and the remaining two as ''that''. The first is used when referring to an object or person which is visible and close to the speaker, the second is used when referring to an object or person which is away from the speaker and the third is used when referring to a previously mentioned object or person which is not particular close to the speaker in an affirmative statement.

The two first-mentioned demonstrative persons each have an [[intensifier|intensified]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] form ending in ۋۇ ''-wu'', ماۋۇ ''mawu'' and ئاۋۇ ''awu'', respectively. These are used when it is necessary to make it clear that the object or person the demonstrative pronoun is referring to really is the object or person which the speaker means. The two first-mentioned demonstrative persons both also have another derived form, ending in شۇ ''-shu'', مۇشۇ ''mushu'' and ئاشۇ ''ashu'', respectively. These are often used for confirming something the speaker is already familiar with.&lt;ref name="EnYaDw.2009.18-20" /&gt;

The examples below illustrate the use of بۇ ''bu'' and its derived forms.

: '''بۇ قەلەم'''
: ''bu qelem''
: "This pen"

: '''ماۋۇ قەلەم'''
: ''mawu qelem''
: "This pen (and not any other pen)"

: '''مۇشۇ قەلەم'''
: ''mushu qelem''
: "This pen (which you are familiar with)"

'''Visual communication''' is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be seen. Visual communication in part or whole relies on [[Eye|eyesight]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sless (1981). ''Learning and Visual Communication''. p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Visual communication is a broad spectrum that includes [[signage|sign]]s, [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[advertising]], [[animation]], [[color]], and electronic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of Visual Communication: Theory, Methods, and Media''. p.123.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The evaluation of a good [[Visual design|visual communication design]] is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience,&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Frascara (2004). ''Communication design: principles, methods, and practice''. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, there are other ways to express information visually - [[gestures]] and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by [[e-mail]], a textual medium, is commonly expressed with [[ASCII art]], [[emoticon]]s, and embedded [[digital image]]s.
[[File:Eye of Horus bw.svg|thumb|right|The Eye of Horus]]
The term 'visual presentation'&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, G. H. ''Visual Communication: More Than Meets the Eye''. Bristol: Intellect Books, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-1-84150-141-3}}. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically-oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the [[World Wide Web]] is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The [[Eye of Horus]] is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the cornea around the pupil is like the cornea around the sun during a solar eclipse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Important figures===
[[Aldous Huxley]] is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[The Art of Seeing]]''. He described "seeing" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is "The more you see, the more you know."

[[Max Wertheimer]] is said to be the father of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt means ''form'' or ''shape'' in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Study==
Students studying visual communication&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media''. [[Routledge]]. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, [[Gestalt psychology]], aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, [[semiotics]], persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.

Visual communication takes place through [[picture]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[chart]]s, as well as through [[sign]]s, signals and [[symbol]]s. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.

==Image analysis==
Visual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by [[Paul Martin Lester]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Martin Lester]].  ''Visual Communication: Images with Messages''. Belmont, CA: [[Thomson Wadsworth]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-534-63720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Personal perspective:
When a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.

;Historical perspective:
An image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.

;Technical perspective:
When the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.

;Ethical perspective:
From this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: [[categorical imperative]], utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.

;Cultural perspective:
Symbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols.  The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.

;Critical perspective:
The view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics.  This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.

==Visual aids==
'''Visual aids''' are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to [[PowerPoint]]s. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction. Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to ''enhance'' the presentation.&lt;ref name="berengueres_2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berengueres | first = Jose | year = 2015 | title = Sketch Thinking | publisher = Stokes Hamilton | location = Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual elements==
'''Objects'''
* The use of objects as visual aids involves bringing the actual object to demonstrate on during the speech. For example, a speech about tying knots would be more effective by bringing in a rope.
* '''Pro''': the use of the actual object is often necessary when demonstrating how to do something so that the audience can fully understand procedure.
* '''Con''': some objects are too large or unavailable for a speaker to bring with them.

'''Models'''
* Models are representations of another object that serve to demonstrate that object when use of the real object is ineffective for some reason.  Examples include human skeletal systems, the solar system, or architecture.
* '''Pros''': models can serve as substitutes that provide a better example of the real thing to the audience when the object being spoken about is of an awkward size or composure for use in the demonstration.
* '''Cons''': sometimes a model may take away from the reality of what is being spoken about. For example, the vast size of the solar system cannot be seen from a model, and the actual composure of a human body cannot be seen from a dummy.

'''Graphs'''
* Graphs are used to visualize relationships between different quantities. Various types are used as visual aids, including bar graphs, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.
* '''Pros''': graphs help the audience to visualize statistics so that they make a greater impact than just listing them verbally would.
* '''Cons''': graphs can easily become cluttered during use in a speech by including too much detail, overwhelming the audience and making the graph ineffective.

'''Maps'''
* Maps show geographic areas that are of interest to the speech. They often are used as aids when speaking of differences between geographical areas or showing the location of something.
* '''Pros''': when maps are simple and clear, they can be used to effectively make points about certain areas. For example, a map showing the building site for a new hospital could show its close location to key neighborhoods, or a map could show the differences in distribution of AIDS victims in North American and African countries.
* '''Cons''': inclusion of too much detail on a map can cause the audience to lose focus on the key point being made. Also, if the map is disproportional or unrealistic, it may prove ineffective for the point being made.

'''Tables'''
* Tables are columns and rows that organize words, symbols, and/or data.
* '''Pros''': Good tables are easy to understand. They are a good way to compare facts and to gain a better overall understanding of the topic being discussed. For example, a table is a good choice to use when comparing the amount of rainfall in 3 counties each month.
* '''Cons''': Tables are not very interesting or pleasing to the eye.  They can be overwhelming if too much information is in a small space or the information is not organized in a convenient way. A table is not a good choice to use if the person viewing it has to take a lot of time to be able to understand it. Tables can be visual distractions if it is hard to read because the font is too small or the writing is too close together.  It can also be a visual distraction if the table is not drawn evenly.

'''Photographs'''
* '''Pros''': Photographs are good tools to make or emphasize a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a Third World country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can have a better understanding of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed.  For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the audience's area.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Presenting Effective Presentations with Visual Aids|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/traintec.html|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cons''': If the photograph is too small it just becomes a distraction. Enlarging photographs can be expensive if not using a power point or other viewing device.

'''Drawings or diagrams'''
* '''Pros''': Drawings or diagrams can be used when photographs do not show exactly what the speaker wants to show or explain. It could also be used when a photograph is too detailed. For example, a drawing or diagram of the circulatory system throughout the body is a lot more effective than a picture of a cadaver showing the circulatory system.
* '''Cons''':If not drawn correctly a drawing can look sloppy and be ineffective.  This type of drawing will appear unprofessional.

===Visual aids media: simple to advanced===
* '''Chalkboard or whiteboard'''
Chalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable.  They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the company of others : an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid.   Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom.  Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Poster board'''
A poster is a very simple and easy visual aid.  Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional.  Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over.  The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Handouts'''
Handouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over.  This can help the person better remember what was discussed.  Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting.  Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention.  The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it.&lt;ref name=maui&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumu|first=Ka|title=Using Visual Aids Effectively|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/mauispeech/html/visual_aids.html|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Maui College]] Speech Department|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Video excerpts'''
A video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech.  There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture.  First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk.  Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting.  The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Projection equipment'''
There are several types of projectors.  These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors.  Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used.  PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often.  Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use.  In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen.  This takes time and costs money.  Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors.  When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen.  Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Computer-assisted presentations'''
PowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track.  A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together.  There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Social media'''
Social media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10297">'''Vocal music''' is a type of music performed by one or more singers, either with [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, or without instrumental accompaniment ([[a cappella]]), in which [[singing]] provides the main focus of the piece. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered instrumental music (e.g. the wordless women's choir in the final movement of [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s [[The Planets]]) as is music without singing. Music without any non-vocal instrumental accompaniment is referred to as ''[[a cappella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94-101. PM 18225701&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables, sounds, or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song.

Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music, since it does not require any instrument besides the [[human voice]]. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music.

==Vocal music without lyrics==
{{main|Non-lexical vocables in music}}

===World traditions===
* [[Indian classical music]] is based on a rich vocal tradition, wherein even instruments are evaluated on their ability to follow the human voice, imitate it, or recreate the same expressions.
* Elaborate untexted vocal improvisation was and still is an important element in [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Middle Eastern]] music traditions. Such music existed prior to the 13th century and the [[First Crusade]] into Palestine and the city of [[Jerusalem]], possibly even before the year 900.
* The modern descendants of the ancient [[ǃKung people|Kung]] tribes and clans of Southern Africa utilize similar traditional music techniques.
* A form of improvisation known as [[thillana]] is a very important feature of [[Carnatic music]] from South India.
* [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] often features wordless and improvised song. The [[sygyt]] technique is a particularly good example of this.
* The [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] communities.
* [[Hasidic Jews]] use a form of voice improvisation called [[nigunim]].  This consists of wordless tunes vocalized with sounds such as "Bim-bim-bam" or "Ai-yai-yai!" often accompanied by rhythmic clapping and drumming on the table.
* [[Puirt a beul]], also known as "Mouth Music", is a Scottish vocal technique imitating the sounds of bagpipes, fiddles, and other instruments used in traditional Scottish music.  It was popularized in North America by [[Scottish Americans|Scottish immigrants]], and has been incorporated into many forms of American music from [[Traditional music|roots music]] to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].
* The [[Cante Alentejano]] is just based on vocal music. It's one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]], the other being  [[Fado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=01007|title= Cante Alentejano, polyphonic singing from Alentejo, southern Portugal|accessdate= November 3, 2015|work= unesco.org|publisher= [[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00563|title= Fado, urban popular song of Portugal|accessdate= November 3, 2015|work= unesco.org|publisher= [[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European classical vocal music===
[[Solfege]], a vocalized musical [[scale (music)|scale]], assigns various syllables such as ‘‘Do-Re-Mi‘‘ to each note. A variety of similar tools are found in   
traditional [[Music of India|Indian music]], and [[scat singing]] of jazz.

===Jazz and popular music===
[[Hip hop music]] has a very distinct form of vocal percussion known as [[beatboxing]]. It involves creating beats, rhythms, and [[scratching]].

The singer of the Icelandic group [[Sigur Rós]], [[Jón Þór Birgisson]], often uses vocals without words, as does Icelandic singer/songwriter, [[Björk]]. Her album [[Medúlla (album)|Medúlla]] is composed entirely of processed and acoustic vocal music, including [[beatboxing]], [[choral]] arrangements, and [[Overtone singing|throat singing]].

Singer [[Bobby McFerrin]] has recorded a number of albums using only his voice and body, sometimes consisting of a texted melody supported by untexted vocalizations.

==Vocal music with lyrics==

===Songs===
:''See [[:Category:Song forms]] for short forms of music with sung words.''

===Extended techniques that involve lyrics===
The [[Second Viennese School]], especially [[Alban Berg]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]], pioneered a technique called [[Sprechstimme]] in which singers are half-talk, half-sing, and only approximate pitches.

A '''wildlife corridor''', '''habitat corridor''', or '''green corridor'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180024/http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] connecting [[wildlife]] populations separated by human activities or structures (such as roads, development, or logging). This allows an exchange of individuals between populations, which may help prevent the negative effects of [[inbreeding]] and reduced genetic diversity (via [[genetic drift]]) that often occur within isolated populations.  Corridors may also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to [[Disturbance (ecology)|random events (such as fires or disease)]].

This may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bond, M.|date=2003|title=Principles of Wildlife Corridor Design. Center for Biological Diversity|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/wild-corridors.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Biologivaldiversity.org|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[urbanization]] can split up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive.  Habitat fragmentation due to [[Human development theory|human development]] is an ever-increasing threat to [[biodiversity]], and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation.

==Purpose==
The main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase [[biodiversity]]. When areas of land are broken up by human interference, population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered. By re-connecting the fragments, the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically. Corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population: 
* '''[[Colonisation (biology)|Colonization]]'''—animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat.
* '''[[Animal migration|Migration]]'''—species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.
* '''Interbreeding'''—animals can find new mates in neighboring regions so that [[genetic diversity]] can increase and thus have a positive impact on the overall population.

Rosenberg et.al. (1995) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Noon |first2=Barry R. |last3=Meslow |first3=E. Charles |title=Towards a definition of wildlife corridor |journal=Integrating People and Wildlife for a Sustainable Future |date=1995 |volume=Proceedings of the First International Wildlife Congress |pages=436–9 |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/3662 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor. The definitions of "[[biological corridor]]" (i.e., wildlife corridor) had, in the early years of studying corridors, been "vague and inconsistent, and often they confound form and function" Rosenberg et.al. developed a [[conceptual model]] that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of [[native vegetation]] or intermediate [http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/Conceptual%20Background/What%20is%20a%20Landscape/What%20is%20a%20Landscape.htm target patches of habitat]. Their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater that if the corridor were absent.

Although corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity, not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion. The case for corridors has been built more on intuition and much less on [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] (Tewksbury et al. 2002). Tewksbury et. al. claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and, that if corridors facilitate animal movement, they should also have strong indirect effects on plant [[populations]] due to increased [[pollen]] and [[seed]] by animals. Results of their 2002 experiment provided a large-scale experimental demonstration that [[habitat]] (or wildlife) corridors facilitate movement of disparate [[Taxon|taxa]] between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects (Tewksbury et al, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewksbury |first1=Joshua |title=Corridors affect plants, animals, and their interactions in fragmented landscapes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=October 1, 2002 |volume=99 |issue=20 |pages=12923–6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.202242699 |pmid=12239344 |pmc=130561 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12923.short |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for. Some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others.

A habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its [[native species]]. Development such as [[roads]], [[buildings]], and [[farms]] can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s and [[flood]]s can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).

Corridors can be made in two distinct areas—either water or land. Water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams. Land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as [[Hedge|a line of shrubs along a sidewalk]] (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.

== Users ==
Species can be categorized in one of two groups; passage users and corridor dwellers.

Passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time. These animals use corridors for such events as [[wikt:migration|seasonal migration]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of a juvenile, or moving between parts of a large home range. Usually large [[Herbivory|herbivores]], medium to large [[carnivore]]s, and migratory species are passage users (Beier &amp; Loe 1992). One common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through. However, the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it, even though they do not live out their entire lives in it.

Corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years. Species such as [[plants]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[birds]], [[insects]], and small [[mammals]] can spend their entire lives in linear habitats. In this case, the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed, such as soil for [[germination]], burrowing areas, and multiple other breeding adults (Beier &amp; Loe 1992).

== Types ==
Habitat corridors can be categorized according to their width. Typically the wider the corridor, the more use it will get from species. However, the width-length ratio, as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor (Fleury 1997). The strip of land will suffer less from [[edge effect]]s such as weeds, predators, and chemicals if it is constructed properly.  The following are three divisions in corridor widths: 
* '''Regional''' – (&gt;500m wide); connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways.
* '''Sub-regional''' – (&gt;300m wide); connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridgelines and valley floors.
* '''Local''' – (some &lt;50m); connect remnant patches of gullies, wetlands, ridgelines, etc.

Habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity. Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while “stepping stone” corridors are small patches of suitable habitat. When stepping stones are arranged in a line, they form a strip of land connecting two areas, just like a continuous corridor would. Both kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate.

Finally, corridors can come in the form of [[underpass]]es or [[overpass]]es, which can be very safe for both animals and humans. Many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy, as well. Large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of [[traffic]] and get hit. An overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road. Observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden (Dole et al. 2003).
[[Image:Estakada ponad Bogdanką Poznań.jpg|thumb|Overpasses such as this one allow for traffic to continue for human convenience, while allowing wildlife to pass unharmed beneath from place to place.]]

== Costs ==
Corridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action. For example, Daniel Simberloff et al. states that “a bridge that would maintain a [[Riparian zone|riparian corridor]] costs about 13 times as much per [[lane mile|lane-mile]] as would a road that would sever the corridor.” He also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for [[endangered species]]. It would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land, install a corridor, and maintain it. However, where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals, then habitat corridors may be the only option.  Corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what, but it does depend on the type, location, and size, which can all vary to a great degree. With the lack of field data on the effectiveness, many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors.

== Monitoring use ==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2008}}
It is extremely important for researchers to pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects. Researchers can use both [[Mark and recapture|mark-recapture techniques]] and evaluate [[Gene flow|genetic flow]] in order to observe how much a corridor is being used. Marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement (Mech &amp; Hallet 2001). The only problem is that tagging animals and watching them does not tell anyone whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land. On the other hand, genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns.

One of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species. By looking at a population’s [[gene flow]], researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors (Mech &amp; Hallett 2001). The migration patterns of an entire population are much more important than the movements of a few individuals. From these techniques, researchers will better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity.

Stephen Mech and James Hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful; they “measure average migration rates over time, which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark-recapture studies are.” For example, when a population is extremely small, mark-recapture is almost impossible. Clearly, genetic analysis of a species is the best way to determine if animals are actually using corridors to move and reproduce.

==Design==
According to new research, wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry, rather than built symmetrically. The research was conducted at UC Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081020135221.htm|title=Designing wildlife corridors|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife corridors are susceptible to [[edge effect]]s; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas. Wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized [[range (biology)|range]]s; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a ''[[rescue effect]]''.

== Examples ==

Both the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors. For example, deer commonly cross roads in order to get to other grazing land. When they are faced with a car coming at them, they freeze; this puts both the deer and the human’s life in danger. In [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]], an overpass was constructed to keep animals off of the busy highway; the area is part of a [[national park]], so many different creatures roam the area. The top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area so that it blends in better and animals will not know the difference. Gates were also put of on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction (Semrad 2007).

In [[Southern California]], 15 underpasses and drainage [[culvert]]s were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, [[mule deer]], small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).

In [[South Carolina]], five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center and four were surrounding it. Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center. Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones. Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region. The most impressive dispersal into the connected region, though, was through bird droppings.  Far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor-connected patch of land (M. 2002).

There have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in [[vole]] populations. A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions. Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high. Researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much, but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding (Aars 1999).

In 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta]], which enabled [[Gray wolf|wolves]] to pass through the course. After this restoration, wolves passed through the corridor frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shepherd, B|author2=J. Whittington |date=2006|title=Response of wolves to corridor restoration and human use management|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=11 |issue=2|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art1/|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife, and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation. Earlier studies had been criticised for failing to demonstrate that corridor restoration leads to a change in wildlife behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel K. Rosenberg|author2=Barry R. Noon |author3=E. Charles Meslow|title=Biological Corridors: Form, Function, and Efficacy|journal=BioScience|volume=47|issue=10 |date=November 1997|pages=677–687|jstor=1313208|doi=10.2307/1313208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Elephant corridor===
Elephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.

In Africa, [[Botswana]] houses the largest number of free-roaming elephant herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/new-way-to-protect-africas-elephant-herds|title=Elephant corridors in Botswana to protect the herds|author=Fran|website=Your African Safari|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants Without Borders (EWB) studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors, so that elephants and humans can co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantswithoutborders.org/living_with_elephants.php|title=Elephants Without Borders Living with elephants|publisher=Elephantswithourborders.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major wildlife corridors===
Several artificial wildlife corridors have been created, these include:
* the Paséo Pantera (also known as the MesoAmerican Biological corridor or [[Paseo del Jaguar|Paséo del Jaguar]])
* the Eastern Himalayan Corridor
* China-Russia Tiger Corridor
* Tandai Tiger Corridor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthera.org/programs/tiger/tiger-corridor-initiative|title=Panthera|publisher=Panthera.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[European Green Belt]]
* The Siju-Rewak Corridor, located in the Garo Hills of India, protects an important population of elephants(thought to be approximately 20% of all the elephants that survive in the country).This corridor project links together the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserve Forest in Meghalaya State, close to the India-Bangladesh border. This area lies within the meeting place of the Himalayan Mountain Range and the Indian Peninsula and contains at least 139 other species of mammal, including tiger, clouded leopard and the Himalayan black bear.
* the [[Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]] is a network of corridors and habitats created for wildlife in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Ecologische hoofdstructuur|Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Some animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like. For example, many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed. Less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer. How effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards (Tewskbury 2002). Corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with.

Human interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible. Although there are many positives and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own.  Each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.

===Negatives===
A major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success. Due to the lack of positive data, many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness. Another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented. However, it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road-building, industry, and [[urban sprawl]] are all competing for space.

Even if corridors are sought as a solution, it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them. Especially in the case of overpasses, research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land. Usually overpasses are built over busy highways, and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic. As more roads and buildings arise, there becomes less space to try to preserve.

Habitat corridors need to be species-specific (not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor) and corridors can be barriers to some species.  For instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat.

When a corridor is implemented, many times development is so close by, that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage. There is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors, so buffers are not usually added in (Rosenberg 1997). Without a buffer zone, corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets, [[suburb]] development, rural homes, [[forestry]], cropland, and feedlots.

Unfortunately, another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money. With such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land, it is difficult to get the proper funding. Those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as, “What if the corridors affect species negatively?” and “What if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events?” Furthermore, there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms, but invasive ones, as well (Beier &amp; Loe 1998). If [[invasive species]] take over an area they could potentially threaten another species, even to the point of extinction.

Although wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation, there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non-developed or less-developed areas, compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute. In other words, corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning/ers, but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves. Very few wildlife follow easily identified "corridors" or "linkages" (e.g., using [[Computer simulation|computer modeling]]), instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily, seasonal, and dispersal movement behavior. Wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat.

===Positives===
Habitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences, but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity. Strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and [[pollen]] and [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], which is an added benefit to the intended one (M. 2002). For example, when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area, plant species effectively get transported, as well.

Another positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land, and thus co-exist where without the corridor this would not be possible. Large animals such as [[bear]]s can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of [[habitat fragmentation]]. A corridor would provide a passage for the bears to [[Foraging|forage]] in other locations, so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">'''"Without the right of correspondence", WRC''' ({{lang-ru|Без права переписки}}, abbreviated as БПП in official documents) was a clause in a [[sentence (law)|sentence]] of many [[political repression|political convict]]s in the [[Soviet Union]].

In a large number of cases during the [[Great Purge]], the oral sentence was "10 years of [[Gulag|corrective labor camps]] without the right of correspondence", which was announced to relatives, while the paperwork contained the real sentence: "the highest degree of punishment: [[execution by shooting]]".&lt;!-- *not* necessarily by [[firing squad]]; needs a separate article --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2003/7/krich.html "An Aluminum Cross"], a documentary case published in ''[[Zvezda (magazine)|Zvezda]]'' magazine #7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cohen |first=Stephen F. |authorlink=Stephen F. Cohen |title=The Victims Return: Survivors of the Gulag After Stalin |publisher=I. B. Tauris |year=2011 |location=London |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93VBLt66TDoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-84885-848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people did not understand the official [[euphemism]] and incorrectly believed that their relative was still alive in prison;&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; this gave officials 10 years to invent an 'accident' in the prison camps that had killed the 'prisoner' as an explanation for why the victim did not return{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. As [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] put it in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'':

{{quote|"Deprived of the right to correspond." And that means once and for all. "No right to correspondence"—and that almost for certain means: "Has been shot."&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn quote"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gulag Archipelago |last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Solzhenitsyn |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-06-092103-X |volume= I |page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

All of the bodies identified from the mass graves at Vinnitsa and Kuropaty had received this sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2007. p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable victims==
*[[Mikhail Koltsov]] (a Soviet writer and correspondent, a prototype of Karkov in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''), executed February 2, 1940. When his brother, [[Boris Efimov]], by a miracle got an appointment with [[Vasiliy Ulrikh]], the latter told him that Koltsov was sentenced to 10 years WRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psj.ru/saver_national/detail.php?ID=6044 Михаил Ефимович Кольцов — За что?
