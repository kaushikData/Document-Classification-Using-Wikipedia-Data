It is performed slowly and for this reason it is suitable for older people. "Anzali" is a traditional dance. It is performed during the beginning of [[marriage]] ceremonies. When it was created, it was intended for older people, although younger people may perform it as well.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">'''Apolo Kivebulaya''' (c. 1864 - 30 May 1933) was a Ugandan [[Anglican]] priest and evangelist. He is sometimes referred to as the "apostle to the pygmies" for his work among the [[Mbuti people|Bambuti]] people of the [[Ituri Rainforest|Ituri forest]] in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. Apolo is considered the principal pioneer of the Anglican church in the Belgian Congo. He was commemorated in the Anglican [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Calendar of Saints]] on May 30.

He was born, along with a twin brother, in 1864 in Kiwanda, Uganda. His parents originally named him Waswa Munubi. Waswa grew up the son of peasants who apprenticed him to a witch doctor, but when he discovered the man tricking people out of their possessions, he left him to learn about Islam, which had been recently brought to the chief Kabaka Mutesa's court by Arab traders.&lt;ref name=gertz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gertz |first=Steven |title=The Prospect Terrified Me |journal=[[Christian History]] |issue=79 |url=http://www.christianhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/wS8wVsy62N/chm79-xr2o_.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824091926/http://www.christianhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/wS8wVsy62N/chm79-xr2o_.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Waswa turned 13, H. M. Stanley, who had discovered David Livingstone in 1872, paid a visit to Mutesa's court and persuaded the chief to begin "reading" in the Christian religion. The chief was probably more impressed with Stanley's guns than with his Bible, for Mutesa had already parted ways with the Arabs and now needed protection. But the chief's welcome opened the door for his people to embrace Christianity.&lt;ref name=gertz/&gt;

Stanley's expedition opened the way for other missionaries too, notably Alexander MacKay, who arrived in 1878. Waswa credits MacKay with planting seeds of belief in his life. "When I looked at the European," he wrote, "his eyes sparkled with kindness." Mackay organized a church, and members of the chief's court began attending his classes.&lt;ref name=gertz/&gt;

He took the name Apolo at his baptism in 1895 after the [[Apollos]] of the Bible. 
He was given the name "Kivebulaya," meaning "from Europe," because he always wore a suit under his cassock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacb.org/stories/demrepcongo/kivebulaya_apolo.html Way, Rev. Yossa, "Apolo Kivebulaya", Dictionary of African Christian Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mythology, it is usually portrayed as an archetypical ogre; according to ''A Dictionary of World Mythology'':

 &lt;blockquote&gt; ...the hairy Sasabonsam has large blood-shot eyes, long legs, and feet pointing both ways. Its favourite trick is to sit on the high branches of a tree and dangle its legs so as to entangle the unwary hunter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both the ogre and vampire versions have iron teeth.

[[File:Mt. Washington Hotel.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Washington Hotel]]]]

The '''Bretton Woods Conference''', formally known as the '''United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference''', was the gathering of 730 [[delegates]] from all 44 [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]], situated in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire|Bretton Woods]], [[New Hampshire]], United States, to regulate the [[International monetary systems|international monetary and financial order]] after the conclusion of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Markwell|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was held from July 1–22, 1944. Agreements were signed that, after legislative ratification by member governments, established the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

== Background ==
Early in the [[Second World War]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] of the British Treasury and [[Harry Dexter White]] of the United States Treasury Department independently began to develop ideas about the financial order of the postwar world. (See below on Keynes's proposal for an International Clearing Union.) After negotiation between officials of the United States and United Kingdom, and consultation with some other Allies, a "Joint Statement by Experts on the Establishment of an International Monetary Fund," was published simultaneously in a number of Allied countries on April 21, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7569?start_page=506, pp. 1629–36.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 1944, the U.S. government invited the Allied countries to send representatives to an international monetary conference, "for the purpose of formulating definite proposals for an International Monetary Fund and possibly a Bank for Reconstruction and Development."&lt;ref&gt;"Invitation of the United States of America to the Conference,"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7570?start_page=12, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "International" was only added to the Bank's title late in the Bretton Woods Conference.) The United States also invited a smaller group of countries to send experts to a preliminary conference in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], to develop draft proposals for the Bretton Woods conference. The Atlantic City conference was held from June 15–30, 1944.

==The agreements==
The Bretton Woods Conference had three main results: (1) Articles of Agreement to create the IMF, whose purpose was to promote stability of exchange rates and financial flows. (2) Articles of Agreement to create the IBRD, whose purpose was to speed reconstruction after the [[Second World War]] and to foster economic development, especially through lending to build infrastructure. (3) Other recommendations for international economic cooperation. The Final Act of the conference incorporated these agreements and recommendations.

Within the Final Act, the most important part in the eyes of the conference participants and for the later operation of the world economy was the IMF agreement. Its major features were:
* An adjustably pegged [[foreign exchange market]] rate system: Exchange rates were pegged to gold. Governments were only supposed to alter exchange rates to correct a "fundamental disequilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;IMF Articles of Agreement, Article IV, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7570?start_page=954, pp. 945–48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Member countries pledged to make their currencies [[convertibility|convertible]] for trade-related and other current account transactions. There were, however, transitional provisions that allowed for indefinite delay in accepting that obligation, and the IMF agreement explicitly allowed member countries to regulate capital flows.&lt;ref&gt;IMF Articles of Agreement, Articles VI, VIII, and XIV, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7570?start_page=960, pp. 951–52, 954–57, 965–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of widespread current account convertibility did not become operative until December 1958, when the currencies of the IMF's Western European members and their colonies became [[convertibility|convertible]].
* As it was possible that exchange rates thus established might not be favourable to a country's [[balance of payments]] position, governments had the power to revise them by up to 10% from the initially agreed level ("par value") without objection by the IMF. The IMF could concur in or object to changes beyond that level. The IMF could not force a member to undo a change, but could deny the member access to the resources of the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;IMF Articles of Agreement, Article IV, Sections 5–6,  https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7570?start_page=960, pp. 946–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All member countries were required to subscribe to the IMF's capital. Membership in the IBRD was conditioned on being a member of the IMF. Voting in both institutions was apportioned according to formulas giving greater weight to countries contributing more capital ("quotas").

==Encouraging open markets==
The seminal idea behind the Bretton Woods Conference was the notion of [[capitalism|open markets]]. In his closing remarks at the conference, its president, U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], stated that the establishment of the IMF and the IBRD marked the end of [[economic nationalism]]. This meant countries would maintain their national interest, but trade blocs and economic spheres of influence would no longer be their means. The second idea behind the Bretton Woods Conference was joint management of the Western political-economic order, meaning that the foremost industrial democratic nations must lower [[protectionism|barriers to trade]] and the [[International finance|movement of capital]], in addition to their responsibility to govern the system.

== Structure of the conference ==
The highest body of the Bretton Woods Conference was the plenary session, which met only in the first and last days of the conference and existed mainly to confirm decisions reached by the lower bodies.&lt;ref&gt;On the points discussed in this section, see Kurt Schuler and Andrew Rosenberg, ''The Bretton Woods Transcripts,'' pp. 7–9 (New York: Center for Financial Stability, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-941801-01-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference conducted its major work through three "commissions." Commission I dealt with the IMF and was chaired by [[Harry Dexter White]], Assistant to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the chief American negotiator at the conference. Commission II dealt with the IBRD and was chaired by [[John Maynard Keynes]], economic adviser to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chief British negotiator at the conference. Commission III dealt with "other means of international financial cooperation" and was chaired by Eduardo Suárez, Mexico's Minister of Finance and the leader of the Mexican delegation. It was a venue for ideas that did not fall under the other two commissions.

Each commission had a number of committees, and some committees had subcommittees. Every country at the conference was entitled to send delegates to all meetings of the commissions and the "standing committees," but other committees and subcommittees had restricted membership, to allow them to work more efficiently. Except when registering final approval or disapproval of proposals, the work of the conference generally proceeded by negotiation and informal consensus rather than by formal voting. When voting occurred, each country had one vote.

The main goal of the conference was to achieve an agreement on the IMF. Enough consensus existed that the conference was also able to achieve an agreement on the IBRD. Doing so required extending the conference from its original closing date of July 19, 1944 to July 22.

Because the United States was the world's largest economy at the time, and the main prospective source of funds for the IMF and IBRD, the U.S. delegation had the largest influence on the proposals agreed to at Bretton Woods.

== The Bank for International Settlements controversy ==
The [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) became an object of scrutiny when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] delegation put forth evidence that the BIS was involved in war crimes.

The BIS, formed in 1930, was originally primarily intended to facilitate settling financial obligations arising from the peace treaties that concluded the [[First World War]]. During the Second World War, it helped the Germans transfer assets from occupied countries. Moreover, now that IMF was to be established, the BIS seemed to be superfluous. Commission III of the Bretton Woods Conference therefore considered Norway's proposal for "liquidation of the Bank for International Settlements at the earliest possible moment."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, ''Final Act'' (London et al., 1944), Article IV.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal passed Commission III without objection&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schuler and Rosenberg, ''The Bretton Woods Transcripts,'' p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted as part of the Final Act of the conference.

Momentum for dissolving the BIS faded after U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt died in April 1945. Under his successor, [[Harry S. Truman]], the top U.S. officials most critical of the BIS left office, and by 1948 the liquidation had been put aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bis.org/about/arch_guide.pdf |title=A brief history of the BIS, 1930–2005|website=bis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monetary order in a post-war world==
The need for post-war Western economic order was resolved with the agreements made on [[Monetarism|monetary order]] and [[Free trade|open system of trade]] at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. These allowed for the synthesis of Britain's desire for [[full employment]] and economic stability and the United States' desire for [[free trade]]. The [[Bretton Woods system]] of pegged exchange rates lasted into the early 1970s.

==Failed proposals==

===International Trade Organization===
The Bretton Woods Conference recommended that participating governments reach agreement to reduce obstacles to international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Bretton Woods Final Act,  Section VII, "International Economic Problems,"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430/item/7570?start_page=950, p. 941.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation was later embodied in the proposed [[International Trade Organization]] (ITO) to establish rules and regulations for [[international trade]]. The ITO would have complemented the IMF and IBRD. The ITO charter was agreed on at the U.N. Conference on Trade and Employment (held in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], in March 1948), but the charter was not ratified by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. As a result, the ITO never came into existence. The less ambitious [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was adopted in its place. However, in 1995, the [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT negotiations established the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as the replacement body for GATT. The GATT principles and agreements were adopted by the WTO, which was charged with administering and extending them.

===International Clearing Union===
{{Main|International Clearing Union}}
[[John Maynard Keynes]] first proposed the ICU in 1941, as a way to regulate the balance of trade. His concern was that countries with a trade deficit would be unable to climb out of it, paying ever more interest to service their ever-greater debt, and therefore stifling global growth. The ICU would effectively be a bank with its own currency (the "[[bancor]]"), exchangeable with national currencies at a fixed rate. It would be the unit for accounting between nations, so their trade deficits or surpluses could be measured by it.

On top of that, each country would have an overdraft facility in its "bancor" account with the ICU. Keynes proposed having a maximum overdraft of half the average trade size over five years. If a country went over that, it would be charged interest, obliging a country to reduce its currency value and prevent capital exports. But countries with trade surpluses would also be charged interest at 10% if their surplus was more than ''half'' the size of their permitted overdraft, obliging them to increase their currency values and export more capital. If, at the year's end, their credit exceeded the maximum (half the size of the overdraft in surplus), the surplus would be confiscated.

[[Lionel Robbins]] reported that "it would be difficult to exaggerate the electrifying effect on thought throughout the whole relevant apparatus of government ... nothing so imaginative and so ambitious had ever been discussed". However, [[Harry Dexter White]], representing the United States, which was the world's biggest creditor, said "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no."

Instead, White proposed an International Stabilization Fund, which would place the burden of maintaining the balance of trade on the deficit nations, and impose no limit on the surplus that rich countries could accumulate. White also proposed creation of the IBRD (now part of the [[World Bank]]) which would provide capital for [[economic reconstruction]] after the war. The IMF as agreed to at Bretton Woods was much closer to White's proposal than to Keynes's.

== Ratification of Bretton Woods Final Act and Savannah Conference ==
The Articles of Agreement for the IMF and IBRD signed at Bretton Woods did not come into force until ratified by countries with at least 80 percent of the capital subscriptions ("quotas"). The threshold was reached on December 27, 1945.

The institutions were formally organized at an inaugural meeting in [[Savannah, Georgia]], on March 8–18, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;IMF, "IMF Chronology," https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/chron/chron.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Notably absent from Savannah was the USSR, which had signed the Bretton Woods Final Act but had then decided not to ratify it. The USSR never joined the IMF and IBRD, though its successor the Russian Federation did in 1992. Australia and New Zealand were likewise absent from formal participation at Savannah (Australia sent observers), though they joined the IMF and IBRD later.

== Influence ==
Because of its success in founding two international organizations that have had long and influential lives, the Bretton Woods Conference is sometimes cited as an example worthy of imitation. In particular, since the [[Nixon shock|collapse in the early 1970s]] of the system of pegged exchange rates agreed to at Bretton Woods there have been a number of [[International monetary systems#Calls for a "New Bretton Woods"|Calls for a "New Bretton Woods".]]

The '''Elbasan Gospel Manuscript''' is a 17th-century collection of translations from the [[New Testament]] into the [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2"/&gt; Although the author is mainly known as the '''Anonyomous of Elbasan''' ({{lang-sq|Anonimi i Elbasanit}}), according to [[Mahir Domi]] and [[Robert Elsie]] the linguistic and historical evidences indicate to be the work of [[Gregory of Durrës]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Elsie |first=Robert |url=http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_early/gregory_of_durres/gregory.html |title=GREGORY OF DURRËS |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113235236/http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_early/gregory_of_durres/gregory.html |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of an unknown "Papa Totasi" (father Totasi) is written on the cover's [[verso]] with the same ink as the text.

The work is presumed to be the oldest work of Albanian Orthodox literature and the first [[Bible translations into Albanian|Bible translation into Albanian]]. According to Elsie, the manuscript was created in 1761, soon before Gregory became the Metropolitan (archbishop) of the Archdiocese of Durrës (1762–1772).&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; The archdiocese's see was then in the [[St. Jovan Vladimir's Church]], in [[Shijon]] near [[Elbasan]], central [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; 

The manuscript is composed of 30 unnumbered folios, 59 pages of biblic translations and has 10x7&amp;nbsp;cm format.&lt;ref name="Elsie2"/&gt; The script used is the [[Elbasan script]], which consists of forty letters, most of them completely original, and not derived from any language spoken in the regions neighboring Albania. However, according to [[Dhimitër Shuteriqi]] and [[Mahir Domi]], there is some [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] influence in the remainder of the letters.&lt;ref name="Elsie2"&gt;{{Citation| last=Elsie| first=Robert| author-link=Robert Elsie| year=1995| title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript ("Anonimi i Elbasanit"), 1761, and the Struggle for an Original Albanian Alphabet| journal=Südost-Forschungen| volume=54| publisher=Südost-Institut| place=Regensburg, Germany| issn=0081-9077| url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf| format=PDF| mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is the only document where the Elbasan script has been retrieved so far.&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt;

The manuscript was purchased little before or around World War II by politician [[Lef Nosi]], who was the owner of a remarkable personal library, and a notable collector. It was confiscated from him by the [[communist Albania|communist]] regime in 1945.

[[File:Zakynthos flag.png|thumb|right|300px|Flag of [[Zakynthos]]]]
The '''flag of [[Zakynthos]], [[Greece]]''', or '''Flag of Zante''', has a dark green background with an orange depiction of [[Zakynthos (person)|Zakynthos]], the mytho-historical first resident of the island and its namesake, in the centre. Zakynthos, partially draped in a robe, is sitting on rock holding a semi-coiled snake to the right. Zakynthos (ΖΑΚΥΝΘΟΣ) is written to the upper right of the man, with the island's motto "''Freedom needs virtue and courage''" (ΘΕΛΕΙ ΑΡΕΤΗ ΚΑΙ TOΛMH
Η ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ - ''théli aretí ke tólmi i elefthería'') under the man, both written in all caps in [[Greek language|Greek]] and in the same colour as the central image. The flag flies throughout the island and is flown above every public building, often in tandem with the [[Flag of Greece|national flag of Greece]].

The '''Grouping of Rural and Independent Chadians''' ({{lang-fr|Groupement des indépendants et ruraux tchadien}}, GIRT) was a [[political party]] in [[Chad]].

==History==
The party was founded in 1956, when the [[Gontchomé Sahoulba]]-led faction broke away from [[Chadian Social Action]]. The party mainly represented interests of traditional chiefs from southern Chad.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;Samuel Decalo (1980) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/160409 Regionalism, Political Decay, and Civil Strife in Chad]" ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'', Vol 18, No 1, pp23–56&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was part of the Entente alliance for the [[Chadian Territorial Assembly election, 1957|1957 Territorial Assembly elections]], alongside the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT). The Entente won 57 of the 65 seats, of which GIRT took nine. However, the party left the Entente and joined the [[Chadian Socialist Union]], a bloc of anti-PPT parties. Later this group evolved into the [[African National Party]] (PNA). The former GIRT leader Djibrine Kerallah became the vice chair of the PNA.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kidane Mengisteab &amp; Cyril K. Daddieh (1999) ''State Building and Democratization in Africa: Faith, Hope, and Realities'', Praeger, p165&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Turkey}}

The '''history of Turkey''', understood as the history of the region now forming the territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]], includes the history of both [[Anatolia]] (the Asian part of Turkey) and [[Eastern Thrace]] (the European part of Turkey).

For times predating the Ottoman period, a distinction must be made between the history of the [[Turkish peoples]], and the history of the territories now forming the Republic of Turkey, essentially the histories of ancient [[history of Anatolia|Anatolia]] and [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="US_Library_of_Congress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt;

The [[name of Turkey|name ''Turkey'']] is derived from [[Middle Latin]] ''Turchia'', i.e. the "land of the [[Turkish people|Turks]]", historically referring to an entirely different territory of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which fell under the control of [[Turkic peoples]] in the early medieval period.

From the time when parts of what is now Turkey was conquered by [[Turkic people|Turks]], the history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the [[Seljuk Empire]], the medieval to modern history of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the history of the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] since the 1920s.&lt;ref name="US_Library_of_Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/trtoc.html|title=About this Collection - Country Studies|author=|date=|website=loc.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812233922/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/trtoc.html|archivedate=12 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Arthur Howard|title=The History of Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay-IkMqrTp4C|accessdate=2 April 2013|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Anatolia and Thrace in antiquity==

===Anatolia===
{{main article|Classical Anatolia|History of Anatolia}}

{{further information|Prehistory of Anatolia|Ancient Anatolians|Hittite Empire|Syro-Hittite states|Median Empire|Achaemenid Empire|Macedonian Empire|Ancient Regions of Anatolia|Kingdom of Pontus|Seleucid Empire|Byzantine Anatolia|Ancient Near East}}

The ancient  history of [[Anatolia]] (Asia Minor)  can be roughly subdivided into two 
[[Prehistory of Anatolia|prehistory]], [[Ancient Near East]] (Bronze Age and Early Iron Age), [[Classical Anatolia]], [[Hellenistic Anatolia]], with 
[[Byzantine Anatolia]] spanning the early medieval period to the age of the [[Crusades]] and the eventual Turkish (Seljuk/Ottoman) conquest of Anatolia by the 15th century.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=September 2017}}

The earliest representations of culture in Anatolia were [[Stone Age]] artifacts. The remnants of [[Bronze Age]] civilizations such as the [[Hittite empire|Hattian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Hittites|Hittite]] peoples provide us with many examples of the daily lives of its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] civilization began to flourish. They, and all the rest of Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]].

As Persia grew in strength, their system of local government in Anatolia allowed many port cities to grow and to become wealthy. All of Anatolia got divided into various [[satrapies]], ruled by [[satraps]] (governors) appointed by the central Persian rulers. The first state that was called [[Armenia]] by neighbouring peoples was the state of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Orontid dynasty]], which included parts of eastern Turkey beginning in the 6th century BC, which became the [[Satrapy of Armenia]] under Achaemenid rule. Some of the satraps revolted periodically but did not pose a serious threat. In the 5th century BC, [[Darius I]] built the [[Royal Road]], which linked the principal city of [[Susa]] with the west Anatolian city of [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;A modern study is D.F. Graf, ''The Persian Royal Road System'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Anatolia played a pivotal role in Achaemenid history. In the earliest 5th century BC, some of the Ionian cities under Persian rule revolted, which culminated into the [[Ionian Revolt]]. This revolt, after being easily suppressed by the Persian authority, laid the direct uplead for the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which turned out to be one of the most crucial wars in European history. After Achaemenid Persian rule, the Greek [[Alexander the Great]] finally wrested control of the whole region from Persia in successive battles, proving victorious over the Persian [[Darius III]]. After Alexander's death, his conquests were split amongst several of his trusted generals, but were under constant threat of invasion from both the [[Gauls]] and other powerful rulers in [[Pergamon]], [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]. The [[Seleucid Empire]], the largest of Alexander's territories, and which included Anatolia, became involved in a disastrous war with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] culminating in the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Magnesia|Magnesia]]. The resulting  [[Treaty of Apamea]] in (188 BC) saw the Seleucids retreat from Anatolia. The [[Attalid dynasty|Kingdom of Pergamum]] and the [[Rhodes (city)|Republic of Rhodes]], Rome's allies in the war, were granted the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia.

Roman control of Anatolia was strengthened by a 'hands off' approach by Rome, allowing local control to govern effectively and providing military protection. In the early 4th century, [[Constantine the Great]] established a new administrative centre at [[Constantinople]], and by the end of the 4th century the Roman empire split into two parts, the Eastern part (Romania) with [[Constantinople]] as its capital, referred to by historians as the Byzantine Empire from the original name, [[Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6f.asp|title=The Fall of the Roman Empire [ushistory.org]|first=|last=ushistory.org|date=|website=www.ushistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320175413/http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6f.asp|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thrace===
{{See also|List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia|Odrysian state|Thracians#Archaic_period|Prehistory of the Balkans|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe}}
The [[Thracians]] ({{lang-grc|Θρᾷκες}}, {{lang-la|Thraci}}) were a group of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European tribes]] inhabiting a large area in Central and Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thracians, 700 BC–AD 46|author=Christopher Webber, Angus McBride|year=2001|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-329-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were bordered by the [[Scythians]] to the north, the [[Celts]] and the [[Illyrians]] to the west, the [[Ancient Greeks]] to the south and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. They spoke the [[Thracian language]] – a scarcely attested branch of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The study of Thracians and Thracian culture is known as [[Thracology]].

[[File:Odrysian.svg|thumb|250px|Thrace and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom in its maximum extent under Sitalces (431-424 BC)]]

Starting around 1200 BC, the western coast of [[Anatolia]] was heavily settled by [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Byzantium]], the latter founded by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists from [[Megara]] in 657 BC. All of Thrace, and the native Thracian peoples were conquered by [[Darius the Great]] in the late 6th century BC, and were re-subjugated into the empire in 492 BC following [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]]' campaign during the [[First Persian invasion of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington.

By the 5th century BC, the Thracian presence was pervasive enough to have made [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.5.v.html Herodotus. ''Histories'', Book V] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001132852/http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.5.v.html |date=2013-10-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; call them the second-most numerous people in the part of the world known by him (after the [[India]]ns), and potentially the most powerful, if not for their lack of unity. The Thracians in classical times were broken up into a large number of groups and tribes, though a number of powerful Thracian states were organized, such as the [[Odrysian kingdom]] of Thrace and the [[Dacians|Dacian]] kingdom of [[Burebista]]. A type of soldier of this period called the [[Peltast]] probably originated in Thrace.

Before the expansion of the Kingdom of [[Macedon]], Thrace was divided into three camps (East, Central, and West) after the withdrawal of the Persians following their eventual defeat in mainland Greece. A notable ruler of the East Thracians was [[Cersobleptes]], who attempted to expand his authority over many of the Thracian tribes. He was eventually defeated by the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].

The Thracians were typically not city-builders, the largest [[Thracian cities]] were in fact large villages.&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, I.E.S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N.G.L. Hammond. ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC''. Cambridge University Press, 1992, p. 612. "Thrace possessed only fortified areas and cities such as Cabassus would have been no more than large villages. In general the population lived in villages and hamlets."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, I.E.S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N.G.L. Hammond. ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC''. Cambridge University Press, 1992, p. 612. "According to Strabo (vii.6.1cf.st.Byz.446.15) the Thracian -bria word meant polis but it is an inaccurate translation."&lt;/ref&gt; and their only [[polis]] was [[Seuthopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen. ''An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation''. Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 888. "It was meant to be a polis but this was no reason to think that it was anything other than a native settlement."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Webber and Angus McBride. ''The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms)''. Osprey Publishing, 2001, p. 1. "They lived almost entirely in villages; the city of Seuthopolis seems to be the only significant town in Thrace not built by the Greeks (although the Thracians did build fortified refuges)."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 324, [[Constantine I]] chose [[Byzantium]] to be the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]], renaming it [[New Rome]]. Following the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly come to be known as [[Constantinople]] became the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. This, which would later be branded by historians as the [[Byzantine Empire]], ruled most of the territory of what is today Turkey until the [[Late Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/turkey/istanbul/istanbul.html|title=Constantinople/Istanbul|author=Daniel C.

Between the 3rd and 7th century AD, the Byzantines and the neighboring Sassanids [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|frequently clashed]] over possession of Anatolia, which significantly exhausted both empires, thus laying the way open for the eventual Muslim conquests from both empires' respective south.

==Early history of the Turks==
{{History of the Turkic peoples pre-14th century}}
{{Main article|Göktürks|Turkic migrations}}

Historians generally agree that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from [[Central Asia]] to [[Siberia]]. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Peter Zieme 2006, p. 64"&gt;Peter Zieme: The Old Turkish Empires in Mongolia. In: Genghis Khan and his heirs. The Empire of the Mongols. Special tape for Exhibition 2005/2006, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late [[Xiongnu]] confederation about 200 B.C &lt;ref name="Peter Zieme 2006, p. 64"/&gt; (contemporaneous with the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]]).&lt;ref name="Findley 2005, p. 29"&gt;Findley (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, 400 years after the [[Han–Xiongnu War|collapse of northern Xiongnu]] power in [[Inner Asia]], leadership of the Turkic peoples was taken over by the Göktürks. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the Göktürks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, Göktürk leadership united the [[nomad]]ic Turkic tribes into the [[Göktürk Empire]].  The name derives from ''gok'', "blue" or "celestial".  Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the Göktürk Khanate had its temporary ''[[Khan (title)|khans]]'' from the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan that were ''subordinate'' to a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs.  The [[Khanate]] retained elements of its original [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] religion, [[Tengriism]], although it received missionaries of [[Buddhist]] monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The Göktürks were the first Turkic people to write [[Old Turkic]] in a runic script, the [[Orkhon script]].  The Khanate was also the first state known as "Turk". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but the name "Turk" was later taken by many states and peoples. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Turkic peoples and related groups migrated west from [[Turkestan]] and what is now [[Mongolia]] towards [[Eastern Europe]], [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Anatolia]] and modern Turkey in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown.  After many battles, they established their own state and later created the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The main migration occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Carter V. Findley"&gt;Carter V. Findley, ''The Turks in World History'' (Oxford University Press, October 2004) {{ISBN|0-19-517726-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also participated in the [[Crusades]].

==Seljuk Empire==
{{main article|Seljuk Empire}}
The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Turkmens created a [[medieval]] empire that controlled a vast area stretching from the [[Hindu Kush]] to eastern [[Anatolia]] and from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. From their homelands near the [[Aral sea]], the Seljuqs advanced first into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and then into mainland [[Persia]] before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jackson |first=P. |year=2002 |title=Review: The History of the Seljuq Turkmens: The History of the Seljuq Turkmens |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=75–76 |doi=10.1093/jis/13.1.75 |publisher=Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seljuq/Seljuk empire was founded by [[Tughril Beg]] (1016-1063) in 1037. Tughril was raised by his grandfather, [[Seljuq Dynasty|Seljuk-Beg]] Seljuk gave his name to both the Seljuk empire and the Seljuk dynasty. The Seljuqs united the fractured political scene of the eastern [[Islamic world]] and played a key role in the [[First Crusade|first]] and [[Second Crusade|second]] crusades. Highly [[Persianized]] in culture and language, the Seljuqs also played an important role in the development of the [[Turko-Persian tradition]], even exporting Persian culture to Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, Rene, ''The Empire of the Steppes'' (Rutgers University Press, 1991), 574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mehmed II]] enters Constantinople by [[Fausto Zonaro]]]]
{{Main article|Ottoman Empire}}
The Ottoman beylik's first capital was located in [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] in 1326. Edirne which was conquered in 1361&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire: conquest, organization and economy|first=Halil|last=Inalcık|publisher=Variorum ReprintsPress|year=1978|isbn=0-86078-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the next capital city. After largely expanding to Europe and Anatolia, in 1453, the Ottomans nearly completed the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople during the reign of [[Mehmed II]]. Constantinople was made the capital city of the Empire following Edirne. The Ottoman Empire would continue to expand into the Eastern Anatolia, Central Europe, the Caucasus, North and East Africa, the islands in the Mediterranean, Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

[[File:Semailname 47b.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The sultan of the golden age, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].]]

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The empire was often at odds with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its steady advance towards [[Central Europe]] through the Balkans and the southern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="Ottoman_Turkey"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|first=Stanford|last=Jay Shaw|author2=Kural Shaw, Ezel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Ottomans were often at war with Persia over territorial disputes. At sea, the empire contended with the Holy Leagues, composed of [[Habsburg Spain]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Knights of St. John]], for control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]], the Ottoman navy frequently confronted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fleets in order to defend its traditional monopoly over the maritime trade routes between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]]; these routes faced new competition with the Portuguese discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488.

The Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 marked the beginning of Ottoman territorial retreat; some territories were lost by the treaty: Austria received all of Hungary and Transylvania except the Banat; Venice obtained most of Dalmatia along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula in southern Greece); Poland recovered Podolia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe'', 1998, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire continued losing its territories, including [[Greece]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and the [[Balkans]] in the 1912–1913 [[Balkan Wars]]. Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see [[Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). Its inhabitants were of varied ethnicities, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Kurds]], [[Greeks]], [[French people|Frenchs]], and [[Italians]] (particularly from [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]). Faced with territorial losses on all sides the Ottoman Empire under the rule of the [[Three Pashas]] forged an alliance with Germany who supported it with troops and equipment. The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] (1914–1918) on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, major atrocities were committed such as Genocide, mass murder and death  marches intentionally denying food and water to the deportees by the Ottoman government against the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenians]], [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and [[Greek genocide|Pontic Greeks]] causing millions of deaths and resulting in the Armenian Genocide of 1915.&lt;ref name=SchallerZimmerer&gt;Schaller, Dominik J; Zimmerer, Jürgen (2008).

Journal of Genocide Research 10 (1): 7–14. doi:10.1080/14623520801950820&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War I, the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|several new states]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderic H. Davison]]; Review "From Paris to Sèvres: The Partition of the Ottoman Empire at the Peace Conference of 1919–1920" by Paul C. Helmreich in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 34, No. 1 (Mar. 1975), pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 1918, the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed, followed by the imposition of [[Treaty of Sèvres]] on August 10, 1920 by [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], which was never ratified. The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] would break up the Ottoman Empire and force large concessions on territories of the Empire in favour of [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France.

==Republic of Turkey==
{{Main article|History of the Republic of Turkey}}
[[File:Marshal Mustafa Kemal Pasha.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (1881-1938)]]

The occupation of some parts of the country by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]].&lt;ref name="Ottoman_Turkey"/&gt; Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name="Atatürk"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ataturk|first=Andrew|last=Mango|publisher=Overlook|
year=2000|isbn=1-58567-011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 18, 1922, the occupying armies were expelled. On November 1, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|newly founded parliament]] formally abolished the [[Sultan]]ate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of July 24, 1923, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the [[successor state]] of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923, in the new capital of [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name="Ottoman_Turkey" /&gt; Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of Turkey]] and subsequently introduced [[Atatürk's Reforms|many radical reforms]] with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past.&lt;ref name="Ottoman_Turkey" /&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fez was abolished, full rights for women politically were established, and new writing system for Turkish based upon the [[Latin alphabet]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinross|first=John|title= Atatürk: A Biography of Mustafa Kemal, Father of Modern Turkey|publisher=Phoenix Press|year=2001| isbn=1842125990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific surname "Atatürk" (''Father of the Turks'') in 1934.&lt;ref name="Atatürk" /&gt;

[[File:Roosevelt Inonu Churchill.jpg|210px|thumb|left|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[İsmet İnönü|İnönü]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] at the [[Second Cairo Conference]] which was held between 4–6 December 1943.]]
Turkey was neutral in World War II (1939–45) but signed a treaty with Britain in October 1939 that said Britain would defend Turkey if Germany attacked it. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid.  The Turkish leaders conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the nascent United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erik J. Zurcher, ''Turkey: A Modern History'' (3rd ed. 2004) pp 203-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Edwards, "The Impact of the War on Turkey," ''International Affairs'' (1946) 22#3 pp. 389-400 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3017044 in JSTOR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222032802/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3017044 |date=2016-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the start of the Cold War. The demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the [[Turkish Straits]], prompted the United States to declare the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in large-scale [[Turkey-United States relations|U.S. military and economic support]].&lt;ref name="Truman Doctrine"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outposts and Allies: U.S. Army Logistics in the Cold War, 1945–1953|first=James A.|last=Huston|publisher=Susquehanna University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-941664-84-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ID4E3Lm8TsgC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=turkey+cold+war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After participating with the United Nations forces in the [[Korean War]], Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]. Following a decade of [[Cypriot Civil War|intercommunal violence]] on the island of [[Cyprus]] and the [[EOKA-B|Greek military coup of July 1974]], overthrowing President [[Makarios III|Makarios]] and installing [[Nikos Sampson]] as a dictator, Turkey [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded the Republic of Cyprus]] in 1974.

The [[Single-Party Period of Republic of Turkey|single-party period]] was followed by [[Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey|multiparty democracy]] after 1945.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25096">The '''International Electrical Congress''' was a series of international meetings, from 1881 - 1904, in the then new field of [[electrical engineering|applied electricity]]. The first meeting was initiated by the French government, including official national representatives, leading scientists, and others. Subsequent meetings also included official representatives, leading scientists, and others. Primary aims were to develop reliable standards, both in relation to electrical units and electrical apparatus.

==Historical background==
In 1881, both within and across countries, different electrical units were being used. There were at least 12 different units of electromotive force, 10 different units
of electric current and 15 different units of resistance.&lt;ref name=Petley483&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petley, B.W.|first= |date=1994-95 |title=A Brief History of the Electrical Units to 1964 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/31/i=6/a=007 |subscription=yes|journal=Metrologia |volume=31 |page=483 |doi= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other international Congresses were held, and sometimes referred to as International Electrical Congress, Electrical Conference, and similar variations. Secondary sources make different judgments about how to classify the Congresses.  In this article, the Congresses with representatives from national governments are identified as ''International Electrical Congress''. Other Congresses — often addressing the same issues  — are identified here as ''Concurrent Related International Electrical Congresses''. Some of these related conferences were devoted to preparing for an International Electrical Congress.

In 1906 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Overview: Summary |work = IEC History

==Related International Electrotechnical Conferences==

===1905 in Berlin===
''Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten'' (International Conference on Electrical Units)

Held 23-25 October at [[Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt]] at [[Charlottenburg]]. The 1904 Congress recommended holding an international conference to address discrepancies in the electrical units and their interpretation. [[Emil Warburg]], president of the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] in Germany, invited representatives from corresponding national laboratories in the United States ([[National Bureau of Standards]]), the United Kingdom ([[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]), and the official standards commissions in Austria and Belgium to an informal conference on electrical standards and units.&lt;ref name=L244&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}pp. 243-244&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Mascart (France), Rayleigh (United Kingdom) and [[Henry Smith Carhart |Carhart]] (USA) were invited because of their expertise and influence.&lt;ref name=L244/&gt; Thirteen of the fifteen invited persons participated in the conference, six from the Reichsanstalt, two from the Belgian Commission on Electrical Units, two from the Austrian Commission on Standardization, [[Richard Glazebrook]] from the National Physical Laboratory, Mascart, and Carhart. The non-attendees were [[Samuel Wesley Stratton]], director of the National Bureau of Standard, who sent three papers outlining the positions and proposals of the Bureau, and Rayleigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; A proceedings was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verhandlungen der Internationalen konferenz über elektrische masseinheiten abgehalten in der Physikalischtechnischen reichsanstalt zu Charlottenburg vom 23. bis 25. oktober 1905 |date=1906 |author=Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten |publisher=Reichsdruckerei |url=https://books.google.com?id=TKD2ZwEACAAJ |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Concentrated on the redefinition of the ohm, ampere, and volt, as resolved in the 1904 Congress. The aim was to attain true international uniformity in definitions of these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 351 &lt;/ref&gt; The main question was whether ''ohm'', ''ampere'', and ''volt'' should be independent of each other, or only two should be defined, and which two.&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49&gt;{{cite book | author=Tunbridge, P. | title=Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units | location=Peter Peregrinus | publisher=London | year=1992 |pages=49-51| isbn=0-86341-237-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZUK624LZBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference concluded that only two electrical units should be taken as fundamental: the [[Ohm#international ohm|international ohm]] and the [[international ampere]].&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt;  It also adopted the Western Cadmium Cell as the standard cell,&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt; and added rules about the preparation and use of the mercury tube, whose geometry was specified at the 1893 Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The conference resolved that another international conference in the course of a year should be held to establish an agreement about the electric standards in use, because different countries had different laws about electrical units.&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt;

===1908 in Marseille===
Held 14-19 September, in connection with the L'exposition internationale des applications de l'électricité.&lt;ref name=Turin/&gt; A three-volume proceedings was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title= Congrès international des applications de l'électricité Marseille (3 vol.)|url= |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |page= |date=1909 |location=Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six percent of the population of [[Gabon]] practice [[Islam]], according to a 2012 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gb.html |title=Gabon |date=12 January 2017 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most follow [[Sunni Islam]]. Eighty to ninety percent of the Muslims are foreigners.

Islamic, Catholic and Protestant denominations operate primary and secondary schools in Gabon. These schools are required to register with the Ministry of Education, which is charged with ensuring that these religious schools meet the same standards required for public schools. The government does not contribute funds to private schools, whether religious or secular.
[[Image:MOSQUEEPORTGENTIL.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Mosque in [[Port-Gentil]], Gabon]]

The Gabonese Government celebrates some Christian and Muslim holy days as national holidays. These include Easter Sunday and Monday, Ascension Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, Eid al-Kebir, and Eid al-Fitr.

The government television stations accorded free transmission time to the Catholic Church, some Protestant congregations, and Islamic mosques. Some Protestant denominations alleged that the government television station does not accord free airtime to minority religious groups. Protestants have alleged in the past that the armed forces favor Catholics and Muslims in hiring and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127233.htm www.state.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabon's executive branch was controlled by a Muslim, [[Omar Bongo]], from 1973 to 2009. Bongo converted to Islam in 1973 and changed his name from Albert-Bernard Bongo to its current form. Gabon is a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], having joined under Bongo's leadership in 1974.

In 2004 a first national conference for the Muslims of Gabon was held in the capital city of the country, Libreville, on the theme ‘United for the sake of a flourishing and tolerant Islam’. During the conference, heads of some 34 Islamic societies of Gabon signed an agreement for undertaking coordinated Islamic works on the sidelines of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafariyanews.com/2k4_news/june/17_gabonmuslimconf.htm www.jafariyanews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klácelka''' is a man-made [[cave]] in a [[forest]] near [[Liběchov]], [[Czech Republic]]. It is known for its complex of [[sculptural]] works made by sculptor [[Václav Levý]]. The name of the cave and the sculptures commemorate [[František Klácel]], a [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]]. It was created during the 1840s.

At the time of carving the Klácelka, Levý was an untutored young man. He chiseled from [[sandstone]] rock a cave that is an allegorical "[[Blaník]]" - a hall of sleeping heroes. These include the leader of the soldiers of the mythological army sleeping in Blaník and [[Hussite]] leaders [[Jan Žižka]] and [[Prokop Holý]]. The walls of the cave are festooned with [[relief]]s from fairy tales of ''Lišák Ferina'' by Klácel.

The theme of Blaník, central to the Klácelka, harks back to [[Protestant]] symbolism and the memory of the [[Hussite Wars]], notwithstanding the [[Catholic]] [[monarchy]] of the times.

The '''Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies''' is an interfaculty interdisciplinary research centre of the Humanities and Social Sciences at [[KU Leuven]], Belgium. It carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, and has been recognized as a KU Leuven Centre of Excellence.

== History and Research ==
The Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, with a particular focus on the following areas, taking the many cross-cutting issues into account: (i) the European Union and global governance, (ii) human rights, democracy and rule of law, (iii) trade and sustainable development, (iv) peace and security, (v) emerging powers, (vi) federalism and multi-level governance, (vii) global commons and outer space, and (viii) non-state actors.

In full recognition of the complex issues involved, the Centre approaches global governance from a multilevel and multi-actor perspective. The Centre considers non-European perspectives to global governance of great importance. It also hosts the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/eu_china_chair|title=– InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engages in interdisciplinary research and education on EU-China relations in close synergy with the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair at the Université catholique de Louvain, and the Leuven India Focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/india_focus|title=– Leuven India Focus|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which aims at developing knowledge and expertise on India and South Asia by organizing conferences, lectures and seminars and interdisciplinary research. The Centre regularly organizes transatlantic conferences and events focusing on Latin America and Asia, and takes a keen interest in the Global South.

In addition to its fundamental research, the Centre carries out independent applied research and advises policy-makers on multilateral governance and global public policy issues. It works with academic and policy partners from all over the world, including the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], [[European External Action Service]], [[Committee of the Regions]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The Centre publishes the Leuven Global Governance Series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-elgar.com/search_results.lasso?series_title=Leuven%20Global%20Governance%20series&amp;series_search=Yes&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Edward Elgar Publishing|Edward Elgar Publishers]], makes it research available through academic journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and global governance opinions on its web site and regularly publishes a newsletter.

Since March 2011, the Centre is located in the historical house de Dorlodot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/contact.html|title=Contact Information|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Centre of Leuven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">'''Maximos Sedfaoui''' (17 August 1863 – 27 February 1925) was the [[locum tenens]] and Apostolic Administrator (مدبّر رسولي) of the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] after the resignation of Patriarch [[Kyrillos Makarios]] in 1908. The Patriarch's exclusion and eventual travel to Beirut, Lebanon and the appointment of Sedfawi was greeted by a long series of opposition and demands for the reinstatement of Patriarch Makarios, but to no avail.

Maximos Swedfawi was born in [[Akhmim]], Egypt as Youssef Sedfawi. He studied at the Oriental College and later on received his doctorate in Theology in 1889. He was ordained as a Coptic Catholic priest in Beirut on 29 June 1889 and returned to Egypt. Also known as Joseph-Maxime Sedfaoui (sometimes Sedfawi), he was appointed Coptic Catholic Bishop of Hermopolis (Minia) from 1896. He was also appointed as Apostolic Administrator, a post he carried simultaneously from 1908 onwards until his death in 1925. He was succeeded by locum tenens [[Markos II Khouzam|Markos Khouzam]] starting 1927 until the latter's election as Patriarch in 1947.

In [[Wendish mythology]] '''Misizla''' (or '''Sicksa''') was a [[god]]like [[hero]]. He was a warrior-musician wearing sword and armour, playing his bagpipe. He may in fact be [[Misizlaw]] (died 999) who wanted to restore Slavic pagan faith.

The '''''Nigerian Compass''''' is a daily newspaper with National circulation in Nigeria, covering news, business, politics and sports. The paper has weekday and weekend editions.

The ''Compass'' is owned by [[Gbenga Daniel]], Governor of [[Ogun State]] from May 2003 to May 2011. 
In June 2009 the newspaper named Daniel the most outstanding governor in education in the country.
The award to the paper's owner drew both criticism and ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Daniel Gets Outstanding Gov Award From His Own Newspaper
 |date=17 Jun 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2009 the paper published a photograph of [[Wale Alausa]], a member of the Ogun State House of Assembly, taking an oath of loyalty while naked. Conflicting explanations were given about the event and the publication of the picture, which seemed to have political motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2010 Femi Shodunke, the deputy editor of the Nigerian Compass, was waylaid by four gunmen in [[Abeokuta]], the Ogun State capital. He narrowly escaped with his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2011 Chief [[Akintola Adeniyi]] (SAN), an [[Ibadan]]-based lawyer, launched a N50 billion libel suit against several individuals as well as the ''Nigerian Compass'' and the paper's Daily Editor, Mr Gabriel Akinadewo. The suit said the newspaper had reproduced libelous remarks made by the main target of the suit, Otunba Sunday Ojo Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After [[TheNews (Nigeria)|TheNews]] published a highly critical story on Daniel's eight-year governorship, Daniel responded angrily. He accused the weekly news magazine of having collaborated with [[Bola Ahmed Tinubu]] on the story. In their riposte on 17 March 2011, TheNews asserted the independence of their newspaper, saying "... we can only be bemused by the unfounded claims that our stories are being teleguided externally. The governor apparently does that with his Nigerian Compass. We concede that right to him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2014, the Nigerian Compass announced the acquisition of its publication right by Segun Oyebolu who had earlier made an offer of N1 Billion to Mr Daniel in 2012. The newspaper subsequently is published as a free national newspaper in Nigeria by the newly registered Compass FreePaper Limited owned by Segun Oyebolu http://theeagleonline.com.ng/gbenga-daniels-nigerian-compass-leased-businessman/

The '''Palais de Justice''' ({{IPA-fr|palɛ də ʒystis}}; '"Palace of Justice"), formerly the ''[[Palais de la Cité]]'' ("Palace of the City"), is located on the [[Boulevard du Palais]] in the [[Île de la Cité]] in central [[Paris]], [[France]].

==Overview==
Among the oldest surviving buildings of the [[Palais de la Cité]] are the [[Sainte Chapelle]] (built c. 1240, during the reign of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]) and the [[Conciergerie]], a former prison, now a museum, where [[Marie Antoinette]] was imprisoned before being executed on the [[guillotine]]. The justice of the state has been dispensed at this site since medieval times. From the sixteenth century to the [[French Revolution]] this was the seat of the [[Parlement de Paris]].

The building was reconstructed between 1857 and 1868 by architects [[Joseph-Louis Duc]] and [[Honoré Daumet]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 22. Daumet is sometimes spelled Dommey.&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior includes sculptural work by [[Jean-Marie Bonnassieux]].

It was opened in October 1868 with little fanfare, save from a visit by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]], prefect of the Seine. It was awarded the Grand Prix de l'Empereur as the greatest work of art produced in France in the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Zanten|first=David|title=Building Paris: Architectural Institutions and the Transformation of the French Capital, 1830-1870|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-521-39421-X|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Party of the Alliance of Youth, Workers and Farmers of Angola''' or ('''Pajoca''', abbreviation of ''Partido da Aliança Juventude, Operários e Camponeses de Angola'') is an opposition party in [[Angola]]. The president of Pajoca is [[Alexandre Sebastião André]] and the general secretary is [[Jesus Kabanga]]. The party was founded in [[Luanda]], on January 19, 1991.

Pajoca favours far-reaching autonomy for the [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] enclave.

In the 1992 elections Pajoca received 13,924 votes (0.35%) and got one MP elected, [[Alexandre Sebastião André]]. In the presidential election, PAJOCA supported the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) candidate.[http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/3ae6a6710.pdf]

In 1998 there was internal turmoil in Pajoca, with then president Sebastião Miguel Tetembwa expelling Alexandre Sebastião André. The first party congress was convened, which elected Alexandre Sebastião André as the new president. The congress also approved a new party constitution.

The women's organization of Pajoca is known as ''Organização da mulher do Pajoca - OMI-PA''.

The '''Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum''' was founded in 2004 as a forum for the regional parliaments of [[Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hamburg Parliament|Hamburg]], [[Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern)]], [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West Pomerania (Westpommern)]], [[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomerania (Pommern)]], [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmia-Masuria (Ermland-Masuren)]] and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast|administrative district of Kaliningrad]]. The regional parliament of the [[Skåne County|southern Swedish province Schonen]] is an associated Member.

== Background ==
The already existing bilateral relations between the regional parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the regional parliaments of Pomerania and West Pomerania were the starting point of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum.

The decision to form a parliamentary partnership was already taken in 2001 by the regional parliament of Schleswig-Holstein and the regional parliament of Pomerania. The parliaments made a commitment to cooperate especially in terms of European-, Baltic-, minority- and regional politics. In 2004 those two institutions decided to build a parliamentary partnership with the goal to form a network of parliamentary relations along the coast of the southern baltic sea.

The regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania already had intensive relations with the regional parliaments of Pomerania and West Pomerania before the parliamentary forum was founded.

In 1996, a meeting of parliamentarians took place in Krugsdorf (Germany). Representatives of the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the European Parliament, the association of the local community Pomerania, the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Association of Counties, the regional parliament of the voivodship of Stettin and representatives of the local association of the communities in Western Pomerania took part in this conference. In the years from 1997-2004 meetings of representatives of parliamentary expert groups took place for a bilateral exchange of information. The main subjects of discussion were economy, tourism and the handling of the custom stations. In 2001, a partnership agreement was signed by the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the regional parliament of Western Pomerania. In 2004, the declaration of the regional parliaments of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and of Pomerania followed.

In 2004, Poland joined the EU. This led to an intensification of parliamentary relations. The central subject was the European funding policy but also the perspectives of young people in this region that now was free of a constructed border.

This development was also a topic of the conference about „The perspectives of border crossing cooperation in the southern Baltic after the eastward expansion of the EU“ which took place in October 2003 in Schwerin. Representatives of the regional parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, West Pomerania and Pomerania participated in the conference. In the course of the following conference from 25–27 April 2004 in Gdansk, the “Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum” was founded. The forum had the goal to connect and coordinate the bilateral relations that already existed between the four regional parliaments. 
 
The good bilateral relations between Germany and Poland were the basis for the “Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum“ that was founded in 2004. From that point onwards, the parliamentary cooperation was taken to a multilateral level.

Subsequently, the regional parliaments of Warmia-Masuria and of the “Oblast of Kaliningrad“ joined the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum in 2008 as well as the free Hanseatic City of Hamburg in 2009. The southern Swedish region “Schonen“ joined the forum as an associated partner in 2005.

== Subjects ==
The Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum regularly deals with subjects that specifically affect the region. The regional parliaments have frequently addressed demands about certain issues of economy and structural politics, as well as the topics energy supply, scientific research, tourism and culture to the relevant actors in the southern Baltic region.

During the 4th Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum from 21-23 Mai 2006 in Kiel, an EU strategy for the Baltic sea region was discussed with view to the Green book of the European Commission for a future EU maritime strategy. So the gathering was meant to create a European agenda for the future sea politics of the EU in the southern Baltic. The forum considered an integrated, interdisciplinary and holistic EU maritime policy, which considers the opposing ecological and economic interests in the southern Baltic region, as necessary. 
 
== Milestones ==
The increasing integration of European policies has increasingly influenced the work of the parliamentary forum. In 2007, the European Commission created an action plan for an integrated maritime policy. Subsequently, the parliamentary forum dealt on a regular basis with the measures announced in the action plan, e.g. the support of intersectionary clusters or the competitiveness of maritime transport. So the main topic of the 7th parliamentary forum which took place in Schwerin was “The implementation of European strategies in the southern Baltic”. From then onwards, the parliamentary forum had significantly supported the development of the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region and made comprehensive contributions in the consultation process. Additionally, it was decided to evaluate the policies resulting from the EU strategy on a yearly basis. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is particularly active as the coordinator for the tourism policies. The main topic of the 9th Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum in Gdansk was the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region. The 13th parliamentary forum took place from 20–21 April 2015 in Hamburg. It mainly dealt with “Science and university cooperation in the Baltic sea area”. The 14th parliamentary forum with the topic “Agriculture, fishery and food industry – Innovation and cooperation in the southern Baltic region” took place from 12–14 June 2016 in Kiel.

== Functioning ==
The delegates of the participating regional parliaments, the associated partners and representatives from politics, science and economy come together yearly in the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum to discuss the subjects that effect the region and to elaborate on recommendations in these matters. The nominated experts give the parliamentarians scientific support with view to the forum´s topics. These topics are the foundation for the resolutions in which the delegates express demands to the relevant actors in the southern Baltic region. Following the annual conference, the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has implemented the resolutions regularly with a parliamentary resolution on the basis of a joint proposal of the democratic parliamentary groups.

The actual members of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum are the regional parliaments of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, West Pomerania, Pomerania and Warmia-Masuria as well as the administrative district of Kaliningrad. The southern Swedish province of Schonen is an associated Partner.

The delegates regularly establish working groups to prepare the annual conferences and to elaborate on the actual issues with experts.

Working groups were established in the past to deal inter alia with the topics “Integrated EU maritime policies”, “Baltic sea strategies” and “Energy supply”. The region Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania presided in the working group “Energy supply” which was established at the 5th Parliamentary forum in 2007. The expert committees of the regional parliaments participating in the forum came together in Schwerin and Stettin to work on recommendations concerning the energy policies of the members of the forum together with international experts.

A unique aspect of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum is the participation of young people in the conferences. Just like the parliamentarians the young people discuss subjects affecting the region and make recommendations to the delegates. At the 3rd forum that took place from 18–20 September 2005 in Binz, the transnational youth project “youth, region and parliament” was initiated. This project gives young people the opportunity to intern in the office of a parliamentarian. This way, young people get an idea of how parliaments in the different regions and countries work and get to know the other country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">The '''Yamoussoukro Decision''' was a treaty that allowed for [[open skies]] among most African countries.  The decision was endorsed by 44 members of the [[African Union]] in 1999, and became binding in 2002.&lt;ref name="schlumberger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Skies for Africa – Implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/open-skies-for-africa|last=Schlumberger|first=Charles|website=World Bank|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty grants [[freedoms of the air|fifth freedom]] transit rights between all of its signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberalising aviation in Africa: the Yamoussoukro Decision|url=https://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/Aviation/International/George-Etomi-Partners/Liberalising-aviation-in-Africa-the-Yamoussoukro-Decision|website=www.internationallawoffice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also sought to eliminate restrictions on ownership of airlines and frequency limits on international routes between signatory states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africans Still Divided on Single Air Transport Market|url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2018-01-30/africans-still-divided-single-air-transport-market|website=Aviation International News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical implementation and application of its policies however faced a number of setbacks and was not completed by all African Union members.&lt;ref name="schlumberger" /&gt;

In 2018, the [[Single African Air Transport Market]] was launched with the intent of fully implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kazeem|first1=Yomi|title=African countries have taken the first major step towards cheaper continental flights|url=https://qz.com/1191558/africa-union-launches-single-african-air-transport-market/|website=Quartz|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
