'''Brigade 6''' is an inactive [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Infantry]] [[Brigade]]. Upon mobilization of the Norwegian Army, this Infantry Brigade will be under the command of the [[6th Division (Norway)|6th Division]] of the [[Norwegian Army]].

The 6th Division was commissioned in 1933 to establish a field brigade with the same number as the division. 6th Brigade is often referred to as 6 fields brigade in literature on [[World War II]].

In 2004, plans called for Brigade 6 to be a mobilisation brigade, using the equipment earmarked for training, maintenance, and repair (the second set of equipment) of [[Brigade North]]. Brigade 6 was not to be deployable overseas for international operations, but was planned to be capable of taking part in network-based multinational operations on Norwegian territory.&lt;ref&gt;John Berg, 'High Priority: Country Briefing: Norway,' [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], 12 May 2004, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astro NJOI''' is a Malaysia free [[satellite television]] service launched on 18 February 2012 in collaboration with the [[government of Malaysia]] and [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]].&lt;ref name="note1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PM launches country's first free satellite TV service |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/12/20/nation/20111220132018&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220234300/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F12%2F20%2Fnation%2F20111220132018&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially announced by former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Najib Razak]] on 20 December 2011.&lt;ref name="note2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Free satellite TV|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/12/21/nation/10137348&amp;sec=nation|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, the service provided 18 television channels and 19 radio stations. However, existing Astro customers may purchase this service through separate account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=njoi - FAQ|publisher=[[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]]|url=http://www.astro.com.my/njoi/faq|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At launch, the set-up which consist of a set-top box, Out-Door Unit (ODU) satellite dish, smartcard and remote control unit, was available at a one-time payment of RM 305 at all Astro authorised retailers, with a standard installation fee of RM 100 from an Astro-authorised installer as stated on the website. In mid-2013, the one-time payment was reduced to RM 280, and installation remains at RM 100. The platform uses prepaid card method where one can pay for the day and amount for the prepaid channels that one wants to watch. The decoder's HDMI output is locked out and this leaves users with composite signal and component video output. However, certain decoders with updated firmware are able to use the HDMI output.  NJOI launched of its first HD channel, channel 300 (Xi Yue HD), on 1 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free to Njoi - hi-def TV shows|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/entertainment/tv/news/2015/01/29/free-to-njoi|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the recommended retail price has been set at RM285 (inclusive of GST). RM350 (excluding RM100 installation) had been the new price of new set from 1 February 2017. On 1 October 2017, the total price has been set at RM355. Njoi's main competitor would be antenna based DTT service, [[MYTV Broadcasting|MYTV]].

[[File:Attila's Throne and Torcello Museum.JPG|thumb|Attila's Chair with the [[Museo Provinciale di Torcello]] behind it]]
'''Attila's Throne''' is an ancient stone chair. It has, however, nothing to do with the king of the [[Huns]], as it was put into place around 100 years after his death, it was most likely the [[podestà]]’s or the [[bishop]]’s chair. The chair is located on the quiet and sparsely populated island of [[Torcello]] at the northern end of the [[Venetian Lagoon]] in [[Italy]].

== Local Legends ==

Multiple local legends surround the throne's history and legacy. The most notable being one who sits on the throne will return to ''Torcello''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiegel|first1=Jessica|title=Visiting Torcello Island in the Venice Lagoon|url=http://www.italylogue.com/things-to-do/visiting-torcello-island-in-the-venice-lagoon.html|website=italylogue|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular legend is that [[Attila]] himself used the throne, This is untrue. The throne was most likely the seat of power for the [[Magister militum]], the governor of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attila's throne in the Isle of Torcello in Venice|url=http://www.venetoinside.com/en/hidden-treasures/hidden-treasure-details/attilas-throne-in-the-isle-of-torcello-in-venice/|website=venetoinside|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auberge d'Allemagne''' ({{lang-mt|Berġa ta' Alemanja}}) was an auberge in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. It was built between 1571 and 1575&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auberges in Valletta|url=https://vassallohistory.wordpress.com/auberges-in-malta/|website=vassallohistory.wordpress.com|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to house knights of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] from the [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langue]] of [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]. 

It was vacated in 1798 when the Order was expelled during the [[French occupation of Malta]]. By the 1830s, the building was used as the residence of the Chief Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacGill|first1=Thomas|title=A hand book, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta|date=1839|publisher=Luigi Tonna|location=[[Malta]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm4DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1839 to make way for [[St Paul's Pro-Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=angelfire&gt;{{cite web|title=the auberges in valletta|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ma/maltarchitecture/auberges_valletta.html|website=angelfire.com|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auberge d'Allemagne was the only auberge in Malta to be intentionally demolished, since the other destroyed auberges were pulled down due to damage sustained in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The houses of the Knights of St. John|url=http://www.malta.com/en/attraction/culture/building-fortification/the-auberges|website=malta.com|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some remains may still exist in situ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymomd|last=Scicluna|journal=Annual Report 2016 Superintendence of Cultural Heritage|title=Dokument imqiegħed fuq il-Mejda tal-Kamra tad-Deputati fis-Seduta|volume=It-Tnax-Il Legislatura|issue=Numru 501|date=3 April 2017|publisher=Ministru għall-Ġustizzja, Kultura u Gvern Lokali|language=Maltese|url=https://www.parlament.mt/media/88791/08699.pdf|page=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916192403/https://www.parlament.mt/media/88791/08699.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta Valletta BW 2011-10-07 12-32-05.JPG|thumb|left|The site of the auberge is now occupied by [[St Paul's Pro-Cathedral]]]]

The powerplant has been the first of its kind in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.si/en/ HSE Power Company site]&lt;/ref&gt;

It pumps water from a height of {{convert|105|m}} above sea level near the village of Avče to a height of {{convert|625|m}}. The accumulation lake is close to the village of [[Kanalski vrh]], it holds a little over 2 million cubic meters of water. The generator generates {{convert|185|MW}} when producing electricity and uses {{convert|180|MW}} when pumping water.  The same turbine is used for pumping and generating electricity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seng.si/che_avce/ ČHE Avče, Soške elektrarne Nova Gorica], vpogledano 18.2.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of the process is 77%, which means it is profitable to operate when electricity generated costs 30% more. The lake has a capacity to operate for 15 hours at full power, discharge rate is around 40 cubic meter per second. Normally it will operate from 6 to 10 hours, usually filling the lake at the end of the week.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">The '''balance of threat''' ('''BoT''') theory was proposed by [[Stephen M. Walt]] first in an article titled "''Alliance Formation and the Balance of World Power''"&lt;ref&gt;Walt, Stephen: [http://www.christoph-rohde.de/waltallianceformationandbop1985.pdf Alliance Formation and the Balance of World Power]&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal ''[[International Security]]'' in 1985 and later further elaborated in his book ''"The Origins of Alliances"'' (1987). The balance of threat theory modified the popular [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] theory in the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school of [[international relations]]. 

According to balance of threat theory, states' [[alliance]] behavior is determined by the [[threat]] they perceive from other states. Walt contends that states will generally [[balancing in international relations|balance]] by allying against a perceived threat, although very weak states are more likely to [[bandwagoning|bandwagon]] with the rising threat in order to protect their own [[National security|security]]. He points to the example of the alliance patterns of European states before and during [[Allies of World War I|World War I]] and [[Allies of World War II|World War II]], when nations with a significantly greater combined power allied against the recognized threat of German [[expansionism]].

Walt identifies four criteria states use to evaluate the threat posed by another state: its aggregate '''strength''' (size, population, and economic capabilities), its '''geographic proximity''', its '''offensive capabilities''', and its '''offensive intentions'''. Walt argues that the more other states view a [[Rising Power|rising state]] as possessing these qualities, the more likely they are to view it as a threat and balance against it.

Balance of threat theory modified [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] (as well as the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] of [[Kenneth Waltz]]) by separating [[Power (international relations)|power]] from threat. In balance of power theory, which had previously dominated realist analyses, states balance against others whose power (i.e., military capabilities) was rising—greater power was assumed to reflect offensive intentions. Walt argues that this is not borne out by empirical evidence, and that balance of threat theory—in which states will not balance against those who are rising in power but do not display offensive intentions—gives a better account of the evidence. For instance, the [[United States]] was most powerful of the two [[Superpower|superpowers]] during the [[Cold War]], but, contrary to the balance of power theory, more states (e.g., the [[NATO]] nations) allied with it than with the [[Soviet Union]] because the United States displayed much less aggressive intentions toward them than did the Soviet Union.

The flaw of the balance of power theory became even more striking after the disappearance of the Soviet threat. With its power [[Polarity (international relations)|unbalanced]], Walt argued in 2004, the United States is still formally allied with NATO, [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and several other countries, and hints that the U.S. might withdraw its forces still tend to provoke requests for a continued U.S. presence.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walt, "Can the United States Be Balanced? If So, How?" (Chicago: American Political Science Association, September 2-4, 2004, http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/5/9/9/6/pages59968/p59968-1.php), p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balancing (international relations)|Counterbalancing]] coalitions predicted by the balance of power theory hardly appeared:
{{quote|
Responses to U.S. primacy pale in comparison to self-defeating self-encirclement that Wilhelmine Germany or the Soviet Union provoked, cases where most of the other major powers made formal or informal alliances to contain or defeat these powerful expansionist states … To date, at least, there is little sign of a serious effort to forge a meaningful anti-American alliance ... Instead of facing a combined coalition of major powers, united by a common desire to contain American power, the main adversaries of the United States have been the isolated and oppressive regimes… that possess little power and even less international support. With enemies like these, one might ask, who needs friends? From the traditional perspective of balance-of-power theory, this situation is surely an anomaly. Power in the international system is about as unbalanced as it has ever been, yet balancing tendencies are remarkably mild. It is possible to find them, but one has to squint pretty hard to do it ... The anomaly of states failing to balance U.S. power vanishes when we focus not on power but on threats. Although the United States is enormously powerful relative to other states, it has not been perceived as a major threat by most other powers.&lt;ref&gt;"Can the United States Be Balanced?" p 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">'''Cannabis in Gibraltar''' is illegal, but due to its proximity to North Africa and to mainland Europe, Gibraltar has frequently been used for cannabis trafficking.

==Trafficking==
Prior to 1957, cannabis trafficking in Gibraltar was limited to small personal amounts by tourists, but with the arrival of the [[Hippie Trail]], larger amounts began to be commercially smuggled, leading Gibraltar to become one of the main entry points to Europe for Moroccan hashish.&lt;ref name="Booth2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecITBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282|date=16 June 2015|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-08219-0|pages=282–{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Terminal page number needed.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s the market began to shift, with decreasing focus on trafficking cannabis and illegal cigarettes, and more on trafficking heroin and cocaine.&lt;ref name="Gold2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gold|title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6ZnmbCBJtkC&amp;pg=PT187|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27674-5|pages=187–{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Terminal page number needed.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Corazones de mujer ''''' is a 2008 film.

== Synopsis ==
Once upon a time there was the best [[Middle East|Arabic]] [[dressmaker]] of the city: his name was Shakira, he was a travestite and he had to make her wedding gown to Zina, a [[fiancée]] just about to get married. But she wasn't a virgin, something inconceivable in the Arab world. To get back to zero miles, they get into an old Alfa Romeo in Turin and head towards Morocco. And that's how the journey that will save their lives starts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">In [[archeology]], '''eastern ''sigillata'' A''' ('''ESA''') is a category of late Hellenistic and early Roman ''[[terra sigillata]]''. In 1957, [[Kathleen Kenyon]] introduced categories A, [[Eastern sigillata B|B]], [[Eastern sigillata C|C]], to classify eastern ''sigillata'' without determining the exact place of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Doorselaer|first=André|title=Archaeological and historical aspects of West-European societies: album amicorum|year=1996|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-6186-722-7|pages=500–501|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NAAS5jBI-IC&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=Eastern%20sigillata&amp;pg=PA500#v=onepage&amp;q=Eastern%20sigillata&amp;f=false}} and Crowfoot, J. W., Crowfoot, G. M. H., Kenyon, K. M., &amp; Palestine Exploration Fund. (1957). ''The objects from Samaria''. London: Palestine Exploration Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; For ESA, still no production centers have been identified but distribution patterns suggest an origin in northern Syria.  ESA is distinguished by the fineness of its fabric, which stands out as very pale in comparison to the deep red-slip that usually covers all surfaces. When fully applied, the slip is of a consistent color and thickness across the vessel. There are many examples on which the thickness of the slip varies considerably or on which firing is inconsistent and very dark in patches. A full range of plates, bowls, cups and jugs was produced. Early forms develop in the context of an eastern Mediterranean [[Hellenistic Koine]], while later products are influenced by trends originating in Italian workshops. Many ESA forms are mold-made and exhibit distinct delineation between walls and floors as well as elegantly curved exterior and base profiles. A further technical feature is the frequent occurrence of a "double-dipping [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]" that is the result of, first, one half of a vessel being dipped in dilute [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] and then the other half being similarly treated. The consequent overlap produced a line of thicker slip that became visibly darker during firing.

'''Fontvieille''' is the southernmost [[Monaco#Wards|ward]] in the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]]. It was developed by an Italian architect, [[Manfredi Nicoletti]], between the 1970s and the 1990s.

== History ==
In contrast to the other city districts [[Monaco-Ville]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[La Condamine]], Fontvieille was constructed, after Italian engineer Gianfranco Gilardini&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lesacablog No real name given + Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/lesaca/2907061962/ |title=081001tpbm &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilardinifoundation.org/pages/page1.html |title=Gilardini Foundation home page |publisher=Gilardinifoundation.org |date=2008-09-13 |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407170810/http://www.gilardinifoundation.org/pages/page1.html |archivedate=2011-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;'s design, almost entirely on artificially reclaimed land and thus represents one of the younger parts of the principality. In order to combat the chronic land shortage in the extremely densely populated principality, the work was begun in 1966 to create new land in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] southwest of ''[[Monaco-Ville|le rocher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monaco-montecarlo.com/index-port_fontvieille-de.html |title=The harbour of Fontvieille in Monaco |publisher=Monaco-montecarlo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the then Crown Prince Albert (since April 6, 2005 [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]]) laid the cornerstone for the new city quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.monaco.mc/monaco/700ans/hist.html |title=The 700 Years of Grimaldi |publisher=.monaco.mc |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of Fontvieille, and its many public works projects, relates substantially to former [[Prince of Monaco]], [[Prince Rainier III]]'s reputation as the Builder Prince.

Plans announced in late 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/monaco/6894991/Monaco-to-build-into-the-sea-to-create-more-space.html |title=Monaco to build into the sea to create more space |publisher=The Telegraph |date= 2009-12-28|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend Fontvieille by the Department of Urban Development are currently being overseen by Prince Albert. The plan is to build a small 0.05&amp;nbsp;km² (0.02 sq mi) or 5.3 ha (13 acres) aura on the west side of the rock, currently planned to be finished by 2015.{{Update inline|date=May 2017}}

The new area will include 3 to 4 new hotels, corporate businesses, shops and apartments for between 600-800 newcomers.

Despite not being the highest priced part of Monaco, flats are also very expensive. For example, 65 m² (700&amp;nbsp;ft²) 1 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom and 1 car parking space, was offered at €3,200,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biairealestate.com/ Biai Real Estate]&lt;/ref&gt; (about $3,514,000 US) in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=3200000&amp;From=EUR&amp;To=USD XE Currency Converter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Fontvieille represents the southwestern portion of the [[city-state]], which is an area of {{convert|0.33|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|33|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. It accommodates 3,602.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/e89a6190e96cbd1fc1256f7f005dbe6e/ecac6bc472645d75c12575a80042a62e/$FILE/Recensement2008_p8-9.pdf Recensement 2008]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Convert|4|ha}} of Fontvieille are given over to the [[Fontvieille Park and Princess Grace Rose Garden]].&lt;ref name='Mon'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fontvieille Park and the Princess Grace Rose Garden|url=http://www.visitmonaco.com/en/Places-to-visit/Gardens/Fontvieille-Park-and-the-Princess-Grace-Rose-Garden|work=Visit Monaco - Fontvieille Park and the Princess Grace Rose Garden|publisher=Visit Monaco|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stade Louis II ==
Fontvieille contains [[Stade Louis II]] (or Louis II Stadium), which serves as the home ground of [[AS Monaco FC]], a Monaco [[football (soccer)|football]] club that is one of the most successful in the [[France|French]] [[Ligue 1|national league]]; the stadium also contains the club's offices and the [[International University of Monaco]] (IUM). The ground also hosted the [[European Super Cup]], an annual event pitting the winners of the top [[UEFA]] club competitions, the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], between 1998 and 2012; it also serves as a venue for [[track and field]], hosting an annual [[IAAF Diamond League]] event.

== Landmarks ==
The district also contains the [[Monaco Heliport]], which provides frequent links to [[Nice Airport]] in neighboring [[France]], with connections to direct flights to [[New York City|New York]], [[Dubai]], [[London]], and other important [[Europe]]an destinations.

Monaco's [[automobile museum]], the [[Monaco Top Cars Collection]], is located on the Terrasses de Fontvieille.&lt;ref name='kjhg'&gt;{{cite web|title=Museums|url=http://www.visitmonaco.com/en/Places-to-visit/Museums|work=Visit Monaco - Museums|publisher=Visit Monaco|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Stamps and Coins]] contains a display of Monegasque money dating to 1640, which illustrates the postal history of the principality.

[[Columbus Hotel Monaco]], which was owned by former racing driver [[David Coulthard]], is located in Fontvieille.

[[Venturi Automobiles|Venturi]] and its subsidiary [[Voxan]] are headquartered on the northern side of Fontvieille.

{{Islam by country}}
According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística]] (the National [[Statistics|Statistical]] Institute of [[Portugal]]), there were, according to the 1991 [[census]], 9,134 [[Islam|Muslims]] in Portugal, about 0.1% of the total population, even though the Islamic Community of Lisbon presently points to a number of about 40,000 according to 2011 estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comunidadeislamica.pt/02b.php?nivel_1=2&amp;nivel_2=22 Comunidade Islâmica de Lisboa - Comunidade Islâmica em Portugal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218031757/http://www.comunidadeislamica.pt/02b.php?nivel_1=2&amp;nivel_2=22 |date=2009-12-18 }} and [http://www.comunidadeislamica.pt/02b3.php?nivel_1=2&amp;nivel_2=22&amp;nivel_3=223 Comunidade Islâmica de Lisboa - Quantos somos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218034946/http://www.comunidadeislamica.pt/02b3.php?nivel_1=2&amp;nivel_2=22&amp;nivel_3=223 |date=2009-12-18 }} (dead links) (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Muslims in the country are [[Sunni]]s, followed by approximately 5,000 to 7,000 [[Sevener|Sevener Ismā'īlī Shīʻa]] Muslims. There is also a small number of [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mamiop8TPxYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YdmiU_yQPNH07AaJroG4Ag&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Islam, Europe's Second Religion: The New Social, Cultural, and Political Landscapes | page=193 | author=Shireen Hunter | publisher=Praeger Publishers | isbn=0-275-97608-4 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Muslim population originates from the former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas provinces]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambique]], most of the latter having their origin in [[South Asia]].

==History==
[[File:Itin mertola.jpg|right|thumb|Old Mosque in [[Mértola]]. Converted into a church]]
From 711 to 1249, much of the territory of what is now Portugal (namely south of the [[Mondego River|Mondego]] river, but particularly in the [[Alentejo]] and the [[Algarve]]) was under [[Moors|Muslim]] control, and was called [[Gharb Al-Andalus|Gharb Al-Andalus]] (the west of [[Al-Andalus]]). This presence has left some [[Culture of Portugal|cultural]] [[cultural heritage|heritage]] in Portugal, such as [[Islamic art]]. The town of [[Mértola]], in the [[Alentejo]], possesses the only partial remains of a mosque, converted to a [[Catholic church]] after the ''[[Reconquista]]''.

'''Jon-Lars''' is a Swedish farm located in [[Alfta]] in [[Ovanåker Municipality]] in the province of [[Hälsingland]]. It is one of seven decorated farms in Hälsingland that have been listed as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s since 2012. It has also been [[Listed buildings in Sweden|classified as "byggnadsminne"]] in Sweden since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lagskydd|url=http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/anlaggning/visaLagskydd.raa?anlaggningId=21300000000505&amp;page=lagskydd|agency=Direction nationale du patrimoine de Suède|language=sv|accessdate=24 April 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Jon-Lars farm has been in the same family since the 17th century. After a fire in 1851, it was completely rebuilt by two brothers, Anders and Olof Andersson. The main building, which has eighteen rooms and over fifty windows, was completed in 1857. 

The Jon-Lars farm was designed to accommodate the families of the two brothers. Two separate dwellings share a reception room. The farm underwent renovations and modernization most recently from 1979–1980; however, the buildings were left mainly intact.&lt;ref name="RAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Historik|url=http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/anlaggning/visaHelaHistoriken.raa?anlaggningId=21300000000505&amp;historikId=21000000530853|agency=Direction nationale du patrimoine de Suède|website=Bebyggelseregistret|language=sv|accessdate=24 April 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hälsingegård JonLars|url=http://langhed.se/index.php/foer-besoekaren/9-haelsingegardarna/16-haelsingegard-jonlars|language=sv|date=2000|accessdate=24 April 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and decoration ==

Like other decorated farms in Hälsingland, the Jon-Lars farm is built of wood. In addition to the main building, the site also includes a shed, a barn and other utility buildings. Most of these buildings have red-painted walls. The interior decorations of the main building are presumably the work of the traveling painter Dalmatian Svärdes Hans Ersson.&lt;ref name="RAA" /&gt;

'''Turkish-Lebanese relations''' are the [[diplomatic relations]] between the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] and the [[Lebanon|Republic of Lebanon]]. Lebanon has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and a consulate general in [[Istanbul]]. Turkey has an embassy in [[Beirut]].

Although matters between [[Ankara]] and [[Beirut]] have never been tense, relations between Turkey and Lebanon have mostly been coldly dormant owing to the former's quietness towards the [[Second Intifada]] because of [[Turkey-Israel relations|its' closeness to Israel]]. However, relations between the two countries have the hope of thickening because of [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]]'s actions during the [[2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflict|Offensive in Gaza]]. Also, the two nations are connected through history because Lebanon gained independence from [[Ottoman Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2667/pdf/i7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical relations==
The [[Ottoman Empire]], which controlled Lebanon as part of Syrian Vilayat, had Lebanon as the most diverse region in the Ottoman Empire. There was several ethnic and religious tensions, notably the infamous [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war]] which devastated Lebanon and the Ottoman further imposed strict rule in Lebanon.

==Modern relations==
===Competing with Iran===
The Turkish Government under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] has perceived the [[Hezbollah]], a Shi’a militant group backed by [[Iran]] with a negative perception, based on historical trauma in Lebanon and the threat to Turkish legacies in Lebanon. Thus Turkey has sought to maintain closer tie with Lebanon, to dismantle Iranian influence inside Lebanon. The influx of Hezbollah fighters coming to Syria fighting against Turkey-backed [[Free Syrian Army]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/ap-turkey-lebanon-hezbollah-should-leave-syria/3655262.html&lt;/ref&gt; is also the reason why Turkey tries to establish stronger ties with Lebanon in order to weaken Iran's role in Lebanon.

===Armenian Genocide===
Lebanon was the first Arab state to recognize the [[Armenian Genocide]] in 2000, which is denied by Turkey. As such, this has put the relationship between two nations suffered a low point.

[[File:Kirchhügel Bendern.jpg|thumb|left|The chapel hill of Bendern, with the Liechtenstein Institute in the middle of the picture]]
The Liechtenstein Institute was founded on August 15, 1986, the national holiday of the Principality of Liechtenstein by the initiative of [[Gerard Batliner]] as a research center for practical and fundamental research relating to Liechtenstein.
The institute does not award degrees and does not offer lectures, which are typical for universities. Therefore, the Liechtenstein Institute is a university-like institution according to the higher education act of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The institute’s organising institution is an incorporated non-profit society, according to  the private and corporate law of Liechtenstein.

Since 1998 the Liechtenstein Institute is located in the present building, the old parsonage on the chapel hill of Bendern. 

In the first years, the founding of the institute relied solely on private contributions. Nowadays the public authorities provide two-thirds of the means.

[[Image:The match-The Gambia.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional wrestlers compete at [[Boreh]] in [[The Gambia]].]] 
'''Lutte Traditionnelle''' (fr. for ''Traditional Wrestling'') is a style of [[West African]] [[folk wrestling]], known as [[Laamb]] in [[Senegal]], [[Boreh]] in [[The Gambia]], [[Evala]] in Togo, and '''KoKowa''' / '''Kokawa''' in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] areas of [[Nigeria]] and [[Niger]], or simply ''Lutte Traditionnelle'', in [[Niger]] and [[Burkina Faso]].  International competition takes place during the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] and the newly organised [[:fr:Championnat d'Afrique de lutte traditionnelle|Championship of African Lutte Traditionnelle]]. 

==Variation==
Since the 1950s, a number of West African traditions have been assimilated into Lutte Traditionnelle as it has become a major spectator sport and cultural event.   The major variation has become [[Laamb]], or Senegalese Wrestling, which allows punching (''frappe''), the only of the West African traditions to do so.  As a larger confederation and championship around Lutte Traditionnelle have developed since the 1990s, Senegalese fighters now practice both forms, called officially ''Lutte Traditionnelle sans frappe'' (for the international version) and ''Lutte Traditionnelle avec frappe'' for the striking version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sports.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=63 Government of Senegal: COMITE NATIONAL DE GESTION DE LA LUTTE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507084322/http://www.sports.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=63 |date=2006-05-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, and Hausa areas of Niger, '''Kokawa''' has become regularised to the West African standard. There the striking component has been hived off to a separate boxing event called [[Dambe]]. Both are performed on the same traditional ring, though Dambe has become the preserve of traveling cofraternaties of fighters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/08/africa_traditional_boxing_in_nigeria/html/11.stm In pictures: Traditional boxing in Nigeria]. Text by Andrew Walker, pictures by Afolabi Sotunde.  BBC World Service, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
Two fighters compete in a circular ring, in more formal events bound by sand bags.  Each fighter attempts to eject the other from the ring, though they can win by knocking the other off their feet or onto all fours.&lt;ref&gt;See a guide to the sport at : [http://www.afrik.com/article8454.html Tout savoir sur la lutte sénégalaise]: interview with Abdou Wahid Kane, professor of the Sociology of Sport at the Institut national supérieur de l’éducation physique et du sport de Dakar.  Badara Diouf, Afrik News, 30 May 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

==International organisation==
Lutte Traditionnelle has grown in organisation and popularity throughout much of West Africa since the 1980s.  Alongside national championships in many nations, several organisations have organised international tournaments, which in turn have necessitated a harmonisation of rules. International competition takes place during the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] and since 2000, is overseen by a coordinating body which organises the  [[:fr:Championnat d'Afrique de lutte traditionnelle|African Championship of lutte traditionnelle]].  In 2008, the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) organised its first international championship for Lutte Traditionnelle in [[Dakar]], inviting teams from eleven nations: Senegal, [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Guinea]], [[Gambia]], [[Guinée Bissau]], [[Togo]], [[Liberia]] and la [[Côte d'Ivoire]].  Nigeria won the competition, marking the first time an Anglophone nation (outside the Gambia) has won a major Lutte tourney. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=APA53838larbioaedec0 L'arbitrage décrié au tournoi de lutte traditionnelle de la CEDEAO].

{{Nihongo|'''Oki Kano'''|加納 沖|Kanō Oki}} known professionally as '''OKI''', is an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] [[Japan]]ese  musician, from [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinra.net/interview/2012/03/15/000000|language=japanese|title=巨大なシステムの中で OKIインタビュー|website=Cinra.net|last=金子|first=厚武|date=March 15, 2012|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[industrial arts]] at the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]. His father, [[Bikki Sunazawa]], was a renowned wood sculptor. Oki uses the [[tonkori]], an Ainu stringed instrument, in his performances and mixes traditional [[Ainu music]] with [[reggae]], [[dub music|dub]] and other styles of [[world music]].  He also plays guitar and traditional Ainu percussion instruments.  

Oki performs frequently in Japan, and he has also taken part in a number of folk music festivals in other countries.  In 2006, he released the album ''[[Kíla &amp; Oki (album)|Kíla &amp; Oki]]'' with the Irish band, [[Kíla]].  His earlier solo albums include collaborations with the female Ainu singing group Marewrew, who sometimes appear in his live show as well.  More recently, he has played with his own Oki Dub Ainu Band, which plays mostly traditional Ainu songs in an electric style which mixes [[dub music|dub]] rhythms with tonkori playing.  During live concerts, he either plays with the Dub Ainu Band or as a solo acoustic act, singing and playing the tonkori.

The '''Sang-O (Shark) class submarines''' ([[Hangul]]: 상어급 잠수함) are in use by [[North Korea]], and are the country's largest indigenously-built submarines. A single unit was captured by the [[Republic of Korea Navy]] (South Korea) after it ran aground on 18 September 1996 in the [[1996 Gangneung submarine infiltration incident]].

==Sang-O II / K-300==
[[File:Gangneung sub 8990.jpg|thumb|left|A ''Sang-O''-class submarine captured by South Korea on display at ''Tongil'' (Unification) Park near [[Gangneung]] in 2012.]]
It was widely reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = KPN deploys new version of Sang O class Coastal Submarine | date = 21 March 2011 | author = Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. | publisher = KPA Journal | url = http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/03/21/2011032100584.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2011 that a new version of the Sang-O class had been deployed in North Korea. Satellite imagery from 2005 suggests the Sang-O II / K-300 may have been produced at the Mayang-do naval base and fitted out at the dry docks located at 39.9978 N, and 128.20019 E.&lt;ref name="osgeoint1"&gt;{{cite news | title = South Korea releases details of North Korea coastal submarine | date = 25 April 2011 | url = http://osgeoint.blogspot.com/2011/04/south-korea-releases-details-of-north.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other footage of the nearby docks of Sinp'o appear to depict the Sang-O II / K-300 as early as 2004 (at 40 01'31.20"N 128 09'55.80"E). Subsequent satellite imagery shows the Sang-O II / K-300 deployed to the Ch’aho-rodongjagu submarine Navy Base at 40.205441 N 128.649524 E on North Korea's east coast.&lt;ref name="osgeoint1"/&gt;

According to the KPA Journal,&lt;ref name="kpajournal1"/&gt; the decision to develop a larger, improved version of the Sang-O came in the late 1990s or early 2000. The Sang-O II / K-300 is a stretched version of the original Sang-O class with an approximate length of 39 to 40 metres and a corresponding surface displacement of approximately 300 to 340 tons.

The increased length and internal volume would suggest an increase in the operational range of the submarine and troop/equipment carrying capabilities. Top speed is also reported to be higher in the new model, meaning an improved propulsion system is likely using some of the extra length.

'''Sliač Airport''' {{Airport codes|SLD|LZSL}} or, historically, ''Letisko Tri Duby'' (literally, "The Three Oaks Airport") is an international airport in central [[Slovakia]] situated between the towns of [[Zvolen]] and [[Banská Bystrica]] and near the spa town of [[Sliač]]. The airport has one runway which is 2,400 m long (18/36). The airport is used by the military as well as commercially for civilian flights.

==History==
The "Tri Duby Airport" played an important role during the [[Slovak National Uprising]] in 1944 when it became the most important airport of the Anti-Nazi Resistance in Slovakia. Between September 6 and October 25, 1944, the airport was being used as the main base of the [[Slovak Insurgent Air Force]] but because of the advancing German units, it later had to be evacuated. While the territory controlled by the Slovak rebels was being encircled by the hostile German forces, "Tri Duby" and the nearby [[Zolná]] airport were the main gateways to the rest of the world. In addition to the significant Soviet aid to Slovakia, the [[United States]], too, were sending in supplies and [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] operatives through "Tri Duby", and these flights were also used to evacuate American aeronauts liberated from the German [[prisoner of war|POW]] camps.

The airport changed its name from "Tri Duby" to Sliač in 1945. 
In 2009, it was closed for a major reconstruction project financed in part by NATO and the EU. It was reopened for military use in May 2011, and for civilian use in June 2011.

Sliač Airport currently operates only charter flights to popular sea resort destinations in [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

'''''The Nation''''' is a daily newspaper published in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]. According to a 2009 survey it was the second-most-read newspaper in Nigeria, and this result was repeated in a 2011 report by The Advertisers' Association of Nigeria (ADVANS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollingsworth|first1=Mark|last2=Kemedi|first2=Von|title=Against The Odds|date=2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784621339|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OA7XBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=%22the%20nation%22%20nigeria%20newspaper%20circulation%20figures&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20nation%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paper's website says it stands for freedom, justice and the market economy. Its target audience is the business and political elite, the affluent, the educated and the upwardly mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The newspaper covers business and economy, public policies, the democratic process and institutions of democracy, sports, arts and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The newspaper became the first of its kind to gain nationwide circulation across the 36 states of Nigeria within two years of operation. This was a result of its popular eight-page pull-out Thursday publication titled ''Campuslife'', a medium specially dedicated to student journalists and writers across the tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The ''Campuslife'' pull-out, with the late Ngozi Agbo (née Nwozor) as pioneer editor, helped the newspaper to become a household name across Nigeria, and several student journalists and correspondents whom the paper gave the opportunity to write for it as undergraduates are now renowned in their various professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ojo|first1=Gbenga|title=Ngozi Agbo: The unforgettable impact - The Nation Nigeria|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/ngozi-agbo-the-unforgettable-impact/|website=The Nation, Nigeria|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campus Life Girl Ngozi Agbo Dies At 36 - Politics - Nigeria|url=http://www.nairaland.com/950896/campus-life-girl-ngozi-agbo|website=nairaland.com|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Conference on Trade and Development''' ('''UNCTAD''') was established in 1964 as a permanent intergovernmental body.

UNCTAD is the part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] dealing with trade, investment, and development issues. The organization's goals are to: "maximize the [[international trade|trade]], [[foreign direct investment|investment]] and development opportunities of [[developing countries]] and assist them in their efforts to integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis. UNCTAD was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1964 and it reports to the UN General Assembly and [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unctad.org/en/Pages/aboutus.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all aspects of development including trade, aid, transport, finance and technology. The conference ordinarily meets once in four years; the permanent secretariat is in Geneva.

One of the principal achievements of UNCTAD (1964) has been to conceive and implement the [[Generalised System of Preferences]] (GSP). It was argued in UNCTAD that to promote exports of manufactured goods from developing countries, it would be necessary to offer special tariff concessions to such exports. Accepting this argument, the developed countries formulated the GSP scheme under which manufacturers' exports and import of some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at reduced rates in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive advantage.

The creation of UNCTAD in 1964 was based on concerns of developing countries over the international market, multi-national corporations, and great disparity between developed nations and developing nations. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established to provide a forum where the developing countries could discuss the problems relating to their economic development. The organisation grew from the view that existing institutions like [[GATT]] (now replaced by the [[World Trade Organization]], WTO), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and [[World Bank]] were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was closely associated with the idea of a [[New International Economic Order]] (NIEO).

The first UNCTAD conference took place in [[Geneva]] in 1964, the second in New Delhi in 1968, the third in [[Santiago]] in 1972, fourth in [[Nairobi]] in 1976, the fifth in [[Manila]] in 1979, the sixth in [[Belgrade]] in 1983, the seventh in Geneva in 1987, the eighth in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in 1992, the ninth at [[Johannesburg]] (South Africa) in 1996, the tenth in [[Bangkok]] (Thailand) in 2000, the eleventh in [[São Paulo]] (Brazil) in 2004, the twelfth in [[Accra]] in 2008, the thirteenth in [[Doha]] (Qatar) in 2012 and the fourteenth in [[Nairobi]] (Kenya) in 2016.

Currently, UNCTAD has 195 member states and is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. UNCTAD has 400 staff members and a bi-annual (2010–2011) regular budget of $138&amp;nbsp;million in core expenditures and $72&amp;nbsp;million in extra-budgetary technical assistance funds. It is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are non-governmental organizations participating in the activities of UNCTAD.&lt;ref&gt;http://unctad.org/en/docs/tdngolistd12_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2018, 195 states are UNCTAD members:&lt;ref name="UNCTAD Members"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unctad.org/meetings/en/SessionalDocuments/tdbinf241_en.pdf|title=Membership of UNCTAD and membership of the Trade and Development Board|publisher=unctad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; all [[Member states of the United Nations|UN members]] plus UN observer states [[state of Palestine|Palestine]] and the [[Holy See]]. UNCTAD members are divided into four lists, the division being based on [[United Nations Regional Groups]]&lt;ref name="UNCTAD Members"/&gt; with six members unassigned: Armenia, Kiribati, Nauru, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tuvalu. List A consists mostly of countries in the African and Asia-[[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Groups of the UN. List B consists of countries of the [[Western European and Others Group]].

The lists, originally defined in 19th General Assembly resolution 1995&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/A/RES/1995(XIX)&lt;/ref&gt; serve to balance geographical distribution of member states' representation on the Trade Development Board and other UNCTAD structures. The lists are similar to those of [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization#Membership|UNIDO]], an UN [[specialized agency]].

the most recent member are the Palestinians&lt;ref&gt; {{cite|title=Palestinians join 2 UN agencies, chemical weapons pact|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5269489,00.html}} &lt;/ref&gt;

* The UNCTAD Trade and Development Board – the board manages the work of UNCTAD between two conferences and meets up to three times every year;
* Four UNCTAD Commissions and one Working Party – these meet more often than the board to take up policy, programme and budgetary issues;
* Expert Meetings – the commissions will convene expert meetings on selected topics to provide substantive and expert input for Commission policy discussions.

=== Geneva, 1964 ===
In response to developing country ([[Least Developed Country]], LDC) anxiety at their worsening position in world trade, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted for a 'one off' conference. These early discussions paved the way for new IMF facilities to provide finance for shortfalls in commodity earnings and for the Generalised Preference Schemes which increased access to Northern markets for manufactured imports from the South. At [[Geneva]], the LDCs were successful in their proposal for the conference with its secretariat to become a permanent organ of the UN, with meetings every four years.&lt;ref name="UNCTAD VI: background and issues"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD VI: background and issues|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5412&amp;title=unctad-vi-issues-prospects-ldcs|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Delhi, 1968 ===
The New Delhi Conference, held in February and March 1968, was a forum that allowed developing countries to reach agreement on basic principles of their development policies. The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in persuading the North to follow up UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing generalised preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was raised to 1% of the North's [[GNP]], but the developed countries failed to commit themselves to achieving the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at UNCTAD conferences.

The conference led to the [[International Sugar Agreement]], which seeks to stabilize world sugar prices.&lt;ref name="UNCTAD VI: background and issues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The UN Conference on Trade and Development |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5262&amp;title=unctad-trade-development |work=ODI Briefing Paper 1|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Santiago, 1972 ===
The [[Santiago]] Conference, 15 April 1972, was the third occasion on which the developing countries have confronted the rich with the need to use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In [[Santiago]], substantial disagreements arose within the [[Group of 77]] (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.&lt;ref name="UNCTAD VI: background and issues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ODI Briefing Paper |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5314&amp;title=unctad-iii-problems-prospects|work=UNCTAD III, problems and prospects|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nairobi, 1976 and Manila, 1979 ===
UNCTAD IV held in [[Nairobi]] May 1976, showed relative success compared to its predecessors. An [[Overseas Development Institute]] briefing paper of April 1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the [[1973 Oil Crisis]] and the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other commodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal commodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity prices were: 'Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world inflation', the expansion of processing, distribution and control of technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD 5: A preview of the issues|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5369&amp;title=unctad-v-preview|work=ODI briefing paper No.2 1979|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAd VI: background and issues|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5412&amp;title=unctad-vi-issues-prospects-ldcs|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCTAD V in the wake of the [[Nairobi]] Conference, held in [[Manila]] 1979 focused on the key issues of: protectionism in developing countries and the need for structural change, trade in commodities and manufactures aid and international monetary reform,technology, shipping, and economic co-operation among developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper written in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs` role as the [[Group of 77]] in the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD: A preview of the issues|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5369&amp;title=unctad-v-preview|work=ODI briefing paper 1979|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgrade, 1983 ===
The sixth UN conference on trade and development in [[Belgrade]], 6–30 June 1983 was held against the background of earlier UNCTADs which have substantially failed to resolve many of the disagreements between the developed and developing countries and of a world economy in its worst recession since the early 1930s. The key issues of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity price stabilisation and trade.&lt;ref name="UNCTAD VI: background and issues"/&gt;
