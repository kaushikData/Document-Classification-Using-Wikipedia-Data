[[ASB Bank]] Limited v Harlick [1996] 1 NZLR 655 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding unconscionable bargains. 
&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Harlicks daughter and son in law wished to purchase a bread run, and in order to get the loan from the ASB, the Harlick's went guarantors on the loan.

Later, the loan came into default, and the ASB pursued the Harlick's for the loan. The Harlick's applied to the High Court to have the ASB's mortgage over their house set aside on the grounds of unconscionability, and the court set aside the mortgage.

The ASB appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the Harlick's thad not suffered from any "material disadvantage or disability', one of the three crucial elements for unconscionable bargains. The Court restored the ASB's mortgage over their house.

Nearly 300 new species were published in it, many of which are still current.

It appeared as Part Three of ''Appendix to the first twenty three volumes of Edward's Botanical Register'', the first two parts being indices of previous volumes of ''[[Edwards's Botanical Register]]'', of which Lindley was editor. It contained 58 pages, issued in three parts. Pages 1 to 16 were issued on 1 November 1839; pages 17 to 32 on 1 December 1839; and the remaining 26 pages on 1 January 1840.&lt;ref name="IPNI 992-2"/&gt; It also contained four [[woodcut]]s based on sketches by Lindley, and nine hand-coloured [[lithograph]]ic plates, the artist and lithographer of which are unacknowledged and are now unknown. According to Helen Hewson, the woodcuts are of high quality, but the plates "do not measure up to the standard of contemporary illustration".&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony" represents only the second attempt to provide a flora for the colony, the first being [[Stephan Endlicher]]'s  1837 ''[[Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de Hügel|Enumeratio plantarum]]'', a [[Latin]] work of which only one installment was published.&lt;ref name="IPNI 4363-2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=4363-2 | title = Enumeratio Plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ... de Hügel | work = [[International Plant Names Index]] (IPNI) | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindley 1839"&gt;{{A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there were at the time a great many undescribed species awaiting publication — speaking of the (now defunct) order Stylidaceae, Lindley remarks "In [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Brown]]'s [[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen|prodromus]] forty-six species only are named for all New Holland... but I possess from Swan River alone at least forty well marked species, and there are some of Baron Hugel's with which I am unacquainted".&lt;ref name="Lindley 1839"/&gt; Working primarily from the collections of [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]], Lindley was able to publish around 280 new taxa, many of which remain current.

==Boumediene v. Bush==
On June 12, 2008 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]],'' that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]] could not remove the right of [[Guantanamo captives]] to access the US Federal Court system.  It ruled that all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.

The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions were to determine if the evidence supporting the allegations that the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification as "enemy combatant". If so, the determination implied that the person should continue to be detained.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2008-10-24&gt;

'''''Antiquities of Mexico''''' is a compilation of facsimile reproductions of [[Mesoamerican literature]] such as [[Maya codices]], [[Mixtec codices]], and [[Aztec codices]] as well as historical accounts and explorers' descriptions of archaeological ruins. It was assembled and published by [[Lord Kingsborough|Edward King, Lord Kingsborough]], in the early decades of the 19th century. While much of the material pertains to [[pre-Columbian]] cultures, there are also documents relevant to studies of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. ''Antiquities of Mexico'' was produced to make copies of rare manuscripts in European collections available for study by scholars.

The work consists of nine volumes, each published in a large [[elephant folio]] format. It was originally planned as ten, but Lord Kingsborough died before the full work could be completed.

Kingsborough commissioned the Italian landscape painter [[Agostino Aglio]] to furnish the reproduction drawings and [[lithograph]]s of the [[Mesoamerica]]n artworks and codices used to illustrate the volumes. Born in [[Cremona]] and resident in [[London]] since 1803, Aglio had previously illustrated antiquities of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Magna Græcia]] on behalf of the English architect [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]]. Aglio spent the better part of six years travelling to the libraries and museums of Europe to examine and draw all of the "Ancient Mexican" documents, artefacts and manuscripts known in European collections of the time.

Many of the facsimiles of codices are hand-colored.

The '''Australian National Maritime Museum''' (ANMM) is a [[Australian government|federally]] operated [[maritime museum]] in [[Darling Harbour]], Sydney. After considering the idea of establishing a maritime museum&lt;!--when?--&gt;, the federal government announced that a national maritime museum would be constructed at Darling Harbour, tied into the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales State government's]] redevelopment of the area for the [[Australian bicentenary]]. The museum building was designed by [[Philip Cox]], and although an opening date of 1988 was initially set, construction delays, cost overruns, and disagreements between the state and federal governments over funding responsibility pushed the opening back to 1991.

One of six museums directly operated by the federal government, the ANMM is the only one located outside of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The museum is structured around seven main galleries, focusing on the discovery of Australia, the relationships between the Australian Aborigines and the water, travel to Australia by sea, the ocean as a resource, water-based relaxation and entertainment, the naval defence of the nation, and the relationship between the United States of America and Australia. The last gallery was funded by the United States government, and is the only national museum gallery in the world funded by a foreign nation. Four additional gallery spaces are used for temporary exhibits. Three [[museum ship]]s – the [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|HM Bark ''Endeavour'' Replica]], the destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D11|6}}, and the submarine {{HMAS|Onslow}} – are open to the public, while smaller historical vessels berthed outside can be viewed but not boarded.

==History==
Of the six museums operated directly by the Federal government (the ANMM, the [[Australian War Memorial]], the [[National Museum of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]], and [[Questacon]]), the ANMM is the only one located outside the Australian Capital Territory.&lt;ref name=Meacham/&gt; The museum is administered by the [[Department of Communications and the Arts]] on behalf of the Australian Government.

===Development===
In June 1985, the federal government announced the establishment of a national museum focusing on Australia's maritime history and the nation's ongoing involvement and dependence on the sea.&lt;ref name=ABS331&gt;ABS, ''Year Book Australia, 1991'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for the creation of such a museum had been under consideration over the preceding years.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm/&gt; After lobbying by New South Wales Premier [[Neville Wran]], the decision was made to situate the new museum at Darling Harbour, and construct it as part of the area's redevelopment.&lt;ref name=ABS331/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm/&gt; The building of the ANMM was seen by both the federal and New South Wales State governments as an important feature of the redevelopment, as it would be a major drawcard, and help fuel the commercial success of the precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Witcomb, ''Re-Imagining the Museum'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian National Maritime Museum (6599711987).jpg|thumb|Side view of the ANMM building]]
The museum building was designed by [[Philip Cox]], Richardson Taylor &amp; Partners.&lt;ref name=MacMahon&gt;MacMahon, ''The architecture of East Australia'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was shaped to invoke the image of billowing sails: the corrugated metal roof stands over {{convert|25|m}} tall on the west side, but drops significantly on the east.&lt;ref name=MacMahon/&gt;

During development, the museum ran into a series of difficulties. In March 1998, the three top members of the ANMM interim council were sacked by the federal government and replaced.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm&gt;Mendelssohm, ''Maritime Museum has that sinking feeling''&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the Department for the Arts informed the museum that its staff would be reduced by 30% and it would undergo budget cuts, forcing the ANMM to rely on contracted security and conservation staff, along with volunteer guides and attendants.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm/&gt; The acceptance of a US$5 million grant for a dedicated gallery showing the links between the US and Australia resulted in the displacement of much of the staff and research areas.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm/&gt; Most of these were later established in the nearby Wharf 7 building.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The museum was initially slated to open in 1988, but by October that year, construction delays had pushed the planned opening date to September 1989, and the project was already $12.5 million over the $30 million budget.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohm/&gt; Construction was completed on 17 November 1989; the cost of the museum's construction had increased to $70 million, and although the Federal government was willing to pay the initial $30 million, there were disagreements between the state and federal governments over who had to supply the additional $40 million.&lt;ref name=Totaro&gt;Totaro, ''Museum no-one wants to pay for''&lt;/ref&gt; It was resolved that New South Wales was responsible for the additional funding, and in October 1990, the museum building was handed over to the Federal government.&lt;ref name=OBrien&gt;O'Brien, ''Finally, smooth sailing for museum''&lt;/ref&gt; The ANMM was opened on 30 November 1991.&lt;ref name=Meacham&gt;Meacham, ''How the museum boss got engaged''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating history===
In order to achieve commercial sustainability, the ANMM was directed by the federal government to institute entry fees:&lt;ref&gt;Witcomb, ''Re-Imagining the Museum'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; the second Australian national museum to do so after [[Questacon]] was opened in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;NSTC, Report of Activities 1988–89, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The entry fee for the museum itself was dropped in 2004 (although access to the museum ships was still charged), then was re-added in December 2011.&lt;ref name=Meacham2011&gt;Meacham, ''Museum sets a course for the future''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the museum's first ten years of operation, 3.3 million visitors attended.&lt;ref name=Meacham/&gt;

In 2010, London's ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' listed the ANMM in its "World's 10 Coolest Museums".&lt;ref name=Meacham2011/&gt;

At the start of 2014, the ANMM announced that it would build a pavilion to showcase exhibits related to the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref name=AAPnewpav&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/new-pavilion-for-maritime-museum/story-fn3dxiwe-1226814029570 |title=New pavilion for maritime museum |last=Australian Associated Press |date=30 January 2014 |work=The Australian |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NCft4D13?url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/new-pavilion-for-maritime-museum/story-fn3dxiwe-1226814029570 |archivedate=7 February 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion, which will be located near the museum's naval vessels, will be built between July 2014 and September 2015.&lt;ref name=AAPnewpav/&gt;

==Galleries and vessels==

===Galleries===
Permanent exhibitions at the museum are focused around six gallery spaces:

;Navigators
:Originally called "Discovery of Australia", this gallery looks at discovery, exploration, and charting of Australia's coastline by the Dutch, British, and French, as well as trade between the Indonesians and Australian Indigenous people before European discovery.

;Eora-First People
:[[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aborigines]] and their relationship with the water.

;Passengers
:Looks at the journeys made to Australia by various groups, from the original settlers to war brides, refugees, and cruise ship visitors.

;Watermarks
:Celebrates "Australia's love affair with the water" in terms of recreation and entertainment.&lt;ref name=Meacham/&gt; The gallery was opened in December 2001, with major focal points including the yacht ''Blackmores First Lady'' (which was used by Australian [[Kay Cottee]] when she became the first woman to sail solo, nonstop, unassisted around the world), the [[coxless four]] rowing shell used by the [[Oarsome Foursome]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], and a vessel from the [[Darwin Beer Can Regatta]].&lt;ref name=Meacham/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMHCottee&gt;Cornford, ''Cottee sells First Lady to museum''&lt;/ref&gt; The space previously hosted the [[America's Cup]]-winning yacht ''[[Australia II]]'' as the centrepiece of the "Tall Gallery", but the yacht, owned by the Australian Government and not the ANMM, was transferred to the [[Western Australian Maritime Museum]] in late 2000.&lt;ref name=GoWest&gt;''Go West'', in ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Navy
:The role of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (and before that, the Royal Navy's [[Australian Squadron]]) in the defence of the nation. Includes the "''Sydney'' Series"; models and histories of the four Australian warships [[List of ships named HMAS Sydney|named after the city of Sydney]].

;Australia–US relationship
:The gallery looks at the links and commonalities between Australia and the US.&lt;ref name=Hundley45&gt;Hundley, ''USA Gallery Revisited'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; A US$5 million [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to the ANMM was the United States' gift for Australia's bicentenary, making the Australia-USA Gallery the only gallery in a national museum funded by a foreign nation.&lt;ref name=Hundley45/&gt; The gallery itself was designed by the Burley Katon Halliday firm.&lt;ref name=MacMahon/&gt;

[[File:AustralianNationalMaritimeMuseum1 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The original lenses from the Tasman Island Lighthouse; centrepiece of the Tasman Light Gallery. The [[Westland Wessex]] helicopter in the background is suspended above the Navy Gallery]]
In addition, there are four other gallery spaces in the museum. The Tasman Light gallery contains the original lenses from the [[Tasman Island Lighthouse]],&lt;ref name=row&gt;{{cite rowlett|tas|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for temporary photographic exhibitions and as hireable space for functions. The other three galleries (two along the eastern side of the top level, and a third offset from the main body of the museum) are used separately or together to host temporary exhibitions.

Other items on display inside the museum, but not associated with any particular gallery, include ''[[Spirit of Australia]]'', the [[Water Speed Record]]-holding motorboat, and an anchor from {{HMS|Sirius|1786|6}}, flagship of the [[First Fleet]].

===Museum ships===
The ANMM's collection of [[museum ship]]s focuses on three vessels that are open for public inspection: the [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|HM Bark ''Endeavour'' Replica]], the destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D11|6}}, and the submarine {{HMAS|Onslow}}.  In addition, the 19th century barque [[James Craig (barque)|James Craig]] is moored nearby and can be toured with a museum ticket.

During the mid-1980s, it was proposed that a [[ship replica|replica]] of explorer [[James Cook]]'s ship, [[HMS Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] be constructed for the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for construction was initially provided by the [[Bond Corporation]], and construction began at the start of 1988.&lt;ref name=Coombes37&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1990, the company ran into financial difficulties, and construction was unable to continue until a charitable trust was established in 1991 to complete and operate the replica ''Endeavour''.&lt;ref&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', pp. 37–88&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was completed in 1994, and spent the next ten years sailing around Australia and the world before ownership was transferred to the ANMM in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daring-class destroyer (1949)|''Daring''-class]] destroyer HMAS ''Vampire'' is the only ship of her class to be preserved, and was the last gun-destroyer to serve in the Royal Australian Navy.&lt;ref name=Gunton82/&gt; ''Vampire'' was commissioned into the RAN in 1959, and served until 1986.&lt;ref name=Gunton82/&gt; The destroyer was loaned to the ANMM on its opening in 1991, and was transferred completely to museum ownership in 1997.&lt;ref name=Gunton82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class]] submarine HMAS ''Onslow'' was introduced into RAN service in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; She was operated until early 1999, and was given to the ANMM that year.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, ''Onslow finds new home''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite no longer being in naval commission, ''Vampire'' and ''Onslow'' have permission to fly the [[Australian White Ensign]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ''Onslow''{{'}}s acquisition, the former Russian submarine [[Soviet submarine B-427|Foxtrot-540]] was on display at the museum from 1995 to 1998.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;Walsh, ''Soviet sub penetrates Sydney Harbour!'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine had been purchased in 1994 by a group of Australian businessmen, and was placed on display for the duration of the [[lease purchase contract]], after which the submarine was relocated to California.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8193">The '''Berggruen Museum''' (also known as the '''Berggruen Collection''') is a collection of [[modern art]] classics in [[Berlin]], which the collector and dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]], in a "gesture of reconciliation", gave to his native city.  The most notable artists on display include [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Henri Matisse]].  The Berggruen Collection is part of the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery of Berlin]].

==History==
[[File:Stülerbau Sammlung Berggruen.jpg|thumb|The Berggruen Museum – West Stüler Building]]
[[File:Giovanni Battista Pittoni - The Death of Joseph - WGA17969.jpg|thumb|''Death of Joseph'' by [[Giambattista Pittoni]], Oil on canvas, 97 x 79 cm]]
The collection arrived in Berlin in 1996, with Berggruen's return to his native city after six decades in exile. In 1988 he had given about 90 [[Paul Klee|Klee]]s to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (December 21, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/arts/dealer-will-enrich-art-of-the-berlin-he-fled.html Dealer Will Enrich Art Of the Berlin He Fled] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990, he had agreed to make a five-year loan (renewable by mutual agreement) to the [[National Gallery]] in London of 72 paintings and drawings by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;John Russell (June 3, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/arts/art-view-gifts-that-can-change-the-climate-of-a-museum.html Gifts That Can Change The Climate Of A Museum] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (February 27, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/arts/design/27berggruen.html Heinz Berggruen, Influential Picasso Collector, Dies at 93] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1990, negotiations with [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]] for the Berggruen collection to be shown in Madrid fell through.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Berggruen initially lent the collection, which he had assembled over 30 years, to the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] (PCHF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2000/1111/feuilleton/0009/index.html Der Glückskauf für Berlin] Ingeborg Ruthe, ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', 11 November 2000. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally sold it to the PCHF in December 2000, for the "symbolic"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/landespressestelle/archiv/2004/01/05/17536/index.html Wowereit beglückwünscht Berggruen zum 90. Geburtstag] State of Berlin website, 5 January 2004. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; price of 253 million [[Deutsche Mark|marks]], well below its then estimated value of 1.5 billion marks.&lt;ref name=taz&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/archiv/?dig=2006/12/16/a0264 Ein Giacometti zum Abschied] ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'', 16 December 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it is exhibited under the title "Berggruen Collection – Picasso and His Time" as part of the National Gallery of Berlin, in the West [[Friedrich August Stüler|Stüler]] Building on Schloßstraße, opposite [[Charlottenburg Palace]].

The centrepiece of the collection is the work of Picasso, with over 100 exhibits, together with over 60 pictures by Paul Klee.  Henri Matisse is represented by over 20 works, including more than half a dozen of his famous [[Henri Matisse#The cut-outs|cutouts]].  [[Sculpture]] ensembles by Alberto Giacometti and examples of African sculpture round out the core of the collection.

Berggruen continued to purchase works after the museum's opening in 1996, including Picasso's important 1909 painting ''Houses on the Hill'' (''Horta de Ebro'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/robinson/robinson10-16-03.asp Weekend Update] Walter Robinson, ''[[Artnet]] Magazine''. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].  A total of 165 works were transferred from Berggruen to the PCHF in the 2000 sale.

In 2005 the Berggruen family acquired Picasso's ''Nu Jaune'' (1907) for [[U.S. dollar|$]]13.7 million at [[Sotheby's]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/arts/picasso-surprise-highlights-sothebys-strong-sale/22515/ Picasso Surprise Highlights Sotheby's Strong Sale] Carly Berwick, ''[[The New York Sun]]'', 3 November 2005. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[gouache]] is one of the first studies for ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', a milestone in 20th-century art.

To mark the 10th anniversary of the museum, and his permanent retirement from public life at the age of 92, Berggruen donated a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, ''Standing Woman III'', to the collection in December 2006.  It had in fact already been on loan at the museum until then, standing in the Stüler Building's [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]].  To keep the two-metre high bronze statue within the collection – his life's work – Berggruen quickly purchased it and donated it to the PCHF.&lt;ref name=taz /&gt;  Several weeks later, on 23 February 2007, he died in [[Paris]].

The museum received 1.5 million visitors during its first decade from 1996 to 2006.&lt;ref name=taz /&gt;  Besides the permanent exhibition "Picasso and His Time", the museum hosts numerous special exhibitions on themes of classic modern art.

==Expansion==

In July 2007 the heirs to Berggruen's estate announced that they would present a further 50 classic modern works to the museum, in order to continue in their father's tradition of reconciliation with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/ich-hoffe-ich-habe-sein-auge-geerbt/1026344.html Nicolas Berggruen: „Ich hoffe, ich habe sein Auge geerbt“] Interview with [[Nicolas Berggruen]], ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 28 August 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the transfer at Christmas 2000 Berggruen had continued to purchase paintings, including works by Picasso, Matisse, Klee and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], among others.  To make an expansion possible, the state of Berlin announced that it would endow the PCHF with a new building for its 50th anniversary: the Kommandantenhaus, adjacent to the West Stüler Building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtleben/familiaere-bande/987966.html Kunstsammlung Berggruen: Familiäre Bande] Nicola Kuhn, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 16 July 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/brueckenschlaege-zu-berggruen/990652.html Museumserweiterung: Brückenschläge zu Berggruen] Nicola Kuhn, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 18 July 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A society for friends of the Berggruen Museum (''Förderkreis Museum Berggruen e. V.'') was founded at the same time, with members including Berggruen's widow Bettina, his children [[Nicolas Berggruen|Nicolas]], [[Olivier berggruen|Olivier]], John and Helen, as well as [[Michael Blumenthal]], [[Michael Naumann]] and [[Simon de Pury]].  The PCHF agreed to take on the running costs of the society.

Plans were announced in 2008 to connect the two buildings with a glass [[pergola]], chosen from an architectural competition, to be paid for by the government and installed by the state of Berlin.&lt;ref name=erbe&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/ausstellungen/ein-grosses-erbe/1823078.html Museum Berggruen: Ein großes Erbe] Bernhard Schulz, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 31 May 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article1524898/Seit-er-denken-kann-ist-er-von-Kunst-umgeben.html Museum Berggruen: Seit er denken kann, ist er von Kunst umgeben] Matthias Gretzschel, ''[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]'', 9 June 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008 a further 70 paintings were added to the collection.&lt;ref name=erbe /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5013">'''Chronicon Paschale''' (the '''Paschal''' or '''Easter Chronicle'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Whitby|first=Mary|date=2012-10-26|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah03045|isbn=9781444338386|title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History|chapter=Chronicon paschale}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Chronicum Alexandrinum''', '''Constantinopolitanum''' or '''Fasti Siculi''', is the conventional name of a 7th-century Greek Christian  [[chronicle]] of the world. Its name comes from its system of chronology based on the [[Christian]] [[paschal cycle]]; its Greek author named it ''Epitome of the ages from Adam the first man to the 20th year of the reign of the most August [[Heraclius]]''.

==Structure==
The Chronicon Paschale follows earlier chronicles. For the years 600 to 627 the author writes as a contemporary historian&amp;mdash;that is, through the last years of emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], the reign of [[Phocas]], and the first seventeen years of the reign of Heraclius.

Like many chroniclers, the author of this popular account relates anecdotes, physical descriptions of the chief personages (which at times are careful portraits), extraordinary events such as earthquakes and the appearance of comets, and links Church history with a supposed Biblical chronology. [[Sempronius Asellio]] points out the difference in the public appeal and style of composition which distinguished the chroniclers (''Annales'') from the historians (''Historia'') of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]].

The "Chronicon Paschale" is a huge compilation, attempting a chronological list of events from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. The principal manuscript, the 10th-century ''Codex Vaticanus græcus'' 1941, is damaged at the beginning and end and stops short at 627. The Chronicle proper is preceded by an introduction containing reflections on Christian chronology and on the calculation of the Paschal (Easter) cycle. The so-called 'Byzantine' or 'Roman' era (which continued in use in [[Greek Orthodox Christianity]] until the end of Turkish rule as the 'Julian calendar') was adopted in the Chronicum as the foundation of chronology; in accordance with which the date of the creation is given as 21 March 5507.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Authorship==
The author identifies himself as a contemporary of the Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610–641), and was possibly a cleric attached to the suite of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|œcumenical Patriarch]] Sergius. The work was probably written during the last ten years of the reign of Heraclius.

The chief authorities used were: [[Sextus Julius Africanus]]; the ''[[Fasti consulares]]''; the ''Chronicle and Church History'' of [[Eusebius]]; [[John Malalas]]; the ''[[Acta Martyrum]]''; the treatise of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], bishop of Constantia (the old Salamis) in Cyprus (fl. 4th century), on ''Weights and Measures''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50495">This page contains a list of orbital launchers' families. To see the long complete list of launch systems, see [[Comparison of orbital launch systems]].

== Description ==

* Family: Name of the family/model of launcher
* Country: Origin country of launcher
* Manufac.: Main manufacturer
* Payload: Maximum mass of payload, for 3 altitudes
** LEO, [[low Earth orbit]]
** GTO, [[geostationary transfer orbit]]
** TLI, [[trans-Lunar injection]]
* Cost: Price for a launch at this time, in millions of US$
* Launches reaching...
** Total: flights which lift-off, or where the vehicle is destroyed during the terminal count&lt;br&gt;note: only includes orbital launches (flights launched with the intention of reaching orbit). Suborbital tests launches are not included in this listing.
** Space (regardless of outcome)
** Any orbit (regardless of outcome)
** Target orbit (without damage to the payload)
* Status: Actual status of launcher (retired, development, active)
* Date of flight
** First: Year of first flight of first family's member
** Last: Year of Last flight (for vehicles retired from service)
* Refs: citations

Same cores are grouped together (like Ariane 1, 2 &amp; 3, but not V). 
&lt;!-- &lt;small&gt;Approximative conversion : LEO mass / 2.5 = GTO mass&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;

| &lt;!-- 201503: I did a little research, and found a source for the total number of launches and the number that were successful, and thus reached their target orbit.  I'm leaving the specific {{cn}} tags on the stuff that is not yet sourced, and adding a citation to the specific claims that are sourced.  Putting citations in this column makes in quite unclear which of the many claims in all these myriad columns are sourced, and which are not.  N2e, March 2015 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Ok but this is destructive for the table setup. Astronautrix gives us all infos we needed. FlyAkwa --&gt;

Cymidei gave birth to one fully formed and armed warrior every six weeks.

She was the wife of [[Llasar Llaes Gyfnewid]], smaller and subservient to her. Together, they lived under a lake in [[Ireland]] and were the keepers of the Cauldron of Regeneration, into which they would throw dead warriors, who would then come back to life mute.

[[Matholwch]], king of Ireland in the tale, took the family in, but tired of them and ordered them thrown into an iron building which was then heated from the outside. Everyone died but Cymidei and Llasar, who escaped to [[Wales]] with the cauldron, which they gave to [[Bran the Blessed|Bendigeidfran]] as a peace offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joellessacredgrove.com/Celtic/deities.html Celtic Deities of Britain, Wales, Gaul, and Scotland (and surrounding areas)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are both mentioned as being guests at the wedding of [[Branwen]], sister of Bendigeidfran, and Matholwch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lugodoc.demon.co.uk/MYTH/MYTH06.HTM The Mabinogion (scroll down to Book II).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Edmonds Cookery Book''''' is a [[recipe book]] focusing on traditional [[New Zealand cuisine]]. It was first published as ''The Sure to Rise Cookery Book'' in 1908&lt;ref name="nzhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/edmonds-cookbook|title=The Edmonds Cookbook|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a marketing tool by [[baking powder]] manufacturer [[Thomas Edmonds (manufacturer)|Thomas Edmonds]] (today part of [[Goodman Fielder]]), but it is now known as a [[Kiwiana|Kiwi icon]].

The front cover shows the old factory on Ferry Road in [[Linwood, New Zealand|Linwood]], [[Christchurch]] (since demolished) and their slogan "Sure to Rise". Only two copies of the first edition are known to survive.&lt;ref name="nzhist" /&gt; The [[cookbook]] has gone through many editions in its 100-year history. In 1955, a "De Luxe" edition was introduced, and had gone through 57 reprints by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds Cookery Book, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been described as "as much a part of New Zealand kitchens as a stove and knife," and at one time it was "sent unsolicited to every newly engaged couple in New Zealand."&lt;ref&gt;Palenski, Ron: ''Kiwi Milestones : New Zealand's Population Through the Millions'' Hodder Moa Beckett, 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-86958-981-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmonds recipe books have sold over 3,000,000 copies. It remains New Zealand's fastest selling book with over 200,000 copies sold in one year.

==Editions==
The Edmonds Cookery Book has made several changes over its history to adapt to changing New Zealand tastes and new kitchen technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edmondscooking.co.nz/cookery-books-history |title= Edmonds Cookery Book History |publisher= Edmonds |accessdate= 2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">The '''ethnic competition thesis''', also known as '''ethnic competition theory''' or '''ethnic competition hypothesis''', is an academic theory that posits that individuals support [[far-right politics|far-right]] political parties because they wish to reduce competition from immigrants over scarce resources such as jobs, housing and welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rydgren | first1 = Jens | last2 = Ruth | first2 = Patrick | title = Voting for the radical right in Swedish municipalities: social marginality and ethnic competition?| journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | page = 209 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, support for the far right should be higher in areas if there are more immigrants and more lower-educated and lower-skilled voters who would face competition from them.

Several studies have found support for ethnic competition thesis. A 2011 study by Jens Rydgren and Patrick Ruth found some support for the theory in that support for the far-right [[Sweden Democrats]] party was higher in areas where there were a higher number of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rydgren | first1 = Jens | last2 = Ruth | first2 = Patrick | title = Voting for the radical right in Swedish municipalities: social marginality and ethnic competition?| journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | page = 202 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00269.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have questioned the link between the number of refugees, number of asylum seekers, or proportion of noncitizens and people born abroad and the success of the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norris | first = Pippa | title = Radical right : voters and parties in the electoral market | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780521613859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fortiva''' was a [[software as a service]] (SaaS) based [[E-mail archiving|email archiving]] company. Founded in 2005 by [[Paul Chen (businessman)|Paul Chen]], the former CEO and founder of [[FloNetwork]] (later acquired by [[DoubleClick]]). Fortiva's SaaS email archiving service introduced a "hybrid" method, taking advantage of storage and services "in the cloud" while leaving control over email services at the customer site. As a result, the company claimed to offer businesses the benefits of an in-house product with the advantages of a managed solution.

== History ==
The company was created in response to the growing legal and regulatory challenges that email presents for businesses, in combination with storage challenges. It was also one of the early companies to build a product "from the ground up" as using software as a service, and was recognized early on as a unique solution to the challenge of securely storing and retrieving email without maintaining all data in-house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan B.

== DoubleBlind Encryption ==

Fortiva was notable for its use of a proprietary method of data security, known as  [[Encryption|DoubleBlind Encryption]]. DoubleBlind Encryption ensured that customer data was encrypted at the customer site before being sent to Fortiva's secure datacenters. As a result, even Fortiva's own staff could not breach the security of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haoodnla.com/article/lxy09213010y9j01/452392# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071519/http://haoodnla.com/article/lxy09213010y9j01/452392# |archive-date=2012-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Globe Holdings v Floratos''''' [1998] 3 NZLR 331 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding where a condition in conditional contract is for the sole benefit of one party, the condition can be unilaterally waived by that party.
&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=221 - 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrows, Finn &amp; Todd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Burrows |first1=John |last2=Finn |first2=Jeremy |last3=Todd |first3=Stephen |publisher=[[LexisNexis]] |ISBN=978-192714-954-6 |year=2012 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The parties entered into a conditional sale agreement involving a block of apartments, requiring the obtaining a subdivision consent within 60 days to the purchasors satisfaction. The contract had a clause allowing either party to cancel the contract prior to a condition being waived, or fulfilled.

Ultimately, the subdivision consent was not obtained, but the purchaser notified the vendor that they had now waived this condition unilaterally, and that they should now treat the contract as now being unconditional.

The vendor response was that the condition was a benefit of both parties, and as such, was not able to be waived unilaterally.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal sitting as a bench of 5, applying [[Hawker v Vickers]] [1991] 1 NZLR 399 ruled that the purchasors were legally able to waive the condition, as it was solely for the benefit of the purchaser. Blandchard J stated: " It has to be remembered that we are at this point concerned with a situation in which it is to be accepted that there is no substantive benefit to [the vendors]." and "The court must reach a view on whether both parties are intended to have the benefit of a contingent condition by applying ordinary principles of contractual construction, examining the contract document as a whole in its factual matrix".

'''Grolier''' is one of the largest U.S. publishers of general encyclopedias, including ''[[The Book of Knowledge]]'' (1910), ''[[The New Book of Knowledge]]'' (1966), ''The New Book of Popular Science'' (1972), ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' (1945), ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]'' (1980), and numerous incarnations of a CD-ROM encyclopedia (1986&amp;ndash;2003).

Grolier is an educational [[publishing company]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacketflap.com/pubdetail.asp?pub=2780 JacketFlap]&lt;/ref&gt; known for its presence in school libraries. It has a strong presence among parents of children under six years old, the target of Grolier's direct mail-to-the-home business.&lt;ref name="HELLERREPORT2000"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630140728/http://www.allbusiness.com/sector-61-educational-services/546308-1.html "Acquisition activity in the education market heats up"], Heller Report on Educational Technology Markets, Monday, May 1 2000 (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000 Grolier became part of [[Scholastic Corporation]], which now maintains ''Grolier Online''.

==History==

[[Walter Montgomery Jackson|Walter M. Jackson]] (1863–1923) was the founder of encyclopedia publisher Grolier, Inc., and he was the partner of [[Horace Everett Hooper]] in publishing the 10th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and in developing its 11th edition.  He split with Hooper in 1908-1909 in a nasty legal fight after failing to wrest control of the ''Britannica'' from Hooper.

Jackson had founded the ''Grolier Society'', which specialized in making extra-fine editions of classics and rare literature.  The Society was named after the [[Grolier Club]], which had been founded in 1884 to advance the arts involved in making books and which was named after a well-known French [[bibliophile]], [[Jean Grolier de Servières]].

After the split with Hooper he acquired the rights to publish the British ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia]]'' under the name ''[[The Book of Knowledge]]''.

''Grolier, Inc.'' subsequently became a large publisher of general encyclopaedias, including ''The Book of Knowledge'' (1910), ''The New Book of Knowledge'' (1966), the ''Encyclopedia Americana'' (1945), the ''Academic American Encyclopedia'' (1980), ''The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia'' (1985 CD-ROM), and the ''Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia'' (1995).

Grolier had a US$100 million international business, primarily located in the UK, Canada and Asia. It had 1999 revenues of $450 million and earnings of approximately $45 million, with $4.5 million in Internet revenues.

By the late 1970s, Grolier has moved its operations to Danbury, Connecticut. In 1988 Grolier was purchased by the French media company [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]], which owned a well-known French-language encyclopedia, the ''Hachette Encyclopedia''. Hachette was later absorbed by the French conglomerate the [[Lagardère Group]]. In 1996, Grolier acquired the Chicago-based [[Children's Press]].

Grolier was then purchased by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] for US$400 million in 2000. The new owners projected a 30% increase in operating income, although historically Grolier had experienced earnings of 7% to 8% on income.&lt;ref&gt;"French Plan to Sell Grolier," ''PublishersWeekly.com'', 11/29/1999; "Scholastic to Acquire Grolier," press release, Scholastic Inc., 4/13/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff reductions as a means of controlling costs followed soon thereafter, even while an effort was made to augment the sales force. Cuts occurred every year between 2000 and 2007, leaving a much-depleted work force to carry out the duties of maintaining a large encyclopedia database.&lt;ref&gt;"Scholastic Has Record Year and Begins Grolier Integration," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 7/24/00; "Scholastic Sales Surge Continues," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 1/01/01; "Robinson: Scholastic's Business Remains Strong," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 10/01/01; "Sales Dip, Earnings Rise at Scholastic," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 7/29/02; "Scholastic Cuts 400 from Global Workforce," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 6/02/03; "Scholastic Takes a Charge," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 7/19/04; "Scholastic Cuts 30 Spots in Library Unit," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 6/02/05; "Scholastic to Cut Costs as Profits Fall," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 12/16/05; "Weak Results Prompt Closings, Layoffs at Scholastic," ''PublishersWeekly.com,'' 3/23/06.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic, which specializes in works for the K-8 market (Kindergarten-to-8th grade), has sought to position the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' as a reference resource for schools. It remains to be seen whether that strategy, applied to a venerable upper-level (even adult-level) publication, will work in the long run.

The name ''Grolier'' is retained as the Scholastic website ''Grolier Online''. The company exists as Grolier Incorporated.

==Imprints==
===Franklin Watts===
{{redirect|Franklin Watts|text=The UK branch of Franklin Watts is maintained by Hachette UK, and is not a part of the sale to Scholastic Corporation}}
'''Franklin Watts Inc.''' was formed in 1942. The company was sold to Grolier in 1957. When the namesake founder retired in 1967, he moved to London to start Franklin Watts Ltd. in 1969. Franklin Watts retired again in 1976.

When Grolier acquired [[Children's Press]] in 1996, much of Franklin Watts were published under the Children's Press imprint. When Hachette sold Grolier to Scholastic Corporation in 2000, Scholastic took U.S. rights to Children's Press and Franklin Watts as well. The UK branch exists today as an imprint of Hachette UK's Hachette Children's Books.

===Orchard Books===
{{redirect|Orchard Books|text=The UK branch of Orchard Books is maintained by Hachette UK, and is not a part of the sale to Scholastic Corporation}}
'''Orchard Books''' was founded in 1986 by Grolier as a children's publisher. Hachette, which acquired Grolier in 1988, sold Grolier to Scholastic Corporation in 2000, along with the U.S. branch of Orchard Books, while retaining the UK branch.
&lt;!--
Publications by Orchard UK include the [[Rainbow Magic]] and [[Beast Quest]] series, as well as titles by [[Lauren Child]], [[Giles Andreae]], [[Catherine and Laurence Anholt]], [[Cressida Cowell]], [[James Mayhew]], [[Anthony Horowitz]], [[Shoo Rayner]], [[Saviour Pirotta]] and Michael Lawrence.

Publications by Orchard US include titles by [[Jenny Nimmo]], [[P. B. Kerr]] and [[Patrick Carman]].--&gt;

==Grolier Collectibles==
The company produced the "Disney Christmas Magic Collection", a popular [[Christmas ornament]] line for [[Disney Consumer Products]]. This part of the business was sold to Early Moments.

==Grolier on CD-ROM==
Grolier's first [[CD-ROM]] publication was the text-only ''Academic American Encyclopedia on CD-ROM'' in 1985, and was one of the first commercial CD-ROM titles. The text was based on the ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]'', which comprised 30,000 entries and 9 million words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D8113AF93BA15752C1A96F948260 Lewis, Peter H. "PERSONAL COMPUTERS; CD-ROM for the Common Man," ''The New York Times'', November 28, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; The editions were updated quarterly&amp;mdash;a rate which outpaced the print edition. Eventually the CD-ROM edition was quite different from the print edition.

Grolier published the encyclopedia with numerous name variations: ''The Electronic Encyclopedia'' (1986), ''The Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia'' (1987), ''The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia'' (1988&amp;ndash;91), ''The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Kister"&gt;''[[Kenneth Kister|Kister]]'s Best Encyclopedias'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 edition was the first to feature pictures, and the 1992 edition was the first to deliver video and sound.&lt;ref name="Kister" /&gt; The last CD-ROM edition published was the 2003 ''Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia''.

==Video games==
In 1982 Grolier formed a subsidiary called '''Grolier Electronic Publishing Inc'''. Grolier Electronic Publishing Inc was renamed '''Grolier Interactive Inc''' in February 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/company/grolier-interactive-inc MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt; They made electronic encyclopedias for the [[Amiga]] and [[video games]] for [[DOS]], [[Windows]], [[Macintosh]] and the [[PlayStation]].
 
The [[video games]] they released include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/games.html?type=company&amp;mode=732&amp;sort=release&amp;dlx_type=all&amp;sortdir=desc&amp;official=all GameSpot]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gi.grolier.com/gi/products/games/docs/gimain.html GI's Game Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/grolier-interactive-inc/full,11 MobyGames]/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural''', or '''Hanoi Ceramic Road''' ({{lang-vi|Con đường Gốm sứ}}), is a [[ceramic]] [[mosaic]] [[mural]] along the walls of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] [[Dike (construction)|dike]] system  in the city of [[Hanoi]], northern [[Vietnam]]. 

With a length of about {{convert|6.5|km|mi}}, the 'Ceramic Road' is one of the major projects that were developed on the occasion of the [[Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi]].&lt;ref name=bxp&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.english.vietnamnet.vn/Entertainment/201009/Bui-Xuan-Phai%E2%80%99s-paintings-on-Hanoi-Ceramic-Road-934070/ |title=Bui Xuan Phai’s paintings on Hanoi Ceramic Road |date=7 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-10 |publisher=Vietnamnet.vn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912112001/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/Entertainment/201009/Bui-Xuan-Phai%E2%80%99s-paintings-on-Hanoi-Ceramic-Road-934070/ |archivedate=12 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hanoi Ceramic Road originated with the journalist Nguyễn Thu Thủy, who won a prize in the Hanoi architecture contest for her idea of transforming the dike system around Hanoi into a ceramic [[mosaic]]. 

The work of decoration began in 2007 for the dike wall of about 6.000m in length and 0.95m in height which runs along the road of Âu Cơ, Nghi Tàm, Yên Phụ, Trần Nhật Duật, Trần Quang Khải, Trần Khánh Dư and terminates at the pier of the [[Long Biên Bridge]].  She was supported by the [[Ford Foundation]], which funded the first {{convert|450|m|ft}} of the wall; and the planning, training, and infrastructure needed to complete the project.&lt;ref name="Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Wall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Thuy|title=Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Wall|url=http://hanoimural.blogspot.com|website=Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Wall|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ceramic Road was planned to be finished in 2010 to commemorate the [[Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet0327/&gt;

Participating in the work of decoration are not only Vietnamese artists but also foreign embassies and culture centres in Hanoi such as the [[Goethe-Institut]], [[Alliance française]] L'espace, [[British Council]], [[Società Dante Alighieri]] Dalte Centre, and other cultural centres of [[Russia]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=vietnamnet0327/&gt;

==Description==
The mosaic wall mural is made from [[ceramic]] [[tessera]]e which are product of [[Bát Tràng]], a nearby village famous for its [[Bát Tràng porcelain]].&lt;ref name=vietnamnet0327/&gt;

The content of the mosaic represents the decorative pattern from different periods in the [[history of Vietnam]]: [[Phùng Nguyên culture]]; [[Đông Sơn culture]]; [[Lý Dynasty]]; [[Trần Dynasty]]; [[Lê Dynasty]] and [[Nguyễn Dynasty]]. Also incorporated on the wall are modern art works, paintings of Hanoi, and children's drawings.&lt;ref name=vietnamnet0327/&gt;

===Guinness World Record===
Ms. Nguyen Thu Thuy said the project will strive to make it into the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] for the 'World's largest ceramic mosaic' by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://en.vietnamplus.vn/Home/First-leg-of-Ceramic-Road-unveiled/20097/790.vnplus| title = First leg of "Ceramic Road" unveiled| accessdate = 17 September 2010| author = VietnamPlus| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 14 July 2009| year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = | pages = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090718123551/http://en.vietnamplus.vn/Home/First-leg-of-Ceramic-Road-unveiled/20097/790.vnplus| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 October 2010, Guinness World Records adjudicator, Beatriz Fernandez, undertook an official review of the Hanoi ceramic mosaic to confirm its dimensions and ensure the strict guidelines relating to the record had been followed. Ms Fernandez confirmed that at 3,850 linear meters (6,950m²) of the Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural was the world’s largest ceramic mosaic and awarded a Guinness World Records certificate.&lt;ref name="WLCM"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Howard Samuel Irwin''' (1928 - ) is an American [[botanist]] and [[taxonomist]] who specializes in the genus ''[[Cassia (genus)|Cassia]]'' and worked as an administrator at the [[New York Botanical Garden]], [[Long Island University]], and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]].&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sinon |first1=Stephen |title=Howard S. Irwin Records (RG4)         Irwin, Howard S. |url=https://www.nybg.org/library/finding_guide/archv/irwin_rg4b.html |website=www.nybg.org |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life &amp; Education==
Irwin was born in [[Louisville, KY]] in 1928. He began his education at [[Northfield Mount Hermon School|Mount Hermon School]] in [[Massachusetts]], after which point he entered [[Hofstra College]] to pursue a career in music. He then transferred to the [[College of Puget Sound]] where he earned an undergraduate degree in biology with minors in music and history in 1950, and a subsequent degree in education.&lt;ref name="nybg-announce"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Executive Director of the New York Botanical Garden |journal=Garden Journal |date=August 1971 |volume=21 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin was then a [[Fulbright]] teacher of [[botany]] and [[zoology]] at [[Queen's_College,_Guyana|Queen's College]] in [[British Guiana]] from 1952 until 1956. During that time he was a coorespondent from [[TIME magazine]].&lt;ref name="clark-announcement"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Director at Clark Garden |journal=Cark Garden of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Newsletter |date=Fall 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 he began work on his PhD in taxonomic botany at the [[University of Texas]], earning his degree in 1960.&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin" /&gt;

==The New York Botanical Garden==
Irwin first began his association with the New York Botanical Garden while a graduate student at the [[University of Texas, Austin]]. During his time as a PhD student, Irwin traveled to [[Brazil]] and collected botanical specimens on behalf of NYBG, with the bulk of his collecting as a student taking place in 1958.&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin" /&gt; Irwin's field notebooks from his time in Brazil (in total eight expeditions between the 1950s and the 1970s) are held by the Archives of the New York Botanical Garden, along with earlier notebooks documenting his time in [[Guyana]] and notebooks for an expedition to [[Surinam]] between 1960 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Library catalog search for Irwin's field notebooks |url=https://willow.nybg.org/search/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=field+notes+irwin&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xfield+notebooks+irwin%26SORT%3DD |website=The LuEsther T. Mertz Library of the New York Botanical Garden |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin's vouchers were also deposited at NYBG and many can be viewed through the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Howard Irwin » C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium |url=http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/vh/specimen_list.php?ColParticipantLocal_tab=irwin&amp;LimitPerPage=20 |website=New York Botanical Garden |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwin was hired as a Research Associate at NYBG in 1960, promoted to Associate Curator in 1963, Curator and Administrator of the Herbarium in 1966, Head Curator in 1968, Executive Director in 1971, and President in 1973, a position that he held until 1979 to embark on a sabbatical to pursue scientific research and writing projects. The tenure of his administration is remembered as the most difficult financial period for NYBG, and Irwin is credited with leading the organization during a very challenging time.&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin" /&gt;

Donald J. Bruckmann, Chairman of the Board of Managers of the New York Botanical Garden wrote of Irwin upon his departure: "Under his stewardship he brought the Garden to new eminence in the world of horticulture and plant science, and made it a great cultural institution in the city with the highest standards in the world. During his tenure the [[Enid A. Haupt Conservatory]] was restored and The Cary Arboretum in [[Millbrook, NY]] was established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Irwin |first1=Howard |title=Memo |agency=The New York Botanical Garden |date=23 August 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his administrative work, Irwin is credited with initiating the Planalto do Brasil Program for the botanical study of the [[Brazilian Highlands]] region.&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin" /&gt;

==Additional Employment==
Irwin was appointed Vice Chancellor of [[Long Island University]] from 1980 until 1983 and Director of [[Clark Botanic Garden]] of the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] from 1983 until 1991.&lt;ref name="nybg-archives-irwin" /&gt; He is Trustee Emeritus of the Truro Conservation Trust in [[Truro, MA]], elected in 2008 after serving on the Trust Board from 2003 until 2008.&lt;ref name="truro-irwin"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Howard Irwin - Trustee Emeritus |journal=Truro Conservation Trust Newsletter |date=2008 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=[2] |url=http://truroconservationtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TCT-Newsletter-December-2008.pdf |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwin and Anne Lieb Wolff (now Anne Lieb Irwin) married on April 22nd, 1979 at the [[New York Botanical Garden]]'s [[Enid A. Haupt Conservatory]] in the [[Bronx, NY]]. Wolff graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Recognition: 1940s - Oberlin College and Conservatory |url=https://www.oberlin.edu/development/recognition/1940s |website=Oberlin College and Conservatory |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en |date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a master's degree from the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">'''Interpedia'''  was one of the first-proposed [[Internet encyclopedia]]s which would allow anyone to contribute by writing articles and submitting them to the central catalogue of all Interpedia pages.

==History==
Interpedia was initiated by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]], who posted a message titled "The Internet Encyclopedia" on October 25, 1993 to the PACS-L (Public-Access Computer Systems Forum) [[LISTSERV|Listserv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9310d&amp;L=pacs-l&amp;T=0&amp;P=1418 PACS-L Listserv message "The Internet Encyclopedia", Oct 25, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;  That message included the following musings:
:''The more I thought about this, the more I realized that such a resource, containing general, encyclopedic knowledge for the layman, would be an important tool for some types of research, and for the Net.Citizenry in general.''
:''Ahh.. but what about contributors... where will you find authors to write the short articles you need? Well, I'd first have to start out by finding some way of communicating with an extremely diverse set of people... everyone from [[linguistics|linguist]]s, to [[molecular biologist]]s, from [[animal rights]] activists to [[zymurgist]]s, and from [[geographer]]s to gas [[chromotographer]]s. Guess what? :-) The Net provides just such an arena! So I thought about it some more...''
:''... and came to the conclusion that this is a good idea!''

The term ''Interpedia'' was coined by R. L. Samuell, a participant in early discussions on the topic.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In November, 1993, discussions moved to a dedicated [[mailing list]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9311C&amp;L=PACS-L&amp;P=R2797&amp;I=-3 PACS-L Listserv message "Internet Encyclopedia (Interpedia) group project and mailing list", Nov 17, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented later by [[Usenet newsgroup]] &lt;tt&gt;comp.infosystems.interpedia&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landfield.com/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/comp/comp.infosystems.interpedia |title=RFD: comp.infosystems.interpedia |accessdate=2003-01-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011106225801/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/comp/comp.infosystems.interpedia |archivedate=November 6, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.interpedia/browse_thread/thread/a0adc2203f87191c/e92420e978d2c3a0?lnk=st Interpedia FAQ] (February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some disagreement about whether all pages should be in [[HTML]], [[plain text]], or whether all formats should be allowed (''e.g.'', as with [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]). Another point of discussion was whether outside Internet resources not specifically written for the Interpedia could become part of it by simply including them in the catalog.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Furthermore, several independent "Seal-of-approval" (SOAP) agencies were envisioned which would rate Interpedia articles based on criteria of their own choosing; users could then decide which agencies' recommendations to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.infosystems.interpedia/6hzoH_WQdPs Interpedia FAQ 15-MAR-94], section 4.2: "What are Seals of Approval (SOAP)?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was actively discussed for around half a year, but in the end never left the planning stages and finally died, perhaps partly due to the unprecedented growth of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Reagle: [http://reagle.org/joseph/2005/historical/digital-works.html#heading5 Wikipedia's heritage: vision, pragmatics, and happenstance] — section 3.2, ''Interpedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors of interracial attraction ==
The biggest determinants of interracial attraction is the location of which individuals live. The [[United States]] is frequently referred to as a [[melting pot]], owing to the diverse ethnic groups that make up the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-01-25/features/9001210012_1_marriages-blacks-couples|title=Interracial Marriage|website=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic [[Ethnic minority|minorities]], such as Hispanics or African Americans, are more likely to marry and be attracted to people outside of their race than European Americans, especially in areas where they make up only a small percentage of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-01-25/features/9001210012_1_marriages-blacks-couples|title=Interracial Marriage|website=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of approval of [[interracial marriage]] has been steadily increasing since the 1950s, a 2013 study found 87% of Americans approve of interracial marriage, compared to just 4% in 1958. The same study concluded that 96% of blacks approved, and 84% of whites.

The (c. 40 BCE) '''''Jijiupian''''' 急就篇, which was compiled by [[Han dynasty]] scholar Shi You 史游 ([[floruit|fl.]] 48-33 BCE), was a Chinese [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] and a prototype for [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]]. This [[Chinese character]] [[abecedarium]] 
contains a series of [[orthography|orthographic]] word lists, categorized according to [[Radical (Chinese characters)|character radical]], and briefly explained in rhymed lines. In the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and Han dynasties, several similar othographic primers were in circulation, such as ''[[Cangjiepian]]'', but the ''Jijiupian'' is the only one that survived for two millennia.

==Title==
The ''Jíjiùpiān'' "Quickly Master [Character] Chapters" is also called the ''Jíjiùzhāng'' 急就章 "Quickly Master [Character] Sections" and simply ''Jíjiù'' 急就.

The title ''Jíjiùpiān'' uses the word ''piān'' [[wikt:篇|篇]], which originally meant "[[bamboo strips]] used for writing (before the invention of paper)" and was semantically extended to "sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book". Several other Chinese dictionary titles use ''pian'', for example, the (c. 500? BCE) ''[[Shizhoupian]]'' "Historian Zhou's Chapters", (c. 220 BCE) ''[[Cangjiepian]]'' "[[Cangjie]]'s Chapters", (c. 543) ''[[Yupian]]'' "Jade Chapters", and (1066) ''[[Leipian]]'' "Categorized Chapters".

''Jíjiù'' has several possible interpretations, depending on the meanings of ''jí'' [[wikt:急|急]] "urgent; hurrying; rapid; fast; hasty; distress" and ''jiù'' [[wikt:就|就]] "proceed; advance; accomplish; achieve; accomplish; finish". The ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' collaborators [[Joseph Needham]], [[Lu Gwei-djen]], and Huang Hsing-Tsung (1986: 194) say, "One hardly knows how to render its title, unless 'Handy Primer'." Thomas Lee (2000: 437) translates ''jijiu'' as "quickly getting to". The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 57) say that ''jijiu'' 急就 "instant success" suggested "fast learning", as seen in the first words of the ''Jijiupian'' preface.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Quickly learn the rarely seen drinking vessels and many different things: listing the names of objects, people, and family names; classify them into different sections so that they will not be easily mixed up. Occasional consultation will definitely be a great delight—for it is quick to retrieve, and, if hard effort is put into it, there will surely be surprising rewards. Please follow the guidelines in each chapter. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage is notably the earliest recorded discussion of how to classify characters into different textual sections (Yong and Peng 2008: 144).

While the title is usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''Jijiupian'', ''Chi-chiu-p'ien'', etc., some English translations are:
*''Handy Primer'' (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 562) 
*''Quick Access [to Characters]'' (Theobald 2010)
*''Quick mastery of the characters'' (Wilkinson 2000: 49)
*''The Instant Primer'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 25)
*''Primer for Quickly Learning Chinese Characters'' (Cai 2013: 85)
*''For Urgent Use'' (Cheung and Lin 2014: n.p.)
*''Wood-Prism Bundles for Rapid Attainment'' (Barbieri-Low and Yates 2015: 1102)

==History==
[[File:Jijiupian.png|thumb|1875 edition Jijiupianfuzhu 急就篇補注 with the Yan Shigu and Wang Yilin commentaries, [[Keio Media Centers (Libraries)|Keio University Library]]]]
The first reference to the ''Jijiupian'' and Shi You 史游 is found in the ''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' "Treatise on Literature" bibliographical section of the (111 CE) ''[[Hanshu]]'' "Book of Han", listed among early dictionaries: "In the time of [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (r. 48-33 BCE), the court scholar Shi You composed the ''Jijiupian''" (元帝时黄门令史游作急就篇). This section also uses the ''Jijiu'' title; ''Jijiu yipian'' 急就一篇 "The ''Jijiu'', in one chapter" (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 194).

In the [[Western Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE-25 CE), the teaching of characters was emphasized, and scholars compiled other character glossaries and wordbooks besides the ''Jijiupian'', for instance, the ''Fanjiangpian'' 凡將篇 ''The General Primer'' by [[Sima Xiangru]] and ''Yuanshangpian'' 元尚篇 ''The Yuanshang Primer'' by Li Chang 李長, both of which are [[lost works]]. These proto-dictionaries facilitated the development of Chinese ''xiǎoxué'' 小學 "minor learning; pre-modern 'linguistics'; philology" (which now means "primary school"), and laid the academic foundation for the compilation of wordbooks, vocabularies, and dictionaries (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 25). The Han dynasty experienced the transition of Chinese lexicography from wordlists and glossaries to character dictionaries and word dictionaries. The ''Jijiupian'' generalized the practice of logically classifying characters into different sections, which inspired the "macro-level stylistic format of the Chinese dictionary" (Yong and Peng 2008: 144).

From the Han to the [[Six Dynasties]] (220-589), the most popular character textbook was the ''Jijiupian'' (Wilkinson 2000: 49). During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] (420-589), several other popular textbooks appeared, such as the ''[[Qianziwen]]'' "Thousand Characters Text", ''[[Baijiaxing]]'' "Myriad Family Surnames", and ''[[Sanzijing]]'' "Three-character Classic" (Yong and Peng 2008: 57). By the Tang, the ''Jijiupian'' had been replaced by the ''Qianziwen'' and ''Baijiaxing'', both of which were deliberately written so that few characters they contain occur more than once. They were memorized generation after generation for over 1,000 years. In the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368) and [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912), the most popular primer was the ''Sanzijing'' (Wilkinson 2000: 49). Contemporary Chinese scholarship admires the ''Jijiupian'' because of its high factual content as contrasted with the much more moralistic tendencies of similar later works such as the ''Sanzijing'' (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).

The ''Jijiupian'' was one of several similar wordbooks that circulated widely during the Qin and Han periods, but it alone survived to the present day, owing to several factors. One reason for its preservation was a model version written by the famous Jin dynasty [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese calligrapher]] [[Wang Xizhi]] (303–361), which was copied by generation after generation of literati eager to perfect their calligraphy (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The Yuan dynasty calligrapher [[Zhao Mengfu]] (1254–1322) also produced an orthographic model ''Jijiupian''. Another factor was the textual explanations written by famous authors in later dynasties. The Tang scholar [[Yan Shigu]] wrote a (620) commentary, and the Song scholar Wang Yinglin 王應麟 wrote the (1280) ''Xingshi Jijiupian'' 姓氏急就篇 (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).

Modern archeological excavations have found fragments of the ''Jijiupian'', and even some tablets on which the inscriptions were evidently exercises in copying characters (Loewe 1967 2: 418; Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197).

==Text==
The original ''Jijiupian'' consisted of 32 sections (''zhang'' 章), each with 63 [[Chinese characters]], totaling 2,016. Some later editions of the text add two more sections, each with 64 characters, thus totaling 2,144. The text was designed to include as many different characters as possible, with little repetition, in order to maximize the student's exposure to and learning of new words. The text is described as a sort of [[abecedarium]] (Goodrich 1975: 220, Yates 2011: 358).

The ''Jijiupian'' [[collation]] puts together characters written with the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] or signific, and then divides them into chapters. Within each chapter, the style consisted mainly of 3-, 4-, or 7-syllable rhyming lines, as in [[Chinese poetry]]. Rhyme makes it easy to read, memorize, and recite (Yong and Peng 2008: 57).

China's first "word books" were written to meet the needs of literacy education (Allan 2013: 212). Shi You's ''Jijiupian'' was intended to be used for learning the meanings of basic characters and how they should properly be written. It formed a basis for verbal elaborations by teachers, and could have served as a handy reference manual for scribes and copyists (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The original Han edition ''Jijiupian'' was written in [[clerical script]], but it was later used for learning to write in other calligraphic styles of characters, such as [[regular script]] and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]].

The ''Jijiupian'' has [[historical linguistics|historical linguistic]] value as a record of common words that were current during the Han dynasty. It preserved many technical terms and names of plants, animals, tools, and objects, which are important for the histories of science, medicine, and technology. For instance, the ''Jijiupian'' was the first text to describe the [[trip hammer]] and [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty#Uses of the waterwheel and water clock|waterwheel]].

To illustrate the types of lists that the ''Jijiupian'' contains, and their value for those who wished to write correctly, consider the Section 24 list of [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese herbal medicines]], written in rhymed 7-character lines (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).
&lt;blockquote&gt;灸刺和药逐去邪 By moxa, acupuncture and the compounding of drugs we may drive out the malign (''[[qi]]'' that cause illness). (Of drugs and drug-plants there are:) ''Huángqín'' 黄芩 ''[[Scutellaria lateriflora]]'', ''fúlíng'' 伏苓 ''[[Wolfiporia cocos]]'', ''yù'' 礜 [[arsenolite]], and ''cháihú'' 茈胡 ''[[Bupleurum falcatum]]''. ''Mǔméng'' 牡蒙 ''[[Rubia| Rubia yunnanensis]]'', ''gāncǎo'' 甘草 ''[[Glycyrrhiza glabra]]'', ''wǎn'' 菀 ''[[Aster tataricus]]'', and ''lílú'' 藜蘆 ''[[Veratrum|Veratrum niqrum]]''. ''Wūhuì'' 烏喙 and ''fùzǐ'' 附子 both ''[[Aconitum carmichaelii]]'', ''jiāo'' 椒 , ''[[Zanthoxylum piperitum]]'', and ''yánhuá'' 芫花 ''[[Daphne genkwa]]''. ''Bànxià'' 半夏 ''[[Pinellia ternata]]'', ''zàojiá'' 皂莢 ''[[Gleditsia sinensis]]'', ''ài'' 艾 ''[[Artemisia argyi]]'', and ''tuówú'' 橐吾 ''[[Ligularia sibirica]]''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The rhyme-words (Old Chinese reconstructions from [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter.E2.80.93Sagart .282014.29|Baxter-Sagart 2014]]) are: *''sə.ɢa'' 邪, *''ɡˁa'' 胡, *''rˁa'' 蘆, *''qʷʰˁra'' 花, and *''ŋˁa'' 吾. With the exception of the mineral arsenolite (arsenic oxide), most of these names are written with the "[[Radical 140|plant radical]]" 艸 or 艹, which is commonly used in characters for plants and trees.

The text "impresses readers with its balanced content and ingenuity" (Lee 2000: 437), and some examples are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To buy on credit, to borrow, to sell and to buy, these activities give convenience to merchants and markets….To cut, to mince, to broil and to cook a whole piece of meat, each has its own shape….Rooms, houses, and inns are [for people] to rest and there are also towers, palaces, and halls….Various ranked lords have their fiefs, lands, and household vassals; these [privileges] come from hard studies, but not from [the help of] ghosts or spirits. (tr. Lee 2000: 438) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Jijiupian'' teaches students basic vocabulary for daily life, with occasional moral lessons.

'''John Pesek''' (February 21, 1894 – March 12, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[greyhound racing]] dog breeder.&lt;ref name="Vierk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bchs.us/BTales_199703.html|title=John Pesek - The Wrestler from Ravenna|author1=Vierk, Valerie|author2=Pesek, Mary Lee|author3=Pesek, Geoffrey|publisher=Buffalo County Historical Society|work=Buffalo Tales (volume 20, number 2)|date=1981|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pesek was born to [[Bohemian]] parents near [[Ravenna, Nebraska]], the fifth of seven children, and grew up living the hard life of the American pioneer. His father Martin died in an accident when John was twelve.&lt;ref name="Vierk"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Pesek originally planned a career in [[boxing]] but took to professional wrestling instead, with which he became familiar by attending the [[traveling carnival]]s of the era. His first high-profile match was in 1914 when he defeated [[Wladek Zbyszko]].

Pesek was nicknamed "The Nebraska Tiger Man" for his ferocity and catlike dexterity. He was also legitimately strong and could hold his own on the mat against opponents that frequently outweighed him considerably. Pesek is recorded as losing only about 20 matches in his entire career,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/pesek.asp&lt;/ref&gt; which he began undefeated until January 16, 1920 when he lost to fellow Nebraskan [[Joe Stecher]]. Among the few other men to ever defeat Pesek were [[Jim Londos]] and [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]]. A true [[catch wrestling|"hooker"]] who believed in wrestling as legitimate competitive sport, Pesek disliked the wrestling "trust" that emerged in the 1920s for its booking of pre-determined match outcomes. His reluctance to co-operate with promoters isolated him from the wrestling mainstream for much of his career.

One important wrestling figure with whom Pesek did agree to work was Ed Lewis, for whom he became a "policeman" to ward off the so-called "trustbusters", outlaw wrestlers who posed threats to promotions and their champions by refusing to co-operate (fix matches) during matches. On November 14, 1921, Pesek squared off against one of the most prominent trustbusters, [[Croatia]]n-born wrestler Marin Plestina at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]]. Pesek proceeded to administer such a severe beating (through continual fouling) that Plestina was hospitalized. All three falls of the match were forfeited due to repeated head butting and eye gouging by Pesek. His repeated fouling caused a near riot.  The New York Times credits Plestina with "intensified fairness" in the face of Pesek's continued fouling.  This is the reason Pesek was banned from wrestling for life in New York.  These comments are taken from a New York Times article dated November 15, 1921.  [[New York State Athletic Commission|New York's athletic commission]] refused to award Pesek his prize money and banned him from wrestling in the state, but the Tiger Man had done his job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/mh-02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122058/http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/mh-02.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion, Pesek was hired to give Lewis' ally, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-area promoter [[Paul Bowser]], a hand in his battle with rival promoter [[Jack Curley]]. Curley was aggressively promoting Olympic wrestling medalist [[Nat Pendleton]] and issued a series of haughty challenges, among them boasting that Pendleton could beat Lewis and any other wrestler on the same night. Pesek was enlisted to face Curley's protégé, and in a [[shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimate contest]] held on January 25, 1923, Pesek defeated and injured Pendleton to claim an [[United States dollar|$]]8000 purse and give Bowser a major financial and publicity victory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Movies/2006/03/03/1471510.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesek would memorably cross paths with Joe Stecher again, wrestling him three times in 1926. Stecher, now the world champion, won the first meeting on April 29, and the second match on August 25 ended in a draw. Then, on October 6 at [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]' [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]], subbing for Ed Lewis, Pesek diverted from the planned result and trapped Stecher in a wrist lock. Stecher appeared to submit, but in order to save face the referee disqualified Pesek under the pretense that he had used an illegal choke hold, allowing Stecher to retain the title. Stecher was said to have cried after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/biography.cgi?joestech |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805015502/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/biography.cgi?joestech |archivedate=August 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite making a good living in America, Pesek eventually grew tired of backroom politics and opted to go overseas for a while in 1929. Traveling to [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], he became a sensation there, winning 47 consecutive bouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bchs.kearney.net/BTales_199703.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406232853/http://bchs.kearney.net/BTales_199703.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesek's reputation as a maverick held him back from holding many championships in his career, and he has been characterized as a "trustbuster" in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.org/people/pesek_john.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804010548/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.org/people/pesek_john.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out that none of the titles he did hold were either won or lost in the ring. From 1931 to 1933, he was the recognized [[Midwest Wrestling Association]] (MWA) champion, until he forfeited the title to wrestle for another promotion. Later, Pesek was recognized for a time as [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|National Wrestling Association champion]]. He was belatedly given the vacant NWA championship on September 13, 1937, as he had been the only man to post a $1000 bond for a proposed tournament one year earlier. However, he was soon stripped of the title when he refused to meet two challengers. Pesek was again awarded the vacant MWA championship in 1938, but was stripped of it in June 1940 for, once again, failing to meet the top contenders.

By the end of the 1920s, Pesek had begun turning his focus towards racing greyhounds, and on {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of his Nebraska farm he built up one of the nation's leading stables. He won several national titles, and the pedigree of one of his greatest dogs, Australian-born "Just Andrew", could be found in 95 percent of American greyhound stock by 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greyhound-data.com/d?i=116943&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesek continued to appear occasionally in exhibition matches through the 1950s, long enough to wrestle on the same card as son Jack, who would go on to enjoy a lengthy wrestling career of his own. He wrestled his final match in 1959.&lt;ref name="Vierk"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Pesek married Myrl Mahoney (died 1966) on February 14, 1921. The couple had seven children: Elizabeth, Jack, Virginia, Mary Lee, Kevin, Catherine and Steve. Jack Pesek went on to become a professional wrestler like his father.&lt;ref name="Vierk"/&gt;

Pesek died at his home on March 12, 1978 from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was buried at the Highland Cemetery outside Ravenna.&lt;ref name="Vierk"/&gt; A bronze statue of Pesek with two greyhounds was being created at the time of his death, and it was posthumously unveiled in front of Ravenna Bank on May 28, 1978.

==Legacy==
Although lesser known than some of his contemporaries, John Pesek is recognized today as one of the best wrestlers of his era. He was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2005, as well as the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] in 1996; Pesek had earlier been inducted into the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star|Lincoln Journal]]'''s Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1957. His contributions to the sport of greyhound racing have also been recognized by his induction to the Greyhound National Hall Of Fame in 1978 – his dogs "Gangster" and "Just Andrew" were inducted in 1964 and 1975, respectively.

A '''''{{IAST|jyotiśhāstra}}''''' is a text from a classical body of literature on the topic of [[Hindu astrology]], known as {{IAST|Jyotiṣha}}, dating to the medieval period of [[Classical Sanskrit literature]] (roughly the 3rd to 9th centuries CE)
Only the most important ones exist in scholarly editions or translations, such as the [[Yavanajataka]] (3rd century), [[Brihat Samhitā]] (6th century), [[Brihat Parāśara Horāśāstra]] (7th century) or  [[Sārāvalī]] (8th century), while many remain unedited in Sanskrit or vernacular manuscripts.

Such classical texts should be distinguished from modern works. There are a great number of contemporary publications, reflecting the persisting importance of astrology in [[Hindu culture]], and the corresponding economical attractivity of the market in India.
Notable modern authors include [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] (1855–1936), [[Bangalore Venkata Raman]] (1912–1998), and [[Sanjay Rath]] (b. 1963).

==Classification==
Pingree classifies as ''jyotihshastra'' ([[shastra|treatises]] on [[jyotisha]]) manuscripts on [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian astrology|astrology]] and [[divination]], and estimates that about 10% of surviving Sanskrit manuscripts belong to the category. He cites the [[Brihat Samhita]] (1.9) for a traditional tripartite division of subject matter which, in his view, does not cover the field adequately:&lt;ref name="Pingree p1"&gt;Pingree (1981) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Wallis by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An elderly man with some strands of white hair visible from beneath a close-fitting black cap; he is wearing red and black robes with a red academical hood and broad white bands at his collar|The mathematician [[John Wallis]], Keeper of the Archives from 1658 to 1703.]]

The position of '''Keeper of the Archives''' at the [[University of Oxford]] in England dates from 1634, when it was established by new statutes for the university brought in by [[William Laud]] ([[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the University]]). The first holder of the post was [[Brian Twyne]], who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 as part of the preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] into the Tower of the Five Orders in the [[Bodleian Library]] under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. The archives include [[charter]]s, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges of the university]], which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.

In total, 21 people have held the position. Of [[Philip Bliss (academic)|Philip Bliss]], who was Keeper of the Archives for 31&amp;nbsp;years in the 19th century, it was said that "his penchant for accumulation seems to have impeded administrative efficiency".&lt;ref name=Bliss/&gt; [[Reginald Lane Poole]], who was in office from 1909 to 1927, took a much narrower view on what should be kept, and criticised his predecessors for their "fatal inability&amp;nbsp;... to destroy things when they are done with".&lt;ref name=Poole/&gt; The third to hold the position, [[John Wallis]] (who was also [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]]), prepared an index of the collection that was still used into the 20th century. The present holder, [[Simon Bailey (archivist)|Simon Bailey]], is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives: he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor, [[David Vaisey]], but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000. The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010, and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director.

==History and role==
[[File:Philip Bliss.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man in red academic robes sitting in a chair with a city scene visible through a window|[[Philip Bliss (academic)|Philip Bliss]], Keeper of the Archives from 1826 to 1857.]]
The position of Keeper of the Archives at the [[University of Oxford]] dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it claims to have one of the longest continuous [[Archive|record-keeping]] traditions in Britain.&lt;ref name=Bod&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2010-08-03|title=Oxford University Archives become part of the Bodleian Libraries|publisher=[[Bodleian Library|Bodleian Libraries]], University of Oxford|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records were initially kept in the [[Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford|Priory of St Frideswide]] (the site of the present-day [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), moving to the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until [[Brian Twyne]] attended to them in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; As part of his work as a member of the committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the University]], [[William Laud]]), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work.&lt;ref name=Hegarty/&gt; Under Twyne and [[Gerard Langbaine the elder|Gerard Langbaine]], his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the [[Bodleian Library]]; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Archives|publisher=University of Oxford|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/history.html|accessdate=24 August 2010|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1634 statutes stated that "the careless keeping of the archives of our University, and the gross ignorance of our privileges" had led to "many mischiefs and losses", particularly in the "almost daily contests with the citizens of Oxford" described by it as "ancient rivals" who "catch at every occasion of impugning our privileges".&lt;ref name=Laud/&gt; The statutes provided that "hereafter and for ever, some person shall be sought for", to collect and guard the archives, "that he may produce them without delay whenever occasion requires it".&lt;ref name=Laud/&gt; This person was to assist the senior officers of the university and be "an unembarrassed and ready champion in guarding and defending the University privileges and rights."&lt;ref name=Laud/&gt; Students at the university (unless exempted by poverty) were to pay 1 [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]] towards defence of Oxford's rights, and £40 from this fund was to be paid to the Keeper of the Archives as his salary. Under the 1634 statutes, [[Convocation]] (the main governing body of the university at the time) chose the Keeper of the Archives, and there were sometimes contested elections for the position; under the modern statutes, the position is filled by decision of the Committee for the Archives.&lt;ref name=Laud&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bhABAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=statutes+university+oxford#v=onepage&amp;q=keeper&amp;f=false|pages=194–195|title=Oxford University Statutes, Volume 1|author=University of Oxford|others=trans.

The scope of the archives is defined by a university regulation. It includes [[charter]]s, title deeds, copies of university statutes and regulations, records maintained by the [[Registrar of the University of Oxford|university's Registrar]] and minutes of meetings, as well as any other official material from the university or its departments that is not in current use and whose preservation is "desirable" in the opinion of the Committee for the Archives.&lt;ref name=RegArc/&gt; The university archives do not contain material from the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges of the university]], which hold their material separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/relatedrecs.html|title=Related records|publisher=University of Oxford|year=2010|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest document held, dating from 1214, is a decision of a [[Papal legate]] in a dispute between the town of [[Oxford]] and the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/1214%20document.html|title=Holdings: 1214 document|publisher=University of Oxford|year=2008|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the archives date from the 19th and 20th centuries, and are mainly in paper format, with only a few photographs and no sound or video recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/index.html|title=Holdings|publisher=University of Oxford|year=2008|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010, and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director.&lt;ref name=Bod/&gt; The present holder, [[Simon Bailey (archivist)|Simon Bailey]], works with an Assistant Keeper (a role split between two people each working part-time) and an Archives Assistant.&lt;ref name=Bod/&gt; Bailey is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives: he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor, [[David Vaisey]], but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000.&lt;ref name=Full/&gt; Some of the holders of the position have been appointed to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellowship]] of one of the colleges; unlike some of the professorships at Oxford, it is not linked to a particular college.

==Letter==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, I am writing to you from Finland. My name is Polina Zherebtsova. I am a political refugee from Russia. From contemporary Russia, which for many, many years has been ruled by Mr. Putin.

 All my life I have kept a diary. And it so happened that I was born in the Caucasus, in the city of Grozny.

 When I was nine years old my city was surrounded by a ring of Russian tanks – and houses were turned into ruins and ashes along with their inhabitants. Has your home been shelled by a tank, Mr Khodorkovsky? Mine was. The upper floors of the apartment building were on fire, and children were screaming in unbearable pain: shrapnel tore their bodies.

 My grandfather, a veteran of the Second World War, was in the hospital on Pervomayskaya Street, but was killed in the shelling. He was recovering – my mother and I were going to take him home.

 We could not bury him for a week. There was fighting.

 I know you have been through a lot, have been imprisoned. But tell me – can you imagine how the patients scream when the guns are firing at their hospital or when a jet bomber, invisible and invulnerable to their curses, drops a one-and-a-half ton bomb on them?

 We looked for where the snow was cleaner, gathered it up and strained it through cloth so we would drink it. It was not white snow, not at all like the snow I can see just now in Finland. It was dark gray and bitter, because there were burning buildings all around. An oil plant was on fire, and whole neighborhoods of homes were burning. Before they reached living human flesh, the bombs tore up stone and  concrete.

 And the houses were full of people, and they had nowhere to run to.

 We fell from hunger, lying about in the corners of apartments, half submerged in basements. And the rats huddled against the cold at our feet and squeaked.

 The rats slept with me in the hallway on the icy wooden floor, and I didn't chase them away, realizing that even they were suffering from "Russian democracy" Our cats died, unable to withstand the diet of pickled tomatoes we fed them once every few days.

 To get at least some food, you had to walk about in other people's basements, where the conquerors had left thin silver threads, and if you stepped on one of those threads you would go straight to heaven.

 And do you want to hear how I stood near the concrete slabs under which for three days in the centre of Grozny, choking in the wreckage and cement dust, Russian old folk died?

 No one was able to raise the slabs and remove the debris! People wept and prayed, but could not do anything. Those who died under the ruins of their houses did not get a grave in "the land we won." This hell was repeated many times in ten years: as long as the war lasted in the Caucasus, in the Chechen Republic.

 In August 1996 rockets from a Russian military post flew into the staircase of our apartment building: our neighbours were blown to pieces. I was eleven years old at the time.

 I came out into the front entrance of our building and my feet  sank ankle-deep in blood. Blood dripped from the walls and ceiling, and I could hear the surviving neighbours screaming in terrible agony. Since then, Mr Khodorkovsky, I do not believe Russia's rulers. I do not think that this is the price of conquering the land and preserving its integrity. This was done by "weaklings" – because a strong man will not assert himself at the expense of the lives of women and children.

 Essentially they are traitors of their own people.

 In 1999, when the "humanitarian corridors" of refugees were shelled, burning people alive in buses, we could not get out of the city. And on October 21, 1999  Grozny market was hit by a rocket.  In the afternoon, when thousands of people were crowded there.

 It was later announced that this was a "market of terrorists" with whom the invaders were fighting.

 "Terrorists" was the name they gave to the children, the old folk and women who traded vegetables, sweets, bread, cigarettes, newspapers, etc.  And the market was called the "arms market," but I never saw weapons there, although sometimes I would spend a whole day going round all the stalls with a box of stuff.

 During the holidays or after school I could not rest – I had to work in order to survive.

 I traded in that market place. There were no pensions, no salaries. People did their best to survive. For a year my mother received no salary. It was stolen. And we traded in order to survive and buy bread.

 They did not have to start "conquering us", turning our lives into one continuous strip of hell. Our lives were already hard enough without bombs and "Grad" installations. When the rocket hit Grozny market I was three blocks away from the place where it landed. I saw fire from the ground to the sky, and then I heard a deafening explosion.

 In my legs there were sixteen fragments of shrapnel.

 And what happened to the people who were closer to the rocket? Severed arms, legs, heads, bodies turned to dust.

 The children found their mother by her hairpins or the buttons on her jacket...

 Did anyone get an apology? Or compensation for this hell? Did anyone?

 I got nothing except threats and being told to "shut your mouth", as I was a true witness to these bloody events. Here is the face of the modern Russian government.

 Killing, slandering and grabbing. And this is called "conquest"?

 In 2000, On January 19, the surviving neighbours and my mother and I were threatened with execution by firing squad.

 We were on the edge of a cliff and the soldiers fired over our heads.

 Our old granny neighbour fell to her knees, crying:

 "What are you doing? We're your people! We're  Russians! Don't shoot!"

 The Caucasus is a peculiar region. In it, cultures and ethnicities, ways of life and cuisines, have been interwoven.

 Of the forty-eight apartments in our building ten were Chechen and the rest – Russian, Armenian, Gypsy, Azeri, Ingush, Jewish, Polish...

 We lived together amicably until the war began. The war swept everything away: life, friendship, love. It destroyed everything.

 Surviving in inhuman conditions, people from the Chechen Republic n the other regions of Russia faced and still face the most vile discrimination, persecution and threats.

 The authorities have no time for their stories of mass executions and extrajudicial kilings. All, regardless of ethnicity, are classed as "Chechens."

 I have come up against this, too.

 For about a year I was refused a passport. But you got one in a single day, and were even kindly driven to the gangway of a private jet. Double standards – those are precisely what distinguish despotism from democracy...

 I was very sympathetic to you when you were in prison. I considered the sentences you were given unjust, political. Even now I think that you may have been subjected to pressure. But you in your interview you said: "Putin is no weakling. I am ready to fight in order to keep the North Caucasus as part of our country. This is our land, we conquered and won it!"  Consider: now you will have to share responsibility for those war crimes, which in  the Caucasus are not the costs of "conquest", but its essence.

 Read my diary.

 Read how we were conquered.

 How we buried our murdered neighbours under fire, having first covered the graves with branches so that the hungry dogs would not tear the bodies apart.

 How thousands of women and children were murdered in the Chechen Republic.

 Do you still want integration with such a Russia?

 I do not.

 And I do not need their citizenship. I am embarrassed by it, like the shameful brand-mark on a slave.

[[Polina Zherebtsova]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83478">A '''multimedia franchise''' is a [[media franchise]] for which installments exist in multiple forms of [[Media (communication)|media]], such as [[book]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[films]], [[television series]], and [[video game]]s. Multimedia franchises usually develop due to the popularization of an original creative work, and then its expansion to other media through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}: "For the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products".&lt;/ref&gt; although the trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}:

{{quote|In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, Larry and Andy Wachowski, creators of ''The Matrix'' trilogy, produced the game ''Enter the Matrix'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie s actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''The Matrix: Reloaded''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, Lucasfilm jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy with ''Star Wars: Battlefront'', a combat game in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''King Kong'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by Michael Ancel and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars'' films (1999–2005); all five  ''Harry Potter'' films (2001–2008); all three ''Spider-Man'' films (2002–2007); ''Hulk'' (2002); ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (2002); ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (2003); ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' (2005); ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' (2006); ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' (2007); and ''Transformers'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to qualify for this list, a franchise must have works in at least '''three''' forms of media, and must have two or more separate works in at least '''two''' of those forms of media (a television series or comic book series is considered a single work for purposes of this list; multiple spin-off series or [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] of a previously ended series are considered multiple works). For example, a television series that spawned one film and one novelization would not qualify; a television series that had a spin-off series, or was remade as a new series, and which spawned two films and one novelization does qualify. This list does not include [[List of public domain works with multimedia adaptations|public domain works from which adaptations have been made in multiple media]], but which do not involve licensing or other means by which an author or owner controls the franchise. A franchise may be included if it obtained multimedia franchise status prior to works within the collection entering the public domain.

Note: In the following table, the initial media through which the franchise characters or settings became known is shown in boldface. Only works of fiction are only considered part of the series; a book or a documentary film ''about'' the franchise is not itself an installment in the franchise.

==Franchises originating in literary works==
These franchises began as novels, short stories, and other forms of purely literary works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">The '''Name Service Switch''' ('''NSS''') is a facility in [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s that provides a variety of sources for common configuration databases and name resolution mechanisms. These sources include local operating system files (such as &lt;tt&gt;[[/etc/passwd]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[[/etc/hosts]]&lt;/tt&gt;), the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), the [[Network Information Service]] (NIS), and [[LDAP]].

=={{visible anchor|nsswitch.conf}}==
A [[system administrator]] usually configures the operating system's name services using the file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/tt&gt;. This lists databases (such as [[/etc/passwd|passwd]], [[Shadow password|shadow]] and [[Group (database)|group]]) and one or more sources for obtaining that information. Examples for sources are ''files'' for local files,  ''ldap'' for the [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]], ''nis'' for the [[Network Information Service]], ''nisplus'' for [[Nisplus|NIS+]], and ''wins'' for [[Windows Internet Name Service]].

The nsswitch.conf file has line entries for each service consisting of a database name in the first field, terminated by a colon, and a list of possible source databases mechanisms in the second field.
A typical file might look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
passwd:     files ldap
shadow:     files
group:      files ldap

hosts:      dns nis files

ethers:     files nis
netmasks:   files nis
networks:   files nis
protocols:  files nis
rpc:        files nis
services:   files nis

automount:  files
aliases:    files
&lt;/pre&gt;

The order of the services listed determines in which order NSS will attempt to use those services to resolve queries on the specified database.

==History==
Earlier [[Unix-like]] systems, with the notable exception of [[Ultrix]], either accessed only the configuration files or had hard-coded rules for files or databases to access; Ultrix offered nearly identical functionality to the Name Service Switch, using the configuration file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/svc.conf&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[Sun Microsystems]] first developed NSS for their [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] operating system, but subsequently programmers ported it to many other operating systems including [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[Linux]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]] and [[AIX operating system|AIX]].

[[File:The Pabst Plan Warsaw 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the plan.]]
The '''Pabst Plan''' ({{lang-de|Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau}}, "New German city of Warsaw") was a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[urban planning|urban plan]] to reconstruct the city of [[Warsaw]] as a [[Nazi architecture|Nazi model city]]. Named after its creator Friedrich Pabst,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Friedrich Pabst]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Nazis' "Chief Architect for Warsaw", the plan assumed that Warsaw, the historical capital of [[Poland]] and a city of 1.5 million inhabitants, would be completely destroyed and rebuilt as a small German town of not more than 130,000 inhabitants. 

In modern historical works the term is used to denote any of the German [[World War II]] plans concerning the destruction and reconstruction of Warsaw. In particular the "Pabst Plan" refers to a plan prepared by Hubert Gross and Otto Nurnberger in 1940 and another plan, prepared by Pabst himself in 1942. Both plans envisioned the destruction of most of Warsaw with its historical monuments and residential areas. In its place a new model city was to be created as a seat for the German ruling class of the [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|occupied Polish territories]]. It was to house a large ''Parteivolkshalle'' ("People's Party Hall") in place of the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]] and serve as a major transportation hub.

After the [[Warsaw Uprising (1944)|1944 Warsaw Uprising]], the Germans decided to [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|destroy the city in its entirety]].

==History==

===Pre-war planning===
The destruction of the city was already planned long before [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|its almost total destruction in 1944]], even prior to the start of [[World War II]]. On 20 June 1939, while [[Adolf Hitler]] was visiting an architectural bureau in [[Würzburg]], his attention was captured by a project to create a future "German" town – Warsaw ({{lang-de|Warschau}}, {{lang-pl|Warszawa}}),{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} which later became known as the Pabst Plan. Friedrich Pabst prepared a technical plan for the annihilation of Warsaw and the complete ethnic cleansing of its native Polish population, with Polish Jews condemned to be the first destined for extermination. It envisaged the transformation of the Polish capital into a new, provincial German town, containing an exclusively [[Germans|ethnic German]] population of no more than 130,000 people on the left bank supported by a slave labour camp of 80,000 Poles on the right bank of the Vistula. Warsaw’s total population in 1935 was around 1.3 million, consisting of [[Poles]], [[Jews]] and other minorities, which meant that putting the new urbanization plan to work would require the complete removal of its entire population. The project included 15 separate plans and photos, and solid pre-build documentation. Among all the pages of the project the most important is a colored plan of the future town which was created by German architects in 1:20 000 scale titled: ''Die neue deutsche Stadt Warschau'' (Warsaw, the New German City). The final table bore the caption ''Der Abbau der Polenstadt und der Aufbau der Deutschen Stadt'' (The Destruction of the Polish City and the Construction of the German City).

Some parts of the project that were showing Warsaw’s urban development from the half of 17th century until the year 1935 were based on Polish documentation from 1935 and presumably on scientific sources prepared for ''Warsaw’s Territorial Development of Communication and Transportation'' by Prof. O. Sosnowski. All these sources were skillfully extracted long before the war. At an early stage, thanks to German deception based on the false pretense of doing scientific research, the German planners concealed the hidden agenda necessary for creating such a plan. German scholars, historians, conservators and professors of architecture and other experts were enlisted to catalogue all of the most important and culturally significant landmarks of the city, the most exquisite churches and public buildings, key library collections, artworks and sculptures.

The "German Varsavia" was planned to be a  built on the crossroad of German [[Autobahn|highways]] and [[Breitspurbahn|railroad networks]]. It covered a 6&amp;nbsp;km² built-up area plus 1&amp;nbsp;km² of the centuries-old Warsaw’s Prague district, for a combined 7&amp;nbsp;km² area, with parks and green areas bringing to a total of 15&amp;nbsp;km². The 7&amp;nbsp;km² of buildings was just 1/20 of the existing Polish capital city and was very different from the actual existing road network of 1939. The whole town center was to be built into a net of narrow, picturesque streets, resembling the planning of a typical German town. The modern and wide Polish capital avenues (like Ulica Marszałkowska, Twarda, Mokotowska, Dzika, Oś Saska, Oś Stanisławowska) would have been erased forever with all their monumental and beautiful buildings and palaces. Only the remains of the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town district]] (without the [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Polish King’s Castle]]), the [[Łazienki Palace|King’s Baths Palace]] ({{lang-pl|Łazienki Królewskie}}) and [[Belweder|Belvedere]] ({{lang-pl|Belweder}}), and modified parts of the Vistula riverside buildings would have been saved.

===Wartime implementation of the plan===

After the start of military operations and the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|fall of the capital]] into German hands the project was updated, incorporating the city's partial destruction in the September offensive of 1939. The project was soon to be included as a part of the overall [[Germanization]] plan of the East, the genocidal [[Generalplan Ost]]. 

On October 8, 1939 [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|western areas of Poland were annexed]] by the Third Reich, and on October 12, 1939 the central areas of Poland were incorporated into the [[General Government]] by Hitler’s decrees. The capital of the Gubernia was placed in [[Kraków]] (Krakau, Cracow) for security reasons. The occupying German elite was afraid of unsubdued Warsaw.

The plan was to be implemented in several stages. One of the parts for the plan, the "Demolition of the Polish City and the Construction of the German City" (''Abbau der Polen-Stadt und der Aufbau der Deutschen Stadt'') included a list of the Polish capital’s centers of life destined for destruction, put in chronological order based on planned liquidation date. The planners also decided to use the destruction caused by bombings and fires during the September 1939 seizure of the city as a pretext for the urbanistic changes. Another part of the plan included a detailed map of the anticipated destruction showing almost all buildings destroyed coincidentally according to the original plan. In reality only 10 percent of the buildings were destroyed in 1939, with total civilian and military losses of around 12,000 killed and 66,000 wounded.

In the "Small Plan" (''Kleine Planung''), the population of Warsaw was to be limited to 500,000 people. The first group affected by this measure was Warsaw's Jewish population, which the German planners assumed would be removed (''Judenaussiedlung'') from an area of around 482 hm² and forcibly relocated to a "[[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]]" (''Judenviertel'') which was 3.5 times smaller, i.e. 143 hm² surrounded by walls and watchtowers. In 1940, the Nazis turned the northern part of mid-town Warsaw (Wola and Muranow) into a Jewish ghetto. The [[Warsaw Ghetto|Jewish Ghetto]] was planned to accommodate around 30,000 of the capital's inhabitants that were of Jewish origin; however it eventually held nearly 400,000 people living in deplorable conditions. The next step for decreasing the original population of the city was the systematic displacement of people captured and destined for either [[slave labor]] in the Third Reich or extermination in [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[labor camp]]s. As early as 1940 all inhabitants of Warsaw were subject to round-ups (łapanki) and mass shootings in the streets. Nearly 250,000 civilians were eventually murdered this way. Memorial plaques can be seen throughout Warsaw today commemorating this indiscriminate program of ethnic cleansing men, women and children. Those who did not manage to escape were sent to death camps at [[Auschwitz]] or [[Majdanek]] or forced into labour in Germany. Among the 2,857,500 Poles [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|working as slave labor in the Third Reich during World War II]], a significant percentage was composed of Warsaw and [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Warsaw province]] inhabitants.

On 6 February 1940 the German mayor of the city presented an unusual gift to [[Hans Frank]], the Governor-General of the Occupied Polish Territories. The gift was a full documentation of the new German town Warsaw (''Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau''), the so-called Pabst Plan, prepared by German architects Hubert Gross and Otto Nurnberger.

On October 9, 1942 [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered the creation of the [[Warsaw concentration camp]] (''Konzentrationslager Warschau - KL Warschau'') which consisted of the Koło district camp (''Kriegsgefangenenlager Warschau'', 1939) and two other camps in the proximity of Dworzec Zachodni (Western Train Station, 1942): the Gęsia camp (Gęsia Street Camp, 1943) and the Bonifraterska camp (Bonifraterska Street Camp, 1943). KL Warschau was functioning until August 28, 1944 when the German government of the city ordered the [[Death march|evacuation of its prisoners]] into the Third Reich, out of fear that the ongoing [[Warsaw Uprising (1944)|Warsaw Uprising]] might result in freeing them. The prisoners were transported to concentration camps in Third Reich: [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Landsberg am Lech#Landsberg Concentration Camp and displaced person camp|Landsberg]], [[Mühldorf subcamp|Mühldorf]], [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]], [[Gross-Rosen]] and [[Ravensbrück]].

'''Posek''' ({{lang-he-n|פוסק}} {{IPA-he|poˈsek|}}, pl. '''Poskim''', {{Hebrew|פוסקים}} {{IPA-he|pos'kim|}}) is the term in  [[Halakha|Jewish law]] for a "decisor" — a legal scholar who determines the position of ''[[Halakha]]'' in cases of law where previous authorities are inconclusive, or in those situations where no clear ''halakhic'' precedent exists.

The decision of a posek is known as a '''''psak din''''' or '''''psak halakha''''' ("ruling of law"; pl. ''piskei din'', ''piskei halakha'') or simply a "psak". In Hebrew, פסק is the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] implying to "stop" or "cease"—the posek brings the process of legal debate to finality. ''Piskei din'' are generally recorded in the [[responsa]] literature.

== Formulating a ruling (psak din) ==
In formulating a ruling, a posek will base the ''psak din'' on a careful analysis of the relevant [[Legal doctrine|underlying legal principles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kosher Get: A Halakhic Story of Divorce |quote=trained in halakhic psak ...  proper subject of analysis ... embody the individual posek's .. |url=http://www.academia.edu/31883079/The_Kosher_Get_A_Halakhic_Story_of_Divorce}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a careful study of the application of these principles. A Posek must therefore be thoroughly versed in [[rabbinic literature]], from the [[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|Babylonian Talmud]], through the major medieval codifications of the Law and up to recent decisors.

The process of analysis usually entails today:
# an initial study of the relevant [[Talmud]]ic ''[[Gemara#The Sugya|Sugyas]]'' with [[Talmud#Commentaries|commentaries]];
# tracing the development of all related material in the ''[[Rishonim]]'' (Medieval rabbinic authorities prior to the ''[[Shulkhan Aruch]])'' through the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'';
# and finally, a close analysis of the works of the ''[[Acharonim]]'' (rabbinic authorities from about the 16th century onwards) discussing the halakha as recorded in the literature of the ''Rishonim'' (and earlier ''Acharonim'').

The ruling itself is an attempt to apply the precedents and principles of the [[Tradition]] to the question being asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol V, Introduction
|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Contemporary_Halakhic_Problems%2C_Vol_V%2C_Introduction |quote=The decisor .. understanding .. underlying principles and postulates of Halakhah}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common goal of poskim in this regard is, as far as possible, to be [[consistent]] with the [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|codified law]], as well as with the maximal relevant [[legal precedent]]s, generally being decisions recorded in the [[responsa]] literature.

== The role of the Posek ==

=== Orthodox Judaism ===
Poskim play an integral role in [[Orthodox Judaism]] in general and [[Haredi Judaism]] in particular. 
* In the Haredi world, each community will regard one of its ''poskim'' as its ''Posek HaDor'' ("Posek of the present Generation").
* [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] rely on the Rov in their community (sometimes but not always [[Rebbe]]s also get the position as Rov) or leading posek recommended by their [[Rebbe]]. Yet there are some Jews who are Hasidic but are not part of a specific movement. These hassidim will vary in who they follow sometimes following generic hassid-style poskim like [[Shmuel Wosner|Rav Shmuel Wosner]]. 
* [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] Jews may select a posek on a more individual rather than a communal basis, although customs vary.
The approach taken here will, generally, be as above. Thus ''poskim'' will not overrule a specific law, unless based on an earlier authority: a posek will generally extend a law to new situations, but will not ''change'' the Halakhah; see [[Orthodox Judaism#Beliefs about Jewish law and tradition|further]] under [[Orthodox Judaism]].

In 2014 the first ever book of [[halacha|halachic]] decisions written by women who were ordained to serve as poskim (Idit Bartov and Anat Novoselsky) was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpupdates.com/2014/06/26/first-halacha-sefer-women-makes-waves-israel-orthodox-world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325221418/http://jpupdates.com/2014/06/26/first-halacha-sefer-women-makes-waves-israel-orthodox-world/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were ordained by the municipal chief rabbi of Efrat, Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]], after completing [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] women’s college’s five-year ordination course in advanced studies in Jewish law, as well as passing examinations equivalent to the rabbinate’s requirement for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpupdates.com/2014/06/26/first-halacha-sefer-women-makes-waves-israel-orthodox-world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325221418/http://jpupdates.com/2014/06/26/first-halacha-sefer-women-makes-waves-israel-orthodox-world/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservative Judaism ===
[[Conservative Judaism]] approaches the idea of ''Posek'', and Halakha in general, somewhat differently, and Poskim here apply a relatively lower weighting to precedent, and will thus frequently re-interpret (or even change) a law through a formal argument; see [[Conservative Halakha]]. Although there are some "''poskim''" in the Conservative movement - e.g. Rabbis [[Louis Ginzberg]], [[David Golinkin]], [[Joel Roth]], and [[Elliot N. Dorff|Elliot Dorff]] - the rulings of any one individual rabbi are considered less authoritative than a consensus ruling. Thus, the Conservative movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]] maintains a [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], whose decisions are accepted as authoritative within the American Conservative movement. At the same time, every Conservative rabbi has the right as ''[[mara d'atra]]'' to interpret Jewish law for his own community, regardless of the responsa of the Law Committee.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109044437/http://uscj.org/Revised_Standards_fo7505.html]

=== Progressive Judaism ===
Both [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] do not regard the halakha as binding.

Although Reform stresses the individual autonomy of its membership, it never completely abandoned the field of Responsa literature, if only to counter its rivals' demands. Even Classical Reformers such as Rabbi [[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]] composed some. Rabbi [[Solomon Freehof]], and his successor Rabbi [[Walter Jacob]], attempted to create a concept of "Progressive Halacha", authoring numerous responsa based on a methodology laying great emphasis on current sensibilities and ethical ideals. Full text collections of Reform responsa are available on the website of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Jacob, ''Liberal Judaism and Halakhah'', Rodef Shalom Press, 1988. pp. 90-94.; Michael A. Meyer, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23536120 Changing Attitudes of Liberal Judaism toward Halakhah and Minhag]'', Proceedings of the World Congress of Jewish Studies, 1993. See a collection of [http://ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/reform-responsa/ CCAR Responsa].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Reconstructionist position is that if Jews would have formed cohesive communities again, their rulings would be binding, yet presently Judaism is in a "post-Halakhic state". Therefore, their basic policy is to allow tradition "a vote, not a veto" in communal and personal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sacks, ''Crisis and Covenant: Jewish Thought After the Holocaust'', Manchester University Press, 1992. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proclamation No. 216''' is the 2017 [[Ordinance Power of the President of the Philippines#Proclamations|proclamation]] of [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] and suspension of the [[habeas corpus|privilege of the writ of habeas corpus]] in the whole of [[Mindanao]], issued by [[Philippine President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on May 23, 2017.

==History==
[[File:Martial law in Mindanao 2017 doc.jpg|thumb|Proclamation No. 216]]

{{see also|Battle of Marawi}}
===Declaration===
At 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[UTC+08:00]]) on May 23, 2017, amid a [[Maute Group]]-related escalation of conflicts in [[Mindanao]] as well as [[Battle of Marawi|recent clashes]] in [[Marawi]] between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Islamist group, [[Philippine President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] placed the whole of Mindanao, including [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]], under [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/duterte-declares-martial-law-in-mindanao|title=Duterte declares Martial Law in Mindanao|last=|first=|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=May 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation was announced during a press briefing held in [[Moscow]], where Duterte was on [[List of international presidential trips made by Rodrigo Duterte#Russia (May 22–24)|an official visit]]; the state of martial law will be in effect for 60 days. [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Spokesperson|Presidential Spokesperson]] [[Ernesto Abella]] said the declaration was possible given the "existence of rebellion," while [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Foreign Secretary]] [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] explained that the step was taken with "the safety, the lives and property of people of Mindanao" in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/170745-philippines-duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|work=Rappler|access-date=May 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation is to be pursuant to the [[1987 Constitution]], which provides for a maximum 60 day-state of martial law without [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] approval for extension, the continuation of government functions, and the safeguard of individual freedoms. However, Duterte insisted that it will not be any different from [[Proclamation No. 1081|martial law]] under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/170759-duterte-martial-law-no-different-marcos|title=Duterte says his martial law to be similar to Marcos time|work=Rappler|access-date=May 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the declaration does not currently affect citizens and government units in [[Luzon]] or the [[Visayas]], Duterte suggested that he might extend the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to Visayas&lt;ref name="cnnsuspendwrit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacungan|first1=VJ|title=Duterte suspends privilege of writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/24/president-duterte-suspend-privilege-writ-of-habeas-corpus-mindanao.html|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and martial law to the entire country if needed to "protect the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40024120|title=Philippine President Duterte eyes nationwide martial law|date=May 24, 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=May 24, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress approved of a resolution supporting the measure on May 31, 2017&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Avendaño|first1=Christine|last2=Yap|first2=DJ|title=Martial law gets Congress OK|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/901512/martial-law-gets-congress-ok|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First extension===
On July 23, 2017, lawmakers voted 261–18 (with no abstention among those present) in favor of the President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s request to give extension to Proclamation Order No. 216 during a special joint session of the [[17th Congress of the Philippines|House of Representatives and the Senate]]. This extension was valid until December 31, 2017.&lt;ref name="CNN_mLaw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Eimor|last2=Garcia|first2=Pia|title=Congress grants Duterte's request to extend martial law in Mindanao until end of year|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/07/22/Congress-votes-martial-law-extension-Duterte.html|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=''CNN Philippines''|date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yap|first1=DJ|last2=Uy|first2=Jocelyn|last3=Salaverria|first3=Leila|title=Congress votes to extend martial law|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/916245/congress-votes-to-extend-martial-law|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=''Philippine Daily Inquirer''|date=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Congress extends martial law to December 31|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/176345-congress-extend-martial-law-december|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=''Rappler''|date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority number required for the approval of martial law is at 158 of the 314 members of Congress.&lt;ref name="CNN_mLaw" /&gt;

Under the Constitution, the President can declare martial law for an initial period of 60 days and ask for its extension in case of rebellion, invasion or when public safety requires it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/update-2-congress-votes-extend-martial-law-mindanao-dec-31-2017/339879/|title=UPDATE 2: Congress votes to extend  martial law in Mindanao until Dec. 31, 2017 - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Congress Extends Martial Law in Mindanao Until End of 2017 - Sunstar Daily Online|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/07/22/congress-extends-martial-law-mindanao-until-end-2017-554325|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2017, a special joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate was held in order to respond to President Rodrigo Duterte's request to extend the declaration of martial law in Mindanao until December 31, 2018. In his letter addressed to the Congress, President Duterte cited the remaining threats of ISIS-inspired terrorist groups. Congress voted 240–27 (14–4 from the Senate, 226–23 from the House) in favor of the second extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viray|first1=Patricia Lourdes|title=Congress approves one-year martial law extension in Mindanao|url=http://beta.philstar.com/headlines/2017/12/13/1768028/congress-approves-one-year-martial-law-extension-mindanao|accessdate=January 8, 2018|work=The Philippine Star|date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
President Duterte's declaration of martial law in the entire Mindanao region was met with polarized views from the citizens with some reports indicating mixed reactions. However, actual surveys on the ground indicate that majority of Filipinos are in favor of its imposition.&lt;ref name="rappler3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/170749-martial-law-mindanao-netizens-reactions |title=Netizens terrified or trusting of martial law in Mindanao |publisher=Rappler.com |date=May 14, 2017 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/632794/majority-of-filipinos-still-favor-extended-mindanao-martial-law-sws-survey/story/ |title=Majority of Filipinos still favor extended Mindanao martial law —SWS survey |publisher=GMA News Online|date=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public figures===
Some lawmakers from Mindanao expressed their views on the president's declaration of martial law.  Mindanao lawmakers led by [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] [[Pantaleon Alvarez]] said Wednesday, May 24 that the declaration of martial law in Mindanao is justifiable, given the other security problems faced by the region. [[Surigao del Sur]] 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel shared the same sentiment. He said martial law will help address his province’s longstanding "insurgency problem". [[Davao City]] 1st District Representative Karlo Nograles, who called the crisis in Marawi as a “clear case of rebellion," said martial rule will help confine the fighting. Alvarez and Nograles also noted that the 1987 Constitution has safeguards against abuse in relation to martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mara Cepeda |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/170792-alvarez-mindanao-lawmakers-justify-martial-law |title=Alvarez, Mindanao lawmakers justify martial law declaration |publisher=[[Rappler]] |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Manny Pacquiao]] said “I fully support the declaration of martial law in Mindanao by President Rodrigo Duterte. I believe this is timely and necessary in the light of political turmoil perpetrated by the Moro extremists in Marawi City.” Senators [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] and [[Bam Aquino]], on the other hand, questioned President Duterte's declaration of a martial law in Mindanao. According to former President [[Fidel Ramos]], "the martial law that will happen could be more harmful" (compared to [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s time).&lt;ref name="youtubeRamos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUszP7nOb5w|title=Ramos fears 'more harmful' martial law under Duterte|date=May 26, 2017|publisher=[[Rappler]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2017, the majority bloc of the Senate adopted a resolution expressing support for President Duterte's declaration of martial law in Mindanao, saying that the proclamation is required for public safety while at the same time clarifying the operation of the 1987 Constitution. The resolution passed the Senate in a 17–5 vote. The opponents of the resolution, all minority bloc senators, filed another resolution calling for a [[Joint session#Philippines|joint session of Congress]] to decide on the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Avendaño|first1=Christine|title=17 senators express support for Duterte’s martial law|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/901100/17-senators-express-support-for-dutertes-martial-law|accessdate=May 30, 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their resolution failed the Senate in a 12–9 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lardizabal|first1=Cecille|title=Senate backs martial law, junks call to convene joint session|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/30/Senate-junks-joint-session-martial-law.html|accessdate=May 30, 2017|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church===
Catholic bishops in Mindanao believe that President Duterte's declaration of martial law in the region should only be temporary. Cardinal [[Orlando Quevedo]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cotabato|Archbishop of Cotabato]], said that the Church is aware of the declaration's necessity to solve issues of peace and order and that the Church does not have "solid and sufficient" facts to protest the declaration as "morally reprehensible". He urged the Mindanaoan people to remain calm but vigilant as to ensure that the implementation of martial law would not be abused. Quevado added that the Church is prepared to fully condemn the declaration of martial law "if it goes in the way of evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valente|first1=Catherine|title=Mindanao bishops ‘not against’ martial law|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/mindanao-bishops-not-martial-law/329635/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|work=[[The Manila Times]]|date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aurelio|first1=Julie|title=Bishops neutral on martial law, but…|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900236/bishops-neutral-on-martial-law-but|accessdate=June 1, 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ozamiz|Ozamiz Archbishop]] Martin Jumoad supports the declaration of martial law, but believes that there should be a "mechanism" to ensure that the implementation would not violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosauro|first1=Ryan|title=Mindanao bishops throw support behind Martial Law|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cagayan-de-oro/local-news/2017/05/28/mindanao-bishops-throw-support-behind-martial-law-544316|accessdate=June 1, 2017|work=[[Sun.Star]]|date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of lawyers from the Philippine Muslim Society is planning to oppose before the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] the president's declaration of martial law in Mindanao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/24/Martial-law-Philippines-Duterte.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Muslim lawyers to challenge martial law declaration before Supreme Court|publisher=|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business sector===
Philippine financial markets weakened in early trading on March 24, 2017 as the [[PSE Composite Index|Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index]] (PSEi) was down 0.42 percent to 7,779.73, before rallying to close at 7,837.82, up by 0.33 percent or 25.68 points, which a trader attributed to investors remaining positive on the domestic market despite the developments in Mindanao.&lt;ref name="interaksyon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/psei-up-peso-weakens-after-martial-law-declaration-in-mindanao/ |title=PSEi up, Peso weakens after martial law declaration in Mindanao |publisher=[[Interaksyon]] |author=Villanueva, J.S. |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abs-cbn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/05/24/17/marawi-fighting-stirs-uncertainty-in-financial-markets |title=Marawi fighting stirs uncertainty in financial markets &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News |publisher=News.abs-cbn.com |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors are monitoring closely how Duterte will use martial law to fight the long-running extremist problem in the south, analysts said. [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI Securities]] research head Haj Narvaez told Cathy Yang on [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]]'s ''Market Edge'' that the incident caused uncertainties which made investors to be more conservative in their decisions. Narvaez projects "some downward pressure" probably in the next 1 to 2 weeks and says that investors will assess if the situation in Mindanao can be controlled. Tycoon and philanthropist [[Washington SyCip]] said the President cutting short a foreign visit due to security worries was "not the publicity that we need. I think worldwide, the word martial law is not the best thing."&lt;ref name="abs-cbn1"/&gt;

Amidst fighting in Marawi and fears of martial law, numerous overseas tourists have cancelled hotel and resort bookings in the Visayas region.&lt;ref name="touristsCancelBookings"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lato|first1=Cris Evert|title=Tourists cancel bookings in PH|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900412/tourists-cancel-bookings-in-ph|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions by the government==
===Armed Forces of the Philippines directive===
The [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]] issued a guidance to the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and its attached bureaus regarding the proper implementation of martial law in [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/899475/dnd-issues-martial-law-memo-to-troops-in-mindanao |title=DND issues ‘martial law memo’ to troops in Mindanao |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Mangosing, F. |date=May 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum states:

{{quotation|Please be guided that the declaration of Martial Law in the island of Mindanao does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplement the functioning of the Philippine judicial and legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilian where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;}}

===Government roundups in Davao City===
On May 25, 2017, after authorities received information on the presence of unidentified and suspicious-looking persons, around 250 individuals have been rounded up in the barangays of Bucana and Mini-Forest in [[Davao City]] as "persons of interest" for not being able to present proof of identification. According to Davao City Police Office Senior Supt. Alexander Tagum, they were at DPCO headquarters to undergo "a verification process" and were not under arrest. He said their operation is part of their efforts to prevent the entry of terrorists in one of Mindanao's biggest cities.&lt;ref name="cnnphilauthoritiesroundup"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tesiorna|first1=Ben|title=Authorities round up 250 persons of interest in Davao|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2017/05/25/authorities-250-persons-of-interest-davao.html|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship and suppression in Mindanao===
On Friday, May 26, 2017, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] stated that it would censor [[News media|the press]] and [[social media]] to "protect national security" across Mindanao, and warned that violators would be arrested.&lt;ref name="yahoocensorship"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippine-military-flags-martial-law-censorship-005831854.html|title=Philippine military flags martial law censorship|date=May 26, 2017|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla, "We'll exercise the right to censure, (sic)" and that it would be based on 3 conditions: to ensure the safety of lives, to ensure operational security and to ensure the safety of men in uniform who are fighting, and for other national security considerations.&lt;ref name="yahoocensorship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gmaafpcensure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/612247/afp-to-censure-media-social-media-over-security-considerations/story/|title=AFP to exercise ‘right to censure’ over security considerations|date=May 26, 2017|publisher=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''Kaya ngayon umaapela kami maaga pa lang na i-exercise 'nyo ang common sense, na 'pag alam ninyo na ito’y nakakasama at hindi nakakatulong, ‘wag 'nyo na ‘ho i-post.

Likewise, the Philippine National Police in Davao region (Police Regional Office 11, or PRO-11) stated that the right to form a public assembly such as protests or rallies against the government would be curtailed with the declaration of Martial Law in Mindanao. PRO-11 said that leaders and organizers of groups that will stage protests or rallies would be arrested if caught making a public nuisance.&lt;ref name="davaopolicearrestprotesters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Alex D.|title=Be warned: Davao police to arrest protesters in line with ML declaration|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/politics/be-warned-davao-police-to-arrest-protesters-in-line-with-ml-declaration/|publisher=Davao Today|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further statements from Duterte===
On the same Friday, Duterte expressed his intention to take responsibility for the actions of soldiers in Mindanao during the implementation of martial law. He assured soldiers that they had his full support and stated: "If you go down, I go down. But for this martial law and the consequences of martial law and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible. ''Trabaho lang kayo. Ako na ang bahala. Ako na ang magpakulong sa inyo'' (Just do your job. I will take care of things. I'll be the one to be imprisoned for you)".

He then joked that soldiers would be free to rape and that he would be the one to go to jail for it. "''Pag naka-rape ka ng tatlo, aminin ko na akin iyon,''" (If you were to rape three, I'll admit that it was mine) according to Duterte.&lt;ref name="dutertesupportsoldiersrape"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macas|first1=Trisha|title=Duterte backs soldiers under martial law, jokes, ‘Maka-rape ka, akin yun’|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/612266/duterte-backs-soldiers-under-martial-law-jokes-maka-rape-ka-akin-yun/story/|publisher=GMA News Online|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rapeheinouscrime"&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Jesus|first1=Julliane Love|title=Duterte told: ‘Rape a heinous crime, never a laughing matter’|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900121/duterte-told-rape-a-heinous-crime-never-a-laughing-matter|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, May 27, 2017, Duterte vowed that he would ignore Congress and the Supreme Court on the duration limits of martial law. He said: "''Hanggang hindi sinabi ng pulis pati Armed Forces na safe na ang Philippines, this martial law will continue. Hindi ako makinig sa iba. 'Yang Supreme Court, 'yang mga congressmen, wala naman sila dito. Bakit, sila ba ang nagpapakamatay? Sila ba ang naghirap dito? Sila ba 'yung – have they suffered the wounds of war? Sila ba 'yung nagtitiis?''" (Until the police and the Armed Forces say the Philippines is already safe, this martial law will continue. I won't listen to others.

==Relation to the CPP-NDF-NPA rebellion==
On May 25, 2017, the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] called on its armed wing, the [[New People's Army]], to "plan and carry out more tactical offensives across Mindanao and the entire archipelago" in response to the Philippine government's declaration of martial law.&lt;ref name="npa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/899587/cpp-orders-npa-to-launch-more-attacks-in-mindanao-other-regions |title=CPP orders NPA to launch more attacks in Mindanao, other regions |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |author=Mangosing, F. |date=May 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party said that the "martial law imposition was made on narrow pretext of armed clashes in Marawi City between the AFP and Maute group," which the party referred to as a bandit group whose leaders, the party claim, "have known links with military officials." The CPP also called on Filipinos to fight the imposition of martial law in Mindanao and demand its immediate lifting.&lt;ref name="npa1"/&gt;

Defense Secretary [[Delfin Lorenzana]] warned the New People's Army not to get involved with the [[Marawi crisis]] as he reiterated that the implementation of martial law in Mindanao will not target local communists.&lt;ref name="npa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/05/28/dont-mess-with-marawi-city-crisis-lorenzana-warns-npa/ |title=Don’t mess with Marawi City crisis, Lorenzana warns NPA |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |author=Wakefield, F. |date=May 28, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenzana said that martial law was declared to address [[radical Islamic terrorism]] and [[narco-terrorism]] in Mindanao according to the directives of the President and that they will fully comply with them. He urged the communists not to force the government's hand and to immediately stop all illegal activities and abide by the true spirit of the peace process.&lt;ref name="npa2"/&gt;

Peace talks between the Government of the Philippines and the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] in the [[Netherlands]] were suspended following these developments.&lt;ref name="npa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/27/17/peace-talks-between-government-communists-suspended-anew |title=Peace talks between government, communists suspended anew |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |author=Buenafe, D. |date=May 27, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time that it was put on hold since the Duterte administration started negotiations with the communist rebels in 2016, with Presidential Peace Adviser [[Jesus Dureza]] saying the administration "will not proceed to participate in the scheduled fifth round of peace negotiations until such time as there are clear indications that an enabling environment conducive to achieving just and sustainable peace in the land shall prevail." Dureza cited the continuing attacks by the NPA and the communist leadership's order for its armed wing to "accelerate and intensify attacks against the government in the face of martial law in Mindanao."&lt;ref name="npa3"/&gt;

==Allegations of human rights violations==
[[Lumad people|Lumads]], or the non-Muslim indigenous peoples of Mindanao, have been vocally against the imposition of martial rule due to the past experience of martial law during the Marcos dictatorship. After 3 months since the imposition of martial rule, numerous human rights violations were recorded by independent human rights organizations{{which|date=December 2017}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Among these violations caused by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police were the bombing of Lumad schools, the food blockade against Lumad communities which forced Lumads to go hungry and move away from their ancestral lands, the capturing of ancestral lands from indigenous Lumads, the killing of suspected Lumads who are reportedly part of the NPA despite no concrete investigation, the censorship of various media outlets in Lumad communities, and the killing of numerous Lumad leaders, which has led to a blow in Lumad morale.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Since the declaration of martial law in Mindanao, there was a heightened presence of government security forces which discouraged Lumad children from going to schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/07/25/Duterte-threatens-to-bomb-Lumad-schools.html&lt;/ref&gt; Linking Lumad schools to communist rebels, President Rodrigo Duterte in a public speech threatened to bomb the schools which he says are promoting "subversion" and communism ideology.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/24/17/duterte-threatens-to-bomb-lumad-schools&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports also surfaced during and after the [[Battle of Marawi]], stating that six soldiers looted stole jewelries and cash from houses in the city. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/31/17/soldiers-under-probe-for-alleged-looting-in-marawi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare''''' (''{{lang|es|Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas}}'') was a manual written by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) for the Nicaraguan [[Contras]], who were involved in a civil war with the Nicaraguan government. It was revealed by the [[Associated Press]] on October 15, 1984. The ninety-page book of instructions focused mainly on how "Armed Propaganda Teams" could build political support in [[Nicaragua]] for the Contra cause through [[deceit]], [[intimidation]], and [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The manual was written in October 1983&lt;ref name="Sklar177"/&gt; by a CIA contract employee who used the alias John Kirkpatrick, who "was a U.S. Army [[counterinsurgency]] specialist, with experience in the [[Vietnam War]]-era [[Phoenix Program]], working under contract to the CIA's International Activities Division." &lt;ref name="Sklar177"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sklar | first=H. | title=Washington's War on Nicaragua | publisher=South End Press | series=Latina/O and Latin American Studies | year=1988 | isbn=978-0-89608-295-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbFXs7_LutMC&amp;pg=PA177 | ref=harv | accessdate=25 April 2017 | page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duane Clarridge]], who oversaw the writing of the manual,&lt;ref name="Sklar177"/&gt; claimed in his 2009 book that John Kirkpatrick was brought in to prepare a course for the Contras on how to interact with the civilian population and outline the [[rule of engagement]], and that he also produced a manual consisting of this curriculum material.{{sfn|Clarridge|Diehl|2009|p=243}} Kirkpatrick based his work off of existing US Army manuals, particularly 1968 Green Beret lesson plans used at the [[John F.

==Publication history==

The manual was written in English, and then translated into Spanish by [[Edgar Chamorro]].{{sfn | Sklar | 1988 | p=182}}{{sfn|LeoGrande|2009|p=364}}{{sfn|Clarridge|Diehl|2009|p=243}} It was printed in ninety pages under the pseudonym Tayacán in late 1983.&lt;ref name="Groggy Dice"&gt;{{cite web |author=Groggy Dice |title=Header text for Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare |date=21 September 2008 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Psychological_Operations_in_Guerrilla_Warfare&amp;oldid=779077 |access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}} Chamorro objected to two portions in the document, namely the sections on hiring professional criminals for special jobs and killing colleagues to create martyrs for the cause. He arranged for these two pages to be physically torn out from 2000 copies. However, 5000 copies were printed, so some commentators have reasoned that some copies were distributed with these sections intact.{{sfn | Sklar | 1988 | p=182}}

==Political reaction==
A [[Reagan administration]] official stated privately that the manual had been written by an "overzealous" independent low-level employee under contract to the CIA.  Further, the manual had not been cleared for publication, was "clearly against the law",&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite journal|date=19 October 1984 |title=U.S. Orders Probe of CIA Terror Manual |journal=Facts on File World News Digest |page=764 A2 |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/60879.html#2c |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531103945/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/60879.html |archivedate=31 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it violated [[Executive Order 12333|Reagan's 1981 Executive Order]] banning political assassinations.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Bovard |first=James |last=Bovard |date=June 9, 2004 |url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0406c.asp |title=Terrorism Debacles in the Reagan Administration |publisher=Future of Freedom Foundation |accessdate=April 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821215232/http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0406c.asp |archivedate=August 21, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 1984, President [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered CIA Director [[William Casey]] to initiate an investigation by the agency's [[Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General|Inspector General]]. Reagan stated that "whoever is guilty [of preparing the manual], we will deal with that situation and they will be removed."&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casey"&gt;{{cite news|first=Neil |last=Roland |date=8 February 1987 |title=Casey spared top officials of discipline for Contra manual |work=United Press International |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/60879.html#2d |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531103945/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/60879.html |archivedate=31 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news conference on November 7th, the day after his [[United States presidential election, 1984|reelection victory]], Reagan dismissed the entire controversy as "much ado about nothing".&lt;ref name="future" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, a White House spokesman said Reagan had approved the Inspector General's report recommending discipline of several mid-level officials. Five mid-level CIA employees received punishments ranging from written reprimands to suspension without pay for "poor judgment and lapses in oversight" because of the manual. In 1987, it was found that Casey blocked any punishment of the two senior CIA officials involved with producing and distributing the manual, including one, [[Duane Clarridge]], who after initially denying that he had anything to do with the manual, admitted he was "fully responsible" for the document. In closed testimony to a congressional committee, Casey reportedly declared, "There's no reason to discipline them for one little slip-up."&lt;ref name="future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; Under political pressure to remove Clarridge from his role, he was promoted to chief of the CIA's European operations.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2017 p. 1814"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fuller | first=C.J. | title=See It/Shoot It: The Secret History of the CIA's Lethal Drone Program | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-0-300-22767-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iSMDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1814 | accessdate=25 April 2017 | page=1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The manual recommended "selective use of violence for propagandistic effects" and to "neutralize" (i.e., kill) government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[lead] demonstrators into clashes with the authorities, to provoke riots or shootings, which lead to the killing of one or more persons, who will be seen as the martyrs; this situation should be taken advantage of immediately against the Government to create even bigger conflicts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The manual also recommended:

&lt;blockquote&gt;selective use of armed force for PSYOP [psychological operations] effect.... Carefully selected, planned targets — judges, police officials, tax collectors, etc. — may be removed for PSYOP effect in a UWOA [unconventional warfare operations area], but extensive precautions must ensure that the people "concur" in such an act by thorough explanatory canvassing among the affected populace before and after conduct of the mission.&lt;ref name="future" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Nicaragua v. United States''==
The manual was one of the issues the [[International Court of Justice]] (IJC) analyzed in the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'' 1986 ICJ 1 case. The court's [[jurisdiction]] for this case was disputed by the United States, an issue that has never been resolved.

The ICJ statements included: "Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled ''Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas'', and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of [[International humanitarian law|humanitarian law]]; but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed are [[Wiktionary:imputable|imputable]] to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America."&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=367&amp;code=nus&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=70&amp;k=66&amp;p3=5 |date=2000 |title=Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) |publisher=[[International Court of Justice]] |location=The Hague |isbn=9210708261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Court has to determine whether the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was such that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government. The Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to demonstrate the total dependence of the contras on United States aid. A partial dependency, the exact extent of which the Court cannot establish, may be inferred from the fact that the leaders were selected by the United States, and from other factors such as the organisation, training and equipping of the force, planning of operations, the choosing of targets and the operational support provided. There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf."&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org"/&gt;

"Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed."&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org"/&gt;

The '''Sidi Ali Karray Mausoleum''' ([[Arabic]]: زاوية سيدي علي الكراي) is one of the famous [[mausoleum]]s of the [[medina of Sfax]].

== History ==
The Sidi Ali Karray Mausoleum is the oldest funerary building in the medina of Sfax. It was built in several stages, the most important of which took place after the death of the saint [[Sidi Ali Karray]] at the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Sfax: monumental archeology research and urban evolution|last=Mahfoudh|first=Faouzi|publisher=Université Paris-Sorbonne|year=1988|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first religious building in the medina of Sfax to combine both prayer and funerary structures (''turba'') in its architecture, a characteristic that inspired the construction of later mausoleums with the same structure such as the [[Sidi Belhassen Karray Mausoleum]] (in the 16th century) and [[Sidi Amar Kammoun Mausoleum]] (in the 17th century).

Between 1978 and 1982, the monument underwent a radical transformation that destroyed all its historical features.

== Architecture ==
The mausoleum was built in three stages:

=== First stage ===
The original part of the mausoleum was the [[Chapel|prayer room]] on the southeast side of the building. It is a rectangular room, ten meters by seven meters, with the floor divided into six aisles, three of which are parallel to the wall of the [[qibla]] and three narrower perpendicular ones. This arrangement is based on four central [[column]]s from which extend two rows of tripled arches following an east&amp;ndash;west axis.

=== Second stage ===
The second stage was an extension of the prayer hall on the eastern side and the addition of a burial chamber to the north. The latter is a rectangular room of 5.75 meters by 4.7 meters.

The [[dome]] of this room is a typical example of a specific Sfax construction technique, which involves is the using a wooden tool to press the plaster more firmly onto the underlying structure, leaving small square indentations on the surface.

=== Third stage ===
According to Faouzi Mahfoudh, towards the end of the 18th century, the building underwent restoration and a small patio was added as part of the construction of a house (probably that of Saint [[Abdallah Jammoussi]]) on the northeast side of the oratory. This patio has a covered gallery near the entrance and stairs to an upper floor, giving the whole mausoleum a domestic feel.

'''Sleepytime Gorilla Museum''' (often abbreviated to '''SGM''') was an [[United States|American]] [[experimental rock]] band, formed in 1999 in [[Oakland, California]]. The band fuses classical, industrial, and art-rock themes throughout their music. They are known to perform elaborate routines on stage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bambarger |first1=Bradley |title=Reviews &amp; Previews: Albums - Pop |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=49 |date=December 8, 2001 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discuss possibly fictitious stories of [[dada]] artists and mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Willcoma |title=Music Review: Sleepytime Gorilla Museum - Of Natural History |url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/sleepytime-gorilla-museum-sleepytime-gorilla-museum-natural-history |website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] |accessdate=September 8, 2018 |date=December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the disbanding of [[Idiot Flesh]], [[Nils Frykdahl]] and [[Dan Rathbun]] joined with [[Carla Kihlstedt]] (with whom Frykdahl and Rathbun had played in the band [[Charming Hostess]]) to form Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, along with percussionists [[Moe! Staiano]] and [[David Shamrock]]. Their first performance, on June 22, 1999, was given to a single [[banana slug]] (''Ariolimax dolichophallus'').&lt;ref name="SGM"&gt;[http://www.sleepytimegorillamuseum.com/history.html Sleepytime Gorilla Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104105144/http://www.sleepytimegorillamuseum.com/history.html |date=2006-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following night's performance was their first to a human audience.

Some time during the recording of ''[[Grand Opening and Closing]]'' (2001), drummer David Shamrock left the band and was replaced by [[Frank Grau]]. Grau also co-released the album, instigated their first tour and managed the band.

During the recording of the follow-up, ''[[Of Natural History]]'' (2004), Grau left the band and was replaced by new drummer Matthias Bossi, formerly of [[Skeleton Key (band)|Skeleton Key]]. The ''Of Natural History'' tour saw Moe! Staiano's exit, and new multi-instrumentalist [[Michael Iago Mellender]]'s entrance. In January 2006 Sleepytime Gorilla Museum signed to [[The End Records]] who re-released their début ''Grand Opening and Closing'' with three bonus tracks.

During early 2007, the title and track list for their third studio album, ''[[In Glorious Times]]'' was announced with the release date set for May 29, 2007.&lt;ref name="05-22-2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=SLEEPYTIME GORILLA MUSEUM: 'Helpless Corpses Enactment' Video Posted Online |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sleepytime-gorilla-museum-helpless-corpses-enactment-video-posted-online/ |accessdate=September 8, 2018 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the release, an [[mp3]] and [[music video]] of the song "Helpless Corpses Enactment" were made available online.&lt;ref name="05-22-2007" /&gt;

==Name==
According to their extensive liner notes for ''Grand Opening and Closing'', their official history and repeated in interviews, the name "Sleepytime Gorilla Museum" comes from a small group of [[Dada]]ists, [[Futurism (art)|Futurists]], and artists named the Sleepytime Gorilla Press who owned and operated what they called a "[[museum]] of the future" which was "anti-artifact, non-historical and closed."&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;Album notes for ''Grand Opening And Closing'', CD 2001. The End Records.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "museum" opened on June 22, 1916 (the same date as the bands' first concert, 83 years later). The exhibit was a fire which caused wide chaos and confusion. The following day the museum was closed (hence the name of the first album). The name itself apparently comes from a poem called "Of the Future Hides the Past," written by Museum members Lala Rolo and Ikk Ygg.&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=La Briola |first1=John |title=Sleepytime Gorilla Museum |url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/sleepytime-gorilla-museum-6558937 |accessdate=September 8, 2018 |work=[[Houston Press]] |date=May 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only source of information on the internet regarding the Sleepytime Gorilla Press, Lala Rolo, and Ikk Ygg arises from the band's interviews.

==Style==
===Performance===
Their live performances have featured puppet shows, pseudo-scientific scholarly presentations, and performances by members of the [[Butoh]] group [http://www.inkboat.com inkBoat].

The band uses many homemade devices as instruments, such as the Viking Rowboat.&lt;ref name="SGM"/&gt; Dan Rathbun — who has created most of the band's idiosyncratic instruments — plays, among other [[custom-made instruments]] (though he uses a common [[bass guitar]] most of the time), a custom-stringed bass instrument referred to as the Sledgehammer Dulcimer (or, alternately, the Slide Piano Log), which uses piano strings and is possibly more than 7 feet long; it is played with two sticks: one in the left hand generally used as a fret, and another in the right hand to strike the strings.

Percussionist Michael Iago Mellender's instruments consist of restaurant kitchen equipment, trash can lids, and other "found" metal objects, in addition to traditional percussion instruments. One of the more infamous instruments used by the band was Moe! Staiano's Popping Turtle (now residing in [[Brooklyn, NY]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sleepytimegorillamuseum.com/moe/sleepytimegorillamuseum.html Moe! Staiano - title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). It can be heard about 1:21 into the song "Sleep is Wrong".

===Categorization===
SGM's music can be likened to [[experimental rock]] or [[avant-garde metal]]; however, as inherent to the music, the band attempts to escape any categorization. Some influences include [[Henry Cow]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Einstürzende Neubauten]], [[King Crimson]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Bauhaus]], [[The Art Bears]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Thinking Plague]], and [[Univers Zéro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=sgm-goac|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110105519/http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=sgm-goac|archivedate=2012-11-10|title=Grand Opening and Closing|publisher=Ground and Sky|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for SGM's second album ''[[Of Natural History]]'', David Moore of [[Pitchfork Media]] states that SGM's debut album ''[[Grand Opening and Closing]]'' was an amalgam of [[Meshuggah]] and [[Secret Chiefs 3]], resulting in "some truly cracked prog-metal anthems."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22317/Sleepytime_Gorilla_Museum_Of_Natural_History Of Natural History | Pitchfork&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Tony Levin]], known for his work with progressive rock pioneers  [[King Crimson]] and also with [[Peter Gabriel]], stated that he is a "huge fan of" Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and chose the track "Sleep is Wrong", which he calls "very, very powerful" as one of the pieces which most influenced his current project, [[Stick Men (prog band)|Stick Men]]. Levin also credited Sleepytime Gorilla Museum as doing "things that we never dreamed of doing in Crimson or in any band that I've been in," specifically their "radical" and "organic" shifts in tempo.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=vutoME7jIuM|title=Tony Levin: Piece 2: Sleepytime Gorilla Museum's Sleep is Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Syrian Social Nationalist Party''' ('''SSNP''') ({{lang-ar|الحزب السوري القومي الاجتماعي}}, [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]: ''Al-Ḥizb Al-Sūrī Al-Qawmī Al-'Ijtimā'ī'', often referred to in [[French language|French]] as ''Parti populaire syrien'' or ''Parti social nationaliste syrien''), is a nationalist [[political party]] operating in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. It advocates the establishment of a [[Greater Syria|Syria]]n [[nation state]] spanning the [[Fertile Crescent]], including present day Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, [[Kuwait]], Jordan, Palestine, [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]], [[Sinai]], southeastern [[Turkey]] ([[Alexandrette]] and [[Cilicia]]), based on geographical boundaries and the common history people within the boundaries share.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 24; [http://www.ssnp.com/new/about.htm ssnp.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517183153/http://www.ssnp.com/new/about.htm |date=2006-05-17 }} "Our Syria has distinct natural boundaries…" (accessed 30 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 100,000 members as of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zamanalwsl.net/en/news/3467.html|title=Social Nationalist Party mourns Two Fighters killed in Clash with Rebels SYRIA NEWS - ZAMAN ALWSL|work=SYRIA NEWS - ZAMAN ALWSL|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the second largest legal political group in Syria after the ruling [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5425 The SSNP is now Syria's largest party after the ruling Ba'ath.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lebanon, it has been a major secular and highly organised elite party in the political history of the country for over 80 years.  Until recent times it was a key group in the [[March 8 Alliance]].

Founded in [[Beirut]] in 1932 as an [[Anticolonialism|anticolonial]] and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation]] organization hostile to [[French colonialism]],  the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted [[coup d'etat|coups d'etat]] in 1949 and 1961 following which it was thoroughly repressed. It was active in resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000 while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon out of both belief in Syrian [[irredentism]] but also due to the decades-long repression it endured at the hands of the [[Baath Party (Syria)|Baath Party]] in Syria. In Syria, the SSNP had become a major [[Right-wing politics|Right-wing]] political force in the early 1950s, but was thoroughly repressed in 1955-56. It remained organized, and by the late 1960s had joined the Left and allied itself with the [[PLO]] and the [[Lebanese Communist Party]], despite the ideological rivalry that persists among them. In 2005, it was legalized in Syria and joined the Ba'ath Party-led [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]]. From 2012 to 6 May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sana.sy/eng/21/2014/05/06/542876.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030837/http://sana.sy/eng/21/2014/05/06/542876.htm |archivedate=2014-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;idioma=1&amp;id=2652361&amp;Itemid=1|title=Noticias de Prensa Latina|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party was part of the [[Popular Front for Change and Liberation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssnp.com/new/ssnp/en/ssnp.htm|title=IDEOLOGY|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412053314/http://www.ssnp.com/new/ssnp/en/ssnp.htm|archive-date=2016-04-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]] the party has seen its relevance increasing in Syria, where almost 12000 fighters of the Party's armed branch, the Eagles of the Whirlwind, fight alongside the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] against the [[Syrian opposition]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/28/the-eagles-of-the-whirlwind/|title= The Eagles of Whirlwind-Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Butrus bustani.jpg|framed|left|Referring to Syria, [[Butrus al-Bustani]] adopted "Love of the Homeland is an article of Faith" as a slogan when he founded the periodical Al-Jinan in 1870]]

===The Early Syrian Nationalists===
In the mid Nineteenth Century [[Butrus al-Bustani]] was one of the first to assert the existence of a [[Greater Syria|Natural Syrian nation]] that should be accommodated in a reformed [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hourani, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983) 100–102&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to the [[Nahda]], thinkers influenced by the [[Arabic Literary Renaissance]] and the [[French Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Suzanne Kassab, ''Contemporary Arab Thought, Cultural Critique in Comparative Perspective'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; and who wished to shape the [[Tanzimat]] reforms, which were an attempt to introduce a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[religious freedom]] to reverse the Ottoman state's creeping economic marginalisation&lt;ref&gt;Paul Salem, ''Bitter Legacy: Ideology and Politics in the Arab World'' (Syracuse University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and which would lead to the [[Young Turks]] and the [[Second Constitutional Era]].

An influential follower of al-Bustani was the Belgian [[Jesuit]] historian, [[Henri Lammens]], ordained as a priest in Beirut in 1893, who claimed that Greater Syria had since [[Ancient Middle East|ancient times]] encompassed all the land between the [[Arab peninsula]], [[Egypt]], the [[Levantine corridor]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], including all the peoples within the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;Asher Kaufman, "Henri Lammens and Syrian Nationalism," in Adel Beshara, ''The Origins of Syrian Nationhood: Histories, Pioneers and Identity''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Henri Lammens.jpg|thumbnail|right|"Syria is the Tunic of Christ" – [[Henri Lammens]].]]

This was also accompanied with the rise of a profoundly idealistic patriotism, largely resembling European [[romantic nationalism]], idealizing the coming of a [[Renaissance|National Revival]] to the Levant, that would shake off the Ottoman past and propel back what many started to see again as the cradle of civilization into the modern world's front stage. In that aspect, the works of [[Khalil Gibran]] who began expressing his belief in Syrian nationalism and patriotism are central. As Gibran said, "I believe in you, and I believe in your destiny. I believe that you are contributors to this new civilization. [...] I believe that it is in you to be good citizens. And what is it to be a good citizen? [...] It is to stand before the towers of New York and Washington, Chicago and San Francisco saying in your hearts, "I am the descendent of a people the builded Damascus and Byblos, and Tyre and Sidon and Antioch, and I am here to build with you, and with a will."&lt;ref&gt;Khalil Gibran, To Young Americans of Syrian Origin. URL: http://www.alhewar.com/gibran_to_young_americans.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonialism, Zionism and Sectarianism===
The late 1920s and the early 1930s were also a period of cultural and political effervescence that greatly contributed to the emergence of [[Syrian nationalism]] as a distinct ideology. In 1920, the French army toppled the first [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] and the Hashemite [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], who had been proclaimed "King of all-Syria" by the [[Syrian National Congress]] at the [[Battle of Maysalun]]. The British and the French dissected the region into spheres of influence in what later became known as the [[Sykes-Picot]] agreement, setting up colonial administrations throughout the Levant. 
[[File:Free Syria.jpg|thumb|left|"On the ashes of our past, we will build our coming glory". Free Syria according to Khalil Gebran]]
The [[Great Syrian Revolt]] was brutally repressed in 1925 while a small clique of traditional landowners and notables coalesced around the newly founded administration of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]]. [[Greater Lebanon]] was established on the ruins of the [[Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon]] with arbitrarily drawn borders and with a state structure largely dominated by the Christian [[Maronites]], a community whose elite were historically well-disposed to the French, and who would ensure the [[French colonial empire]] a strong foothold in the Arab World. [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]] was increasing at an alarming speed, bringing to the shores of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Zionist]] migrants who had little affinity to ([[Revisionist Zionism]]) or similarities with ([[Labor Zionism|Marxist and Labor Zionism]]) the local populace, be it the [[Palestinian Arabs]] or the traditional [[Arab Jews|local Jewish communities]]. Class tensions sharpened as some Palestinian landowners sold their lands to the [[Jewish National Fund]], with little regard to the national aspirations and plight of the peasantry. As the [[Balfour Declaration]] became public, fears in the Levant of the parceling out of the region along [[Colonialism|Colonial]] borders implied in the minds of many the need for concerted action throughout the Levant that would transcend traditional sectarian divides. Similarly, [[Communism]], perceived by many as an alien ideology that did not resonate much with the socioeconomic conditions of the early 20th century Levant, was looked upon with suspicion, particularly since many [[Zionist]] migrants settling in Palestine were coming from the [[Soviet Union]].

Many Syrian and Lebanese youth saw these events as omens of an ill future in which the Levant, which had until then been a single economic and social entity within the [[Ottoman Empire]] referred to as [[Bilad al-Sham]], would be dismembered along religious, ethnic, and class lines. As the traditional elite stirred away from the people and slowly sought the good offices of the French High Commissioner, and given the repression with which the French Mandate was applied, [[Secret societies]] flourished in the late 1920s. Similarly, many begin to see the devastating effect that sectarianism was bringing upon the people of the region, be it pro-Christian [[Separatism]] in Lebanon or the radicalism of [[Islamist]] elements in Syria, which pitted each faction against the other and benefited no other than the colonial administration, and began to condemn the mixing of religion with politics. The path was hence laid down for the emergence of a [[political ideology]] that would simultaneously fight against the dismemberment of the region, [[Zionism]], and [[Colonialism]], through [[Anti-colonialism]], [[Liberation War]], and [[Romantic nationalism|National Revival]], while [[Anti-communism|keeping communism in check]]. It also represented a clear departure from the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] current that advocated the unification of the entirety of the Arab World, and which had implicit [[Islamic nationalism|Islamic nationalist]] undertones. This ideology was to be that of a [[Romantic Nationalism|Romanticized]] [[Secularism|Secular]] [[Greater Syria in pan-Syrian nationalism|Greater Syria]] based upon the natural geographical boundaries that defined the region loosely dubbed as the Fertile Crescent, an ideology that [[Antun Saadeh]] would come to assert with the foundation of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, where it found its full expression.

==Foundation and early years==
[[File:Antun Saadeh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antun Saadeh]]]]
The SSNP was founded by [[Antun Saadeh]], a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] journalist and lecturer from a [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] family who had lived in South America from 1919 to 1930&lt;ref name=goetz&gt;{{cite book |title=Nazism in Syria and Lebanon: The Ambivalence of the German Option, 1933–1945 |author=[[Nordbruch Goetz]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-203-88856-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAWBkDAv4TkC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Syrian+social+nationalist+nazi+fascist |quote=(...) during his speech of 1 June 1935 (...) Antun Saadeh declared (...) "(...) The Syrian Social Nationalist Party is neither a Hitlerite nor a Fascist one, but a pure social nationalist one. It is not based on useless imitation, but is the result of an authentic invention. (...)"}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} who in November 1932 secretly established the first nucleus of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which operated underground for the first three years of its existence,&lt;ref name="goetz" /&gt; and in 1933 started publishing the monthly journal ''Al-Majalla'' which was distributed in the [[American University of Beirut]] and developed the party's ideology. In 1936 the party's open hostility to colonialism led to the French authorities banning the party and the imprisoning Saadeh for six months for creating a clandestine party,&lt;ref name=goetz /&gt; although an accusation of having been in contact with the German and Italian [[fascist]] movements was dropped after the Germans denied any relationship.&lt;ref name=goetz /&gt; During his time in prison Saadeh wrote ''The Genesis of Nations'' to lay out the SSNP's ideology. At that time, the Party joined ranks with other nationalist and patriotic forces including the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]], whereas it began militating, in secret, for the overthrow of the Mandate. Nonetheless, the alliance between the SSNP and the National Bloc did not last long: The National Bloc refrained from engaging in actual militant activities against the French, deciding instead to cooperate with the High Commissioner. Many SSNP members also felt that the NB refused to cooperate with them due to the fact that their founder was Christian.&lt;ref&gt;See: Youssef al-Debs, "In the Convoy of the Renaissance"&lt;/ref&gt;

Saadeh emigrated again to Brazil in 1938 and afterwards to Argentina, only to return to Lebanon in 1947 following the [[Lebanese Independence Day|country's independence from the French in 1943]]. On his way to Argentina, he visited Italy and Berlin, which increased the suspicions of the French that the SSNP might have been entertaining relations with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Coming back shortly to Lebanon in 1939, he was questioned by the French authorities who accused him of plotting with the Germans. The charge was dropped when no evidence of collaboration had been found and after that Saadeh declared that even the French rule to which he was vehemently opposed would be better than German or Italian rule. Having afterwards left for Argentina, Saadeh found out that the Argentinian branch of the SSNP newspaper had been voicing its outright support for [[Nazi Germany]] and to the Axis powers, which led Saadeh to issue a lengthy letter to the editor-in-chef, restating that the SSNP is not a [[National Socialist]] party and that no stance should be taken vis-à-vis the Allies or the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Nordbrush, ''Nazism in Syria and Lebanon'', 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the SSNP had grown exponentially and had clashed on many occasions with its primary ideological rival, the [[Kataeb Party]], a [[Falangism|Spanish Fascist-Inspired]] party that had been founded by [[Pierre Gemayel]], a pharmacist and athlete after his return from the [[Berlin Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]]. Being vehemently [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] in its early days, a position that would later change, it had also clashed with the [[Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party]], the latter accusing the SSNP of Nazi sympathies.

[[File:Greater Syria with Syrian Social Nationalist Party Flag.svg|thumb|right|[[Greater Syria in pan-Syrian nationalism|Greater Syria or Natural Syria]], encompassing the entirety of the [[Middle East]] basin, commonly known as the [[Fertile Crescent]]]]
While the Kataeb was committed to the notion of Lebanon as a [[nation state]] defined as an entity presiding over the borders outlined first by the [[Sykes–Picot agreement]] in 1916, and afterwards by the [[Greater Lebanon|French administrative division]] of its mandate into six states including the state of Greater Lebanon, and had espoused a [[Clerical fascism|strong bond between the nation and the church]] as well as outright social ultraconservatism, the SSNP rejected these national claim on the basis that the borders outlining the newly created states were fictitious, resulting from colonialism, and do not reflect any historical and social realities. The party claimed that Greater Syria as defined by Saadeh represents the national ideal encompassing the historical people of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, bound together by a clearly defined geography and a common historical, social and cultural development path away from all [[sectarianism]].&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;A. Saadeh. ''The Genesis of Nations''. Translated and Reprinted. Dar Al-Fikr. Beirut, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party took a radical stance against the traditional notable class in Syria and Lebanon, including the large landowners and feudal lords, and called for the emancipation of the working class and the peasantry away from religion and sectarianism, into a socialist-inspired production-based economy. The SSNP also called for the reclamation of [[Alexandretta Sanjak|Alexandretta]] which had been arbitrarily given to Turkey by France. With the start of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] in 1948, Saadeh radicalized the party's [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist stance]] by declaring that "Our struggle with the enemy is not a struggle for borders but for existence", and called on Party members to fight in the [[Arab Liberation Army]], although many regular Lebanese and Syrian army officers were already Party members.
[[File:Antun Saadeh on Trial.jpg|thumb|left| Antun Saadeh faces his hasty and theatrical trial for "high treason and armed rebellion". He was summarily executed shortly afterwards]]
When the [[Lebanese Communist Party]], which had fought against Saadeh's return in 1947 and which had been fighting for the title of head of the country's [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]] movement, declared its acceptance of the [[Partition Plan]], infuriated and increasingly zealous SSNP members burned down a Communist headquarters. As communists defected away after the Communist Party's sudden pivot upon orders from the [[Soviet Union]], the SSNP's ranks swelled.

When the Arabs lost the war in 1948, Saadeh propelled the Party into a fully confrontational stance: He deemed [[Arabism]] as a purely rhetorical gimmick, condemned the incompetence and hypocrisy of the Arab leaders, and asserted that the creation of the State of Israel and the expulsion of the Palestinians was the direct result of this incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;See: "The Rise of the Revolutionaries" in Patrick Seale, ''The Struggle for Arab Independence''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1949, a year after the declaration of the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] and the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] (the Nakba), and a response to a series of aggressions perpetrated by the Kataeb-backed Lebanese government, the SSNP attempted its first revolution. Following a violent crackdown by government forces, Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with [[Husni al-Za'im]] in an attempt to obtain his support. A decision was taken by [[King Farouk]], [[Riad el Solh]] and [[Husni al-Za'im]] to eliminate [[Antoun Saadeh]], under the patronage of [[British Intelligence]] and the [[Mossad]].&lt;ref&gt;http://daharchives.alhayat.com/issue_archive/Hayat%20INT/2000/7/7/من-قتل-أنطون-سعاده-وثائق-جديدة-تكشف-خلفيات-انقلاب-حسني-الزعيم.html. {{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Al-Za'im handed Saadeh over to Lebanese authorities, who had him executed on July 8, 1949. It was the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.&lt;ref&gt;Adel beshara (2010). ''Outright Assassination: The Trial and Execution of Antun Sa'adeh'', 1949.

=== From Confrontation to Accommodation ===
After Saadeh was executed and its high-ranking leaders were arrested, the party remained underground [[1958 Lebanon crisis|until 1958]] when it sided with the pro-Western president [[Camille Chamoun]] against the Arab nationalist rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.iprimus.com.au/fidamelhem/ssnp/The+lebanese_crisis_of_1958_and_the+the+SSNp.htm |title=Article on pro-SSNP website on the party's role in the 1958 civil war |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115140010/http://home.iprimus.com.au/fidamelhem/ssnp/The+lebanese_crisis_of_1958_and_the+the+SSNp.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2014 |df= }} accessed 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred right after the Party was accused of having plotted the assassination of [[Adnan al-Malki]], a Left-leaning [[Baath Party (Syria)|Baath Party]] army officer in Syria, and after Party members had fled to Beirut. The Party at that time still viewed the [[Soviet Union]] with contempt, and opposed the [[Arab Nationalist]] current of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], while retaining its commitment to Syrian Nationalism. Indeed, the idea of having Greater Syria subsumed under the creed of Arab Nationalism founded on the [[Arabic language]], [[Arab culture|Arab]] and [[Islamic culture]] was abhorred by the SSNP, which retained its profound belief in Syrian social and anthropological historicism, namely the process of national and social association that characterizes the [[Fertile Crescent]] and that differentiates it from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] or [[North Africa]].

=== The 1961 Coup d'Etat ===
In 1961 two SSNP members, company commanders in the Lebanese army, tried to carry off a lightning coup against [[Fouad Chehab]] and failed.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/06/behind-the-terror/376326/ |title=Behind the Terror |website= The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the main reasons cited by the perpetrators was the increasingly dictatorial aspects of the rule of [[Fouad Chehab|General Chehab]], his expansion of the state surveillance and intelligence apparatus, but also his [[Nasserist]] orientation.

This resulted in a renewed proscription and the imprisonment of many of its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, ''Foreign Relations of the United States Volume 17, Near East,1961–1963,'' (Washington, DC: GPO 1993), 383-384.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the party's known activists remained in prison or exile until a general amnesty in 1969.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic.com"/&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975, the SSNP formed a military squad that allied with the leftist [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM), against the [[Phalangists]] and their allies of the [[Lebanese Front]]. The SSNP saw the Lebanese Civil War as the inevitable result of the divisions of the Syrian nation into small states and away from a [[liberation war]] against [[Israel]].  After the defeat of leftist forces in the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the SSNP joined a number of the leftist organizations who regrouped to resist the Israeli occupation, including the [[Wimpy Operation|killing of two Israeli soldiers in a Wimpy Cafe]] in west Beirut by party member Khalid Alwan.

In 1983 the party joined the [[Lebanese National Salvation Front]]. In 1985, a member of the party, [[Sana'a Mehaidli]], detonated  a car bomb next to an Israeli military convoy at [[Jezzin]], South Lebanon. She killed two Israeli soldiers and become one of the first known female [[suicide bombers]].

The SSNP participated in a number of general elections in Lebanon, winning six seats in [[Lebanese general election, 1992|1992]], although seeing a decline in subsequent elections winning two seats in both [[2005 Lebanese general elections|2005]] and [[Lebanese general election, 2009|2009]].

==The SSNP in Syria==
In Syria the SSNP grew to a position of considerable influence in the years following the country's independence in 1946, and was a major political force immediately after the restoration of democracy in 1954. It was a fierce rival of the [[Syrian Communist Party]] and of the radical pan-Arab [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], the other main ideological parties of the period. In April 1955 Colonel [[Adnan al-Malki]], a Ba'athist officer who was a very popular figure in the Syrian army, was assassinated by a party member. This provided the Communists and Ba'athists with the opportunity to eliminate their main ideological rival, and under pressure from them and their allies in the security forces the SSNP was practically wiped out as a political force in Syria.

The SSNP's stance during the Lebanese civil war and in Lebanese politics—where it has become a close ally of [[Hezbollah]]&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;—was consistent with that of Syria, and that facilitated a rapprochement between the party and the Syrian government. During Hafez al-Assad's [[President of Syria|presidency]], the party was increasingly tolerated. After the succession of his son [[Bashar al-Asad|Bashar]] in 2000, this process continued. In 2001, although still officially banned, the party was permitted to attend meetings of the Ba'ath-led [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] coalition of legal parties as an observer. In Spring 2005 the party was legalised in Syria, in what has been described as "an attempt to allow a limited form of political activity".&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

Over time, the SSNP and the Syrian Baathist regime experienced a dramatic turnabout in their historical relationship, from enemies to allies. The process started as the party reckoned that Hafez al-Assad regional goals such as consolidating Syria's control over Lebanon and the [[PLO]] were consistent with the SSNP's goal of establishing Greater Syria,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic.com"/&gt; while the SSNP reciprocated acting as a Syrian proxy in Lebanon. The alliance has strengthened on the face of the [[Syrian Civil War]].

In the 22 April 2007 [[Syrian parliamentary election, 2007|election]] for the [[People's Council of Syria]], the party gained 3 out of 250 in the parliament.

Notable SSNP politicians in Syria include [[Issam Al Mahayri]], [[Joseph Sweid]], [[Bushra Massouh]], and [[Issam Bagdi]]

===Role in the Syrian Civil War===
{{see also|Eagles of the Whirlwind}}
During the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War]] the SSNP participated in counter demonstrations in support of the [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|government]].&lt;ref name="Al Akhbar English"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/18502|title=The SSNP 'Hurricane' in the Syrian conflict: Syria and South Lebanon Are The Same Battlefield|website=Al-Akhbar in English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Syrian Civil War|the war]] broke out, the Syrian government reciprocated providing weaponry and training.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt; In the meantime, SSNP officials had become a target for rebel militants and were kidnapped and assassinated.&lt;ref name="Al Akhbar English" /&gt; Bashar al-Yazigi, head of the political SSNP bureau in Syria stated that the "opposition is seeking to create sharp sectarian rifts and fragment Syrian society"&lt;ref name="Al Akhbar English" /&gt; with the party regarding both the ongoing Syrian Civil War and the [[Iraq War]] as attempts to partition those countries—and, eventually Lebanon—along ethno-sectarian lines.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt;

Estimates of the number of SSNP fighters in Syria range from 6,000 to 8,000.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt; Lebanese fighters are included in their ranks, even though the party claims that "their proportion within the group's total fighting force has decreased steadily, as more Syrians sign up".&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt;
By February 2014, SSNP fighters were primarily deployed in the governorates of [[Homs Governorate|Homs]] and [[Damascus Governorate|Damascus]] and were said to be the most formidable military force other than the Syrian Army in [[Suweida Governorate|Suweida]].&lt;ref name="Al Akhbar English" /&gt; SSNP fighters have participated in the battles [[battle of Sadad|of Sadad]], [[Battle of Ma'loula|Ma'loula]] or [[Battle of al-Qaryatayn (March–April 2016)|al-Qaryatayn]], among others.&lt;ref name="Al Akhbar English" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/04/04/actualidad/1459795054_451165.html|title=El Ejército sirio expulsa al Estado Islámico del desierto|author=Natalia Sancha|date=5 April 2016|work=El País|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party officials say its membership has increased "by the thousands" since the start of the war as a result of its alleged "reputation as an effective fighting force in Syria".&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt;

The party is taking on a larger role in Syria's official political system: it fielded 30 candidates for the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]], winning 7 seats.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt;

==Ideology==
{{unref section|date=October 2018}}
===Political tenets===

==== Greater Syria, Natural Syria ====
While in jail from early February to early May 1936, Saadeh completed ''The Genesis of Nations'' which he had started writing three months before the French authorities in Lebanon discovered the secret organization and arrested its leader and his assistants. In his book, Saadeh formulated his belief in the existence of a Syrian nation in a homeland defined as embracing all historic Syria extended to the Suez Canal in the south, and that includes modern Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The boundaries of the historic environment in which the Syrian nation evolved went much beyond the scope usually ascribed to Syria, extending from the Taurus range in the north-east and the [[Zagros mountains]] in the north-west to the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the south and includes the [[Sinai peninsula]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, including the island of [[Cyprus]], to the arch of the Arabian desert and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=January 2012}} According to Saadeh, this region is also called the Syrian Fertile Crescent, the island Cyprus being its star.

Greater Syria corresponds to the [[Mesopotamian]] basin of [[Bilad al-Sham]] before it was arbitrarily dissected by the colonial powers. According to Saadeh, geographical factors play an important role in setting the parameters for the process of association and thus for the establishment of a nation. He held that the process of [[human evolution]] from [[hunter-gatherer]] to settled agriculture was among the most important factors that led to the creation of private property and the [[class system]]. Saadeh highlighted the role that the class system played in the flourishing of trade and commerce and the creation of wealth, ascribing it to be a characteristic of the [[Semitic peoples]], namely the coastal [[Phoenicians]]. He also stressed the link between the economic [[modes of production]] and the establishment of cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s and values, a view he shared with [[Karl Marx]].

However, Saadeh believed that while the economic modes of production can create culture, culture acquires a life of its own with time and eventually becomes embedded and perpetuated in its people, who come to recognize themselves as a living organism. Hence comes the importance of the state in serving the interest of the nation, and of national democracy as the legitimate source of political legislation. The party espouses the idea that the fundamental basis of nation is the territory or geographical region, not the ethnical bond. The natural environment and geographical specifications of a certain land is what eventually allows, or disallows, its transition from a socio-economic phase to another.
[[File:SSNP members.jpg|thumb|left|SSNP members at Saadeh's return from exile in 1947]]
These natural geographical factors hence create the societal framework in which man establishes his existence, beliefs, habits, and value systems. Saadeh's critique of ethnic nationalisms led him to hence develop a framework of geographical nationalism, the idea of the "natural homeland". When he applied this model to the case of the Fertile Crescent, the conclusion he reached was straightforward: the natural geographical factors of the basin lying east of the Mediterranean is what has allowed it to become the [[cradle of civilization]]s, what has driven throughout the course of human history movements seeking to unify it, what has allowed it to establish, through ethnic, religious and cultural assimilation and mixing, a high culture and civilization, and what has made it the prize coveted by all imperialist powers. Saadeh advocated for all ethnoreligious groups to consider themselves as descendants of the [[Ancient Near East|pre-Christian era]] empires of [[Babylon]] and [[Assyria]], of the [[Hittites]] and the kings of [[Arameans|Aram]], then of the [[Islamic empires]], all the way up until the present.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic.com"/&gt; The SSNP claimed that the Greater Syria is the natural home of the Syrian people with clearly defined geographic boundaries, yet that its people are suffering from an [[identity crisis]] due to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, colonialism, and sectarianism. Saadeh claimed that the ''renaissance'' of the Syrian nation is inevitably linked to the purge of these "decadent" forces through the reinforcing of national solidarity, resistance against colonialism, and adoption of [[secularism]].

In Saadeh's vision of "harmony" among the country's ethnic and religious communities through a return to a so-called Syrian "racial unity" which was itself in fact a mixture of races, neither Islam nor pan-Arabism was important, and therefore religion wasn't either.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic.com"/&gt; Saadeh's concept of the nation was shaped mainly by historical concrete interactions amongst people over the centuries in a given geography, rather than being based on ethnic origins, race, language or religion.  This led him also to conclude that the Arabs could not form one nation, but many nations could be called Arab.

==== The Syrian People ====
The SSNP's Greater Syria ideal posed a problem for all of the existing nationalist movements because of its clear departure from [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] and Islamic undertones, and its inextricable link with what the party leader defined as "the Syrian people", Greater Syria being its natural homeland. The notion of a Syrian people is the cornerstone of the SSNP, and is defined according to the Party as the people inhabiting the Fertile Crescent, whose culture and socio-economic conditions have been a direct consequence of its own interaction with the natural environment.

The Syrian people, according to the Party's founder, is a cultural and socio-economic body of people hailing from a very heterogeneous background, but whose social mixing and assimilation over time within the Levantine basin has allowed for the emergence of a high settled civilization and for the extension of this people over the entirety of Natural Syria. In a clear departure from [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic]], [[Racial nationalism|racial]] and [[Religious nationalism|religious]] understandings of a nation, the Syrian people is a "mixture of races generated by migrations and intermarriages", its social life and cohesion having been shaped and determined by the environment and geography in which it developed. Hence the SSNP rejects racial notions of nationalism, Saadeh himself having ridiculed European racial doctrines in the opening chapters of the Genesis of Nations.

==== Romantic Nationalism ====
The attitude of the party and its founder towards minority [[separatism]] and movements calling for ethnically-separate homelands was one of outright hostility. Saadeh was also hostile to all religiously-motivated political movements, or movements that did not call for the separation between Church (or Mosque) and State. Thus he called [[Wahhabism]] and [[Islamism]] a "return to the desert", a "dry ideology of Arabian tribes" that had no commonalities with the high civilization of the Fertile Crescent. The incoming [[Jewish immigration to Palestine|Jewish migrants]] to Southern Syria (Palestine) and the Jewish communities were criticized for their "foreign and racial loyalties", their unwillingness to assimilate, and their active willingness to create an ethnically [[Jewish state]] in Palestine, with Saadeh deeming the Jews as the community unable and unwilling to assimilate, and having criticized the notion that Jewishness can be a cornerstone for a nation-state. For the SSNP, the Jews do not constitute a nation as they are a heterogeneous mixture of peoples in a similar sense that Muslims and Christians do not constitute a nation.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adel Beshara, "Where we Stand", http://www.ssnp.com/old/ourstand.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826090041/http://www.ssnp.com/old/ourstand.htm |date=2016-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Kurds]] were attacked for their [[communitarianism]] and their disposition to establish a Kurdish state in the north. In what relates to the Arab–Israeli conflict, the party has since its establishment adopted a hard-lined [[anti-Zionist]] stance, while retaining its belief that a [[One-state solution|secular and democratic state in Palestine]] is the only proper solution to the conflict.
The societal cohesion of the Syrian people and its ability to properly assimilate newcomers, minorities, and migrations, is essential to its survival to its progress, and any movement that seeks to assert ethnic, religious, or racial separatism within the Syrian homeland is one that ought to be met with outright hostility. The answer to these threats, according to the Party, lay in the rebirth of the Syrian people, the Renaissance.

==== The Renaissance ====
The Syrian people, as outlined above, is, according to Saadeh, among the first people to have historically moved from the tribal phase into the settled agricultural phase and towards the establishment of [[private property]] and [[social classes]]. This first transition allowed the Syrian people to prosper exponentially and to excel in most of the crafts of the ancient world. Saadeh and the party espoused the belief that a new transition has to take place, a transition to the [[modern age]], which ought to have two prerequisites: the [[Secularism|secular]] unity of the Syrian people and its renaissance. The unity of the Syrian people firstly implies debarring the clergy from interfering in state affairs, and enacting a full separation between Church-Mosque and State. This would inevitably allow the Syrian people to regain its unity and social cohesion.

The second task of the party is to work towards the Renaissance, which the party leader described as being a dynamic undertaking that would shatter what he described as the [[old regime]]. The Renaissance ideal, which Saadeh traces back to the ingenuity of the first Syrians – the Assyrians and the Phoenicians, among others, lies in the mastery of the Syrian people over the sciences and the crafts, which he eulogizes in The Genesis of Nations while attacking what he deemed as the antiquated notions of religious [[fatalism]]. In order to regain its mastery over the crafts and over its own destiny, Saadeh underlines the need for [[intellectualism]], education, and the pursuit of knowledge as cornerstones of the future Syrian society, a notion he summarizes in his famous quote, "Society is knowledge, and knowledge is power".

==== Social Nationalism ====
While the Renaissance is underlined as a romanticized notion of spiritual, intellectual, and patriotic elevation, the SSNP elaborated a simple yet straightforward doctrine pertaining to how the Syrian People ought to organize itself once the Renaissance has begun, albeit the fact that Saadeh had not developed the idea completely. The social-nationalist model elaborated by Saadeh is reflected in the "Communiqué of the First Social Nationalist Revolution of 1949".

The first of these principles is the abolition of [[feudalism]] and of the rule of the traditional [[notables]] and [[landowners]], which the Party deems responsible for the "desolate state of things to which the country had gotten to", including maintaining educational levels at an all-time low and being instrumental in the loss of Palestine. The second principle is "[[Anti-capitalism|opposing capitalist tyranny]]". Despite its belief in the necessity of private property, the SSNP declared defending workers' rights and establishing a framework that guarantees these rights as an inalienable right. This is coupled with the need to establish [[mandatory education]], [[universal healthcare]], the nationalization of vital areas of the economy such as the production of raw materials, and a strong centralized state that is able to give [[Dirigisme|economic directions]]. The third principle stated is [[Anti-communism|combating communism]]. This is particularly true in the early days of the Party, from 1932 until 1961, and before the Party began to slowly shift further towards the Left – which epitomized in its joining the Left-wing parties during the Lebanese Civil War, and becoming a founding member of the Lebanese National Resistance Front, and a close ally of the Lebanese Communist Party and the PLO. This remains a topic of debate, however, as the strongly pronounced nationalistic features of SSNP ideology would permit scholars to interpret ''social nationalism'' as a distinctive breed of [[National Syndicalism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==== Liberation War ====
Perhaps one of the most striking feature of the Party throughout its history, and which has led it to be respected by some, dreaded by others, is the zealous and the almost mystical devotion of its members to the notion of [[Liberation War]]. Most Party members have historically conducted military, [[guerilla]], and assassination operations with little concern for their personal safety or survival. Saadeh himself had a very [[revolutionary]] view of life and death, whereas the Renaissance and the "New Generation" would not see the light of day without sacrifice: "we love life because we love freedom, and we love death when death is a path to life" is among the few quotes of Saadeh which the SSNP reveres.

Since its foundation in 1932, the SSNP adopted direct action and [[Political violence|violence]] against those it deemed as the enemies of the Syrian People, to which it referred to as the "forces of darkness", while the founder referred to the Party as the "Sons of Life" (Abna` al-Hayat): Colonialism and particularly French colonialism in Syria and Lebanon, the feudal landowning and notable class, politicians it deemed to be traitors or corrupt, Zionist settlement of Palestine, [[Lebanese nationalism|Christian separatism]] in Lebanon, Islamic fundamentalism in Syria, a list to which could be added the communists, although this last addition would change in the course of the years as both would join ranks in the LNRF. 
[[File:Lebanese National Resistance Front.jpg|thumb|left|The flag of the Lebanese National Resistance Front, a coalition of armed groups that assembled to fight off the Israeli invasion of Lebanon]]
In 1949, it declared the "First Renaissance Revolution" against the Lebanese government, an armed confrontation with the Lebanese and Syrian security forces that ended in a disaster and the execution of Antun Saadeh by the Lebanese authorities on the 8th of July. Not too long later, Party members assassinated the Lebanese Prime Minister [[Riad al-Solh]] who was instrumental in Saadeh's death penalty. To avoid being caught, the assailants committed suicide. When one of the assailants survived and woke up in the hospital, he completed his suicide attempt by tearing up his wounds and falling from the bed. The assassination of the general prosecutor who judged Saadeh was also conducted by a Party cell, and Party members are believed to have been involved in the assassination of Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian dictator who captured Saadeh and handed him over to the Lebanese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adel Beshara, ''Outright Assassination, the Trial and Execution of Antun Saadeh'' (Ithaca, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Party member [[Habib Shartouni|Habib al-Shartouni]] assassinated the Lebanese President [[Bachir Gemayel]], the leader of the [[Lebanese Forces]], who had asked for the [[Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982|Israelis to invade Lebanon]] all the way up to Beirut, and with the consent of whom the [[Siege of Beirut]] was effectuated. The Party also undertook many operations against Israeli presence in Lebanon, including a military operation in broad daylight against Israeli officers stationed in Beirut, which triggered the beginning of the generalized armed struggle for Lebanese liberation. [[Sana'a Mehaidli]], whose family had been displaced and was forced to live homeless after the Israeli occupation, detonated herself in her car along with an Israeli convoy in South Lebanon. The Party joined arms with the communists, the PLO, the Arab nationalists, and other left-leaning groups to fight against the Israeli invasion, leading to the break of the siege and to the withdrawal of the Israelis from Beirut. Today, the Party's military wings fights alongside the Syrian Arab Army against the [[Free Syrian Army|FSA]] and [[ISIS]].

===Organization===

The SSNP was organised with a hierarchical structure and a powerful leader. Its ideology was an entirely secular form of nationalism; indeed, it posited the complete separation of religion and politics as one of the two fundamental conditions for real national unity. The other condition was determined economic and social reform.&lt;ref name="Hourani, p. 326"&gt;Hourani, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblem and flag===

The party's emblem is the whirlwind (in Arabic Zawba'a زوبعة). It was designed by the SSNP students at the American University of Beirut while the party was still clandestine and before the French authorities had uncovered it in 1936. Saadeh stated the whirlwind was found engraved on ancient Syrian artifacts, and it is known from for example Sumerian art. The SSNP emblem has been said to be a combination of the Islamic crescent and the Christian cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SSNP website | url = http://ssnp.net/content/view/378/100 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120714144039/http://ssnp.net/content/view/378/100 | archivedate = 2012-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/24853-2/|title=The SSNP's Military: The Eagles of the Whirlwind &amp; Their Emblem - By Jesse McDonald - Syria Comment|author=|date=4 June 2017|website=joshualandis.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party flag features a red hurricane, called the "Zawba'a", within a white disc on a black background.

The swastika was replaced with a hurricane as a PPS symbol,(177) while the storm or combat troops were present in both. Both Hitler and Saadeh, in addition to having the same title of 'the leader', held and exercised all legislative and executive authority."&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that the party denies.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ideological criticism===

Despite Saadeh's claims, some authors state that when the party began overt activity, it was the object of many critiques due to having many ideological and organizational resemblances to European fascism, and due to the resemblance of its external symbols to those of German Nazism.&lt;ref name=am1987&gt;{{cite news | last=Ya'ari | first=Ehud |title=Behind the Terror |work=Atlantic Monthly |date=June 1987 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/87jun/yaari.htm |quote=[The SSNP] greet their leaders with a Hitlerian salute; sing their Arabic anthem, "Greetings to You, Syria," to the strains of "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles"; and throng to the symbol of the red hurricane, a swastika in circular motion. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes1992&gt;{{cite book | last=Pipes | first=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Pipes |title=Greater Syria |year= 1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3PsAb1uV94C | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 100–101 | isbn=0-19-506022-9 |quote=The SSNP flag, which features a curved swastika called the red hurricane (''zawba'a''), points to the party's fascistic origins. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yamak1966&gt;{{cite book | last=Yamak | first=Labib Zuwiyya |title=The Syrian Social Nationalist Party: An Ideological Analysis |year= 1966 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=98tBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party:+An+Ideological+Analysis&amp;dq=The+Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party:+An+Ideological+Analysis&amp;pgis=1 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such resemblances went against the idea that it was an authentic national ideology and couldn't be acknowledged by the party.&lt;ref name=goetz/&gt; The party's founder Saadeh was aware of these accusations and he addressed them during his speech of 1 June 1935 (long before the events of World War II, and before the party was given publicity and the accusations started appearing in the press):

{{quote|The system of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is not a Hitlerite or a Fascist system, but that it is purely a Syrian system which does not stand on unprofitable imitation, but on basic originality which is one of the characteristics of our people.|||[[Antun Saadeh]]|''June 1935''.&lt;ref name="goetz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssnp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssnp.com/new/library/saadeh/misc/en/june_1_35.htm|title=Saadeh|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052238/http://www.ssnp.com/new/library/saadeh/misc/en/june_1_35.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars were however bent on ascribing the blame of collusion of Saadeh with fascism, hence, Reeva Simon writes: "the party's 'leader for life', was an admirer of [[Adolf Hitler]] influenced by Nazi and fascist ideology".&lt;ref name=johnson2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Simon | first=Reeva S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East |year= 1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party%22+nazi&amp;dq=%22Syrian+Social+Nationalist+Party%22+nazi&amp;pgis=1 | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference USA]] | isbn=0-02-896011-4 |quote=The Syrian Social Nationalist party (SSNP) was the brainchild of Antun Sa'ada, a Greek Orthodox Lebanese who was inspired by Nazi and fascist ideologies. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party adopted a reversed swastika as the party's symbol, sang the party's anthem to ''[[Deutschland über alles]]'', and included developing the cult of a leader, advocating totalitarian government, and glorifying an ancient pre-Christian past and the organic whole of the Syrian ''Volk'' or nation.&lt;ref name=am1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson2001&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=Michael |title=All Honourable Men |year= 2001 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zydtz0dDntQC |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] | isbn=1-86064-715-4 |quote=Saadeh, the party's 'leader for life', was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and influenced by Nazi and fascist ideology. This went beyond adopting a reversed swastika as the party's symbol and singing the party's anthem to ''Deutschland über alles'', and included developing the cult of a leader, advocating totalitarian government, and glorifying an ancient pre-Christian past and the organic whole of the Syrian Volk or nation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab nationalist thinker [[Sati' al-Husri]] considered that Saadeh "misrepresented" Arab nationalism, incorrectly associating it with a [[Bedouin]] image of the Arab and with Muslim sectarianism. Palestinian historian [[Maher Charif]] sees Saadeh's theory as a response to the religious diversity of Syria, and points to his later
extension of his vision of the Syrian nation to include Iraq, a country also noted for its religious diversity, as further evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Charif, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The party also accepted that due to "religious and political considerations", the separate existence of Lebanon was necessary for the time being.&lt;ref name="Hourani, p. 326"/&gt;

From 1945 on, the party adopted a more nuanced stance regarding Arab nationalism, seeing Syrian unity as a potential first step towards an Arab union led by Syria.&lt;ref name="Hourani, p. 326"/&gt;

===Scholarly criticism===
Lebanese historian [[Kamal Salibi]] gives a somewhat contrasting interpretation, pointing to the position of the Greek Orthodox community as a large minority in both Syria and Lebanon for whom "the concept of pan-Syrianism was more meaningful than the concept of Arabism" while at the same time they resented [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] dominance in Lebanon. According to Salibi,

&lt;blockquote&gt; Saadeh found a ready following among his co-religionists. His idea of secular pan-Syrianism also proved attractive to many Druzes and Shiites; to Christians other than the Greek Orthodox, including some Maronites who were disaffected by both Lebanism and Arabism; and also to many Sunnite Muslims who set a high value on secularism, and who felt that they had far more in common with their fellow Syrians of whatever religion or denomination than with fellow Sunnite or Muslim Arabs elsewhere. Here again, an idea of nationalism had emerged which had sufficient credit to make it valid.  In the Lebanese context, however, it became ready cover for something more archaic, which was essentially Greek Orthodox particularism.&lt;ref&gt;Kamal Salibi (1988, 1998), pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prof. Salibi remarks on the beginnings of Saadeh's party in the 1930s: "[A]mong its first members were students and young graduates of the American University of Beirut." This early party was "mainly Greek Orthodox and Protestants with some Shi'ites and Druzes...." In Lebanon as a whole the party was not popular. "Christians were generally opposed to their Syrian unionism, while Moslems were suspicious of their reservations with regard to pan-Arabism. The Lebanese authorities were able to suppress them without difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Salibi, ''The Modern History of Lebanon'' (New York: Praeger 1965) at 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], the Arab nationalism was influenced by European fascism, with the creation of at least seven Arab nationalist shirt movements similar to the [[Sturmabteilung|brown shirt]] movement by 1939, with the most influenced ones being the SSNP, the Iraqi Futawa youth movement and the [[Young Egypt Party (1933)|Young Egypt]] movement.&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; These three movements would share characteristics like being territorially expansionist, with the SSNP wanting the complete control of Syria, belief in the superiority of their own people (with Saadeh theorizing a "distinct and naturally superior" Syrian race), being "nonrationalist, anti-intellectual, and highly emotional" and "[emphasizing] military virtues and power [and stressing] self-sacrifice".&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; Also according to Payne, all these movements received strong influence from European fascism and praised the Italian and German fascism but "[they never became] fully developed fascist movements, and none reproduced the full characteristics of European fascism"; the influence in Arab nationalism remained long after 1945.&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; Also, Saadeh's superior race was not a pure one, but a fusion of all races in Syrian history.&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; The SSNP would be "[a] elite group, with little structure for mobilization".&lt;ref name="payne"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of fascism, 1914–1945|author=[[Stanley G. Payne]]|edition=illustrated, reprint|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=9781857285956|pages=352–354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=Antun+Saadeh+fascism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nasrin was born to Dr. Rajab Ali and Edul Ara in the town of [[Mymensingh]]. Her father was a renowned physician, and a professor of Medical Jurisprudence in Mymensingh Medical College, also at Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College. Taslima studied medicine and became a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Youth, Autobiography  - Volume II by Taslima Nasrin|url=http://taslimanasrin.com/MY%20YOUTH.htm/MY%20YOUTH.htm|publisher=Official website|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Taslima Nasrin receiving Ananda Award in 2000.jpg|thumb|Nasrin receiving [[Ananda Puraskar|Ananda Award]] in 2000]]
After high school in 1976 (SSC) and higher secondary studies in college ([[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|HSC]]) in 1978, she studied medicine at the [[Mymensingh Medical College]], an affiliated medical college of the [[University of Dhaka]] and graduated in 1984 with an [[MBBS|MBBS degree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/11/nasrin-taslima/ |title=Taslima Nasrin |last=Devarajan |first=Arthi |date=Spring 1998 |website=Postcolonial Studies |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college, she demonstrated her propensity for poetry by writing and editing a poetry journal called ''Shenjuti''. After graduation, she worked at a family planning clinic in Mymensingh for a while, then practised at the gynecology department of Mitford hospital and at the anesthesia department of [[Dhaka Medical College]] hospital. While she studied and practised medicine, she saw girls who had been raped; she also heard women cry out in despair in the delivery room if their baby was a girl.&lt;ref name="fume"/&gt; She was born into a [[Muslim]] family; however, she became an [[atheist]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;She described herself as a delegate of the NGO [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] at Commission V of UNESCO's General Conference: "I was born to a Muslim family, but I became an atheist." {{cite web

===Literary career until ''Lajja''===

Early in her literary career, she wrote mainly poetry, and published half a dozen collections of poetry between 1982 and 1993, often with female oppression as a theme, and often containing very graphic language.&lt;ref name="fume"/&gt; She started publishing prose in the early 1990s, and produced three collections of essays and four novels before the publication of her 1993 novel ''[[Lajja]]'' ({{lang-bn|লজ্জা}} ''Lôjja''), or ''Shame'', in which a [[Hindu]] family is being attacked by Muslims. This publication changed her life and career dramatically.

Nasrin suffered a number of physical and other attacks following the publication of ''Lajja''. She had written against Islamic philosophy, angering many Muslims of Bangladesh, who called for a ban on her novel. In October 1993, a radical fundamentalist group called the Council of Islamic Soldiers offered a bounty for her death.&lt;ref name="fume"&gt;{{cite news

==Life in exile==
After fleeing Bangladesh in 1994, Nasrin spent the next ten years in exile in Europe and America. She returned to the east and relocated to Kolkata, India, in 2004, where she lived until 2007. After renewed unrest broke out, and after spending several months in hiding, Nasrin left for Europe and America again in 2008.

===1994–2004, exile in Europe and America===
Leaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted [[citizenship]] by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government and took refuge in Germany.&lt;ref name="richards"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-KwuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=czADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6488,3824580&amp;dq=taslima+nasrin+passport+bangladesh&amp;hl=en|title=Home is where they hate you|last=Richards|first=David|date=25 July 1998|publisher=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She allegedly had to wait for six years (1994–1999) to get a visa to visit India. In 1998 she wrote Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood her biographical account from birth to adolescence. She never got a Bangladeshi passport to return to the country when her mother,&lt;ref name="richards"/&gt; and later her father,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} were on their death beds.

In March 2000, she visited [[Mumbai]] to promote a translation of her novel ''Shodh'' (translated by Marathi author Ashok Shahane, the book was called ''Phitam Phat''). Secular "atheist" groups seized upon the occasion to celebrate freedom of expression, while "radical fundamentalist groups...threatened to burn her alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2004, she was granted a renewable temporary residential permit by [[India]] and moved to Kolkata in the state of [[West Bengal]], which shares a common heritage and language with Bangladesh; in an interview in 2007, after she had been forced to flee, she called Kolkata her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While living in Kolkata, Nasrin regularly contributed to Indian newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Anandabazar Patrika]]'' and ''[[Desh magazine|Desh]]'', and, for some time, wrote a weekly column in the Bengali version of ''The Statesman''.

Again her criticism of Islam was met with opposition from religious fundamentalists: in June 2006, Syed Noorur Rehaman Barkati, the [[imam]] of Kolkata's [[Tipu Sultan Mosque]], admitted offering money to anyone who "blackened [that is, publicly humiliated] Ms Nasreen's face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2015 Nasrin was supposedly threatened with death by Al Qaeda-linked extremists, and so the Center for Inquiry assisted her in traveling to the United States, where she now lives.&lt;ref name="centerforinquiry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/amid_death_threats_from_islamists_cfi_brings_secular_activist_taslima_nasri/ |title=Amid Death Threats from Islamists, CFI Brings Secular Activist Taslima Nasrin to Safety in U.S. |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date= |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Inquiry (CFI) that helped evacuate her to USA on 27 May gave an official statement in June 2015 stating that her safety "is only temporary if she cannot remain in the U.S., however, which is why CFI has established an emergency fund to help with food, housing, and the means for her to be safely settled",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Taslima Nasrin Moved to US Following Death Threats in India |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/taslima-nasrin-moved-to-us-following-death-threats-in-india/2806843.html |work=VOA News |accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasrin started writing poetry when she was thirteen. While still at college in Mymensingh, she published and edited a literary magazine, ''SeNjuti'' ("Light in the dark"), from 1978 to 1983. She published her first collection of poems in 1986. Her second collection, ''Nirbashito Bahire Ontore'' ("Banished within and without") was published in 1989. She succeeded in attracting a wider readership when she started writing columns in late 1980s, and, in the early 1990s, she began writing novels, for which she has won significant acclaim.&lt;ref name="controversy"&gt;{{cite news

Her own experience of [[sexual abuse]] during adolescence and her work as a [[gynaecologist]] influenced her a great deal in writing about the alleged treatment of [[women in Islam]] and against religion in general.&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt; Her writing is characterised by two connected elements: her struggle with the Islam of her native culture, and her [[feminist philosophy]]. She cites [[Virginia Woolf]] and Simone de Beauvoir as influences, and, when pushed to think of one closer to home, [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain|Begum Rokeya]], who lived during the time of undivided [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=96825&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=''Times Higher Education'' interview |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=24 February 1995 |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her later poetry also evidences a connection to place, to Bangladesh and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Columns and essays===
In 1989 Nasrin began to contribute to the weekly political magazine ''Khaborer Kagoj'', edited by Nayeemul Islam Khan, and published from Dhaka. Her feminist views and anti-religion remarks articles succeeded in drawing broad attention, and she shocked the religious and conservative society of [[Bangladesh]] by her radical comments and suggestions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Later she collected these columns in a volume titled ''Nirbachita Column'', which in 1992 won her first [[Ananda Purashkar]] award, a prestigious award for Bengali writers. During her life in Kolkata, she contributed a weekly essay to the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of ''The Statesman'', called ''[[Dainik Statesman]]''.

===Novels===
In 1992 Nasrin produced two novellas which failed to draw attention.

Her breakthrough novel [[Lajja|''Lajja'' (''Shame'')]] was published in 1993, and attracted wide attention because of its controversial subject matter. It contained the struggle of a patriotic Bangladeshi Hindu family in a Muslim environment.&lt;ref name="radicals"&gt;{{cite news

Her other famous novel is ''French Lover'', published in 2002.

===Autobiography===
Her memoirs are renowned for their candidness, which has led to a number of them being banned in Bangladesh and India. ''Amar Meyebela'' (''My Girlhood'', 2002), the first volume of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi government in 1999 for "reckless comments" against Islam and the prophet [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Writers and intellectuals for and against Nasrin==
Nasrin has been criticised by writers and intellectuals in both Bangladesh and West Bengal for targeted scandalisation. Because of "obnoxious, false and ludicrous" comments in ''Ka'', "written with the 'intention to injure the reputation of the plaintiff'", [[Syed Shamsul Haq]], Bangladeshi poet and novelist, filed a defamation suit against Nasrin in 2003. In the book, she mentions that Haq confessed to her that he had a relationship with his sister-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Nearly 4 million dollars were claimed in defamation lawsuits against Nasrin by fellow writers in Bangladesh and West Bengal after the publication of ''Ka'' / ''Dwikhandita''. The West Bengal Government, supposedly pressured by 24 literary intellectuals, decided to ban Nasreen's book in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/02/05/stories/2004020500020100.htm |title=''Fishing for trouble'' |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=5 February 2004 |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasrin replied that she wrote about known people without their permission when some commented that she did it to earn [[celebrity|fame]]. She defended herself against all the allegations. She wrote why she dared to reveal her sexual activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/04-crisis-media/59taslima.pdf |title=''homeless everywhere'' |format=PDF |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that she wrote her life's story, not others'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">'''Transaction Processing over XML''' (TPoX) is a [[benchmark (computing)|computing benchmark]] for [[XML database]] systems. As a [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]], TPoX is used for the [[Software performance testing|performance testing]] of [[database management system]]s that are capable of storing, searching, modifying and retrieving [[XML]] data. The goal of TPoX is to allow database designers, developers and users to evaluate the performance of XML database features, such as the XML query languages [[XQuery]] and [[SQL/XML]], XML storage, [[Index (database)|XML indexing]], [[XML Schema]] support, XML updates, [[transaction processing]] and [[Transaction log|logging]], and [[concurrency control]]. TPoX includes XML update tests based on the [[XQuery Update Facility]].

The TPoX benchmark exercises the processing of [[XML#Data-centric and document-centric XML|data-centric]] XML, in contrast to content- or [[XML#Data-centric and document-centric XML|document-centric]] XML.

TPoX was originally developed and tested by [[IBM]] and [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], but became an open source project on [[SourceForge]] in January 2007. TPoX 1.1 was released in June 2007. TPoX 2.0 was released in July 2009.

The TPoX benchmark package contains the following:

* XML Schemas that define the XML data used in the benchmark.
* An XML data generation tool to generate an arbitrary number of XML documents with well-defined value distributions and [[referential integrity]] across documents.  The XML data is generated conforming to industry schema such as [[Financial Information eXchange|FIXML]] to model real-world applications.
* Workloads which are executed on the generated data. A workload is a set of transactions. A [[Database transaction|transaction]] can be a query in [[XQuery]] or [[SQL/XML]] notation or an insert, update or delete operation.
* A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application which acts as a workload driver. It is configurable and can spawn 1 to n parallel threads to simulate concurrent database users. Each user connects to the database and executes a random sequence of transactions defined in the workload. Parameter markers in the transactions are replaced by real values that are drawn from random value distributions. The workload driver collects and reports performance metrics, such as the transaction throughput as well as minimum, maximum and average response times.
* Documentation.

The TPoX workload consists of seven XML queries, two inserts, two deletes, and six [[XQuery Update Facility|XML update]] operations. The primary performance metric of the benchmark is TTPS (TPoX Transactions Per Second) which is the throughput of the multi-user read/write workload at a given [[scale factor]]. The smallest TPoX scale factor uses 10GB of raw XML documents, the largest uses [[Petabyte|1PB]] of raw XML documents.

The '''Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16. Jahrhunderts (VD 16)''' (in English: ''Bibliography of Books Printed in the German Speaking Countries of the Sixteenth Century''), abbreviated '''VD 16''', is a project to make a retrospective German national bibliography for the sixteenth century. The project was compiled during the period 1969-1999. It is financed by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (German Research Foundation). 

There is a corresponding German national bibliography for the seventeenth century, known as [[VD 17]]. Together the VD 16 and VD 17 alongside the planned [[VD 18]] (''Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke des 18. Jahrhunderts'') fulfill a function for the bibliographic history of the German cultural zone similar to the ''[[English Short Title Catalogue]]'' for Britain and North America.

'''William Chester Minor''', also known as '''W. C. Minor''' (June 22, 1834 &amp;ndash; March 26, 1920) was an American army surgeon and one of the largest contributors of quotations to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name=Winchester98&gt;{{Cite book |last=Winchester |first=Simon |title=The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1998 |isbn=0-06-017596-6 |edition=hardback |location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in a [[lunatic asylum]] for murder at the time.{{clarify|date=September 2017|reason=This sentence is vague. The time he was held should be explicitly specified}} 

==Life==

===Early life===
Minor was born on the island of [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), the son of [[Congregational church|Congregationalist Church]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[New England]]. He had numerous half-siblings, among them [[Thomas T. Minor]], mayor of [[Seattle, Washington]].{{Sfn | Winchester | 1998 | p = 47}}  At 14 he was sent to the United States. He subsequently attended [[Yale University|Yale Medical School]], graduating with a degree and a specialization in comparative anatomy in 1863.

===Military career===
He was accepted by [[Medical_Corps_(United_States_Army)#19th_century|the Union Army as a surgeon]] and served at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in May 1864, which was notable for the terrible casualties suffered by both sides. Minor was also given the task of punishing an Irish soldier in the [[Union Army]] by [[human branding|branding]] him on the face with a ''D'' for "[[desertion|deserter]]"{{Sfn | Winchester | 1998 | loc = ch 3}} and his nationality later played a role in Minor's dementia delusions.{{Sfn | Winchester | 1998 | loc = ch 3}}

After the end of the [[American Civil War]], Minor saw duty in New York City.  He was strongly attracted to the [[red-light district]] of the city and devoted much of his off-duty time to going with prostitutes. By 1867, his behavior had come to the attention of the Army and he was transferred to a remote post in the [[Florida Panhandle]]. By 1868, his condition had progressed to the point that he was admitted to [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]], a [[lunatic asylum]] (as [[mental hospital]]s were then called) in Washington, D.C.  After eighteen months he showed no improvement.

===Move to England===
In 1871 he went to London, settling in the slum of [[Lambeth]], where once again he took up a dissolute life. Haunted by his paranoia, he fatally shot a man named George Merrett, who Minor believed had broken into his room, on February 17, 1872. Merrett had been on his way to work to support his family of six children, himself, and his pregnant wife, Eliza. After a pre-trial period spent in London's [[Horsemonger Lane Gaol]], Minor was found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and incarcerated in [[Broadmoor Hospital|the asylum at Broadmoor]] in the village of [[Crowthorne]], Berkshire. As he had his [[Veteran's pension (United States)|US army pension]] and was not judged dangerous, he was given rather comfortable quarters and was able to buy and read books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | archivedate = 2010-04-17 | publisher = Institutions | url = http://www.institutions.org.uk/asylums/england/BRK/broadmoor_asylum.htm | title = Asylums | place = UK | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100417050639/http://www.institutions.org.uk/asylums/england/BRK/broadmoor_asylum.htm | contribution = Broadmoor Asylum}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091128021718/http://www.berkshirerecordoffice.org.uk/documents/William_Chester_Minor.pdf | archivedate = 2009-11-28 | url = http://www.berkshirerecordoffice.org.uk/documents/William_Chester_Minor.pdf | type = biography | contribution = William Chester Minor | publisher = Record office | place = Berkshire, UK | format = [[PDF]] | title = Documents}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributor to ''Oxford English Dictionary''===
{{Main|Oxford English Dictionary#Early editors}}
It was probably through his correspondence with the London booksellers that he heard of the call for volunteers from what was to become the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED). He devoted most of the remainder of his life to that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://oed.com/public/contrib/contributors#minor | contribution = William Chester Minor | title = Contributors | publisher = Oxford English Dictionary}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the project's most effective volunteers, reading through his large personal library of antiquarian books and compiling quotations that illustrated the way particular words were used. He was often visited by the widow of the man he had killed, and she provided him with further books.  The compilers of the dictionary published lists of words for which they wanted examples of usage. Minor provided these, with increasing ease as the lists grew. It was many years before the ''OED''{{'}}s editor, Dr. [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], learned Minor's background history, and visited him in January 1891.  In 1899 Murray paid compliment to Minor's enormous contributions to the dictionary, stating, "we could easily illustrate the last four centuries from his quotations alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary|author= Winchester, Simon|year=2004|page=201|publisher=[[OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Caught in the Web of Words: James A.H. Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary|author=Murray, Katharine Maud Elisabeth|year=2001|page=306|publisher=Yale University Press}} &lt;p&gt;In 1899 alone, Minor provided 12,000 quotations for the ''OED''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor's condition deteriorated and in 1902, due to delusions that he was being abducted nightly from his rooms and conveyed to places as far away as Istanbul, and forced to commit sexual assaults on children, he cut off his own penis ([[Penis removal|autopenectomy]]) using a knife he had employed in his work on the dictionary.&lt;ref name="forsyth"&gt;{{Citation| title = The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language | first = Mark | last = Forsyth |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His health continued to worsen, and after Murray campaigned on his behalf, Minor was released in 1910 on the orders of Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name="forsyth"/&gt; He was deported back to the United States and resided at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] where he was diagnosed with [[dementia praecox]]. He died in 1920 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], after being moved in 1919 to the Retreat for the Elderly Insane there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/dnb/66721.html |work=[[ODNB]]|title=Minor, William Chester|author= Winchester, Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The book ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]'' (published in America as ''The Professor and the Madman''), by [[Simon Winchester]], was published in 1998 and chronicles both Minor's later life and his contributions to the creation of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

The movie rights for the book were bought by [[Mel Gibson]]'s [[Icon Productions]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="nyt_gussow"&gt;

'''Wine labels''' are important sources of information for consumers since they tell the type and origin of the wine. The [[label]] is often the only resource a buyer has for evaluating the [[wine]] before purchasing it. Certain information is ordinarily included in the wine label, such as the country of origin, quality, type of wine, alcoholic degree, producer, bottler, or importer.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"&gt;George, Rosemary, ''The Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Wine Label Decoder'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these national labeling requirements producers may include their web site address and a  [[QR Code]] with vintage specific information.

==Information provided==
[[File:Scratch and Sniff Wine Label.jpg|right|thumb|A wine label for a wine from Vouvray with a [[scratch and sniff]] sticker affixed to draw the consumer's attention.]]

===Label design===
Some wineries place great importance on the label design while others do not. There are wineries that have not changed their label's design in over 60 years, as in the case of [[Château Simone]], while others hire designers every year to change it. Labels may include images of works by [[Picasso]], [[Chagall]], and other artists, and these may be collector's pieces.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; The elegance of the label does not determine the wine's quality. Instead, it is the information contained within the label that can provide consumers with such knowledge.

Most New World consumers, and increasingly European consumers, prefer to purchase wine with varietal labels and/or with brand name labels. A recent study of younger wine drinkers in the U.S. found that they perceived labels with châteaux on them to be stuffy or old-fashioned. Producers often attempt to make selecting and purchasing wine easy and non-intimidating by making their labels playful and inviting.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Paul. Labels gone wild. ''Wine Enthusiast'', 2006 (March), ''19(3)'', 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial success of New World wine attributed to striking label designs has led some European producers to follow suit, as in the case of the redesign of [[Mouton Cadet]].&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite web|last= Benady |first= David, ''Design Week'' |title= Wine label branding off the shelf |url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/Articles/137951/Wine+label+branding+off+the+shelf.html |date= March 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences by country===
[[File:New York sparkling wine.jpg|left|thumb|Sparkling wine from New York with a semi-generic usage of "Brut American champagne."]]
Wine classification systems differ by country. Wines can be classified by region and area only. For example, there are 151 châteaux in [[Bordeaux]] with "Figeac" and 22 estates in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] with "Corton" on their labels. In Burgundy, there are 110 appellations in an area only one-fifth the size of Bordeaux. Complicating the system is the fact that it is common for villages to append the name of their most famous vineyard to that of the village.

In [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], the authenticity of the wine is guaranteed by a seal on the label or a band over the cork under the capsule.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; This is promulgated by the growers' association in each area.

[[German Wine Label|German wine labels]] are particularly noted for the detail that they can provide in determining quality and style of the wine.

Almost every New World wine is labelled by grape variety and geographic origin. [[Semi-generic]] designations were once quite common in countries such as Australia and the US, but the wine authorities in areas such as [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] have not been afraid to bring lawsuits against the use of their names outside their region, and semi-generic names are falling out of use.

Wines whose label does not indicate the name of the winery or the winemaker are referred to as "[[cleanskin (wine)|cleanskin]]" wine, particularly in [[Australia]].

Degree of sweetness information is particularly inconsistent, with some countries' manufacturers always indicating it in standardized fashion in their language (brut, dolce, etc.), some traditionally not mentioning it at all or referring to it informally and vaguely in a rear-label description, and yet other countries' regulators requiring such information to be included (commonly on a secondary label) even when such information has to be added by the importer. In certain cases of conflicting regulations, a wine may, for example, even be labelled "sweet" by a manufacturer, but also "semi-sweet" (as per a different law) in the local language translation on a supplementary label mandated by the jurisdiction where it is sold.

===Importance of labels in different types of wine===
The information contained in labels is important to determine the quality of the wine. For example, great importance needs to be attached to [[vintage]] dates when there are differences in climate.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; The taste and quality of the wine can change from year to year depending on the climate. Knowing the vintage is specially important when buying fine wines because the quality of the wine can vary from year to year due to climatic differences. The quickest way to determine the quality of the year is to use a [[wine chart]].&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt;

Vintage dates may not be important, for example, there are no vintage dates on bottles of [[sherry]].
On the other hand, wines may or may not have vintages. [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] is usually a blend from more than one year and only sometimes sold as a vintage wine. Also, [[Port wine|Port]] is only sold with a vintage in years of exceptional quality.

===Bottler and importer information===
A wine label may include the producer, the bottler and the merchant's names. The bottler's name must always be included in the label. The importer's name must be included in the label only for countries outside the [[Common Market]]. While it is not necessary for a wine to be bottled at its place of origin, it is obligatory for classed growth claret and vintage port to be bottled in [[Bordeaux]] and [[Oporto]].&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; Also, bottling of [[Alsace]] must be done within the [[appellation]].&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; Thus, it is important to look for terms such as ''mis en bouteille au château'' or ''mis au domaine'' because they tell you the wine is estate bottled.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt;

===Misleading information===
[[File:Blanc de noirs cremant.jpg|left|thumb|A ''blanc de noir'' sparkling wine made from the red Pinot noir and Gamay grapes.]]
Labels may include terms that may be perceived as misleading. The term ''[[Champagne (wine)#Blanc de blancs|Blanc de blancs]]'' may be included in a label. This term means "white wine made from white grapes". The fact is that white wines are predominantly made from white grapes, with the exception of many [[sparkling wines]], the common use of the red [[Pinot noir]] in Champagne wines being a typical example.

Although the word ''château'' is most associated with [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], it does not mean that the wine ''does'' come from Bordeaux, and there may not be any kind of building – let alone a château – associated with the vineyard. The name château can even be included in wines from Australia or California. Labels of [[Vin de pays]] never include the word château.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt;

''[[Cru (wine)|Cru]]'', a word used to classify wines can mean different things. For example, in the [[Médoc]] part of Bordeaux, this terms means the château is one of the classified growths in the regions. In [[Saint-Émilion AOC|Saint-Émilion]], the term ''cru'' is of little importance because it bears little relation to quality. For [[Provence]] the term ''cru classé'' is included only for historical reasons. On the other hand, the use of the term ''cru'' in [[Swiss wine|Switzerland]] has no foundation and it is included at the producer's discretion.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt;

===Accessibility===

To better reach the market of [[blindness|blind]] or sight-impaired wine consumers, labels have appeared printed in [[Braille]]. Currently{{when?|date=January 2018}} the only known winemaker to print all their labels in Braille is [[Chapoutier]] winery in France, who began the practice in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Karen Meyer |title=Braille wine labels | date=2008-05-01 |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/disability_issues&amp;id=6113514 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wineries in a number of countries have followed Chapoutier's lead and have braille available on at least some of their bottles.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100387.html Washington Post – Vintners Who Share a Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neck and back labels==
Neck and/or back labels may appear on a bottle. The neck label may include the vintage date and the back label usually gives extra (and usually optional) information about the wine. Government required warnings are usually found in the back label, as well as [[Universal Product Code|UPC]]s. For example, the United States requires alcoholic beverages to include a warning regarding the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The label also has to mention the possibility of a reduced ability to drive while intoxicated. Wine labels in the US must also disclose that the wine contains [[sulfites]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Wine laws==
There are different reasons for wine laws. Labelling regulations can be intended to prevent wine from sounding better than it is.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; Also, it is illegal to say that a wine is made from one grape when it is actually from another.

The label must also include the name and address of the bottler of the wine. If the producer is not the bottler, the bottle will say that the wine was bottled by X bottled for Y producer.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; Table wines may carry the name of the bottler and the postal code. The label must also include the country of origin.

The size of the font is also regulated for mandatory information. Alcohol content must be included in the label, with some jurisdictions also requiring brief nutritional data, such as caloric value, carbohydrate/sugar content, etc. In Australia and the United States a wine label must also mention that it has [[sulfites]] in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttb.gov/pdf/grape_wine_labels0706%20.pdf Wine Label Regulations] summary from the US Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations may permit table wines to be labelled with only the colour and flavour, and no indication of quality.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; The use of words such as [[Cuvée]] and [[grand vin]] in labels is controlled.&lt;ref name="Wine Label decoder"/&gt; As mentioned above, a [[vin de pays]] must never be from a château, but from a [[domaine]].

=== Allergen warnings ===
[[New Zealand]] and [[Australia|Australian]] labelling regulations have required an [[allergen]] warning to appear on wine labels since 2002 due to the use of [[egg whites]], [[milk]], and [[isinglass]]&lt;ref&gt;Food Standards Australian and New Zealand (2004) [http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/factsheets/industryfactsheetsfsc/wineandthelabellingo2558.cfm Wine and the labelling of certain substances that may cause adverse reactions]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[fining (wine)|fining]] and [[clarifying (wine)|clarifying]] of the wine. The United States is considering similar requirements. [[Winemakers]] in the US have been resistant to this requirement because the decision to put a wine through a fining process normally occurs after the labels have been ordered, which could lead to allergen warnings on wines that have had no exposure to allergens.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sogg ''Wine Producers Struggle With Proposal to Require Allergen Warnings'' ''Wine Spectator'' p. 22, 31 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Wine labels from the member states of the European Union must also disclose after 30 June 2012 that the wine was treated with casein and ovalbumin, derived from milk and egg respectively, used as fining agents in the winemaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:347:0027:0028:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EU) No 1266/2010] of 22 December 2010 amending Directive 2007/68/EC as regards labelling requirements for wines&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting ==
[[File:1912er Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|Historical wine label]]
'''Paper wine labels''' have long been collected. This can turn into a full-fledged hobby, with collections organized by theme, country, or region. For others, saving labels may be part of maintaining a wine tasting-notes journal, or just simply to remember a particular wine.  '''Wine labels''', or '''Bottle Tickets''', are also an area of interest to collectors. The Wine Label Circle [http://www.winelabelcircle.org] was formed in 1952. These objects of silver, mother-of-pearl, ivory or enamel were, in the 18th and 19th centuries, used to identify the contents of the decanter or bottle on which they were hung, the contents of which may have included in addition to wines and spirits, sauces, condiments, flavourings, perfumes, toilet waters, medicines, inks, soft drinks, preserves and cordials &lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Wine-Label, N. M. Penzer, 1947, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wine Labels 1730–2003 A Worldwide History'', Ed Dr John Salter, 2004, London&lt;/ref&gt;

While labels were once easily steamed off, recent automatic bottling and labeling processes at wineries have led to the use of stronger glues. Removing these labels is often difficult and may result in considerable damage to the label. A recent, though by no means universal, innovation to bypass this problem is the use of bottles that come with the ability to tear off a small part of the label in order to remind the drinker of the name and bearing of the wine.

If full label removal is desired, a common approach involves putting hot water inside the bottle which makes the hold of the glue weaker. A knife can then be used to remove the label from one side by lifting it off with even pressure.

Commercial label removal kits apply a strong, transparent sticker over the label surface. The goal is to carefully pull off the sticker and literally tear the front design of the label away from the glued back. In practice, varying degrees of success are encountered and extensive damage to the label can occur.

'''''Writing Drama''''' (French: La dramaturgie) is a treatise by French writer and filmmaker [[Yves Lavandier]], originally published in 1994, revised in 1997, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2014. The English version was translated from the French by Bernard Besserglik and published in 2005. The book exists also in Italian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audinoeditore.it/libro.php?collana_id=M&amp;collana_progr=20 L'ABC della drammaturgia]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL3355446M/dramaturgia La dramaturgia]&lt;/ref&gt; and Portuguese.

==Content==

''Writing Drama'' explores the mechanisms of dramatic story telling. The author makes a clear distinction between what is written to be seen and/or heard ([[theater]], [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[opera]] and to a lesser extent [[comic books]]) and what is written to be read ([[literature]]).

The book's principle is the same as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']]. [[Yves Lavandier]] examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights ([[Samuel Beckett]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Hergé]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Molière]], [[Dino Risi]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Sophocles]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Billy Wilder]], etc.) in order to answer three questions:
* what do dramatic works consist of?
* why is this so?
* how does one go about writing them?

The author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by [[Molière]], ''[[The School for Wives]]'', and a film directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''[[North by Northwest]]'', are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc.

In the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him:
*Drama preexists theater and film. Life being full of conflicts and ruled by causality, one can say that life is aristotelian.
*The art of narrative can be taught, like every other human activity.
*It takes two to speak the language of drama: writer and receiver. This is why [[dramatic irony]]—which consists in giving the audience an item of information that at least one of the characters is unaware of—is a fundamental mechanism, omnipresent in all genres (tragedy, comedy, melodrama, suspense, thriller, etc.) and all types of narratives.
*All the great storytellers know the rules of narration, at least unconsciously.
*One can respect the rules and take the spectator into account while keeping one’s liberty and authenticity.
*Rules are called “recipes” by those who fear or despise them.
*Drama should not be placed in the same basket as literature, [[Molière]] and [[William Shakespeare]] beside [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Franz Kafka]].
*Dialogue, in theater or radio, is the visible part of the iceberg. Even in radio, structure and characterisation are paramount.
*Theater is, as well as film, an art of the image.
*To write a good story, three things are needed: conflict, conflict and conflict.
*The spectacular and the sensational are cheap ways to generate emotion and often mingle with voyeurism and omnipotence.
*When an actor is brilliant, he of course deserves all the plaudits he gets. But praise is also due to the director who directed him as well as to the writer who created his role in the first place.
*The most powerful language of drama is structure, far before dialogue.
*Nonetheless, dialogue is inevitable when one tells a human story, even in silent movies where dialogues were numerous, either written on intertitles or guessed by the audience.
*The three-act structure (dramatic acts, not logistical ones) relies simply on a universal triad: before-during-after. One can find the three-act structure in the vast majority of dramatic works, including in a narrative as deconstructed as ''[[21 Grams]]''.
*Suspense should not be mistaken with mystery, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with [[Agatha Christie]].
*Comedy is a noble, useful and difficult treatment. Its lightness is only an appearance, a politeness.
*As the mockery of human limitations, comedy may be disparaging but also demanding or compassionate.
*The basics of narrative are the pattern of a fractal structure.
*TV series are highly respectable and can produce masterpieces of human art such as ''[[The Sopranos]]''.
*Children need good drama. To write for children is a wonderful school of narration.
*Writers of drama will always be indispensable and keep on responding to a triple human need of emotion, meaning and distraction.

''Writing Drama'' is considered a reference textbook amongst European playwrights and scriptwriters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/comments.htm What the professionals say about Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacques Audiard]], ''Writing Drama'' is on par with [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. [[Francis Veber]] said it is "the most thorough and challenging work of its kind to come out since the birth of scriptwriting". In 2006, [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] called Yves Lavandier the "living god of screenwriters".
