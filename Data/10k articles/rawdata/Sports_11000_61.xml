The '''[[1912–13 NHA season|1912–13]] [[Toronto Blueshirts|Toronto Hockey Club]] season''' was the first season of the Toronto franchise in the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA).

==Team business==
Operation of the ice-making equipment at the new Arena Gardens was delayed a week when the pipes had to be relaid. Local pipefitters, unfamiliar with ice-making equipment, had  installed the pipes improperly, and W. H. Magee of New York, advisor to the Arena, ordered the pipes removed and reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 3, 1912 |title=Rowing Club are to join junior hockey ranks |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 8, 1912 |title=Arena to be ready Monday |page=Sports p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off-season==
The Torontos' manager Bruce Ridpath built the team from new prospects, rather than signing established professionals, like the Tecumsehs, the other Toronto NHA club. Ridpath signed [[Scotty Davidson]], who had been playing in Calgary; [[Frank Foyston]] of the Toronto Eatons, [[Roy McGiffin]] of the Simcoes, [[Cully Wilson]] of Winnipeg, and [[Harry Cameron]] and [[Frank Nighbor]] of [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]. Only [[Archie McLean (ice hockey)|Archie McLean]] from the PCHA, had previous big-league experience.{{sfn|Harper|2013|pp=239–240}}

==Regular season==
[[Cully Wilson]] scored the first-ever goal for the Torontos, in their opening night 9–5 loss to the Canadiens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=December 26, 1912 |page=4 |title=Torontos Beaten By Canadiens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team started the season poorly under the coaching of Ridpath, but Ridpath signed [[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]], the former star of the [[Montreal Wanderers]] as coach. The team continued to struggle until Marshall decided to become a playing coach with the team. His veteran presence helped the Blueshirts to win some games, eventually finishing third in the standings.

The '''John A. Alario, Sr. Event Center''', commonly shortened as the '''Alario Center''', is a 2,400-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Westwego, Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The History of the Alario Center|publisher=alariocenter.com|url=http://www.alariocenter.com/about/history/|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was approved for construction in 1993, and opened in 1999. The arena was most notably used as the practice facility for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[New Orleans Pelicans]] (formerly Hornets) from 2002 to 2013.  The Alario Center features six hardwood courts under one roof.

The Alario Center also hosts many annual sports events including AAU Boys Basketball tournaments, boxing matches, cheerleading/dance competitions, wrestling, professional wrestling, gymnastics meets and volleyball tournaments.  There are also many non-sports events that are annually held at the Alario Center including the FIRST Robotics Bayou Regional, the Governor's West Bank Luncheon, concerts, college graduation ceremonies and numerous sales &amp; expos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alario Center|publisher=experiencejefferson.com|url=http://www.experiencejefferson.com/listings/?action=display&amp;listingID=335|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jefferson Convention and Visitors Bureau Sports Guide|publisher=visitjeffersonparish.com|url=https://www.visitjeffersonparish.com/sites/default/files/JCVB_Sport_Guide.pdf|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2014, the venue hosted [[Supercard of Honor VIII]], a [[professional wrestling]] event promoted by national wrestling promotion [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH).

Because of the Center's size and location in [[Jefferson Parish]], many parish schools hold events there, including graduations. One such school is [[Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Academy]].

The Bayou Segnette Sports complex, which the Alario Center is part of also includes '''[[Segnette Field]]''', a baseball stadium that is the home of the [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University New Orleans']] Wolfpack baseball program.

The Alario Center is named for the father of [[John Alario|John A. Alario, Jr.]], the dean of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]].

==Greyhound racing==
Albert Park had a short lived greyhound track around the pitch from 13 May 1989 until 1999. The track was a fairly tight circuit, heavily banked and raced over 270, 450 and 630 yards. The greyhound operation closed amidst controversy after a track manager was convicted of animal cruelty after using hares as live bait. Greyhound racing's governing body the [[Greyhound Board of Great Britain]] (GBGB) were unable to impose any punishment because the track chose to be independent and was not affiliated to the GBGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =207|year=1991|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-61-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''athletic union''' or '''athletics union''' (AU) usually refers to the group of student [[sports clubs]] within a [[university]] or other institute of [[higher education]], in the [[United Kingdom]].

==General information==
Sports clubs affiliate to their athletic union for support and finance. If a sports club is not part of the athletic union then it is probably not an official or recognized club of the institution.

Each athletic union is often run and supported by the institute's [[students' union]], but are sometimes operated by the institute itself or semi-autonomous from either the students' union or the university. Athletic unions can (and most do) affiliate to [[British Universities and Colleges Sport]] (BUCS).

In a typical structure, members of sports clubs automatically become members of the athletic union with all the benefits of the membership (including insurance and social aspects) included. Individual students who compete in individual sports, where no club exists in their chosen activity, can also join the athletic union.

Officers of the sports clubs generally become ''[[ex officio]]'' members of the AU standing committee and this committee typically elects an AU chair and vice-chair. The AU president (sometimes called sports officer or activities officer) is usually elected from the wider [[student body]] as part of [[executive (government)|executive committee]] elections.

Many athletic unions employ a person (or persons) to work alongside the AU president in support of the sports clubs, and to keep a continuity from year to year within the athletic union.

'''Botafogo Basketball''', is the men's professional basketball team of the major [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas]] that is based in [[Botafogo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.

==History==
Basketball plays a major important role in the club's history. It was on a basketball game in 1942 between the rowing and the football club of the Botafogo neighbourhood (Club de Regatas Botafogo and Botafogo Football Club, respectively) when, during the match just after halftime, Armando Albano,  a player from the football side, died on the court after suffering a heart attack. In his honor, the president of each side decided to merge their clubs to become the [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas]], with a new flag and a new crest, mixing both club's originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botafogo.com.br/basquete.php?cat=esportes|title=Basquete|publisher=Botafogo FR|date=  |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, Botafogo won many titles of the state championship, including the three-peat in 1943, 1944 and 1945.

Botafogo won the [[Taça Brasil de Basquete|Brazilian League]] championship in 1967, becoming the first and only club from Rio to do it until 2000. They also competed at [[1968 Intercontinental Cup (basketball)|the 1968 edition]] of the [[Intercontinental Cup (basketball)|Intercontinental Cup]].

At the beginning of the 2000s, clubs' basketball department became amateur, only backing to professional ways in 2015. At the 2017 season, Botafogo played at [[Liga Ouro]], the second tier of Brazilian basketball. The club finished the regular season at the first position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnb.com.br/noticias/alerta-e-alivio/|title=Alerta e Alivio|publisher=Liga Nacional de Basquete|date=2 June 2017  |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to win the title after beating [[Blumenau Basketball]] at the playoffs and then, winning the finals after beating [[Joinville]] at the 5th and decisive game at home by 90-68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnb.com.br/noticias/botafogo-campeao/|title=Botafogo Campeão|publisher=Liga Nacional de Basquete|date=30 June 2017  |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's main star Jamaal Smith was elected the Finals MVP after a great performance during the series.

At women's basketball, Botafogo is the biggest winner of the state's championship with seven titles: 1955, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1995 and 2006.

'''Broomball Australia''' is the national governing body for the ice sport of [[broomball]] in [[Australia]].  It was incorporated in October 2004 after a number of years unofficially operating under other varied names, such as the ''Australian Broomball Association''.  Broomball Australia is a member of the [[International Federation of Broomball Associations]] (IFBA).

As of 2006 Broomball Australia has four full members and one associate member.  Full members are granted full voting rights within the association with two delegates appointed to the ''National Council'', the decision-making arm of the body.  Associate members are officially recognised by Broomball Australia, but do not have any voting rights.

The current members are:
* [[Australian Capital Territory Broomball Association]] (ACTBA) (full member)
* [[Broomball Association of South Australia]] (BASA) (full member)
* [[North Queensland Broomball Association]] (NQBA) (full member)
* [[New South Wales Broomball Association]] (NSWBA) (full member)
* [[Coffs Harbour Ice Broomball Club]] (associate member)

According to its [http://www.broomballaustralia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=43#Purpose official website], Broomball Australia's purpose: &lt;blockquote&gt;is to develop and promote the sport of broomball in Australia to gain acceptance, recognition and support in the wider sporting community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Organisation of Broomball Australia ==
Broomball Australia is run by the National Council, which is made up of two voting members from each full member association.  All motions are passed through, and debated and actioned by votes from the National Council.

From the National Council, an Executive Committee is elected to run the day-to-day operations of the organisation.  One delegate from each full member association is elected to the Executive Committee in one of the following positions: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer.  Delegates are elected for a term of one year at the [[Annual General Meeting]] of Broomball Australia.

== National Championships ==
Broomball Australia sanctions the [[Australian National Broomball Championships]], an annual tournament to determine Australia's national broomball champions.

The '''City Stadium, Norwich''' was a [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] stadium in Sprowston Road, [[Norwich]].

==Origins==
The stadium was built in 1939 north of the centre of Norwich but south of the junction between Sprowston Road and Mousehold Lane and there was a large wood known as Mousehold Heath to the south. The main catchment area was the densely populated housing estate of Sprowston directly to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/624083/310986/12/100954|title=OS Plan 1956|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was the fourth greyhound track to have brought greyhound racing to the city of Norwich following on from [[The Firs Stadium]], [[Boundary Park Stadium]] and [[Thorpe Greyhound Track]].&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening==
Despite the advent of the [[World War II|second World War]] the large City Stadium opened for business on 25 July 1939. The meeting attracted a crowd of nearly ten thousand and was hailed as a great success by the management. It was declared open by Mr B Cannell, Mr F.Pine, Mr George Attoe, Mr A Holder (Director of Racing) and Mr J H Thornton (publicity manager) and the all-electric [[Tote board|totalisator]] was used. The first ever winner was a greyhound called Grangemore Lad trained by Nicholson winning by four lengths at 5-2.&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The track characteristics were described as a very handy and sharp little track, 322 yards in circumference (the smallest in Britain) with bends that are well banked and perfect going was ensured throughout the year with the aid of an automatic watering system.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;

Distances were 400, 555 and 715 yards with an 'Inside McWhirter Trackless' hare system and ray timing and photo finish were also installed. The home straight contained the main grandstand and club with hare control and judges box opposite the winning post. The members club was a spacious modern club room with fully licensed bar and buffet. Subscription was £1, 1 shilling per annum. There were two entrances and car parks, one opposite the main stand on the other side of the track and one between bends three and four. The racing kennels could be found on the fourth bend but the 200 resident kennels were situated on the first bend with the exercising paddocks extending from the kennels to right around the second bend.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt;

Following the closure of Boundary Park in 1962 the Racing Manager (RM) Arthur Rising joined the City Stadium with the existing RM Mr D.Pine becoming General Manager and Director of Racing. Track trainers at the same time were Speechley and Ashley and distances changed to 333, 400 and 555 yards. Racing was held on Tuesday and Saturday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
The end of the stadium came about as a huge shock, the advance runners list had been advertised for Tuesday 10 August 1971 but the public were informed that the forthcoming Tuesday night racing had been cancelled and the stadium would close with immediate effect. Therefore, the last meeting had been the previous one held on Saturday 7 August 1971. The site had been sold and was soon redeveloped into housing.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;

As a student growing up in [[South Los Angeles]], Bailey was known as a jokester. He held various jobs after dropping out of [[community college]].&lt;ref name=streeter_06202018/&gt; In 1984, he was fired from his job and told by his boss that he would "never amount to anything".

'''Floyd Casey Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Waco, Texas]]. The stadium was used for 64 seasons before being replaced by McLane Stadium in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.baylor.edu/hesabaylorhistoryproject/finance-at-baylor-1951-1960/before-floyd-casey-the-backing-of-baylor-stadium-at-the-dawn-of-televised-football/|title=BEFORE FLOYD CASEY: THE BACKING OF BAYLOR STADIUM AT THE DAWN OF TELEVISED FOOTBALL|last=Ericksen|first=|date=2016|website=wacotrib.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was primarily used for [[American football|football]], and was the home field of the [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor Bears]]. The stadium, located about four miles from the [[Baylor University]] campus, cost $1.8 million to build and sat 50,000 people. Originally named '''Baylor Stadium''', it opened in 1950 with a Baylor game against the [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]]. On December 7, 2013, Baylor played its last game in the stadium, against the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]], where the attendance record of 51,728 was established.&lt;ref name="scores.espn.go.com"&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=333410239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baylorbears.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baylorbears.com/facilities/casey.html|title=BaylorBears.com - Facilities|publisher=BaylorBears.com|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baylor won 19 of its final 20 games played at the stadium.

Originally known as Baylor Stadium, the stadium was renamed at halftime of the November 5, 1988 homecoming game when it was renamed for Floyd Casey by his son, university trustee and longtime booster Carl B. Casey of Dallas, who gave [[US$]]5 million towards an $8 million stadium renovation project.

The stadium was renovated several times. Turf was first introduced to the stadium in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://digitalcollections.baylor.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/tx-photos/id/5140/rec/4|title=Baylor Photography|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Then in 1998, the stadium installed SportGrass, a leading artificial grass surface. In 2005, it underwent massive renovations to extend the Grant Teaff Plaza in honor of former head coach [[Grant Teaff]]. The extended plaza created much-needed updates to the stadium's façade.

The stadium was an elongated oval shape, running southeast-northwest, with large grandstands on the sidelines.  The south end zone was cleared, with athletic marks painted on the ground and the large LED scoreboard behind it. (Prior to the creation of the current athletic marks, the area was painted gold, with "BAYLOR" painted in large green block letters.)  In 2004, a large [[tarpaulin|tarp]] was installed that covered the south end zone and could be removed when ticket demand necessitated it.  With the tarp in place [[seating capacity]] was reduced to 47,000. The north end zone had seating in front of the Carl &amp; Thelma Casey Athletic Center, site of the football offices, training facilities, and stadium field house.

Prior to the building of the stadium, the Baylor football team played at [[Carroll Field]], an on-campus field last used in 1935, and Waco's [[Municipal Stadium (Waco)|Municipal Stadium]] on Dutton Avenue.

In the spring of 2012, Baylor regents approved a [[McLane Stadium|new on-campus stadium]] to be built on the [[Brazos River]] adjacent to [[Interstate 35]].

The demolition of the stadium was completed on May 14, 2016.

'''Football''' is a family of [[team sport]]s that involve, to varying degrees, [[Kick (football)|kicking]] a [[Football (ball)|ball]] to score a [[Goal (sport)|goal]].  Unqualified, [[Football (word)|the word ''football'']] is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called ''football'' in certain places include [[association football]] (known as soccer in some countries); [[gridiron football]] (specifically [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]]); [[Australian rules football]]; [[rugby football]] (either [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]]); and [[Gaelic football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Thomas |last2=Gilbourne |first2=D. |title=Science and football: a review of applied research in the football code |journal=Journal of Sports Science |year=2003 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=693–705 |doi=10.1080/0264041031000102105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11272089 |title=Editorial: Soccer – or should we say football – must change |date=12 June 2014 |quote=New Zealanders on the way to their local rugby grounds should still be talking of "going to the football"}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different variations of football are known as '''football codes'''.

== Common elements ==
[[File:Men kicking footballs.webm|alt=Men kicking footballs|thumb|upright=1.25|Men kicking footballs]]
The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: ''carrying'' codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and ''kicking'' codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.  &lt;ref name="Douge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Douge |first=Brian |title=Science and Football |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-415-50911-4 |pages=3–19 |edition=Second |chapter=Football: the common threads between the games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDBicFbsioC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common rules among the sports include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Law 1: The Field of Play - Football Rules &amp; Governance {{!}} The FA|url = http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-1---the-field-of-play|website = www.thefa.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27|first = The Football|last = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two ''teams'' of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
* A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
* ''[[Score (sport)|Scoring]]'' ''[[goal (sport)|goals]]'' or ''points'' by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
* Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two ''[[goalposts]]''.
* The goal or line being ''defended'' by the opposing team.
* Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball.
* Players using only their body to move the ball.

In all codes, common skills include [[Passing (sports)|passing]], [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]], evasion of tackles, catching and [[Kick (football)|kicking]].&lt;ref name="Douge" /&gt; In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players ''[[Offside (sport)|offside]]'', and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a ''[[Goal (sport)|crossbar]]'' between the goalposts.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Football (word)}}
There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".  It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=Etymology Online |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in [[medieval Europe]], which were played ''on foot''. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

A Chinese game called ''[[cuju]]''&lt;!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--&gt; (蹴鞠) has been recognised by [[FIFA]] as the first version of the game with regular rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/the-game/index.html |title=History of Football - The Origins - FIFA.com |first= |last=FIFA.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It existed during the [[Han dynasty]] and possibly the [[Qin dynasty]], in the second and third centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giossos |first1=Yiannis |last2=Sotiropoulos |first2=Aristomenis |last3=Souglis |first3=Athanasios |last4=Dafopoulou |first4=Georgia |title=Reconsidering on the Early Types of Football |journal=Baltic Journal of Health and Physical Activity |date=1 January 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2  |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bjha.2011.3.issue-2/v10131-011-0013-5/v10131-011-0013-5.pdf |doi=10.2478/v10131-011-0013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese version of ''cuju'' is ''[[kemari]]'' (蹴鞠), and was developed during the [[Asuka period]].&lt;ref name="hawaii"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese sports: a history |author=Allen Guttmann, Lee Austin Thompson |year=2001 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location= |isbn=9780824824648 |pages=26–27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbOau1trIMMC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=kemari#v=onepage&amp;q=kemari&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in [[Kyoto]] from about 600&amp;nbsp;AD. In ''kemari'' several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like [[keepie uppie]]). 

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game ''[[harpastum]]'' is believed to have been adapted from a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (''[[Episkyros]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29pi%2Fskuros ἐπίσκυρος],

There are a number of references to traditional, [[ancient]], or [[prehistoric]] ball games, played by [[indigenous peoples]] in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], went ashore to play a form of football with [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) people in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hakluyt, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012191427/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html |date=October 12, 2008 }}, ''[[University of Adelaide]]'', December 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called ''Aqsaqtuk''. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, [[William Strachey]], a colonist at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] recorded a game played by Native Americans, called ''Pahsaheman''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On the [[Australian continent]] several tribes of [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as ''[[Marn Grook]]'' ([[Djab Wurrung]] for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an [[anecdote]] from the 1878 book by [[Robert Brough-Smyth]], ''The Aborigines of Victoria'', in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in [[Victoria, Australia]], that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that ''Marn Grook'' was one of the [[Origins of Australian football|origins of]] [[Australian rules football]].

The [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand played a game called [[Ki-o-rahi]] consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Games played in Mesoamerica]] with rubber balls by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to [[basketball]] or [[volleyball]], and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the [[Iroquois]] Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, [[lacrosse]] (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

[[File:Mobfooty.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of so-called "[[mob football]]"]]

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "[[mob football]]", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash ''en masse'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder&lt;ref name="sportmatters"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=88 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=William |title=Sports in the Western World |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1988 |page=48 |isbn=978-0-252-06042-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,&lt;ref name="sportmatters" /&gt; and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).

The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by [[William FitzStephen]] in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of [[Shrove Tuesday]]:
{{quote|After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Alsford, [http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html#p25 FitzStephen's Description of London], ''Florilegium Urbanum'', April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at [[Ulgham]], Northumberland, England:  "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".&lt;ref name=Magoun&gt;Francis Peabody Magoun, 1929, "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature" (''The American Historical Review'', v. 35, No. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at [[Newcastle, County Down]] being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |title=Irish inventions: fact and fiction |publisher=Carlow-nationalist.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729154246/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at [[Shouldham]], Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".&lt;ref name="Magoun"/&gt;

In 1314, [[Nicholas de Farndone]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [''rageries de grosses pelotes de pee'']&lt;ref&gt;Derek Birley (Sport and The Making of Britain). 1993. Manchester University Press. p. 32. 978-0719037597&lt;/ref&gt; in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.

In 1363, King [[Edward III of England]] issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games",&lt;ref&gt;Derek Baker (England in the Later Middle Ages). 1995. Boydell &amp; Brewer. p. 187. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-648-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that "football" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
[[File:Football gravure 1750.jpg|thumb|France circa 1750]]
King [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), "football" |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Cawston, Nottinghamshire]]. This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of [[dribbling]]: "[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt;

Other firsts in the mediæval and [[early modern Europe|early modern]] eras:

* "a football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.&lt;ref name=Etymology/&gt; This reference is in Dame [[Juliana Berners]]' ''Book of [[St Albans]]''. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt;
* a pair of football boots were ordered by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1526.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1150460,00.html Vivek Chaudhary, "Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?"] (''[[The Guardian]]'', February 18, 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] in one of his poems: "[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."&lt;ref&gt;Anniina Jokinen, [http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm Sir Philip Sidney. "A Dialogue Between Two Shepherds"] (''Luminarium.org'', July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the first references to ''goals'' are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, [[John Norden]] and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] referred to "goals" in [[Cornish hurling]]. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=EBook of The Survey of Cornwall |last=Richard |first=Carew |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
* the first direct reference to ''scoring a goal'' is in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''[[The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[Camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".

=== Calcio Fiorentino ===

{{Main|Calcio Fiorentino}}
In the 16th century, the city of [[Florence]] celebrated the period between [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] and [[Lent]] by playing a game which today is known as "''calcio storico''" ("historic kickball") in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]]. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).

=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===
{{Main|Attempts to ban football games}}
There have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.&lt;ref name="Women Football and Europe"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9781841262253 |title=Women, Football and Europe: Histories, Equity and Experience | editor1-last = Magee | editor1-first= Jonathan |year=2007 |publisher=Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport | editor2-last = Caudwell | editor2-first= Jayne | editor3-last = Liston | editor3-first= Kate | editor4-last = Scraton | editor4-first= Sheila |series=International Football Institute Series |volume=1 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo2ZnpOQc7AC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the [[enclosure act]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

== Establishment of modern codes ==

=== English public schools ===
{{Main|English public school football games}}
While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between "kicking" and "running" (or "carrying") games first became clear.

The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde".&lt;ref&gt;A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach. Duckworth, 1899 {{ISBN|1-4446-5884-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Mulcaster]], a student at [[Eton College]] in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history8_18_3.asp |title=2003, "Richard Mulcaster" |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)". Mulcaster's "footeball" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.&lt;ref&gt;
Francis Peabody Magoun. (1938) History of football from the beginnings to 1871. p.27. Retrieved 2010-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1633, [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]], a teacher from [[Aberdeen]], mentioned elements of modern football games in a short [[Latin]] textbook called ''Vocabula.'' Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as "keeping goal" and makes an allusion to passing the ball ("strike it here"). There is a reference to "get hold of the ball", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players ("drive that man back").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Shared Origins of Football, Rugby, and Soccer |last=Rowley |first=Christopher |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9781442246195 |location= |pages=86 |via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBoCgAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s ''Book of Games'', written in about 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-io9DcBllkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;vq=football&amp;dq=willughby+book+of+sports |title=Francis Willughby, 1660–72, '&amp;#39;Book of Games'&amp;#39; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19 |isbn=978-1-85928-460-5 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willughby, who had studied at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: "a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals." His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"); scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a "law" of football: "they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For all the quotes in this paragraph}}

English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=Carosi&gt;[http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf Julian Carosi, 2006, "The History of Offside"]&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were "off their side" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.&lt;ref name=Carosi/&gt; The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 &lt;ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.&lt;ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/&gt;)

During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.

Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rugby School]] ]] [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game." in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding "Foot-Ball", as played at [[Scone, Scotland|]], Scotland:
:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it. ([http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html William Hone, 1825–26, ''The Every-Day Book'', "February 15."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html |date=January 5, 2008 }} Access date: March 15, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was ''running forward with it'' as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.

[[Railway Mania|The boom in rail transport in Britain]] during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host "home" school, and the other half by the visiting "away" school.

The ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).

Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. (7&amp;nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&amp;nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.

==== Clubs ====
{{Main|Oldest football clubs}}

Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example [[The Gymnastic Society|London's Gymnastic Society]] which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;THE SURREY CLUB Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, October 07, 1849; pg. 6. New Readerships&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Football: The First Hundred Years. The Untold Story. Adrian Harvey. 2005. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, during the period 1824–41.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nas.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp |title=The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland |publisher=Nas.gov.uk |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.&lt;ref name="Nas.gov.uk"/&gt;

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rugby chronology |work=Museum of Rugby |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&amp;sectionTitle=World+Rugby+Chronology |accessdate=April 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121094425/http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&amp;sectionTitle=World%2BRugby%2BChronology |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.

==== Competitions ====
{{Main|Oldest football competitions}}

One of the longest running football fixture is the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], contested between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of [[Australian rules football]], although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the [[Melbourne Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/australia/melbourne.htm |title=History of the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]], contested since 1878. The [[South Australian Football Association]] (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the [[Youdan Cup]] (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).   [[The Football League]] (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The [[England v Scotland (1870)|first ''ever'' international football match]] took place between sides representing England and Scotland on March 5, 1870 at [[the Oval]] under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871.

==== Modern balls ====
{{Main|Football (ball)}}

[[File:Richard Lindon (1816-1887).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Richard Lindon]] (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders.]] In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal [[urinary bladder|bladders]], more specifically [[Pig bladder|pig's bladders]], which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm#Early Soccer Ball World – Early History]. Retrieved June 9, 2006.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616030554/http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1851, [[Richard Lindon]] and [[William Gilbert (Rugby)|William Gilbert]], both shoemakers from the town of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London. Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.&lt;ref&gt;The exact name of Mr Lindon is in dispute, as well as the exact timing of the creation of the inflatable bladder. It is known that he created this for both association and rugby footballs. However, sites devoted to football indicate he was known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/ HJ Lindon], who was actually Richard Lindon's son, and created the ball in 1862 (ref: [http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm Soccer Ball World]), whereas rugby sites refer to him as [[Richard Lindon]] creating the ball in 1870 (ref: [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1699545,00.html Guardian article]). Both agree that his wife died when inflating pig's bladders. This information originated from web sites which may be unreliable, and the answer may only be found in researching books in central libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindon also won medals for the invention of the "Rubber inflatable Bladder" and the "Brass Hand Pump".

In 1855, the U.S. inventor [[Charles Goodyear]] – who had patented [[vulcanized rubber|vulcanised rubber]] – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris ''Exhibition Universelle'']]. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerballworld.com/Oldestball.htm soccerballworld.com, (no date) "Charles Goodyear's Soccer Ball"] Downloaded 30/11/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see [[truncated icosahedron]]) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]].

==== Modern ball passing tactics ====
{{Main|Passing (association football)}}

The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/scots_invented_beautiful_game_1_1121849 Scots invented beautiful game] The Scotsman, 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis Peabody (1938).  History of football from the beginnings to 1871.  Published by H. Pöppinghaus&lt;/ref&gt;

"Scientific" football is first recorded in 1839 from [[Lancashire]]&lt;ref&gt;Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, January 13, 1839. New Readerships&lt;/ref&gt; and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood's Magazine, Published by W.

=== Cambridge rules ===
{{Main|Cambridge rules}}
In 1848, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[H. de Winton and J. C. Thring|Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J. C. Thring]], who were both formerly at [[Shrewsbury School]], called a meeting at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the ''Cambridge rules''. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Football Association tribute to the Cambridge Rules |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/football-association-tribute-to-the-cambridge-rules |accessdate=5 January 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed ''when a player catches the ball directly from the foot'' entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from "loitering" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on [[the Football Association]] committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).

=== Sheffield rules ===
{{Main|Sheffield rules}}
By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], founded in 1857 in the English city of [[Sheffield]] by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.&lt;ref name="Football, the First Hundred Years"&gt;{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football, the First Hundred Years |year=2005 |pages=95–99 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-35019-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxoZ0S-GC7MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the club initially played its own code of football: the ''Sheffield rules''. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.

The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41–43 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the [[The Football Association|London]] and [[Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield]] FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.

There is archival evidence of "foot-ball" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].

In July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37 |accessdate=2006-07-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37 |archivedate=June 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web |title=The Origins of Australian Rules Football |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=36 |accessdate=2007-06-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104451/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=36 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of which was played on July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.

[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted "a game of our own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].

The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as "Victorian Rules" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.

During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.

At the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. --&gt;
X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Shortell. [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx  Hacking – a history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403122555/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx |date=2008-04-03 }}, [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx Cornwall Referees Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303044805/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx |date=March 3, 2008 }}, 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking is the true football". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term "soccer", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford "-er"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of "Association".&lt;ref name=OEDsoccer&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&amp;nbsp;yards (13.5&amp;nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.

=== Rugby football ===
{{Main|History of rugby union}}
[[File:Football London Ilustrated News.gif|thumb|A rugby scrum in 1871]]
In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also "rugby" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the [[try]], where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.

=== North American football codes ===
{{Main|History of American football|Canadian football#History}}

As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]] played a game called [[Old division football]], a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.&lt;ref name=ODF&gt;{{cite web |last=Meacham |first=Scott |title=Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) |publisher=dartmo.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained largely "[[mob football]]" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.&lt;ref name=PFRA1&gt;{{cite web |title=No Christian End! |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611173624/https://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while [[Harvard University]] followed suit in 1861.&lt;ref name=PFRA1/&gt; In its place, two general types of football evolved: "kicking" games and "running" (or "carrying") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "[[Boston Game|Boston game]]", was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]]. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name=PFRA1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Allaway |first=Roger |title=Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? |work=The USA Soccer History Archives |publisher=Dave Litterer |year=2001 |url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (then known as the College of New Jersey), [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] all began playing "kicking" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]].&lt;ref name=PFRA1/&gt;

In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto]] (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.&lt;ref name=1860s&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |title=Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501160230/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on [[rugby football]].&lt;ref name= 1860s/&gt; A "running game", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the [[Montreal Football Club]] in Canada in 1868.&lt;ref name=histfoot&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Football |work=The History of Sports |publisher=Saperecom |year=2007 |url=http://www.historyoffootball.net/ |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|the first game of American intercollegiate football]].&lt;ref name=PFRA1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1800s |work=Rutgers Through The Years |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |accessdate=2007-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120202924/http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |archivedate=2007-01-20 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern North American football grew out of a match between [[McGill University]] of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No Christian End!

On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] met at the [[Massasoit Convention]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], agreeing to adopt most of the [[Rugby Football Union]] rules, with some variations.&lt;ref name=PFRA2&gt;{{cite web |title=Camp and His Followers: American Football 1876–1889 |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qRx5vacY?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|left|Rutgers College Football Team, 1882]]
In 1880, Yale coach [[Walter Camp]], who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] with the ''[[line of scrimmage]]'' and the establishment of the ''[[Down (American and Canadian football)|down-and-distance]]'' rules.&lt;ref name=PFRA2/&gt; American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Tom |title=The Pro Style: The Complete Guide to Understanding National Football League Strategy |publisher=National Football League Properties, Inc., Creative Services Division |location=Los Angeles |year=1976 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tiny Maxwell and the Crisis of 1905: The Making of a Gridiron Myth |journal=College Football Historical Society |volume= |issue= |year=2001 |pages=54–57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808041801/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-date=2010-08-08 |authors=Watterson, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal [[forward pass]].

Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] adopted the [[Burnside rules]], which implemented the ''line of scrimmage'' and ''down-and-distance'' system from American football, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922201718/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df=}} History of the Grey Cup&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 CFL.ca History, Timeline, 1920] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625000000/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Canadian football [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|remain different codes]], stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.

=== Gaelic football ===
[[File:Croke Park from the hill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Football Final]] in [[Croke Park]], 2004.]]
{{Main|Gaelic football#History|l1=History of Gaelic football}}
In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as ''[[caid (sport)|caid]]'', remained popular in Ireland, especially in [[County Kerry]]. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic "cross-country game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.

By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which allowed tripping.

There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on February 7, 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).

===  Schism in Rugby football ===
[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:

Marshall: "Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!"

Miller: "Yes, that's just you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have a share in the spending of it."]]
{{Further|History of rugby league}}
The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.

In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.

The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better "spectator" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the "play-the-ball ruck", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the ''Northern Rugby League'', the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.

Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].

=== Globalisation of association football ===
{{Main|History of FIFA}}
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. Its first president was [[Robert Guérin]]. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.

=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].

During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].

With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&amp;nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.

The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.

In 1995, rugby union became an "open" game, that is one which allowed professional players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

== Use of the word "football" ==
{{details|Football (word)}}
The word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where one says it.
[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word "football" to encompass both association football and rugby]]
In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]). In [[francophone]] [[Quebec]], where [[Canadian football]] is more popular, the Canadian code is known as {{lang|fr|le football}} while American football is known as {{lang|fr|le football américain}} and association football is known as {{lang|fr|le soccer}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=34 |title=The governing body is the "Fédération de soccer du Québec" |publisher=Federation-soccer.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304192131/http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=34 |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 45 national [[FIFA]] (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use ''Football'' in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] use ''Soccer'' in their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently "normalised" to using "Football", including:
* [[Football Federation Australia|Australia's association football governing body]] changed its name in 2005 from using "soccer" to "football"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/Soccer-to-become-football-in-Australia/2004/12/16/1102787198357.html?from=more Stories Soccer to become football in Australia] (SMH.com.au.

The practice of '''[[futsal]]''' in Paraguay is very popular and is one of the most practiced sports in the country. The governing body for futsal in Paraguay is the [[Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol]] (Paraguayan football association), which controls the [[Paraguay national futsal team]] and is in charge of the organization of the [[Campeonato de Futsal de Paraguay]] (Paraguayan futsal tournament).

The Paraguayan futsal tournament is being held since 1987, declaring a champion every year. Since 1995  a new system consisting of two tournaments ([[Apertura]] and [[Clausura]]) was created, in which the national champion is declared by facing the winners of the Apertura and Clausura. Another tournament called "De Campeones" was also introduced. In 2004, a second division tournament was created to allow for more teams to compete.

At the national team level, Paraguay has won three [[FIFUSA/AMF Futsal World Cup|AMF Futsal World Cups]], a bronze medal at the [[Pan American Games]] and one [[South American Futsal Championship]].

The '''Highlander Challenge World Championships''' (or more simply the '''Highlander Challenge''' or '''Gododdin Highlander Challenge''') is a tournament that marries traditional [[Highland Games]] with more contemporary [[strength athletics]]. It was created to help reinvigorate Highland Games in Scotland by giving a modern and aspirational image while maintaining the tradition inherent in the history of the sport.

==History==
[[Highland Games]] has a long and distinguished history in Scotland. It was once claimed to be the biggest spectator sport in the country after football and as a format has been exported around the globe. In particular, it has been very successful in [[North America]]. However, in its native land some well informed commentators began to note that it was attracting small crowds, the format was deemed tired and the number of traditional heavy competitors was dwindling at once well attended gatherings.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/sport/headlines/display.var.2373901.0.History_lessons_with_highland_games_may_just_work_as_a_makeover.php Highland games to be spiced up with history lessons]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr Douglas Edmunds]], the co-founder of the [[World's Strongest Man]], but more pertinently a former world caber-tossing champion, determined to reinvigorate the sport in his native Scotland. Along with his son, [[Gregor Edmunds]] the 2007 winner of the [[World Highland Games Championships]], he set about organizing a new competition that would attract some of the top names from the world from such disciplines as [[Highland Games]], [[strength athletics]], [[powerlifting]] and [[field athletics]]. He said "Gimmicky strength events, like truck-pulling, we feel are inappropriate when Scotland has such a magnificent history…Sadly, some games have poor quality athletes, bad equipment, and poor quality commentary with little crowd interaction. We aim to change that."&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

Thus was spawned the Highland Challenge. Invitees to the tournament had to meet high criteria, being either national champions, Olympians, world record-holders, World Highland games champions, World's Strongest Man finalists, and US highland games champions. Having brought the earth of their homelands to the Moot Hill, in the same manner and place as allegiance was sworn to Scotland's ancient kings, contestants would enter a competition consisting of a mixture of traditional [[Highland Games]] events and more contemporary [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] tests in order to vie for the title of the "Chieftain's Champion".

The 2007 event saw [[Sebastian Wenta]] win the competition and having sampled some success the next games were planned for 2008. Douglas Edmunds managed to attract a number of sponsors for the 2008 event, as well as gaining an agreement with [[Channel 4]] to televise the event. The 2008 event took place at  [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] on 19 and 20 July 2008. Such was its success that a 2009 event was planned for immediately.

==Events==
The events contested are designed to echo not only the traditions of the Highland Games but also the history of Scotland. They include wrestling, schiltron jousting and stone-lifting, as well as traditional throws, such as the caber. In addition, there are re-enactments of battles including in 2008 the 1396 Battle of the North Inch starring Hal o’ the Wynd.&lt;ref name="Perth"&gt;[http://www.perthshireadvertiser.co.uk/perthshire-news/local-news-perthshire/strathmore/2008/07/18/world-athletes-muscle-in-at-scone-palace-73103-21360475/ World athletes muscle in at Scone Palace, 18 July 2008  by Gordon Bannerman, Perthshire Advertiser Friday ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 contest a new event called ''"The Whisky Plunder,"'' (sponsored by  [[The Famous Grouse]]) saw competitors racing with four casks.&lt;ref name="Perth"/&gt; The Famous Grouse also sponsored the “Tossing the Caber” event, with winners toasting success with a Famous Grouse trophy and a personalised Gallon Bottle.

===2007: Gododdin Challenge===
{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}

===Final===
The Highlander Challenge was to begin on 26 May 2007 at Blair Castle, Scotland. The Games made up two half-hour episodes of the IFSA Strongman 26 programme television series. The event was also backed by [[Event Scotland]] and was conceived by Dr. Douglas Edmunds. It went by the name "Gododdin Challenge" in 2007. Sebastian Wenta edged out Gregor Edmunds by one-half point for the victory at the Gododdin Challenge at Blair Castle. [[Hjalti Arnason]] who watched the contest commented that this made for TV event would result in excellent shows and [[Mike Zolkiewicz]], who finished fourth said that the blend of traditional Highland Games and strongman events "had great balance and it tested athletic ability beyond just a Highland Games or a strongman contest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2007/May/Sebastian_Wenta_Wins_Gododdin_Challenge.html Sebastian Wenta Wins Gododdin Challenge, by Randall J.

It consists of a large hill with a [[construction point]] (K-point) of {{convert|112|m|sp=us}} and a normal hill with a K-point of {{convert|90|m|sp=us|0}}. Construction started in 1980 and the venue opened in 1982 to host [[ski jumping at the 1984 Winter Olympics|ski jumping]] and [[Nordic combined at the 1984 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]] at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. The [[ski jumping at the 1984 Winter Olympics – Large hill|large hill event]] saw Finland's [[Matti Nykänen]] set the hill record of {{convert|116.0|m|sp=us|0}} in front of 90,000 spectators. No other [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) sanctioned competitions have taken place at the hills. During the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], the hills became a battleground and have since not been used. However, there are plans to rebuild the [[ski jumping hill|in-run]], expand the large hill and build new spectator stands and visitor facilities.

==History==
[[File:Igman.jpg|thumb|left|The jumps during winter]]
The Malo Polje area of Igman has traditionally been used for recreational cross-country skiing. During [[Sarajevo bid for the 1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo's Olympic bid]], the two ski jumps were proposed as separate venues. However, after the games were awarded, the plans changed in favor of a single venue, which would allow better post-Olympic use.&lt;ref&gt;OCXIVOWG: 104&lt;/ref&gt; The area plan for the jumps were presented by the Organizing Committee's executive board on 30 April 1979 and was passed by Sarajevo City Council in September 1979. The design of the ski jump was approved by FIS on 18 October 1979. Work on auxiliary infrastructure started in mid-1979,&lt;ref&gt;OCXIVOWG: 105&lt;/ref&gt; including a new road from the city to Igman.&lt;ref&gt;OCXIVOWG: 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the hill and judge's tower started on 1 July 1980 and was completed on 1 December 1982. Construction of the ski lift started on 1 October 1982 and was completed on 30 October 1983. The jumps were inaugurated in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;OCXIVOWG 107&lt;/ref&gt; After the Olympics, Sarajevo experienced a boom in recreational skiing among locals, including ski jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-02-12/sports/8803290680_1_olympic-torch-olympic-ceremony-olympic-flag |title=Sarajevo: It Was Great While It Lasted |date=12 February 1988 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |last=Butturini |first=Paula |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/646BFb928?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-02-12/sports/8803290680_1_olympic-torch-olympic-ceremony-olympic-flag |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], Igman became part of the buffer zone between the belligerents of the Bosnian government and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy (2007): 129&lt;/ref&gt; The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy fighting during the civil war and was also used for executions by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Vice News|title=The Crumbling Ruins of Sarajevo's 1984 Winter Olympics|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-crumbling-ruins-of-sarajevos-1984-winter-olympics|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1984/SKJ/ |title=Ski Jumping at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Games |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/646AXJJV4?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1984/SKJ/ |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skieguide.com/igman.php |title=Igman ski area, Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Ski eGuide |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6464xZAFd?url=http://www.skieguide.com/igman.php |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the war, the hills were no longer able to be used.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/BIH-Bosnia+and+Herzegovina/Sarajevo/0012-Malo+Polje/ |title=Sarajevo |publisher=Ski Jumping Hill Archive |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/645tOZDi7?url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski%20Jumps/BIH-Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina/Sarajevo/0012-Malo%20Polje/ |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Olympic legacy company ZOI'84, which owns the hills, launched plans to renovate the venue. Estimated to cost between €7 million and €10 million, the in-runs would have been completely rebuilt, as they are in too poor condition to be renovated. The large hill would be expanded to give a K-point of {{convert|120|m|sp=us}}. Designs have been made by Austrian architect firm Hofrichter-Ritter and financing is planned through [[European Union]] or Austrian grants. The project includes natural stands on the sides of the landing slope and a combination of permanent and temporary stands around the out-run. At a later date, part of stands could be covered with a roof. A panorama restaurant has been proposed for the top of the in-runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/content/view/22086/32/ |title=Dvije skakaonice za zemlju bez skakača |date=10 March 2010 |work=[[Radio Sarajevo]] |language=Bosnian |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6464eD6Bb?url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/content/view/22086/32/ |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new venue was scheduled to open in 2013; however, no work was done and the site is mostly derelict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hofrichter-ritter.at/construction-27.htm#2-27 |title=Olympiaschanze Sarajevo |publisher=Hofrichter-Ritter |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archivedate=21 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6465GJBi9?url=http://www.hofrichter-ritter.at/construction-27.htm |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2827">The '''International Skat Players Association''' ('''ISPA''') is the worldwide umbrella organisation for all competition [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] players. The ISPA was founded in 1976 by Peter Brand and Martha Prickartz in [[Aachen]], Germany.

It initially crossed swords with the world's largest national Skat association, the [[German Skat Association]] (''Deutscher Skatverband'', DSkV), and promulgated different rules for the game. Towards the end of the 1990s, talks between the top officials of each organisation led to rapprochement and agreement between the two large associations. The ban on double membership was lifted and a uniform International Skat Order (''Internationale Skatordnung '', ISkO) was adopted, which has been valid worldwide ever since. The ISPA delegates  two regular commissioners to the [[International Skat Court]] (''Internationale Skatgericht'').

''ISPA World'' is divided into national [[Division (organisation)|branches]] with regional groups and further subdivisions down to local [[Club (organization)|club]]s. It operates its own leagues as well as cup and championship competitions. Its focus is on the open [[World Skat Championship|World]] and [[European Skat Championship|European Skat Championships]], which have been held annually since 1978/1979 at various venues. In addition, ISPA has organized the Online Skat World Championships biennially since 2011. Furthermore, ISPA publishes the annual magazine, ''Skatmagazin''. 

The subdivision of ISPA Germany (''ISPA-Deutschland'') has relatively few members in comparison with the ''DSkV'' and is ''inter alia'' jointly responsible for organising the annual German Skat Championship.&lt;ref&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170603/http://ispaworld.info/index.php/deutsche-meisterschaften |date=December 31, 2016 |title=Deutsche Einzel- und Mannschaftsmeister der ISPA seit 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in double events, because the DSkV also organises German championships with individual and team competitions and runs federal and regional Skat leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutscherskatverband.de/meisterschaften_turniere.html Meisterschaften &amp; Turniere im DSkV]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liandro Rudwendy Filipe Martis''' (born 13 November 1995) is an [[Curaçaoan]] professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|Winger]] for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[Premier League]].

==Career==
Following trials with [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]], [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], Martis went on trial with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the end of July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Man Utd &amp; Leicester keen on former Feyenoord winger|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-man-utd-leicester-keen-on-former-feyenoord-winger|website=teamtalk.com|publisher=Team Talk|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Martis signed a contract with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Sidelined with injury for much of the 2016/17 season, Martis has already shown glimpses of his talent during his short stay with the Foxes and is thought of as a promising talent for future seasons at King Power Stadium.

==International career==
Martis made his international debut for [[Curaçao national football team|Curaçao]] as a 16 year old against [[Aruba national football team|Aruba]] in a 3-2 friendly defeat on 14 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARUBA VS.

Liandro Martis entered the match against Mexico as a taste making left winger. That was excellent. We already knew, because he already showed that he made big steps at Feyenoord Rotterdam. Even the Mexican crowd stood behind him, That was great to see. However, The Coach needed to handle physically cautiously with him, because he just turned 17 in November 2012. That is why the Coach decided to put him as a substitute player, but after all he really did well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7360">[[File:DSCF1252.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Windsurfing]] is a typical surface water sport]]

The following is a list of '''surface water sports'''; these are [[sports]] which are performed atop a body of [[water]].

==Towed water sports==

===Discing===
Discing (also known as "saucering" in New England) consists of standing on a circular wooden disc and being towed behind the [[boat]] in a manner akin to water skiing. The disc (or "saucer") is gripped by the feet and supports the rider by means of spreading his/her weight evenly across the water. It requires good balance, and is difficult to perform at extremely high speeds.  Saucer tricks include spinning, jumping, and sharing a disk with one or more partners. Disks vary from 12 inches to 5 feet in diameter.  One form of Discing/saucering is for the boat to  do circles at fast speed with the discer trying to hold on as long as possible and seeing how far he or she can shoot off upon releasing the rope.

===Skurfing===
[[File:GoonBoySkurfing.jpg|thumb|150px|A skurfer]]
[[Skurfing]] is a surface water sport in which the participant is towed on a surfboard, behind a boat, with a ski rope. Skurfing is highly popular in the state of W.A in Australia and in many other places in the world.  Skurfing is not a professional sport and has no competitions; it is a freestyle sport with highly individualistic style and form.  It may be considered the precursor to [[wakeboarding]].

===Towed hydrofoiling===
The hydrofoiler is towed by a powered boat; mechanically the person rides a [[Paravane (water kite)|water kite]] or paravane hydrofoil. Wake energy is used for some jumping. A wakeboard is used to enter the hydrofoiling. This is a hybrid surface sport as it uses the surface of the water and the under-surface and air.

===Tubing===
[[File:Biscuitjumping.JPG|thumb|150px|Two tubers]]
[[Tubing (recreation)|Tubing]], also known as biscuiting, is where a large circular rubber tube is towed behind a boat at fast speeds.   The general aim is to hold on as long as possible without falling off due to the boat's sharp turns; more experienced biscuiters also try to jump the boat's wake and become airborne.

===Wakeboarding===
[[Wakeboarding]] is a surface water sport which involves riding a wakeboard over the surface of a body of water. It was developed from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques.  The rider is usually towed behind a motorboat; typically at speeds of 18–24 miles per hour depending on the water conditions, board size, rider's weight, and rider's comfort speed. But wakeboarding can also be performed with a variety of media including closed-course cables, winches, PWCs, and ATVs.

===Water skiing===
[[File:Slalom on waterskis.jpg|thumb|150px|Water skiing]]
[[Water skiing]] is a sport/game and recreational activity and is popular in many countries around the world where appropriate conditions exist - an expanse of water unaffected by wave motion. Rivers, lakes, and sheltered bays are all popular for water skiing.

Standard water skis were originally made of wood but now are usually constructed out of fibreglass-based composites. They are of similar length to downhill snow skis but are somewhat wider. Instead of a rigid binding, they have rubber molded binding, in which the skier's feet are placed. Skiers are pulled along by a rope with a handle fitted at one end and attached to a powerboat at the other.

==Board sports==

===Bodyboarding===
[[File:Oahu North Shore surfing tube.jpg|thumb|150px|A bodyboarder]]
A [[bodyboarding|bodyboard]] is an instrument of wave riding consisting of a small roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone'). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as 'dropknee') or can even be ridden standing up.

[[File:KiteBoardingCRGorge.jpg|thumb|150px|A kitesurfer]]

===Kite surfing===
[[Kite surfing]], also known as kitesurfing and kiteboarding, and sometimes as flysurfing, involves using a power kite to pull a small surfboard, or wakeboard (on water), a wheeled board on land, or a snowkiting.

[[File:Oahu North Shore surfing hand drag.jpg|thumb|150px|A surfer in [[Oahu]], Hawaii]]

===Paddleboarding===
[[Paddleboarding]] is an activity in which a person paddles a long streamlined surfboard with their hands.  This is done while laying or kneeling on the board.  Padleboards are raced throughout the world.

===Surfing===
[[File:2010 mavericks competition.jpg|thumb|right|A surfer performing a late drop  at a [[Mavericks (location)]]in 2010. ]]

[[Surfing]] is a recreational activity in which individuals paddle into a wave on a surfboard, jump to their feet, and are propelled across the water by the force of the wave. Surfing's appeal probably derives from an unusual confluence of elements: adrenaline, skill, and high paced maneuvering are set against a naturally unpredictable backdrop—an organic environment that is, by turns, graceful and serene, violent and formidable.

[[File:Skim.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Skimboarding]]

===Skimboarding===
[[Skimboarding]] is a boardsport which involves riding a skimboard either on an outgoing wave, or in shallow water, where instead of going for waves the rider may attempt to ride a rail or do "tech" tricks.

===Windsurfing===
[[Windsurfing]] is a sport involving travel over water on a small 2-4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint. The sport is a hybrid between sailing and surfing. The sail board might be considered the most minimalistic version of the modern sailboat, with the major exception that steering is accomplished by the rider tilting the mast and sail or, when planing, carving the board, rather than with a rudder.

== Other ==

===Hydrofoil sailing===
This recent development in the high-speed sailing arena has evolved most in the International Moth class of racing dinghy. These boats have a "T" shaped rudder and centreboard that generates sufficient lift to clear the hull from the water. When this happens wetted surface area drops radically and the boats accelerate up to 1.2 to 1.5 times the speed of the prevailing wind. These boats are very light (all up weight is less than 40&amp;nbsp;kg) and very fast, They hydrofoil in as little as {{convert|8|kn|km/h}} of breeze ("sit on the deck breeze" for most dinghy classes). The top recorded speed is about 50&amp;nbsp;km/hour, and speeds of 40&amp;nbsp;km/hour are common in the class.

===Bodysurfing===
[[File:Bodysurf Lajolla.jpg|thumb|Bodysurfing in [[La Jolla]], [[California]]  ]]
[[Bodysurfing]] is the art and sport of riding a wave without the assistance of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard. Bodysurfers typically equip themselves only with a pair of specialized swimfins that stay on during turbulent conditions and optimize propulsion.

===Sea scooters===
This uses a water propeller or sea scooter together with a snorkel kit. The scooters travel at a speed of around {{convert|6|to|7|km/h}}, which allows the user to explore more in less time both underwater and along the surface.

The '''Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum''' is an American outdoor sports [[stadium]] located in the [[Exposition Park, Los Angeles|Exposition Park]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The stadium serves as the home to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC Trojans football|Trojans football team]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. It is also the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Coliseum was home to the Rams from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. The Coliseum is serving as their home stadium again until the completion of [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theramswire.usatoday.com/2016/12/06/los-angeles-rams-home-attendance-memorial-coliseum-san-diego-chargers/|title=Don't judge Rams home attendance based on percentage of seats filled|date=December 6, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; USC, which operates and manages the Coliseum, began a major renovation of the stadium in early 2018.&lt;ref name="coliseumrenovation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |title=The USC Coliseum Renovation Project Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the renovation project the seating capacity will be 78,467. Once USC completes the renovation in 2019, the seating capacity will be 77,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/147418/l-a-coliseum-renovation-reaches-halfway-point-with-topping-off-ceremony/|title=Coliseum renovation reaches halfway point with topping-off ceremony - USC News. August 15, 2018|website=www.usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], which is owned by the State of California, and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California, [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], City of Los Angeles and managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aux.usc.edu|title=USC Auxiliary Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1959 to 2016, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished between August and October 2016. [[Banc of California Stadium]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] and home of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles FC]], was constructed on the former Sports Arena site and opened in April 2018.

The Coliseum will be the first stadium to have hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] three times, in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and the future [[2028 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 2028]], after the International Olympic Committee confirmed a deal it established on July 31, 2017, during the [[131st IOC Session]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-2028-olympics-deal-20170731-story.html|title=Details emerge in deal to bring 2028 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles|last=Wharton|first=David|date=July 31, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 31, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-makes-historic-decision-by-simultaneously-awarding-olympic-games-2024-to-paris-and-2028-to-los-angeles|title=IOC MAKES HISTORIC DECISION BY SIMULTANEOUSLY AWARDING OLYMPIC GAMES 2024 TO PARIS AND 2028 TO LOS ANGELES|date=September 13, 2017|publisher=Olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also was the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]]. It was the site of the [[Super Bowl I|First AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later called Super Bowl I, and [[Super Bowl VII]]. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] of the NFL, and [[UCLA Bruins football]]. It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="NPS-LANDMARK" /&gt;

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which consists of six voting members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lamcc.lacounty.gov/About-Us|title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission &gt; About Us|website=lamcc.lacounty.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by the three ownership interests and meets on a monthly basis, provides public oversight of the master lease agreement with USC. Under the lease the University has day-to-day management and operation responsibility for both the Coliseum and Banc of California Stadium properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamcc.lacounty.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=w03nIl-tEsc%3d&amp;portalid=17|title=Second Amendment to Lease and Agreement by and between the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and University of Southern California effective July 29, 2013|website=www.lamcc.lacounty.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 98-year lease took effect on July 29, 2013, and was signed by the parties on September 5, 2013. The agreement required the University to make approximately $100 million in physical repairs to the Coliseum, pay $1.3 million each year in rent to the State of California for the state owned land the Coliseum property occupies in Exposition Park, maintain the Coliseum's physical condition at the same standard used on the USC Campus, and assume all financial obligations for the operations and maintenance of the Coliseum and Banc of California Stadium Complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/college-football/story/_/id/9423259/lease-vote-paves-way-usc-trojans-take-coliseum], "ESPN.

On Monday, January 8, 2018, the University began its $300 million&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/31/uscs-coliseum-renovation-about-30-million-over-budget/|title=USC's Coliseum renovation about $30 million over budget|last=Kaufman|first=Joey|date=May 31, 2018|work=Orange County Register|access-date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; project to renovate and improve the Coliseum. The project, which is solely funded by the University, is scheduled to be completed by the 2019 football season and is the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years. Once completed the capacity will go from about 93,607 to 77,500 and the project includes replacing every seat in the stadium along with the addition of [[luxury boxes]] and club suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/01/08/construction-starts-on-renovations-to-coliseum-2/|title=USC-driven construction starts on renovations to Coliseum|last=Kaufman|first=Joey|date=January 8, 2018|work=Orange County Register|access-date=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coliseumrenovation.com"/&gt; On January 29, 2018, [[United Airlines]] became the stadium's first naming rights partner, thus making the stadium the '''United Airlines Memorial Coliseum'''; the name change will take effect August 2019.&lt;ref name="UA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.usc.edu/135477/united-airlines-memorial-coliseum-to-be-new-name-for-l-a-landmark/|title=United Airlines Memorial Coliseum to be new name for L.A. landmark - USC News. January 29, 2018|website=www.usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present use==
The Coliseum is now primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team and the home of the Los Angeles Rams (until their new stadium is completed). Most of USC's regular home games, especially the alternating games with rivals [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], attract a capacity crowd. The current official capacity of the Coliseum is 78,467.&lt;ref name="media-newswire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-newswire.com/release_1072461.html|title=Media-Newswire.com – Press Release Distribution – PR Agency|first=Media-Newswire.com – Press Release|last=Distribution|website=media-newswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.dailytrojan.com"&gt;[http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/09/09/News/Coliseum.To.Open.With.Renovations-3421214.shtml www.dailytrojan.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915030708/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/09/09/News/Coliseum.To.Open.With.Renovations-3421214.shtml |date=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USC's women lacrosse and soccer teams use the Coliseum for selected games, usually involving major opponents and televised games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/w-soccer/recaps/110714aaa.html], "

===Olympic Cauldron===
The [[Olympic cauldron]] (also known as the '''Olympic Torch''') was built for the stadium's two Olympic Games. It is still lit during  USC football games and  for [[Los Angeles Rams]] games, and other special occasions (e.g., when the Olympics are being held in another city).

In addition, the torch has been lit on the following historic occasions:
* To honor the fallen Israeli Athletes from the 1972 [[Munich Olympics]] Games.
* For several days following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] in 1986.  
* For over a week following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.  
* Non-stop for seven days following the 2004 death of [[Ronald Reagan]], a former California governor who as [[President of the United States]] opened the 1984 Summer Games. 
* In April 2005 following the death of [[Pope John Paul II]], who had celebrated Mass at the Coliseum during his visit to Los Angeles in 1987. 
* At the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] 50th anniversary game on March 29, 2008, during the ThinkCure! charity ceremony (While [[Neil Diamond]]'s "[[Heartlight (song)|Heartlight]]" was played and the majority of the attendees turned on their complimentary souvenir keychain flashlights.)  
* For the duration of [[Special Olympics World Games]] held in Los Angeles from July 25, 2015 to August 2, 2015. 
* For the returning [[Los Angeles Rams]]' first home game on September 18, 2016 against the [[Seattle Seahawks]].
* The Olympic torch was lit when the expected official awarding of the [[2028 Olympics|2028 Olympic games]] to Los Angeles on September 13, 2017.
* For the Coliseum Gladiator MMA Championship Finals on Sat. September 23, 2017.
* For the [[Los Angeles Rams]]' first playoff game in Los Angeles in 38 years on January 6, 2018 against the [[Atlanta Falcons]].
* For the [[2018 California wildfires]] &amp; the [[Thousand Oaks shooting]].

==History==
===Planning===
The Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to L.A. [[veterans]] of [[World War I]] (rededicated to all United States veterans of World War I in 1968). The official ground breaking ceremony took place on December 21, 1921 with construction being completed in just over 16 months, on May 1, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Pac10/USC/index.htm Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019181015/http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Pac10/USC/index.htm |date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[John and Donald Parkinson]], the original bowl's initial construction costs were $954,873. When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The now-signature Olympic torch was added. For a time it was known as '''Olympic Stadium'''. The [[Olympic cauldron]] torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The scoreboard and video screen that tower over the peristyle date back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims.  The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955.  In the mid-and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower.  Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's "Court of Honor"—plaques recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete roster of honorees can be seen below).

A pair of life-sized [[bronze]] nude statues of male and female athletes atop a 20,000 pound (9,000&amp;nbsp;kg) post-and-lintel frame formed the ''Olympic Gateway'' created by [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] for the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] games. The statues, modeled on [[water polo]] player [[Terry Schroeder]] &lt;ref name="Crowsnest"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Jerry |title=Schroeder learns to grin and bare the naked truth |series=Crowe's nest column |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/11/sports/sp-crowe11 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long jumper from Guyana, [[Jennifer Inniss]], who participated in the games, were noted for their anatomical accuracy. A decorative facade bearing the Olympic rings was erected in front of the peristyle for the 1984 games, and the structure remained in place through that year's football season.  The stadium rim and tunnels were repainted in alternating pastel colors that were part of architect [[Jon Jerde]]'s graphic design for the games; these colors remained until 1987.

===Renovations===
[[File:LAColiseum-under-construction-1922.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Coliseum under construction in 1922]]

For many years the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remain in place today, though the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The [[seating capacity]] was reduced to approximately 93,000.

The Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set many NFL attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. When the NFL amended its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout rule]] to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum's large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in [[Southern California]] even in the teams' best years.

Partly due to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For [[University of Southern California|USC]]&amp;ndash;[[UCLA]] and USC-[[University of Notre Dame]] games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed in 1977–1978 at the behest of Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it.  However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:&lt;ref name=USCColiseum /&gt;

* The field was lowered by {{convert|11|ft|m|1}} and fourteen new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} at the eastern 30-yard-line).
* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).
* The locker rooms and public restrooms were modernized.
* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm Stadiums of the NFL-Los Angeles Coliseum-Los Angeles Rams/Raiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205140916/http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm |date=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, for Raiders home games, [[tarpaulin]]s were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing [[seating capacity]] to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by [[HNTB]] that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). After the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], however, $93 million was required from government agencies (including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] before electing to move back to the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]] prior to the 1995 season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995.

In August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum's west end on a new 6,000 square-foot high-definition video scoreboard, accompanying the existing video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2011/04/coliseum-video-board.html|title=USC Official Athletic Site – USCTrojans.com|website=www.usctrojans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC football's home opener versus the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]], with the game being televised on [[ABC College Football|ABC]].

In July 2013, USC gained the master lease of the Coliseum, after the previously governing Coliseum Commission failed to deliver promised renovations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-coliseum-usc-20130725,0,2495018.story ''USC to take over L.A.

===Coliseum Renovation Project===
On October 29, 2015, the University of Southern California unveiled an estimated $270-million project for a massive renovation and restoration the Coliseum. The upgrades include: replacing all seats in the stadium, adding new aisles and widening some seats, a new [[surround sound]] system, construction of a larger and modern [[press box]] (that contains new box suites, premium lounges, a viewing deck and V.I.P. section), restoration and renaming of the [[Peristyle]] (soon to be called the '''Julia and George Argyros Plaza'''), stadium wide [[Wi-Fi]], new [[High-definition video]] [[jumbotron]] and [[scoreboards]], introduction of [[LED]] ribbon boards, new [[concession stands]], upgraded entry concourses, new interior and exterior lighting, modernization of plumbing and electrical systems, and a reduction in capacity of about 16,000 seats, with the final total at approximately 78,467 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102915aad.html|title=USC Official Athletic Site – USCTrojans.com|website=www.usctrojans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans have been met with mixed reactions from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/colleges/usc/post/_/id/20695/coliseum-renovation-a-hot-topic-among-usc-trojans-faithful|title=Coliseum renovation a hot topic among USC Trojans faithful|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles 2028]] Olympic bid committee proposes spending $300 million in added renovations to support its bid added to USC's total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reignoftroy.com/2015/08/25/la-coliseum-to-undergo-major-renovations-for-olympic-bid/|title=LA Coliseum To Undergo Major Renovations For Olympic Bid|date=August 25, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began when the 2017 football season ended, and is scheduled to be completed by the fall of 2019.  USC officials stated that construction will be planned around the school's (and the Rams') 2018 home football schedule, with no interruption.

===Notable events===

====1920s====
In [[1923 college football season|1923]], [[Pomona College]] and [[1923 USC Trojans football team|USC]] played in the inaugural game at the Coliseum on October 6,&lt;ref name=cusplpo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zMQxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0eQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1268%2C543126 |work=Berkeley Daily Gazette |location=California |title=U.S.C. plays Pomona |date=October 6, 1923 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Trojans prevailing 23–7. Situated just across the street from Exposition Park, USC agreed to play all its home games at the Coliseum, a circumstance that contributed to the decision to build the arena.

From [[1928 UCLA Bruins football team|1928]] through  [[1981 UCLA Bruins football team|1981]], the [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]] also played home games at the Coliseum. When USC and UCLA [[UCLA–USC rivalry#Football rivalry|played each other]], the "home" team (USC in odd-numbered years, UCLA in even), occupied the north sideline and bench, and its band and rooters sat on the north side of the stadium; the "visiting" team and its contingent took to the south (press box) side of the stadium. Excepting the mid-1950s and 1983–2007, the two teams have worn their home jerseys for the [[UCLA–USC rivalry#Football rivalry|rivalry games]] for the [[Victory Bell (UCLA–USC)|Victory Bell]]; this tradition was renewed in [[2008 UCLA Bruins football team|2008]], even though the two schools now play at different stadiums.  UCLA moved to the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] in [[1982 UCLA Bruins football team|1982]].
[[File:LA Coliseum gate.jpg|thumb|right|187px|The peristyle arch entrance to the Coliseum.]]

====1930s–1940s====
In 1932, the Coliseum hosted the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Summer Olympic Games]]; the first of two Olympic Games hosted at the stadium. The Coliseum served as the site of the [[Field hockey at the 1932 Summer Olympics|field hockey]], [[Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], the [[show jumping]] part of the [[Equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics|equestrian]], and the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics|track and field]] events along with the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932s.pdf 1932 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410231532/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932s.pdf |date=April 10, 2008 }} pp. 61–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1932 games marked the introduction of the [[Olympic Village]] as well as the victory podium.&lt;ref name=NPS-LANDMARK /&gt;

The former Cleveland Rams of the [[National Football League]] relocated to the Coliseum in [[1946 NFL season|1946]], becoming the [[Los Angeles Rams]]; but the team later relocated again, first to [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], then to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in [[1995 NFL season|1995]] only to move back to Los Angeles in [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. The [[Los Angeles Dons]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] played in the Coliseum from 1946 to 1949, when the Dons franchise merged with its NFL cousins just before the two leagues merged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=52HGfXAUdOAC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;dq=%22miami+seahawks%22+owner+1946+aafc&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UQTrU83mxX&amp;sig=2mNWOw8XZsgMgpd3QNI3g_yXraI#PPA438,M1 James P. Quirk and Rodney D. Fort, ''Pay Dirt: The Business of Professional Team Sports'', p. 438], {{ISBN|0-691-01574-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coliseum hosted the [[NCAA Division I Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] in [[1934 NCAA Track and Field Championships|1934]], [[1939 NCAA Track and Field Championships|1939]], [[1949 NCAA Track and Field Championships|1949]] and [[1955 NCAA Track and Field Championships|1955]].

====1950s–1960s====
Among other sporting events held at the Coliseum over the years were games of [[Major League Baseball]], which were held at the Coliseum when the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] of the [[National League]] relocated to the West Coast in 1958. The Dodgers played here until [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for the 1962 season.  Even allowing for its temporary status, the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]] for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as {{convert|710|ft|m|0}} from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for [[American football|football]] (not baseball) teams.

In order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only {{convert|251|ft|m}} from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many "[[Chinese home run]]s", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as "O'Malley's Chinese Theatre"&lt;ref name="Mover and Shaker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The House that [[Charlie Chan]] Built", drawing protests from the [[Chinese American]] community in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref name="Close Shave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of 250-foot pop flies going over the left-field fence. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' titled a critical [[editorial]] "Every Sixth Hit a Homer!" &lt;ref name="Mover and Shaker" /&gt; Players, too, complained, with [[Milwaukee Braves (1953–65)|Milwaukee Braves]]' [[ace (baseball)|ace]] [[Warren Spahn]] calling for a rule that would require any home run to travel at least {{convert|300|ft}} before it could be considered a home run.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Schwarz|title=201 Feet to Left, 440 Feet to Right: Dodgers Play the Coliseum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/sports/baseball/26coliseum.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]] ordered the Dodgers to erect two {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} screens in left field to prevent pop flies from becoming home runs.  One screen would have topped the left field wall, while the second would have been in the stands, {{convert|333|ft|m|0}} from the plate. A ball hit to left would have to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared the first screen, it would be a [[ground-rule double]]. However, the Dodgers discovered that the state's earthquake safety laws barred construction of a second screen. The first screen was built, however; its cables, towers, wires and girders were in play.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was, the "short porch" in left field looked attractive to batters. In the first week of play during [[1959 Major League Baseball season|the 1959 season]], the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed "[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon Shots]]."&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt;

Unable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} down each foul line. Also, when the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels]] joined the [[American League]] for 1961, Frick rejected their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility.&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the "Retro Ballpark" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards.  With a right field corner of only 318 feet, this fell short.  However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the "new/old" style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.

Late that season, the screen figured in the National League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race. The Braves were playing the Dodgers in the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, and [[Joe Adcock]] hit a ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder behind it and got stuck in the mesh. According to the ground rules, this should have been a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule it a ground-rule double.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"/&gt;  Adcock was left stranded on second. The game was tied at the end of nine innings and the Dodgers won it in the tenth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN195909150.shtml|title=Milwaukee Braves at Los Angeles Dodgers Box Score, September 15, 1959 - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].

[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|240px|The Coliseum during the [[1959 World Series]].]]
Although less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines and short dimensions (left field at 251 feet [mentioned above] and power alleys at {{convert|320|ft|m}}) it was ideally suited for large paying crowds. Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series played there drew over 92,000 fans, with game 5 drawing 92,706, a [[Major League Baseball attendance records|record]] unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition game between the Dodgers and the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of legendary catcher [[Roy Campanella]] drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[Boston Red Sox]] to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1959]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]].

The Coliseum was also the site of John F. Kennedy's memorable acceptance speech at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]]. It was during that speech that Kennedy first used the term "the [[New Frontier]]".

The Rams hosted the [[1949 NFL Championship Game|1949]], [[1951 NFL Championship Game|1951]], and [[1955 NFL Championship Game|1955]] NFL championship games at the Coliseum. The Coliseum was the site of the very first [[Super Bowl I|NFL-AFL Championship Game]] in January 1967, an event since renamed the [[Super Bowl]]. It also hosted the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl in 1973]], but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be hosted at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never had an NFL tenant. The venue was also the site of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]] from [[1951 NFL season|1951]] to [[1972 NFL season|1972]] and again in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].

In [[List of American Football League seasons#1960 .5B1.5D|1960]], the [[American Football League]]'s [[Los Angeles Chargers]] played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego the next year; the team moved back to its original home in 2017.

The [[United States men's national soccer team]] played its first match as the stadium in 1965, losing to Mexico in a 1966 World Cup qualifier. Also, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] of the [[United Soccer Association]] played their home games in the Coliseum for one year (1967) before moving to the Rose Bowl.

The largest gathering in the Coliseum's history was a [[Billy Graham]] crusade which took place on September 8, 1963 with 134,254&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coliseum History {{!}} LA Coliseum|url = http://www.lacoliseum.com/index.php/coliseum-history/|website = www.lacoliseum.com|accessdate = December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in attendance, noted by the Coliseum's website as an all-time record. With the renovations of 1964, the capacity of the Coliseum was reduced to roughly 93,000 for future events.

====1970s–1980s====
In July 1972, the Coliseum hosted the "Super Bowl" of [[Motocross]]. The event was the first motocross race held inside a stadium.&lt;ref name="Brobdingnagian In Lilliput"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/features/122_0903_the_first_supercross/index.html |title=The First Supercross |publisher=motorcyclistonline.com |accessdate=March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved into the [[American Motorcyclist Association|AMA]] [[Supercross]] championship held in stadiums across the United States and Canada.

On August 20, 1972, [[Wattstax]], also known as the "Black-Woodstock", took place in the Coliseum. Over 100,000 Black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert.

In 1973, [[Evel Knievel]] used the entire distance of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars at the stadium. Knievel launched his motorcycle from atop one end of the Coliseum, jumping the cars in the center of the field, and stopping high atop the other end. The jump was filmed by ABC Wide World of Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/wwos/e_knievel.html|title=ABC Sports – Wide World of Sports|website=espn.go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, the Coliseum was host to Super Bowl VII which saw the AFC champion [[Miami Dolphins]] (17–0) defeat the NFC champion [[Washington Redskins]] (13–4), 14–7, and become the only team in NFL history to attain an undefeated season and postseason.

The Los Angeles Rams played their home games in the Coliseum until 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim]] prior to the [[1980 NFL Season]]. They hosted the NFC Championship Game in 1975 &amp; 1978 in which they lost both times to the Dallas Cowboys by lopsided margins.

The [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] used the Coliseum as their home ground in both the 1977 and 1981 seasons.

The Coliseum was also home to the [[United States Football League|USFL]]'s [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] between 1983 and 1985. In this capacity, the stadium also is the site of the longest professional [[American football]] game in history; a triple-overtime game on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics) between the Express and the [[Michigan Panthers]], which was decided on a 24-yard game-winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, 3:33 into the third overtime to give Los Angeles a 27–21 win. Until 2012, this game marked the only time in the history of pro football that there was more than one kickoff in overtime play in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfl.info/panthers/ Michigan Panthers] USFL.info&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], the former [[Oakland Raiders]] moved in. The same year, UCLA decided to move out, relocating its home games to the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].
[[File:Olympic Torch Tower of the Los Angeles Coliseum.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Opening Ceremony of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] on July 28, 1984]]
The Coliseum was also the site of the [[1982 Individual Speedway World Championship|1982 Speedway World Final]], held for the first and, to this day, only time in the USA. The event saw [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] native [[Bruce Penhall]] retain the title he had won in front of 92,500 fans at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[1981 Individual Speedway World Championship|1981]]. An estimated 40,000 fans were at the Coliseum to see Penhall retain his title before announcing his retirement from [[motorcycle speedway]] to take up an acting role on the [[NBC]] drama series ''[[CHiPs]]''.

Los Angeles hosted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], and the Coliseum became the first stadium to host the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice; again serving as the primary [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|track and field]] venue and site of the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102235952/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf |date=November 2, 2010 }} Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 72–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coliseum played host to the 2-day California World Music Festival on April 7–8, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/ted-nugent/poster-art/poster/LAC790407.html California World Music Festival Poster].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Rolling Stones]]  played at the stadium on their 1981 ''Tattoo You'' tour (October 9 &amp; 11),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1981]]&lt;/ref&gt; supported by [[George Thorogood]], J. Geils Band, and a relatively unknown newcomer called [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].

[[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; The [[E Street Band]] concluded their [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], with four consecutive concerts on September 27, 29–30 and October 2, 1985. These shows were recorded and eight songs from the show of September 30 appear on their box set, entitled ''[[Live 1975–85]]''.

[[U2]] played at the stadium on leg 3 of their breakout Joshua Tree tour in 1987 with two consecutive nights, November 17 and 18, 1987.  They later returned on their Pop Mart tour, June 21, 1997.

Los Angeles natives [[Mötley Crüe]] played at the stadium on December 13, 1987 during the second leg of their ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (Mötley Crüe album)|"Girls, Girls, Girls"]]'' World Tour with fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and Los Angeles-based band [[Guns N' Roses]] as the opening act. Mötley Crüe at the time was one of the most popular and successful musical acts on the planet, while Guns N' Roses was one of the largest up-and-coming acts. Guns N' Roses would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992 on their infamous co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|tour]] with [[Metallica]].

The stadium played host to The [[Monsters of Rock Tour 1988|Monsters of Rock]] Festival Tour, featuring [[Van Halen]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], Metallica and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, but was later canceled.

The stadium also played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Joan Baez]].

====1990s–2000s====
The Coliseum was set to be the site of [[WrestleMania VII]] on March 24, 1991. However, the event was eventually moved to the nearby [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. Officially, the World Wrestling Federation (now [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]) claimed the decision to move the event was due to security concerns (this may have been in reference to then-champion [[Sgt Slaughter]], who was playing a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Iraqi sympathizer character to coincide with [[Operation Desert Storm]]). However, that claim has often been disputed and the venue change attributed to low ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/sgtslaughter2.html|title=Sergeant Slaughter|date=May 26, 2011|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141543/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/sgtslaughter2.html|archivedate=May 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was first announced that the Coliseum was to host WM7, WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]]'s original promos for the event told that they expected over 100,000 fans to attend. The reported attendance in the Sports Arena was 16,158.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The 100,000-plus mark would later occur 25 years later on April 3, 2016 when AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas housed 101,763 fans for [[WrestleMania 32]].

The Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1984, they had trouble filling it.  The NFL  scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on [[Monday Night Football]] as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out.  Finally, in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.

The most recent pro football tenant prior to the return of the Rams was the short-lived [[Los Angeles Xtreme]], the first and only champion of the [[XFL]]. It won the championship game at the Coliseum over San Francisco.

The [[Legends Football League]] began as a halftime spectacular known as the [[Lingerie Bowl]]. The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of [[Los Angeles Temptation]] games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after 3 seasons at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in Ontario.

The stadium hosted several matches, including the semi-finals and final, of the women's FIBA World Cup. The world's largest audience for a women's sporting event. The U.S. NWT beat China in a shoot-out. The 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] beat [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], [[1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1998]], and [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2000]] tournaments. In October 2000, United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]] and the [[StubHub Center]] as home stadiums in the Greater Los Angeles.

The stadium hosted the [[K-1 Dynamite!! USA]] [[mixed martial arts]] event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Springer|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-mma3jun03,1,2027204.story|title=Morton doesn't last one round|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion [[New York Yankees]] at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people. The Yankees won that game 6–2. As part of their west coast 50th anniversary celebration in 2008, the Dodgers again hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series Champions, the [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref name=LAT111407&gt;{{cite news|first=Dylan|last=Hernandez|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-spw-dodgers15nov15,1,3897689.story|title=Dodgers to play host to Red Sox in March|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle game of a three-game set in Los Angeles, held on March 29, 2008, was also won by the visitors, by the relatively low score of 7–4, given the layout of the field – Red Sox catcher [[Jason Varitek]] had joked that he expected scores in the 80s.

As previously mentioned in the 1950s–1960s section, during 1958–1961, the distance from home plate to the left field foul pole was {{convert|251|ft|m|1}} with a {{convert|42|ft|m|0|adj=on}} screen running across the close part of left field. Due to the intervening addition of another section of seating rimming the field, the 2008 grounds crew had much less space to work with, and the result was a left field foul line only {{convert|abbr=on|201|ft|m| long|1|adj=mid}}, with a {{convert|60|ft|m|0|adj=on}} screen, which one Boston writer dubbed the "Screen Monster".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Even at that distance, 201 feet is also {{convert|abbr=on|49|ft|m|1}} short of the minimum legal home-run distance. This being an exhibition game, balls hit over the {{convert|abbr=on|60|ft|m|0}} temporary screen were still counted as home runs. There were only a couple of home runs over the screen, as pitchers adjusted (and [[Manny Ramirez]] did not play).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores108/108089/MLB803093.htm MLB803093], USAToday.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coliseum formerly hosted the major U.S. [[electronic dance music]] festival [[Electric Daisy Carnival]]. It last hosted the event in 2010; following the drug-related death of an underage attendee at EDC that year, the festival's organizer [[Insomniac Events]] was blacklisted from hosting future events at the venue, and it subsequently moved to [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] beginning in 2011.&lt;ref name="laweekly-edcdeath"&gt;{{cite web|title='EDC' Raver Teen Sasha Rodriguez Died From Ecstasy Use|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/edc-raver-teen-sasha-rodriguez-died-from-ecstasy-use-2386344|website=LA Weekly|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-fataltoll&gt;{{cite news |title=A fatal toll on concertgoers as raves boost cities' income| url= http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-coliseum-rave-deaths-20130203-story.html#page=1| work =Los Angeles Times |date = February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trib-edcladeath&gt;{{cite news| title= Man dies at Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-22/news/chi-electric-daisy-carnival-death-20140622_1_electric-daisy-carnival-drug-molly-jennifer-forkish |date =June 22, 2014 | work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-caution&gt;{{cite news| title=A Bit of Caution Beneath the Thump | author = Jon Pareles | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/arts/music/electric-zoo-returns-under-watchful-eyes.html | work =New York Times|date = September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-clampdown&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric Zoo to Clamp Down on Drugs This Year|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-zoo-to-clamp-down-on-drugs-this-year-1409278227| work=Wall Street Journal| date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Coliseum Commission focused on signing a long-term lease with USC; the school offered to purchase the facility from the state but was turned down. After some at-time contentious negotiations, with the university threatening in late 2007 to move its home stadium to the Rose Bowl, the two sides signed a 25-year lease in May 2008 giving the Coliseum Commission 8% of USC's ticket sales, approximately $1.5 million a year, but commits the agency to a list of renovations.&lt;ref name=WSJ062408&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Futterman|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121427510765899201?mod=residential_real_estate|title=Landmark's Name Is up for Sale|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=June 24, 2008|accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2008, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission announced they were putting the [[naming rights]] of the Coliseum on the market, predicting a deal valued at $6 million to $8 million a year. The funds would go towards financing more than $100 million in renovations over the next decade, including a new video board, bathrooms, concession areas and locker rooms.&lt;ref name=WSJ062408 /&gt; Additional seating was included in the renovation plans which increased the Coliseum's [[seating capacity]] to 93,607 in September 2008.&lt;ref name="media-newswire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.dailytrojan.com"/&gt;

On June 17, 2009, the Coliseum was the terminus for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 2009 NBA Championship victory parade. A crowd of over 90,000 attended the festivities, in addition to the throngs of supporters who lined the 2-mile parade route. The Coliseum peristyle was redesigned in purple and gold regalia to commemorate the team and the Lakers' court was transported from [[Staples Center]] to the Coliseum field to act as the stage. Past parades had ended at Staples Center, but due to the newly constructed [[L.A. Live]] complex, space was limited around the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-security18-2009jun18,0,7785141.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Andrew | last=Blankstein | title=Lakers parade goes off mostly without a hitch | date=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s–present====
On July 30, 2011, the LA Rising festival with [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Rise Against]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Immortal Technique]] and [[El Gran Silencio]] was hosted at the Coliseum.

On April 27, 2013, the stadium hosted the [[Stadium Super Trucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/ |title=Schedule |work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124159/http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/ |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2013, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and USC implemented the Second Amendment to the Lease and Agreement between the Coliseum Commission and USC which transferred to USC the responsibility for the long-term (98 years) operation of both the Coliseum and the then Sports Arena facilities and the capital renewal of the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;http://lamcc.lacounty.gov/ "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission"&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2014, the Coliseum hosted the 5th-place game, 3rd-place game, and Final of the [[2014 Copa Centroamericana]] in front of 41,969 spectators.

In August 2015, the Coliseum hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the [[2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2015/LA2015_Special_Olympics_World_Games_Closing_Ceremony.aspx |title=Carly Rae Jepsen, O.A.R. and Andra Day to Headline the LA2015 Special Olympics World Games Closing Ceremony on August 2 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=specialolympics.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Los Angeles Rams====
On January 13, 2016, the NFL gave permission for the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]] to relocate back to Los Angeles. The Rams resumed play at the Coliseum, while awaiting completion of the [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Rams to relocate to L.A.; Chargers first option to join|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000621645/article/rams-to-relocate-to-la-chargers-first-option-to-join|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rams to Return to Los Angeles|url=http://www.stlouisrams.com/news-and-events/article-1/Rams-to-Return-to-Los-Angeles/802b4e16-671e-4864-97b6-943115cdc4cf|publisher=St. Louis Rams|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2016, the Coliseum hosted its first NFL game at the stadium since 1994, as the Rams hosted [[Dallas Cowboys]] at a preseason game to a crowd of 89,140 people.

On September 18, 2016, the Coliseum hosted the first Rams regular season home game since 1979, against the [[Seattle Seahawks]].

On January 6, 2018, the Coliseum hosted its first Rams playoff game since the 1978 NFC Championship game, against the defending NFC champion [[Atlanta Falcons]].

On November 19, 2018, the Coliseum hosted its first [[Monday Night Football]] game since 1985, and the first Monday night game the Rams hosted at the Coliseum exact date 40 years later, with the Rams taking on the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. That game, which was originally scheduled to be played at [[Estadio Azteca]] in Mexico City that night, was moved to the Coliseum due to poor field conditions at the former.  The Rams won the game, 54-51, over the Chiefs in the highest-scoring game in Monday Night Football history.

====Naming rights and 2028 Summer Olympics====
On January 29, 2018, it was announced by the [[University of Southern California]] that [[United Airlines]] had bought the [[naming rights]] to the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.usc.edu/135477/united-airlines-memorial-coliseum-to-be-new-name-for-l-a-landmark/|title=United Airlines Memorial Coliseum to be new name for L.A. landmark|website=www.usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial Coliseum will be retained in the name of the stadium by the condition of the Coliseum Commission's requirement in its master lease agreement with the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamcc.lacounty.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=w03nIl-tEsc%3d&amp;portalid=17|title=Second Amendment to Lease and Agreement by and between the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and University of Southern California effective July 29, 2013|website=www.lamcc.lacounty.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be called the '''United Airlines Memorial Coliseum''' starting in August 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Closing-Bell/2017/05/18/United.aspx|title=United Gets L.A.

===The Coliseum and the NFL===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
{{See also|History of the National Football League in Los Angeles}}
[[File:Newlamc.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Model of a proposed renovation to the Coliseum.]]
There was much debate about the Coliseum's potential to be a modern NFL venue. Although the Coliseum has significant historical value, it is regarded by some as inadequate to be the home of a major professional sports team. Since it was designed and built long before the age of club seats, luxury boxes, and the other revenue-generating amenities that modern football stadiums possess, any professional team moving to the Coliseum will likely have to perform extensive renovations. Also, its status as a [[National Historic Landmark]] means any renovations would have to be complementary to the most identifiable parts of the building, a guideline that was not followed during [[Soldier Field]]'s renovations in 2002. Soldier Field was stripped of its landmark status as a result of its renovation. Los Angeles County voters have been generally uninterested in appropriating tax revenue toward building a new stadium. Without public funds, the costs of renovation would have to be borne by any future tenant of the Coliseum. Because of the difficulties that the NFL had with trying to finance a renovated Coliseum, Rose Bowl or until 2016 a brand new stadium, pro football was absent from the second-largest [[media market]] in the United States for two decades. (The NFL was to award a franchise to Los Angeles in 2002, but [[Proposed Los Angeles NFL stadiums#1999 expansion team plans|debate over a stadium]], coupled with [[Houston Texans|Houston's]] aggressiveness, led the NFL to award the franchise to Houston instead.)

On November 10, 2005, then-NFL commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] announced that the NFL and city officials had reached a preliminary agreement on bringing an NFL team back to the Coliseum. However, this did not come to fruition.

An article in the May 24, 2006 issue of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' made light of a proposition to spend tens of millions of dollars of city funds to heavily renovate the stadium, and indicated that the city may make more than $100 million in added funds available in the future toward further renovation. City leaders who supported the spending despite significant disapproval from the local population cited that the renovations were necessary to help attract a new NFL team to the city and that the tax revenue generated by the presence of a new franchise team would have eventually paid back the investment many times over.

While a proposal to bring pro football back to the Los Angeles area was still in the works (at the time), there had been little action taken in the last years of the NFL's absence from the Los Angeles market to bring an NFL team to the Coliseum. Up until 2013, USC had a series of mostly one- and two-year leases with the commission.&lt;ref name=LAT060607&gt;Sam Farmer, [http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/los-angeles-coliseum/recent/4 Coliseum panel mulls options], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] declared that the policy of requiring the NFL to relocate to the Coliseum would change and other options would be explored.&lt;ref&gt;David Wharton and Sam Farmer – [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-rose29nov29,0,1000492.story Mayor benches NFL plan, wants Trojans in Coliseum]. November 29, 2007. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Quote: With USC threatening to move its home games to Pasadena's Rose Bowl, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called for a long-term deal to keep the Trojans in the Memorial Coliseum, saying for the first time he has given up hope of the National Football League returning to the aging stadium. "While I remain committed to bringing a professional team to Los Angeles, it is time to read the scoreboard", Villaraigosa said in a statement Wednesday. "The Coliseum is no longer a viable option for the NFL."&lt;/ref&gt; The Coliseum Commission's June 23, 2008 decision to sell naming rights to the stadium had signaled a likely end to the prospects of the NFL's returning to the Coliseum as the prospect of a naming-rights deal by a future NFL team tenant could have helped lure a new pro team.&lt;ref name=WSJ062408 /&gt;

In August 2011, Tim Leiweke, President of [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG, Inc.]], stated publicly that his interest in using the Coliseum as a possible temporary venue for an NFL team that might relocate to Los Angeles would require that such negotiations with AEG be conducted with USC and not with the Coliseum Commission.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

On September 7, 2011, the Coliseum Commission voted unanimously to request USC to undertake negotiations for possible management agreement regarding the Coliseum and the then Sports Arena. USC and the Commission began negotiations at the end of September and concluded in December 2011 with a Term Sheet outlining basic points of agreement negotiated between USC and the Commission negotiating committee. The full Commission on December 21, 2011 unanimously endorsed the terms and instructed its legal counsel to proceed with development of an actual lease agreement so that a draft could be made available for public comment. Over the next 18 months the Commission and its staff held several public meetings on the draft lease and discussion meetings with the California Science Center (representative for the State owned property in Exposition Park).

During an open session meeting on July 17, 2013, the Commission authorized the amendment to the existing USC-Coliseum Commission Lease for the operation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the then Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 25, 2013, the Coliseum Commission and USC executed this new long-term master lease agreement. It became effective on July 29, 2013, and the Commission transferred day-to-day management and financial responsibilities for the Coliseum and Sports Arena to USC. This included the rehiring by USC, on a fixed term basis, of the Coliseum/Sports Arena employees who had been working for the Commission the previous day. For most of the former Coliseum Commission employees, the fixed term of their employment would be short-lived, ending 10 months later on May 30, 2014.
[[File:LA Memorial Coliseum aerial view, August 2017.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view of the Coliseum in August 2017 with the [[Los Angeles Rams]] field]]
The new master lease contained a provision that required USC to cooperate with any request by the City or County of Los Angeles for use of the Coliseum on a temporary basis (no longer than 4 years) by an NFL team. USC was required to negotiate in good faith with the NFL to structure a sublease or occupancy agreement on fair market terms; USC could require the NFL team to contribute to any capital improvements in the Coliseum; USC is not obligated under the master lease to incur any additional expense or liabilities from the use of the Coliseum by an NFL team. Additionally, under the master lease USC had the right to refuse to enter into an agreement with the NFL if the school reasonably determined that the NFL team being proposed posed security or safety concerns for the USC campus or if the activities associated with the NFL team would cause violations of NCAA or Pac-12 bylaws, regulations, or policies/procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://re.usc.edu/docs/Coliseum%20-%20Second%20Amendment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526024524/http://re.usc.edu/docs/Coliseum%20-%20Second%20Amendment.pdf |archivedate=May 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}, "Second Amendment to Lease and Agreement By and Between Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and University of Southern California, July 29, 2013"&lt;/ref&gt;

That lease provision was executed when the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] relocated back to Los Angeles for the [[2016 NFL season]], the Coliseum serves as their temporary stadium until the [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] is finished in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/Inglewood-Stadium-Opening-Delayed-Till-2020-423012364.html|title=Rain Delay: Opening of Inglewood Stadium Pushed Back to 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rearden|first1=Tim|title=LA COLISEUM PREPARES TO HOST NFL GAMES IN 2016|url=http://abc7.com/sports/la-coliseum-prepares-to-host-nfl-games-in-2016/1158491/|website=abc7.com|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2016, it was reported by ''[[USA Today]]'' that the [[San Diego Chargers]] (a candidate to move to Los Angeles) were in contact with the Coliseum Commission about playing at the stadium should they move; the Chargers ultimately chose the much smaller [[StubHub Center]] as their temporary home.

Beginning in the 2017 season, the seating capacity for Rams games was capped at 70,000 due to limited logistics for larger crowds.

===Attendance records===
;College football
Records differ between the 2006 USC football [[media guide]] and 2006 UCLA football media guide. (This may be due to only keeping records for "home" games until the 1950s.) The USC Media guide lists the top five record crowds as:
* 1. 104,953 — vs. Notre Dame 1947 (USC home game; Highest attendance for a football game in the Coliseum)
* 2. 103,303 — vs. UCLA 1939 (USC home game)
* 3. 103,000 — vs. USC 1945 (UCLA home game)
* 4. 102,548 — vs. USC 1954 (UCLA home game)
* 5. 102,050 — vs. UCLA 1947 (USC home game)

The UCLA Media guide does not list the 1939 game against USC, and only lists attendance for the second game in 1945 for Coliseum attendance records. These are the top three listed UCLA record Coliseum crowds:
* 1. 102,548 — vs. USC 1954 (UCLA home game)
* 2. 102,050 — vs. USC 1947 (UCLA home game)
* 3. 100,333 — vs. USC 1945 (USC home game; 1945's second of two meetings)
The largest crowd to attend a USC football game against an opponent other than UCLA or Notre Dame was 96,130 for a November 10, 1951 contest
with [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]]. The largest attendance for a UCLA contest against a school other than USC was 92,962 for the November 1, 1946 game with [[Saint Mary's Gaels|Saint Mary's College of California]].

;National Football League
The Los Angeles Rams played the San Francisco 49ers before an NFL record attendance of 102,368 on November 10, 1957.  This was a record paid attendance that stood until September 2009 at [[Cowboys Stadium]], though the overall NFL regular season record was broken in a 2005 regular season game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] at [[Azteca Stadium]] in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Weir|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/games/2005-10-03-cardinals-niners_x.htm|title=Cardinals deep-six 49ers in historic tilt in Mexico|date=October 3, 2005|newspaper=USA Today|quote=Total attendance for record regular season game in Mexico City Azteca Stadium is 103,467 breaking the record of 102,368 who saw the Rams play the 49ers on Nov. 10, 1957, at the Los Angeles Coliseum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Weir|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-29-nfl-mexico-cover_x.htm|title=Mexico gets ready for football, not futbol|date=September 25, 2005|newspaper=USA Today|quote=A 1994 Houston-Dallas exhibition drew a still-standing NFL record 112,376 to Estadio Azteca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both records were broken on September 20, 2009 at the first regular season game at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]] between the Dallas Cowboys and [[New York Giants]].

In 1958 the Rams averaged 83,680 for their six home games, including 100,470 for the [[Chicago Bears]] and 100,202 for the [[Baltimore Colts]].

In their 13 seasons in Los Angeles the Raiders on several occasions drew near-capacity crowds to the Coliseum.  The largest were 91,505 for an October 25, 1992 game with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 91,494 for a September 29, 1991 contest with the San Francisco 49ers, and 90,380 on January 1, 1984 for a playoff game with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

The Coliseum hosted the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, later called the [[Super Bowl]]. The January 15, 1967 game, pitting the [[Green Bay Packers]] against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], attracted 61,946 fans—a lower-than anticipated crowd (by comparison, a regular-season game between the Packers and Rams a month earlier drew 72,418). For [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973, which matched the [[Miami Dolphins]] against the [[Washington Redskins]], the attendance was a near-capacity 90,182, a record that would stand until [[Super Bowl XI]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. The 1975 NFC Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys had an attendance of 88,919, still the largest crowd for a conference championship game since the conference-title format began with the 1970 season.  The 1983 AFC Championship Game between the Raiders and [[Seattle Seahawks]] attracted 88,734.

The Rams'  first NFL game at the Coliseum  since 1979,  after spending fifteen years at Anaheim Stadium and then twenty-one seasons in St. Louis,   a pre-season contest against the Cowboys on  August 13, 2016,   drew a crowd of 89,140.   The team's first regular-season home game,   on September 18 against the [[Seattle Seahawks]],   attracted 91,046—the largest attendance for a Rams game at the Coliseum since 1959.

;Major League Baseball
Contemporary baseball guides listed the theoretical baseball [[seating capacity]] as 92,500. Thousands of east-end seats were very far from home plate, and were not sold unless needed. The largest regular season attendance was 78,672, the Dodgers' home debut in the Coliseum, against the [[San Francisco Giants]] on April 18, 1958.

The May 7, 1959, exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[1958 World Series]] Champion [[New York Yankees]], in honor of disabled former Dodgers catcher [[Roy Campanella]], drew 93,103, which was a Major League Baseball record prior to 2008.

All three Dodgers home games in the [[1959 World Series]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]] exceeded 90,000 attendance. Game 5 drew 92,706 fans, a major league record for a non-exhibition game.

The attendance for the exhibition game on March 29, 2008, between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], was 115,300,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2008_03_29_bosmlb_lanmlb_1&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Boxscore: Boston vs. LA Dodgers - March 29, 2008|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a new [[Guinness World Record]] for attendance at a baseball game. The previous record of an estimated 114,000 was in the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] for an exhibition game between teams from branches of American Military Forces and Australia.

;Soccer
{{Main|Soccer Matches of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum}}
Several factors allowed the city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area to become the footballing central United States, both for local and international football . Including the common demographic factor in the area since the mid-twentieth century began to hold thousands and then millions, especially Mexican Latin American immigrants ; California leading the city's fondness for soccer called . To this incipient city footballing tradition dating back to 1902. Initially found joins football stadiums hosted a small area like Wrigley Field (Chicago Stadium homonymous) and Veterans Memorial Stadium, however the growing fondness for football, moved the dispute encounters the biggest stage in the city, the Memorial Coliseum.

The first official match in the competition that developed serious property was on March 7, 1965, corresponding to the qualifiers for the World Cup 1966 England between the U.S. and Mexico that ended with a tie at two goals.

Although the stadium represents the second most active venue in the history of the U.S. national team (after Robert F. Kennedy), it has played only 20 games in it, the last one in 2000.

However, the national team with increased activity in the Memorial Coliseum is Mexico, who has played 61 games in the building. Even the Los Angeles stage is the second stage where most capped the Mexican representative, only after its official seat Estadio Azteca, more than any other enclosure in his country and the United States. It was the mid-1980s when the Mexican national team began to adopt it as usual venue of their friendly games in the neighboring country, largely by population uniqueness of Los Angeles, which places it as the second-biggest city with Mexicans in the world.

Given its capacity and importance of the area in which it is located, it has been striking for different club and international matches, both friendly and official. While it is emphasizing the fact it had not been considered as the venue for the 1994 World Cup, awarded to its neighbor the Rose Bowl Stadium.

Although the stadium has never hosted the MLS Cup (final title game of Major League Soccer) or the end of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup (the tournament's oldest soccer country), it was the seat of the first final of a professional soccer tournament in the country, when it was the setting for the 1967 championship, organized by the United Soccer Association.

'''Lulu Devine''' (born '''Cynthia Stathopoulos''' on November 17, 1955 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a former American big-bust feature dancer, model, and pornographic video actress. Lulu turned to dance as a feature dancer during the late 1980s, and by 1990 began a pornographic video career. Lulu is also the older sister of fellow big-bust feature dancer and porn actress [[Toppsy Curvey]].

==Talk show, magazine appearances==
Lulu has appeared on numerous talk shows, such as ''([[Jerry Springer Show]], [[The Jenny Jones Show]]''), ''The [[Howard Stern]] Show'', and ''The [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] Show'' and also has made appearances at the Adult Entertainment Expo with fellow big-bust performers [[Chelsea Charms]], [[Minka]], and Kayla Kleevage. Devine has appeared in men's magazines such as ''Score'', ''Gent'', ''Hustler's Busty Beauties'', and ''D-Cup Magazine''.

=="Bandito" sports game crashing runs==
Devine is the older sister of fellow big-bust feature entertainer and adult model [[Toppsy Curvey]]. In the Tampa area, Lulu is also notoriously recognized in local pro sports circles for her "Kissing Bandit" routine, made famous by former "Kissing Bandit", TV personality, big-bust model and three-time ''[[Playboy]]'' centerfold [[Morganna Roberts]]. Numerous times in the past she has accompanied her sister Toppsey on her "bandito" runs, as to where she and her sister Lulu would run out on the fields during [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] pro football games and kiss the players.

==Police charges==
In early 2005, [[Hillsborough County, Florida]] sheriff's deputies raided her [[Brandon, Florida|Brandon]] house and arrested her on a misdemeanor charge of prostitution. She was surprised, she said when officials announced the discovery of a "dungeon" in her two-bedroom home in a working-class neighborhood. After posting $250 bail, Devine gave an interview at her dining room table that Friday morning. She was later convicted and fined, then released.* The story gained national attention and was shown on various television news media affiliate broadcasts, as well as tabloid journalism sources.&lt;ref name=Raid&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/02/19/Hillsborough/Raid_finds_alleged__s.shtml Raid finds alleged 'sex dungeon'.

'''Ozone therapy''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]] that purports to increase the amount of oxygen in the body through the introduction of [[ozone]]. It is based on [[pseudoscience]] and is considered dangerous to health, with no verifiable benefits.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=801.415 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21] Sec. 801.415 Maximum acceptable level of ozone (FDA Website)&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques have been suggested, with purported benefits including the treatment of [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], and [[multiple sclerosis]], among others. An overview of the history and practice of ozone therapy was published in the "Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine" in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elvis AM, Ekta JS | title = Ozone therapy: A clinical review | journal = Journal of Natural Science, Biology, and Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–70 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 22470237 | pmc = 3312702 | doi = 10.4103/0976-9668.82319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone therapy is sold as an alternative treatment for various illnesses. Beginning in 1991 the [[FDA]] has prosecuted and sent to jail several people presenting themselves as medical doctors and selling ozone therapy products as a medical cure or operating medical clinics using ozone therapy for healing human illness.&lt;ref name="Knotts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knotts|first1=Bob | name-list-format = vanc |title=Judge Won`t Reduce Bail For Ozone Therapy Advocate|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-10-19/news/9002200233_1_ozone-previous-arrest-fraud|access-date=1 May 2018|work=The Sentinel Sun|date=October 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitlock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitlock|first1=Chuck| name-list-format = vanc |title=MediScams : how to spot and avoid health care scams, medical frauds, and quackery from the local physician to the major health care providers and drug manufacturers|date=2001|publisher=Renaissance Books|location=Los Angeles |isbn=9781580631808 |page=139 |edition= 1st |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=3HRqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139&amp;lpg=PT139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arrests following similar activity have been made in other countries as well.&lt;ref name="Malaba"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malaba|first1=Tom|last2=Kiwanuka|first2=Christopher| name-list-format = vanc |title=Ozone Therapy Lands Kampala Doctor in Trouble|url=https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/ozone-therapy-lands-kampala-doctor-in-trouble|access-date=1 May 2018|work=Uganda Radio Network|date=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thai"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman who sought Thai "Ozone Therapy" dies|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10400153|access-date=1 May 2018|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 10 deaths have been related to ozone therapy or its lack of usefulness, in nine cases there had been investigation and in eight it was discovered that the practitioners had used false credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatstheharm.net/ozonetherapy.html Ozone Therapy] (What's The Harm website)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed uses ==
Ozone therapy consists of the introduction of ozone into the body via various methods, usually involving its mixture with various gases and liquids before injection, with potential routes including the [[vagina]], [[rectum]], [[intramuscular]] (in a muscle), [[subcutaneously]] (under the skin), or intravenously (directly into veins).  Ozone can also be introduced via [[autohemotherapy]], in which blood is drawn from the patient, exposed to ozone and re-injected into the patient.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxygen Therapy |url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/oxygen-therapy |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |access-date=29 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721031010/http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/oxygen-therapy |archive-date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This therapy has been proposed for use in various diseases, including cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, [[arthritis]], [[heart disease]], [[Alzheimer's dementia]], [[Lyme disease]], though supportive evidence for these applications is limited. Theories about the ability of ozone to kill tumor cells with oxygen have no credible scientific basis.&lt;ref name = ACS/&gt;  For treatment of HIV/AIDS, although ozone deactivates the viral particles [[in vitro|outside the body]], there is no evidence of benefit for living patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/oxygen.html | authorlink=Saul Green| title=Oxygenation Therapy: Unproven Treatments for Cancer and AIDS| publisher=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine | year = 1997 | vauthors = Green S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] initially stated in 1976, and reiterated its position in 2006, that when inhaled, ozone is a toxic gas which has no demonstrated safe medical application, though their position statements primarily deal with its potential for causing inflammation and [[pulmonary edema]] in the lungs. They also emphasize that in order for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present at concentrations far greater than can be safely tolerated by humans or other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=801.415 | title = Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Vol 8 section 801.415 | date = 1 April 2011 | access-date = 4 October 2011 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food &amp; Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent reviews have highlighted that different routes of administration may result in different therapeutic and side effect profiles,&lt;ref name="Zanardi"/&gt; though a statistically robust meta analysis of available research has not been performed to date.

Ozone has been suggested for use in [[dentistry]], but existing evidence does not support its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Azarpazhooh A, Limeback H | title = The application of ozone in dentistry: a systematic review of literature | journal = Journal of Dentistry | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–16 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18166260 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdent.2007.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho H, Lynham AJ, Hsu E | title = Postoperative interventions to reduce inflammatory complications after third molar surgery: review of the current evidence | journal = Australian Dental Journal | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 412–419 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28498604 | doi = 10.1111/adj.12526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviews have suggested ozone as potential treatment for [[herniated disc]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steppan J, Meaders T, Muto M, Murphy KJ | title = A metaanalysis of the effectiveness and safety of ozone treatments for herniated lumbar discs | journal = Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 534–48 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20188591 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2009.12.393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and diabetic neuropathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braidy N, Izadi M, Sureda A, Jonaidi-Jafari N, Banki A, Nabavi SF, Nabavi SM | title = Therapeutic relevance of ozone therapy in degenerative diseases: Focus on diabetes and spinal pain | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 233 | issue = 4 | pages = 2705–2714 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 28594115 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.26044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some controversy about its use by athletes in an attempt to increase performance; although its use is not disallowed in and of itself, it can be mixed with banned substances for administration prior to injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/belgian-court-continuing-investigation-of-ozone-therapy-doctor |title=Belgian Court Continuing Investigation Of Ozone-therapy Doctor |work=Cycling News |date=9 February 2013 |access-date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==

Much of the concern related to ozone therapy revolves around the safety of blood ozonation. It is well established that when inhaled by mammals, ozone reacts with compounds in tissues lining the lungs and triggers a cascade of pathological effects including [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref name="Zanardi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanardi I, Borrelli E, Valacchi G, Travagli V, Bocci V | title = Ozone: A Multifaceted Molecule with Unexpected Therapeutic Activity | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 304–14 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26687830 | doi = 10.2174/0929867323666151221150420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul Green has argued that since ozone has the capacity to oxidize organic compounds in an atmospheric environment, it should also logically oxidize blood components and [[endogenous]] human tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/oxygen.html | author=Green S | title=Oxygenation therapy: Unproven treatments for Cancer and AIDS | date=17 June 2001 | website=Quackwatch }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High levels of inhaled ozone are known to be toxic, though single-dose inhalation of lower levels is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bocci V, Borrelli E, Travagli V, Zanardi I | title = The ozone paradox: ozone is a strong oxidant as well as a medical drug | journal = Medicinal Research Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 646–82 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19260079 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/med.20150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents suggest that its effects are tissue dependent, though the subject is still debated.&lt;ref name="Zanardi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bocci V, Zanardia I, Valacchi G, Borrelli E, Travagli V | title = Validity of Oxygen-Ozone Therapy as Integrated Medication Form in Chronic Inflammatory Diseases | journal = Cardiovascular &amp; Hematological Disorders Drug Targets | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–38 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26126818 | doi = 10.2174/1871529x1502151209114642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious complications reported from the use of this therapy include the development of [[hepatitis]] and also include five reported fatalities.&lt;ref name=MJA&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ernst E | title = A primer of complementary and alternative medicine commonly used by cancer patients | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 174 | issue = 2 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11245510 | doi =  | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/174_02_150101/ernst/ernst.html }} [citation requires membership to industry magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern about an association with [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] after autohemotherapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Üreyen ÇM, Baş CY, Arslan Ş | title = Myocardial Infarction after Ozone Therapy: Is Ozone Therapy Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde? | journal = Cardiology | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–104 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26139204 | doi = 10.1159/000431078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though this association has been contested as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Re L, Rowen R, Travagli V | title = Ozone Therapy and Its Use in Medicine | journal = Cardiology | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–100 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26919490 | doi = 10.1159/000443604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1856, just 16 years after its discovery, ozone was first used in a health care setting to disinfect operating rooms and sterilize surgical instruments.&lt;ref name="Chemical Technology Encyclopedia pp 82-3"&gt;Chemical Technology Encyclopedia; Barnes &amp; Noble 1968 vol.&amp;nbsp;1 pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 19th century the use of ozone to disinfect drinking water of bacteria and viruses was well established in mainland Europe.&lt;ref name="Chemical Technology Encyclopedia pp 82-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suchkov BP | title = [Study of the ozonization of drinking water containing pathogenic bacteria and viruses] | language = Russian | journal = Gigiena I Sanitariia | volume = 29 | issue =  | pages = 22–9 | date = June 1964 | pmid = 14235449 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 ''[[The Lancet]]'' published an article describing the administration of ozone for treatment of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Internal Administration of Ozone in the Treatment of Phthisis | journal = Lancet | volume = 140 | issue = 3612 | year = 1892 | pages = 1180–1181 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)92422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During [[World War I]], ozone was tested at [[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] in London as a possible [[disinfectant]] for wounds.  The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with [[antiseptics]], were found preferable.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Jacewicz |first1=Natalie | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Killer of a Cure |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=34–37 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-killer-of-a-cure|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | name-list-format = vanc | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet |volume=188 |issue=4860 | year = 1916 | page = 712 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)31717-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the [[FDA]] prohibited the medical use of ozone, "In any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness", stating "Ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. In order for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present in a concentration far greater than that which can be safely tolerated by man and animals."&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trevor Booker, Tony Parker and Kirk Hinrich.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Trevor Booker]] sets a "screen" on [[Tony Parker]] for [[Kirk Hinrich]]]]
The '''pick and roll''' (also called a '''ball screen''' or '''screen and roll''') in [[basketball]] is an offensive play in which a player sets a [[screen (sports)|screen]] (pick) for a teammate handling the ball and then moves towards the basket (rolls) to receive a pass. In the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the play came into vogue in the 1990s and has developed into the league's most common offensive action.&lt;ref name="abrams"&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents sometimes counter with a '''switch''' of defensive assignments during the play. 

==Execution==
The play (in its elementary form) involves three players. The play begins with a [[Basketball position|defender]] guarding a ballhandler. The ballhandler moves toward a teammate, who sets a "screen" (or "pick") by standing in the way of the defender, who is separated from the moving ballhandler. The defender is forced to choose between guarding the ballhandler or the screener. If the defender tries to guard the ballhandler, then the screener can move toward the basket (as the man defending the screener may try to trap or guard the ballhandler, giving the screener space) sometimes by a foot [[pivot (basketball)|pivot]]&lt;!--per WP:REDLINK--&gt; ("roll"), and is now open for a [[Basketball#Passing|pass]]. If the defender chooses instead to guard the screening teammate, then the ballhandler has an open shot.&lt;ref name="krause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wissel"&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Pick n roll by Bon Custodio.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Bigman sets a "screen" on defender]]The pick and roll is often employed by a shorter [[Basketball position#Back court|guard]] handling the ball and a taller [[Basketball position#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|forward]] or [[Center (basketball)|center]] setting the screen; if the taller defender switches to guard the ballhandler, then the offensive team can have favorable mismatches. The shorter guard has a speed advantage over the taller defender, while the taller forward has a size advantage over the shorter defender.

==Results==
A successful pick and roll play may result in the screener being in position to receive a pass with a clear path for an easy shot, with the chance of drawing a [[Personal foul (basketball)|foul]] as other defenders move towards the play to try to prevent [[Penetration (basketball)|penetration]]. It may alternately lead to the ballhandler being momentarily without a defender, and thus free to pass to any open teammate, or take an [[uncontested shot]], which greatly improves the chance of scoring, again with the chance of drawing a foul as the screened defender hurries to get back into the play.

The success of the strategy depends largely on the ballhandler, who must recognize the situation quickly and make a decision whether to take the shot, pass to the screener who is rolling (if the defender switches) or pass to another open teammate (if other defenders come to help).&lt;ref name="krause"/&gt; The screener also must recognize the open spaces of the court to roll to and be alert to receive the pass and finish the play.

==Other variations==
Variations of the pick and roll are the ''pick and pop'' (or ''pick and fade''), where the screener moves for an open [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] instead of rolling to the basket, or the ''pick and slip'', where the screener fakes setting a screen before slipping behind the defender to accept the pass.

===Pick and pop===
The pick and pop is an offensive play that is a derivative of the classic pick and roll. Instead of rolling toward the basket, however, the player setting the pick moves {'pops'} to an open area of the court to receive a pass from the ballhandler for a jump shot. 

The premise of the two plays is the same: a ballhandler uses a teammate's pick to attract the attention of two defensive players to free his teammate for a scoring opportunity. A successful pick and pop relies on a ballhandler who demands constant defensive attention and a teammate with an accurate jumpshot or a layup if by the rim.

==Notable uses==
In the NBA, [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]] of the [[Utah Jazz]] used this play to great effect in the 1990s,&lt;ref name="krause"&gt;{{Cite book

Stockton, a [[point guard]], was a good shooter and exceptional decision maker and Malone, a [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]], was a great finisher. When they were teammates on the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Steve Nash]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] also utilized the high-screen pick and roll to great success.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt;{{r|rohan20120215}} The [[Golden State Warriors]]' combination of point guard [[Stephen Curry]] and power forward [[Draymond Green]] are noted for their use of a stutter step high pick-and-roll set: Curry's long-range shooting ability often makes him be double-teamed or become trapped, Curry will pass to Green as he rolls out of the screen, allowing Green to lead a 4-on-3 offense with the option to pass to wing shooters, lob an [[alley-oop]] or drive to the basket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingnews.com/nba-news/4662065-draymond-green-stephen-curry-passing-assist-warriors-record Steph Curry dominating; he can thank Draymond Green], Sporting News, 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Synergy Sports Technology]], use of the pick and roll in the NBA rose from 15.6% of total plays in the [[2004–05 NBA season]] to 18.6% in the [[2008–09 NBA season]].&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt;

The pick and roll is also used extensively in [[box lacrosse]], the sport played in the [[National Lacrosse League]].

'''Stade Tata Raphaël''' (Father Raphael Stadium) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  Originally known as '''Stade Roi Baudouin''' ([[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] Stadium) when it was inaugurated in 1952 and '''Stade du 20 Mai''' (20 May Stadium) in 1967, it was used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fussballtempel.net/caf/listecaf.html|title=Football stadiums of the world – Stadium List Africa {{!}} Football stadiums of the world|website=www.fussballtempel.net|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium's most famous event was [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] [[boxing]] match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]] for the Undisputed [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Championship that took place on October 30, 1974. 60,000 people attended the boxing match. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2017/04/26/20-biggest-ever-boxing-attendances-history-does-joshua-v-klitschko/george-foreman-v-muhammad-ali/|title=The 20 biggest-ever boxing attendances in history - where does Joshua vs Klitschko rank?|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was ranked as a great upset, Ali knocked out the previously undefeated Foreman in eight rounds. The associated music festival, [[Zaire 74]], that took place at the stadium six weeks prior to the boxing match, included such stars as [[James Brown]] and [[B.B. King]].

Following the downfall of President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s regime in 1997, the stadium was renamed '''Stade Tata Raphaël''' after [[Raphaël de la Kethulle de Ryhove]], initiator of the stadium in 1952.

The stadium was also the setting for a documentary film about Congolese women's boxing, ''[[Victoire Terminus]]'' (2008).&lt;ref name=var&gt;{{cite news|title=Victoire Terminus|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936145?refcatid=31|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|format=review|date=9 February 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209011105/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936145?refcatid=31|archive-date=2013-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel, ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]'' (1998), includes a passage describing the Rumble in the Jungle taking place at the Stade du 20 Mai (20 May Stadium) while political prisoners are locked up downstairs.

'''Telenor Arena''', sometimes referred to as '''Fornebu Arena''', is a multi-purpose indoor [[arena]] located at [[Fornebu]] in [[Bærum]], outside [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It serves as a venue for a variety of events, including concerts, exhibitions, action shows, family shows, TV and sport. It has a capacity for 15,000 spectators for sports and 23,000 for concerts, including 40 [[luxury boxes]] and [[club seating]] for 1,200. The venue has a fixed roof and an asphalt floor. The venue was opened ahead of the [[2009 Tippeligaen|2009]] Norwegian [[Association football|football]] season as a replacement for [[Nadderud Stadion]]. It cost 585 million [[Norwegian krone]]r (NOK) to build, of which NOK&amp;nbsp;300 million was for the sports venue.

During the 2000s, Nadderud was below standards for play in the top national league. Fornebu was at the time undergoing an [[urban redevelopment]]; after several years of negotiations and public grants, Stabæk secured a lot in 2004. Construction started in 2007. In 2010, a disagreement arose between the club and venue-owner [[Kjell Chr. Ulrichsen]], with the latter demanding that the team leave the venue to allow for more event revenue. Telenor Arena has hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], as well as concerts by artists and bands of international fame, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Adele]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Roger Waters]] (the Wall tour), [[Rihanna]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Kanye West]], [[Metallica]], [[AC/DC]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. [[Telenor]] holds the [[naming rights]].

==History==

===Planning===
Stabæk traditionally has played their home games at [[Nadderud Stadion]], a municipal [[multi-purpose stadium]] at [[Bekkestua]]. Following the club's rapid ascent from lower divisions to the top league during the first half of the 1990s, Nadderud became in need of upgrades, resulting in a new main grandstand opening in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nadderud stadion in "new look" |last=Nesbø |first=Knut |authorlink=Knut Nesbø |date=14 February 1996 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |page=15 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium remained severely lacking adequate facilities for professional football, and fell short of increasing requirements from the [[Football Association of Norway]] (NFF).&lt;ref name=utelukket&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/reservearena-er-utelukket-for-stabek-1.5871251 |title=Reservearena er utelukket for Stabæk |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Lars |date=8 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBf2Tapj?url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/reservearena-er-utelukket-for-stabek-1.5871251 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, a redevelopment of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 Stabæk players launched the idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu, which became subject to an [[urban redevelopment]] project after the 1998 closing of [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]]. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a [[retractable roof]].&lt;ref name=j13&gt;Jensen, 2008: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed amenities were [[movable seating]] which would also allow the stadium to both host [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and be configured as an intimate football stadium.&lt;ref name=hjemmearena&gt;{{cite news |title=Fornebu blir hjemmearena fra 2004 |last=Sandven |first=Arild |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=11 May 2001 |page=41 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea called for [[Bruce Springsteen]] to hold a concert before the first match, which would be played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=j13 /&gt; Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also the idea of having a retractable roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 2008: 258–59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fornebu (luft).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Fornebu]] with Telenor Arena to the right]]
In May 2001, Oslo City Council voted to sell their properties at Fornebu to Fornebu Boligspar (FB), which again had agreements to sell a lot for the stadium to Stabæk.&lt;ref name=hjemmearena /&gt; In November 2002, [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] concluded that [[Norrønafly]] had the right to continue leasing a hangar—located at the planned location of the venue—until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hangar stopper Stabæks stadion  |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=17 November 2002 |page=47 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2003, Stabæk was in financial difficulties, and investor [[Kjell Chr. Ulrichsen]] bought shares for NOK&amp;nbsp;10 million to avoid bankruptcy; these shares had the [[option (law)|option]] to be converted to shares in the arena company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stabæk har også en rik onkel Legger 10 millioner i nytt Stabæk-stadion  |last=Skomakerstuen |first=Bjørn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=25 June 2003 |page=14 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fornebu Boligspar later determined that it was more profitable to build apartments at the arena site. Negotiations started between the club, the property company and Mayor [[Odd Reinsfelt]]. In November 2003, it was announced that a compromise was reached whereby Fornebu Boligspar would give the lot free to Stabæk, in exchange for a lot nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ordfører Odd Reinsfelt fant løsningen for Stabæk og Fornebu Boligspar |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=27 November 2003 |page=26 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later the compromise was rejected by FB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ingen enighet om Fornebu Arena  |last=Fredagsvik |first=Jarle |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=11 December 2003 |page=28 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new compromise was announced on 29 June 2004, whereby FB would give 50 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) and a lot free to Stabæk in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Enige om stadionløsning på Fornebu |agency=[[Aftenposten]] |date=29 June 2004 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following day the parties announced that they were not able to agree on the risk, as Stabæk demanded that FB take the full risk in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bråstopp for Stabæk på Fornebu  |last=Bugge |first=Mette |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 June 2004 |page=21 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Stabæk started negotiating with [[IT Fornebu]] to take over a lot they owned. They needed a {{convert|300|ha}} lot which would have a market value of between NOK&amp;nbsp;60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by "maneuver in gray areas within the margins".&lt;!--"bevege seg i gråsoner innen marginene"--&gt;&lt;ref name=grey&gt;{{cite news |title=Nytt håp for Stabæk på Fornebu |last=Thoresen |first=Thore-Erik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2 July 2004 |page=32 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was further pressured by NFF, who were going to limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria.&lt;ref name=grey /&gt; On 29 October, FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK&amp;nbsp;50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a re-regulation of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated that it would not be possible for construction to start until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stabæk vant – får drømmearenaen |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 October 2004 |page=18 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green. Until Stabæk's proposal was made, UEFA had not thought that anyone would build a pitch with a non-green turf, and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nei til blått |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=10 November 2004 |page=32 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006, after discussion about the planned [[Fornebu Line]]—a [[people mover]] which would connect Fornebu to [[Lysaker]]—stopped the regulation plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreløpig stopp for Stabæks stadion |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=18 October 2006 |page=48 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stabæk fikk ja til nytt stadion |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=9 November 2006 |page=48 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December, Stabæk announced that the financing was secured.&lt;ref name=bygg550&gt;{{cite news |title=Stabæk- bygg til 550 mill.|last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=23 December 2006 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects were HRTB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrtb.no/prosjekter/ku_lo_fornebu.html |title=Telenor Arena |publisher=HRTB |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yDR0YrlD?url=http://www.hrtb.no/prosjekter/ku_lo_fornebu.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main contractor was [[NCC Construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc.no/no/Konsepter/Listpage/Bygg-og-Anlegg/telenor-arena/ |title=Telenor Arena |publisher=[[NCC Construction]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yCoseyrC?url=http://www.ncc.no/no/Konsepter/Listpage/Bygg-og-Anlegg/telenor-arena/ |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[dome]]d stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=– Fotball blir innendørsidrett NFF-sjef tror på kunstgress og tak  |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2 December 2005 |page=28 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the building boom, concrete elements needed for construction to start meant that the rest of the construction was delayed.&lt;ref name=bygg550 /&gt; The cornerstone was laid on 5 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Motto for Fornebu Arena |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=6 September 2007 |page=48 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Stabæk announced they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship agreement with the [[telecommunications company]] [[Telenor]], where the latter would pay up to NOK&amp;nbsp;115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dagensit.no/bransje/article1431478.ece |title=Telenor betaler 115 millioner for stadion |work=Dagens IT |last=Riise |first=Kari Vartdal |date=24 June 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from [[Scandinavian Property Development]] to [[KLP Eiendom]].&lt;ref name=handel&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/eiendom/naering/article1625512.ece |title=Selger Fornebu-eiendommer |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=6 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger [[seating capacity]], an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud.&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/ikke-skriv-historien-om-arenaen-enna-1.5787282 |title=Ikke skriv historien om arenaen ennå |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Schultz |first=Einar |date=8 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yCoWHGZg?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/ikke-skriv-historien-om-arenaen-enna-1.5787282 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, and a large number of police officers have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.&lt;ref name=schultz /&gt;

===Football versus event controversy===
In October 2009, ten individuals bought the operation company of the club and signed a 40-year lease for the use of the arena for Stabæk's home matches, as well as the right to use the facility for certain other activities. This contract has a revenue of NOK&amp;nbsp;9 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1771727.ece |title=10 personer overtar Stabæk |last=Sparre |first=Martin Riber |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=20 October 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Stabæk Holding]] had a deficit of NOK&amp;nbsp;66.1 million, while Stabæk Fotball lost NOK&amp;nbsp;23.6 million.&lt;ref name=kastetut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-kan-bli-kastet-ut-av-telenor-arena-1.5774178 |title=Stabæk kan bli kastet ut av Telenor Arena |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |last2=Hagerup |first2=Mari |last3=Harnes |first3=Nils H. |last4=Bjørnstad |first4=Andreas |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBG8nJAJ?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-kan-bli-kastet-ut-av-telenor-arena-1.5774178 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the operating company running, Ulrichsen increased the company's share capital by NOK&amp;nbsp;73 million from late 2009 through late 2010.&lt;ref name=selgesegut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/ulrichsen-vurderer-a-selge-seg-ut-1.5860917 |title=Ulrichsen vurderer å selge seg ut |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBQQXLiy?url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/ulrichsen-vurderer-a-selge-seg-ut-1.5860917 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Telenor arena 0641.jpg|thumb|left|Training at the venue]]
On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding stated that they were near a bankruptcy, and that they intended to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair [[Diderik Schnitler]] in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common one to two years in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches.&lt;ref name=kastetut /&gt; The holding company stated that they might have to file for [[bankruptcy]]. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7366817 |title=Stabæk kan bli kastet ut av Telenor arena |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Jenssen |first=Grethe Kielland |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBG0uT5T?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7367402 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stabæk's director of sports, [[Inge André Olsen]], stated that returning to Nadderud was not an option, as it had too little capacity and insufficient facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7367402 |title=– Uaktuelt å gå tilbake til Nadderud |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Haram |first=Ingrid Vestre |last2=Rismyhr |first2=Kim Peder |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBG0uT5T?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7367402 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Should Nadderud be used, it would have to be rebuilt, with new grandstands under roofs, VIP seating, a new parking house and new change room, which would cost NOK&amp;nbsp;100 million. Because of building permits, construction would take two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/utelukker-ikke-nadderud-retur-1.5774883 |title=Utelukker ikke Nadderud-retur |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Hagerup |first=Mari |last2=Johnsen |first2=Morten Gisle |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBJZX05b?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/utelukker-ikke-nadderud-retur-1.5774883 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadderud is also not approved to host games in the Premier League, so Stabæk would have to either play their games at [[Ullevaal Stadion]] in Oslo or [[Marienlyst Stadion]] in [[Drammen]].&lt;ref name=kastetut /&gt; Telenor stated that if Stabæk moved, they would have to re-negotiate the naming rights agreement for the arena, as the value of the contract was largely based on the naming exposure of Stabæk playing in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/telenor-vil-vurdere-sin-sponsoravtale-1.5775814 |title=Telenor vil vurdere sin sponsoravtale |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Harnes |first=Nils H. |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBJuNO3X?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/telenor-vil-vurdere-sin-sponsoravtale-1.5775814 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also stated that they had difficulty understanding the argumentation from the holding company, as there was no football being played October and March, but that the venue, which has the largest capacity for indoor concerts in the Oslo area, failed to attract large artists, such as [[Rihanna]], during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/telenor-sjef-skuffet-over-arenadrift-1.5908351 |title=Telenor-sjef skuffet over arenadrift |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Olsson |first=Svein |date=22 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBL8Tlc6?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/telenor-sjef-skuffet-over-arenadrift-1.5908351 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball stated that they were willing to move their training, [[Norwegian Football Cup]] and [[UEFA]] matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a compromise to free up more available time in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-villig-til-a-flytte-treninger-til-nadderud-1.5860934 |title=Stabæk villig til å flytte treninger til Nadderud |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |last2=Hagerup |first2=Mari |last3=Harnes |first3=Nils H. |last4=Bjørnstad |first4=Andreas |date=4 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBG8nJAJ?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-kan-bli-kastet-ut-av-telenor-arena-1.5774178 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup.&lt;ref name=utelukket /&gt; In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the right to lease the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A [[preliminary injunction]] for this was granted by [[Asker and Bærum District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/derfor-er-arenastriden-i-retten-1.5898362 |title=Derfor er arenastriden i retten |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Olsson |first=Svein |last2=Johnsen |first2=Morten Gisle |date=22 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yCrROILU?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/derfor-er-arenastriden-i-retten-1.5898362 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball officials said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK&amp;nbsp;200 million plus grants worth NOK&amp;nbsp;50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/stabek-slar-kraftig-tilbake-mot-arena-eier-1.5893323 |title=Stabæk slår kraftig tilbake mot Arena-eier |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Holmlund |first=Bjørnar |date=16 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBPqKqTj?url=http://www.budstikka.no/sport/stab-k/stabek-slar-kraftig-tilbake-mot-arena-eier-1.5893323 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book value of the venue was NOK&amp;nbsp;303 million at the end of 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that. The bank [[DnB NOR]] held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK&amp;nbsp;260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK&amp;nbsp;60.1 million.&lt;ref name=verdilos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/tingretten-arenaen-er-verdilos-1.5917184 |title=Tingretten: Arenaen er verdiløs |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |date=27 December 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yDNcR6jH?url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/tingretten-arenaen-er-verdilos-1.5917184 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2011, the parts announced that they had reached a compromise. Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena for at least the [[2011 Norwegian Premier League|2011 season]]. In addition, the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK&amp;nbsp;20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, but at the same time move the risk from Stabæk Holding to Stabæk Fotball. If the club declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the [[2012 Norwegian Premier League|2012 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-far-spille-pa-telenor-arena-1.5940071 |title=Stabæk får spille på Telenor Arena |work=[[Budstikka]] |last=Johnsen |first=Morten Gisle |date=7 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBPQBlcj?url=http://www.budstikka.no/konomi/stabek-far-spille-pa-telenor-arena-1.5940071 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7453992 |title=Stabæk blir på Telenor Arena i 2011 |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Jenssen |first=Grethe Kielland |last2=Rismyhr |first2=Kim Peder |date=7 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 April 2011 |archivedate=24 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yBPVtCh7?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/1.7453992 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June, Stabæk announced that they would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium. The necessary NOK&amp;nbsp;35 million would entail a risk the club was not willing to take. The club stated that they hoped they could remain at the stadium by establishing a [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen. If this does not work out, the club will have to relocate from the 2012 season. The club is then considering relocating back to Nadderud, to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst. The club estimates that any relocation would result in the club losing half their revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/dnaktiv/article2172854.ece |title=Gir opp Telenor Arena |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=30 June 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Smxcgei?url=http://www.dn.no/dnaktiv/article2172854.ece |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011, losing 1–2 against [[Haugesund FK|Haugesund]].

The [[Norwegian Handball Federation]] announced in May 2013 that the arena would be used for a four-nation men's handball tournament, Bring Cup, in November. The federation stated that they would use the tournament to evaluate if the venue was suitable as a new national arena for handball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/100Sport/handball/-322217_1.snd |title=Telenor Arena blir storstue for håndball |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Sandvik |first=Trond |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |archivedate=23 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LL7sv8zz?url=http://www.aftenposten.no/100Sport/handball/-322217_1.snd |deadurl=no |language=Norwegian |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue received mixed reviews.

==Transport==
[[Ruter]] bus 31 is a high-frequency service which runs from the city center of Oslo via [[Lysaker Station]] to Fornebu. During regular schedule it stops just outside the stadium; however, on matchdays it stops further away because of traffic. Lysaker Station is served by both the [[Oslo Commuter Rail]] and selected intercity and regional trains. Dedicated football buses are operated by Ruter to Stabæk home games. There are 1,500 parking spaces immediately near the venue, although additional parking is available at IT Fornebu and at Lysaker, which are a seven- and fifteen-minute walk away, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telenorarena.no/en/index.php?l1=78&amp;l2=96&amp;pageID=30 |title=How to get here |publisher=Telenor Arena |accessdate=19 April 2011 |archivedate=19 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y3dr1SQJ?url=http://www.telenorarena.no/en/index.php?l1=78&amp;l2=96&amp;pageID=30 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fornebu Line is under planning, and would be built either as a [[light rail]] or a [[rapid transit]], which would allow rail transport from the city center of Oslo and Lysaker to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruter.no/Global/dokumenter/dokumentvedlegg/fornebubane/Fornebu_sluttrapport_des2009.pdf |title=Fornebubanen Sluttrapport trasé og konsekvensutredning |publisher=[[Ruter]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 April 2011 |archivedate=19 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y3e40Kkc?url=http://ruter.no/Global/dokumenter/dokumentvedlegg/fornebubane/Fornebu_sluttrapport_des2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena often gets uncomfortably hot when the capacity is full and the organisers were criticized for the water priced at 44 NOK (approximately $7,2) for a cup with water.

'''Viljandi linnastaadion''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Viljandi]], [[Estonia]].  It is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and hosts the matches of [[FC Viljandi (2011)|FC Viljandi]].  The stadium has 1,006 seats of which 400 are under the roof.

Officially, the '''FFA Technical Center-Academy Stadium''' ({{lang-hy|ՀՖՖ Տեխնիկական-կենտրոն ակադեմիայի մարզադաշտ}}), commonly known as the '''Yerevan Football Academy Stadium''' or the '''Avan Academy Stadium''', is an all-seater [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. It is located in the northern [[Avan District]] of the city, within the Technical Center-Academy complex of the [[Football Federation of Armenia]]. The stadium is sometimes known as the Avan Football Academy Stadium.

==Overview==
[[File:FFA academy stadium Yerevan, 08.08.2015.jpg|The main stand|thumb|left]]
The 1,428-seated stadium&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football365.am/wp/?p=115586 Football 365 article about the stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; was officially opened on 29 April 2013 by the Mayor of Yerevan [[Taron Margaryan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armsport.am/hy/news/2013/04/29/%D5%8F%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B8%D5%B6-%D5%84%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A3%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B5%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%A8-%D5%AF%D5%BF%D6%80%D5%A5%D6%81-%D4%B1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%A4%D5%A5%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%AB-%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%BC%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B5%D6%81-%D5%B4%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A6%D5%A1%D5%A4%D5%A1%D5%B7%D5%BF%D5%AB-%D5%A2%D5%A1%D6%81%D5%B4%D5%A1%D5%B6-%D5%AF%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B4%D5%AB%D6%80-%D5%AA%D5%A1%D5%BA%D5%A1%D5%BE%D5%A5%D5%B6%D5%A8/297265 Taron Margaryan at the Football Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first official match in the stadium took place earlier on 13 April 2013, between [[FC Pyunik]] and [[FC Banants]] within the frames of the [[Armenian Premier League]]. The match ended up with a result of 4-0, in favour of Pyunik.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armsport.am/hy/photos/%D5%93%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%AB%D5%AF-%D4%B3%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%B1%D5%A1%D5%BD%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%9D-1-1/2497 Pyunik Vs Gandzasar at the Football Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has served as the home venue of the [[Armenian Premier League]] side [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] between 2013 and 2017.

It is currently the home ground of the newly-founded [[FC Avan Academy]], playing at the [[Armenian First League]].

The stadium is part of the [[Yerevan Football Academy|Technical Center-Academy]] of the [[Football Federation of Armenia]] which was officially opened on 1 September 2010 by the [[UEFA]] president [[Michel Platini]]. The centre is home to the main football stadium, 9 football training pitches (8 natural and 1 artificial), 4 outdoor tennis courts, an indoor sports hall, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, fitness centre and a 4-star hotel with 49 guest rooms.
