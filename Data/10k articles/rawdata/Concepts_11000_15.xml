      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3472">In [[mathematics]], an '''adjunction space''' (or '''attaching space''') is a common construction in [[topology]] where one [[topological space]] is attached or "glued" onto another. Specifically, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''Y''. Let ''f'' : ''A'' → ''X'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous map]] (called the '''attaching map'''). One forms the adjunction space ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' by taking the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identifying]] ''y'' with ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in ''A''. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;X\cup_f Y = (X\amalg Y) / \{f(A) \sim A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, the adjunction is written as &lt;math&gt;X+\!_f \,Y&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, one may think of ''Y'' as being glued onto ''X'' via the map ''f''.

As a set, ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' consists of the disjoint union of ''X'' and (''Y'' − ''A''). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where ''A'' is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of ''Y'' one can show that the map ''X'' → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is a closed [[embedding]] and (''Y'' − ''A'') → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is an open embedding.

==Examples==
*A common example of an adjunction space is given when ''Y'' is a closed ''n''-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] (or ''cell'') and ''A'' is the boundary of the ball, the (''n''−1)-[[sphere]]. Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a [[CW complex]].
*Adjunction spaces are also used to define [[connected sum]]s of [[manifold]]s. Here, one first removes open balls from ''X'' and ''Y'' before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.
*If ''A'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the [[wedge sum]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.
*If ''X'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient ''Y''/''A''.

==Categorical description==
The attaching construction is an example of a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. That is to say, the adjunction space is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to following [[commutative diagram]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:AdjunctionSpace-01.svg|175px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Here ''i'' is the [[inclusion map]] and φ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of ''X'' and ''Y''. One can form a more general pushout by replacing ''i'' with an arbitrary continuous map ''g'' &amp;mdash; the construction is similar. Conversely, if ''f'' is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue ''X'' and ''Y'' together along their common subspace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">An '''adventive species''' is a species that has arrived in a new locality. It may have had help from humans as an [[introduced species]] or it may not.

The term is now used by some writers in a more restricted sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A.P. 1916. "[http://psyche.entclub.org/pdf/23/23-178.pdf A New England orthopteran adventive]". ''Psyche'' 23: 178-179. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townes H.K. 1947. "[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/16163/PHES13_105-106.pdf?sequence=1 A ''Eumenes'' wasp and six adventive Ichneumonidae new to Hawaii (Hymenoptera)]". ''Proceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society'' 13: 105-105 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton C.E. 1964. "[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/6(4)-689.pdf Highlights in the history of entomology in Hawaii 1778-1963]". ''Pacific Insects'' 6: 689-729 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J.H., McCoy E.D. 1995. "[http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/74655/72313 Introduction to insect behavioral ecology: The good, the bad, and the beautiful: Non-indigenous species in Florida. Invasive adventive insects and other organisms in Florida]". ''Florida Entomologist'' 78: 1-15 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the [[cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis''), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the [[kudzu]] vine (''Pueraria lobata''), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.&lt;ref&gt;Martin N.A., Paynter Q. 2013. Predicting risk from adventive herbivores to New Zealand indigenous plants. ''New Zealand Entomologist'': 1-8. DOI:10.1080/00779962.2012.759308&lt;/ref&gt;

The later and more limited concept is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]]; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive.&lt;ref name="WHS1999"&gt;Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii'', Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant cultivation|Cultivated]] plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in [[biological control]] programs eventually become naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;Stiling, P. 1993. Why do natural enemies fail in classical Biological Control Programs? ''American Entomologist''. 39:31-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can readily see how this second (later) concept applies to cultivated plants. Those that grow within the confines of culture are ‘adventive’; those that grow outside those confines are ‘naturalized’. But the concept falls apart when applied to the far more numerous species of invertebrate animals and microorganisms: extremely few of these are cultured, and by the time they are detected in nature they tend to be established (‘naturalized’).

'''Aerobic granular reactor''' is a type of waste treatment facility.

==Overview==
[[Sewage treatment]] plants (STP) based on [[activated sludge]] often cover large surface areas, necessitated mainly by the large [[settling tank]]s. To build compact STP’s, [[biomass]] can be grown as [[biofilms]] on a carrier material, or as fast settling [[Aerobic granulation|aerobic granular sludge]] without a carrier.  Recent research showed the advantages of a discontinuously fed system, in which it is possible to grow stable granulated sludge under aerobic conditions.

Simultaneous [[Chemical oxygen demand]], and [[Nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus]] removal, can be easily integrated in a discontinuous fed system.  Because of the high settling capacity of the granules, the use of a traditional settler is unnecessary.  Therefore the installation can be built very compact, needing only 20% of the surface area of conventional activated sludge systems.

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], '''aparigraha''' ({{lang-sa|अपरिग्रह}}) is the [[virtue]] of [[Non-possession|non-possessiveness]], non-grasping or non-greediness.&lt;ref name=artidhand&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigrah is the opposite of ''parigrah'', and refers to keeping the desire for possessions to what is necessary or important, depending on one's life stage and context. The [[precept]] of ''aparigraha'' is a self-restraint ([[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]) from the type of [[greed]] and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Lauricella (2013), Judging by the way animals are treated: Gandhi as a manifestation of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Gandhi Marg Quarterly, 35(4): 655–674&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of [[dāna]] (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;SC Jain (2012), Spiritual Guidance in Achieving and Sustaining Organizational Excellence, Purushartha: A Journal of Management Ethics and Spirituality, 4(2): 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Kazanas (2013), Vedic Tradition and Civilization, in On India: Self-Image and Counter-image (Editor: AN Balslev), SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-8132110927}}, pages 27-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Aparigraha is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] in Sanskrit, made of "''a-''" and "''parigrah''". The prefix "''a-''" means "non-", so "''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;parigrah''" is the opposite of "''parigrah''", so ''aparigraha'' is speech and actions that oppose and negate ''parigraha.''

The word ''parigrah'' means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others.&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt; The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes.&lt;ref name=kjain&gt;K Jain, Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 30, Issue 11, pages 139-146&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first ''[[tirthankara]]'' in [[Jainism]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-YnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;dq=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEuaq_ofnaAhUVTI8KHUgCDagQ6AEIQjAG&lt;/ref&gt;

Monier-Williams states that the word ''"parigraha"'' has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, ''Parigraha'', A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 593&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Brahmana]]s and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt; In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt;

The virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as "abstaining from accepting gifts",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm The Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali] Verse 2.30&lt;/ref&gt; "not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person", and "not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted".&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/178/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 178-182&lt;/ref&gt; The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness,&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Mathur et al (2010), New Horizons in Indian Management, {{ISBN|978-8178357119}}, page 280&lt;/ref&gt; and non-[[compulsive hoarding|possessiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers | author = Nancy Gerstein | page = 140 | year = 2005 | publisher = Pendragon | isbn = 978-0-9722809-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of "letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Taylor (2008), End-of-Life Yoga Therapy: Exploring Life and Death, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF YOGA THERAPY, No. 18, pages 97-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Jainism}}
Aparigraha is one of the virtues in [[Jainism]]. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'') and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (''parimita-parigraha'') and limiting one’s desires (''iccha-parimana'').&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt;

In Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml Aparigraha - non-acquisition], Jainism, BBC Religions&lt;/ref&gt; Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy.&lt;ref name=mjwcr&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof (Editors), Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761927297}}, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt; Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life.&lt;ref name=valueeduc&gt;MR Mehta (in Editor: P. Kapur), Value Education, Volume 1, {{ISBN|81-7835-566-3}}, pages 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]], Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt;
==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]] (II.30), ''aparigraha'' is listed as the fifth [[Yamas]] or code of self-restraint, after with  [[Ahimsa]] (nonviolence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), [[Asteya]] (not stealing), and [[Brahmacharya]] (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein and Jeanine Miller (1997), The Essence of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-0892817382}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः ॥३०॥

Non-violence, Non-falsehood, Non-stealing, Non-cheating (celibacy, chastity), and Non-possessiveness are the five Yamas. (30)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/ Yoga Sutra], Sadhana Pada, [[sutra]] 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (''yamas'', "the don'ts") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (''niyamas'', "the dos") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten ''yamas'' and ''niyamas'', these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clarke (2014), Handbook of Research on Development and Religion, Elgar Reference, {{ISBN|978-0857933577}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Hornett (2013), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and the forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer, {{ISBN|978-3642324444}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-69&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wood states,&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; ''aparigraha'' is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in "acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://yogainternational.com/article/view/non-possessiveness-let-go-of-what-keeps-you-from-moving-forward Non-Possessiveness: Let Go of What Keeps You From Moving Forward] Irene Petryszak, Yoga International (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

With constancy of ''aparigraha'', a spiritual illumination of the how and why of motives and birth emerges. (39)

Restraint from possessiveness and greed, or ''aparigraha'', leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of [[Sādhanā]], path of spiritual existence.&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; In outer world, ''aparigraha'' manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.&lt;ref&gt;KM George (2014), Toward a Eucharistic Missiology, International Review of Mission, 103(2), 309-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to charity and conservation==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Shonil A. Bhagwat, Yoga and Sustainability, The Journal of Yoga, Fall/Winter 2008, Volume 7, Number 1, pages 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.&lt;ref&gt;C. Betal (2008), CONSERVATION OF ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH YOGIC LIFESTYLE, Journal of Environmental Research And Development Vol, 2(4), pages 905-911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DK Taneja (2014), Yoga and health, Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39(2), pages 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.

[[File:Apollo_Tityos_Met_08.258.21.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo]] killing [[Tityos]]. Lower tier, side A of an Attic red-figure calyx-krater. Attributed to the Nekyia Painter]] 

The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

===Albert Szent-Györgyi===
[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lord Risbabhdev moving over golden lotus after attaining Omniscience.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicitng [[Rishabhanatha]], the first Arihant of the present half cycle of time (''[[avasarpini]]'') moving over lotus after attaining omniscience.]]
{{Jainism}}
'''''Arihant''''' ({{lang-pka|arihant|italic=yes}}, {{lang-sa|árhat|italic=yes}} "conqueror") is a [[soul]] who has conquered inner passions such as attachment, anger, pride and greed. Having destroyed four inimical karmas, they realize pure self.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} ''Arihants'' are also called ''kevalins'' ([[omniscience|omniscient]] beings) as they possess ''[[kevala jnana]]'' (pure infinite knowledge).{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} An ''arihant'' is also called a '''''jina''''' ("victor"). At the end of their life, ''arihants'' destroy remaining ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and attain ''[[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation) and become ''[[Siddha#Jainism|siddhas]]''. ''Arihantas'' have a body while ''siddhas'' are bodiless pure spirit. The [[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]], the fundamental prayer dedicated to ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' (five supreme beings), begins with ''Ṇamō arihantāṇaṁ'', "obeisance to the arihants".

''Kevalins'' - omniscient beings - are said to be of two kinds{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
# ''[[Tirthankara]] kevalī'':  24 human spiritual guides who after attaining omniscience teach the path to salvation.{{sfn|Rankin|2013|p=40}}
# ''Sāmānya kevalī'': ''Kevalins'' who are concerned with their own liberation.

According to Jains, every soul has the potential to become an ''arihant''. A soul which destroys all [[kashaya (Jainism)|''kashayas'']] or inner enemies like [[anger]], ego, [[deception]], and [[greed]], responsible for the perpetuation of ignorance, becomes an ''arihant''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} 

== Philosophy ==
According to Jain texts, [[omniscience]] is attained on the destruction of four types of ''karmas''– deluding, the knowledge-obscuring, the perception-obscuring and the obstructive ''karmas'', in the order mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality|last=Jain|first=S.A.|year=1960|publisher=Vira Sasana Sangha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRIaAAAAMAAJ |quote=Non-Copyright |p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''arihants'' are said to be free from the following eighteen imperfections:{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}}

# ''janma'' – (re)birth;
# ''jarā'' – old-age;
# ''triśā'' – thirst;
# ''kśudhā'' – hunger;
# ''vismaya'' – astonishment;
# ''arati'' – displeasure;
# ''kheda'' – regret;
# ''roga'' – sickness;
# ''śoka'' – grief;
# ''mada'' – pride;
# ''moha'' – delusion;
# ''bhaya'' – fear;
# ''nidrā'' – sleep;
# ''cintā'' – anxiety;
# ''sveda'' – perspiration;
# ''rāga'' – attachment;
# ''dveśa'' – aversion; and
# ''maraņa'' – death.

=== Omniscience ===
{{Main|Kevala Jnana}}
[[File:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|Kevala Jñāna of Mahavira]]
In Jainism, omniscience is said to be the infinite, all-embracing knowledge that reflects, as it were in a mirror, all substances and their infinite modes, extending through the past, the present and the future.{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=2}} According to Jain texts, omniscience is the natural attribute of the pure souls. The self-attaining omniscience becomes a ''kevalin''.

The four infinitudes (''ananta cātuṣṭaya'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}} 
# ''ananta jñāna'', infinite knowledge
# ''ananta darśana'', perfect perception due to the destruction of all darśanāvaraṇīya karmas
# ''ananta sukha'', infinite bliss
# ''ananta vīrya'' – infinite energy

== Tirthankaras ==
{{Main|Tirthankara}}
[[File:Vardhaman Keezhakuyilkudi.jpg|thumb|right|Image of ''Vardhaman Mahāvīra'', the 24th and last tirthankara of present half time cycle]]
Those ''arihants'' who re-establish the Jain faith are called ''tirthankaras''. ''Tirthankaras'' revitalize the ''[[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]'', the fourfold order consisting of male saints (''[[Sadhu|sādhu]]s''), female saints (''sādhvis''), male householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'') and female householders (''srāvika'').

The first ''tirthankara ''of the current time cycle was [[Rishabhanatha|Ṛṣabhanātha]], and the twenty-fourth and last Tirthankara was [[Mahavira]], who lived from 599 BCE to 527 BCE.

[[File:Samavasarana.jpg|thumb|[[Samavasarana]] (divine preaching hall) where omniscient ''Arihantas'' preach]]

Jain texts mention forty-six attributes of ''arihants'' or ''tirthankaras''. These attributes comprise four infinitudes (''ananta chatushtaya''), thirty-four miraculous happenings (''atiśaya''), and eight splendours (''prātihārya'').{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}}

The eight splendours (''prātihārya'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=181}}
# ''aśokavrikśa'' – the [[Ashoka tree]];
#  ''siṃhāsana''– bejeweled throne;
#  ''chatra'' – three-tier canopy;
#  ''bhāmadal'' – halo of unmatched luminance;
#  ''divya dhvani'' – divine voice of the Lord without lip movement;
#  ''puśpavarśā'' – shower of fragrant flowers;
#  ''camara'' – waving of sixty-four majestic hand-fans; and
#  ''dundubhi'' – dulcet sound of kettle-drums and other musical instruments.

== Liberation ==
At the time of ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]'' (final release), the ''arihant'' sheds off the remaining four ''aghati karmas'':
# ''Nama'' (physical structure forming) karma
# ''[[Gotra]]'' (status forming) karma,
# ''Vedniya'' (pain and pleasure causing) karma,
# ''Ayushya'' (life span determining) karma.

These four karmas do not affect the true nature of the soul and are therefore called ''aghati karmas''.

== Worship ==
[[File:Hatigumfa.jpg|thumb|[[Hathigumpha inscription]] of [[Kharavela|King Khāravela]] at [[Udayagiri_and_Khandagiri_Caves|Udayagiri Caves]], second Century BCE, starts with [[Namokar Mantra]] ]]
In the Ṇamōkāra mantra, ''Namo Arihantanam, Namo Siddhanam'', Jains worship the arihants first and then to the ''siddhas'', even though the latter are perfected souls who have destroyed all karmas but arihants are considered to be at a higher spiritual stage than ''siddhas''. Since ''siddhas'' have attained ultimate liberation, they probably are not directly accessible but may be through the wisdom they passed on. However arihants are accessible for spiritual guidance of human society until their nirvana. The ''[[Dravyasamgraha|Dravyasaṃgraha]]'', a major [[Jain literature|Jain text]], states:
{{quote|Having destroyed the four inimical varieties of karmas (''ghātiyā karmas''), possessed of infinite faith, happiness, knowledge and power, and housed in most auspicious body (''paramaudārika śarīra''), that pure soul of the World Teacher (Arihant) should be meditated on.|''{{IAST|Dravyasaṃgraha}}'' (50){{sfn|Jain|2013|p=177}}}}

The red self-intersecting torus is the σ=45° isosurface, the blue sphere is the τ=0.5 isosurface, and the yellow half-plane is the φ=60° isosurface.  The green half-plane marks the ''x''-''z'' plane, from which φ is measured.  The black point is located at the intersection of the red, blue and yellow isosurfaces, at Cartesian coordinates roughly (0.841, -1.456, 1.239).]]

'''Bispherical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis that connects the two foci.  Thus, the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in [[bipolar coordinates]] remain points (on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the axis of rotation) in the bispherical coordinate system.

==Definition==
The most common definition of bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the foci

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate surfaces===
Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to intersecting tori of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} +
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a \cot \sigma \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sin^2 \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the foci but are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting spheres of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( x^2 + y^2 \right) +
\left( z - a \coth \tau \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sinh^2 \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the foci. The centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; spheres lie along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, whereas the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; tori are centered in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane.

===Inverse formulae===

The formulae for the inverse transformation are:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \arccos\left(\dfrac{R^2-a^2}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \operatorname{arsinh}\left(\dfrac{2az}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \operatorname{atan}\left(\dfrac{y}{x}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q=\sqrt{(R^2+a^2)^2-(2 a z)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\phi = \frac{a \sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^3 \sin \sigma}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3}{a^2 \sin \sigma} 
&amp; \left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma}
\left( \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right) \right. \\[8pt]
&amp;{} \quad + \left.
\sin \sigma \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}
\left( \frac{1}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right) + 
\frac{1}{\sin \sigma \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of bispherical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]], for which bispherical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  However, the [[Helmholtz equation]] is not separable in bispherical coordinates. A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two conducting spheres of different radii.

'''Christia V. Daniels Adair''' (October 22, 1893 – December 31, 1989) was an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[suffragist]] and civil rights worker based in Texas. There is a mural in Texas about her life, displayed in a county park which is named for her.

==Early life and education==
Christia V. Daniels was born in 1893 in [[Victoria, Texas]] and grew up in [[Edna, Texas]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Women|last=Salem|first=Dorothy C.|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1993|isbn=0-8240-9782-3|location=New York and London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the daughter of Hardy Daniels and Ada Crosby Daniels. Her father had a hauling business, and her mother was a laundress.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;Bernadette Pruitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-YSzAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;ots=7OA7SlXOmA&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''The Other Great Migration: The Movement of Rural African Americans to Houston, 1900-1941''] (Texas A&amp;M University Press 2013): 176. {{ISBN|9781603449489}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had an older, half-sister who had been legally adopted by her mother as well as two younger brothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/digital_objects/95362|title=Christia Adair.

==Career==
Christia Daniels taught at public schools in Edna for three years and then left teaching in 1918 after she married Elbert H. Adair, a [[brakeman]] for the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri-Pacific Railroad]], and moved to [[Kingsville, Texas]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, she joined a women's group and fought against gambling establishments and organized petition drives for women's suffrage. Despite the success of the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement,]] she was prevented from voting in Texas and turned away from a polling place due to state stating that black Americans cannot vote in primaries, even though she was allowed to register to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U6o0ttZqgtUC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''African-American Women in the Struggle for the Vote, 1850-1920''] (Indiana University Press 1998): 147-148. {{ISBN|9780253211767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident prompted Adair to begin working with the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aalgs/00016/aal-00016.html|title=Christia Adair Collection MSS.0017 An Inventory of her Records at the African American Library at the Gregory School, Houston Public Library|website=legacy.lib.utexas.edu|language=en|others=Adair, Christia V.

Allwright]] case. After the case was decided in the favor of Smith, the Houston chapter of the NAACP became a popular target for bomb threats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She refused to divulge the group's membership rolls to police due to the belief that the Houston police were trying to procure the list in order to break up the chapter, under the guise of claims of [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was one of the chapter members who testified during the trial regarding the attempted seizure of the chapter's records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Adair worked on desegregation of the [[Houston Public Library]], airport, hospital, and public transit facilities, as well as department store dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt; She was part of the effort to make black Texans eligible to serve on juries, and to be hired for county jobs.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Adair co-founded the Harris County Democrats, an integrated organization, and in 1966 was the first African-American woman elected to the state's Democratic Executive Committee (though she refused her seat on the committee in protest).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5789044/cv_adair_and_others_refuse_to_be_seated/ "Liberal Demos Refuse to Serve on Committee"] ''Abilene Reporter-News" (September 23, 1966): 31. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Gibson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i5ZmBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;ots=EU2u2-98ya&amp;dq=Harris%20County%20Democrats%20Adair&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=Harris%20County%20Democrats%20Adair&amp;f=false ''Texas History for Kids: Lone Star Lives and Legends, with 21 Activities''] (Chicago Review Press 2015): 104. {{ISBN|9781613749920}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also active in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] from childhood, and was the first woman on the denomination's general board.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2239">'''Coloured Petri nets''' (CPN) are a backward compatible extension of the concept of [[Petri net]]s.

CPN preserve useful properties of Petri nets and at the same time extend initial formalism to allow the distinction between tokens.&lt;ref name=JensenV1&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Kurt|title=Coloured Petri Nets|year=1996|publisher=Heidelberg|location=Berlin|isbn=3-540-60943-1|pages=234|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloured Petri Nets allow tokens to have a data value attached to them. This attached data value is called token '''color'''. Although the color can be of arbitrarily complex type, places in CPNs usually contain tokens of one type. This type is called '''color set''' of the place.

'''Definition 1.''' A ''net'' is a tuple ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''A'', ''Σ'', ''C'', ''N'', ''E'', ''G'', ''I'' ) where:
* ''P'' is a set of ''places''.
* ''T'' is a set of ''transitions''.
* ''A'' is a set of ''arcs''
In CPNs sets of places, transitions and arcs are pairwise disjoint ''P'' &lt;big&gt;∩&lt;/big&gt; ''T''=''P'' &lt;big&gt;∩&lt;/big&gt; ''A''=''T'' &lt;big&gt;∩&lt;/big&gt; ''A''=''&lt;big&gt;∅&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''Σ'' is a set of color sets defined within CPN model. This set contains all possible colors, operations and functions used within CPN.
* ''C'' is a color function. It maps places in P into colors in Σ.
* ''N'' is a node function. It maps A into (''P'' × ''T'')&lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt;(''T'' × ''P'').
* ''E'' is an arc expression function. It maps each arc a∈A into the expression e. The input and output types of the arc expressions must correspond to the type of the nodes the arc is connected to.
Use of node function and arc expression function allows multiple arcs connect the same pair of nodes with different arc expressions.
* ''G'' is a guard function. It maps each transition t∈T to a guard expression g. The output of the guard expression should evaluate to Boolean value: true or false.
* ''I'' is an initialization function. It maps each place p into an initialization expression i. The initialization expression must evaluate to multiset of tokens with a color corresponding to the color of the place C(p).

A well-known program for working with coloured Petri nets is [[CPN_Tools|cpntools]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25113">This is a conversion chart showing how the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress Classification systems organize resources by concept, in part for the purpose of assigning [[Wiktionary:call number|call numbers]].  These two systems account for over 95% of the classification in [[United States]] libraries, and are used widely around the world.

The chart includes all ninety-nine second level (two-digit) DDC classes (040 is not assigned), and should include all second level (two-digit) LCC classes. Where a class in one system maps to several classes in other system, it will be listed multiple times (e.g. DDC class 551).

The '''constructive developmental framework''' ('''CDF''') is a theoretical framework for [[epistemological]] and [[psychological assessment]] of adults. The framework is based on empirical developmental research showing that an individual's perception of reality is an actively constructed "[[Idios kosmos|world of their own]]", unique to them and which they continue to develop over their lifespan.

CDF was developed by Otto Laske based on the work of [[Robert Kegan]] and Michael Basseches, Laske's teachers at [[Harvard University]]. The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage, cognitive level of development, and psychological profile. It provides three epistemological perspectives on individual clients as well as teams.&lt;ref name="MHD1"&gt;Laske, Otto E.: Measuring hidden dimensions. The art and science of fully engaging adults. Volume 1. Interdevelopmental Institute Press, Medford, MA 2006, {{ISBN|0-9776800-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]]s are designed to probe how an individual and/or group [[Construals|constructs the real world conceptually]], and how close an individual's present thinking approaches the complexity of the real world.

==Overview==
The methodology of CDF is grounded in empirical research on [[positive adult development]] which began under [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] in the 1960s, continued by [[Robert Kegan]] (1982, 1994), Michael Basseches 1984, and Otto Laske (1998, 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018). Laske (1998, 2009) introduced concepts from [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy and the [[Frankfurt School]] into the framework, making a strict differentiation between social–emotional and cognitive development.

Kegan (1982) described five stages of development, of which the latter four are progressively attained only in adulthood. Basseches (1984) showed that adults potentially transcend formal logical thinking by way of dialectical thinking, in four phases, measurable by a fluidity index. Both Kegan's and Basseches' findings were updated and refined by Laske in 2005 and 2008 respectively. In 2008 and 2015, Laske proposed that dialectical thought forms are an instantiation of Bhaskar's ''four moments of dialectic'' (MELD; Bhaskar 1993), and that these ontological moments form a sequence M→E→L→D that underlies individual cognitive development (Laske 2015), providing a basis for a dialectical cognitive science as well as a cognitively oriented management science. Based on the concept of 'dialogical dialectic', Laske stressed the need for a dialogical, in contrast to a monological, social science.The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage ('what should I do and for whom?'), cognitive level of development ('what can I know and what therefore are my options?'), and psychological profile ('how am I doing right now?'). The first two tools (ED, CD) provide an epistemological, the third (NP) a psychological, perspective on a person or team. See the list of references below.

In CDF, social-emotional, cognitive, and psychological assessment are arrived at separately, as follows:
# A person's social-emotional profile addresses the question "What should I do and for whom?"; it is evaluated based on a semi-structured 1-hour interview in terms of "stages" (created by Kegan-Lahey in 1988, refined by Laske 2005).
# A person's cognitive profile addresses the question "What can I know and what consequently are my options?"; it is evaluated based on a semi-structured 1-hour interview in terms of "dialectical thought forms" and the fluidity of their use during the interview or in a written text (Basseches 1984; refined by Laske 2008).
# A person's psychological profile addresses the question "How am I presently doing?"; it is evaluated based on Morris Aderman's Need-Press Questionnaire (NP) grounded in [[Henry Murray]]'s theory of personality (Aderman 1970).

In CDF, each of these profiles by itself is considered a pure abstraction since it is only in their togetherness that the "hidden dimensions of a person's consciousness" can be empirically understood and made the basis of an intervention. Importantly, a CDF intervention requires dialectical thinking, in contrast to purely logical thinking as used in positivistic research. For this reason, CDF is a model of dialogical, not monological, research.

==Social–emotional development ==

=== Stages of adult development ===
According to the developmental psychologist [[Robert Kegan]],&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;Kegan, Robert: The evolving self: problem and process in human development. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA 1982, {{ISBN|0-674-27231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a person's self-concept evolves in a series of stages through their lifetime. Such evolution is driven alternately by two main motivations: that of being autonomous and that of belonging to a group. Human beings are "controlled" by these motivations in the sense that they do not have influence on them but are rather defined by them. Additionally, these motivations are in conflict and their relationship develops over a lifespan.&lt;ref name="MHD1"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Kegan describes 5 stages of development, of which the latter 4 are progressively attained in adulthood, although only a small proportion of adults reach the fourth stage and beyond:
* Stage 1: Purely impulse or reflex-driven (infancy and early childhood).
* Stage 2: The person's sense of self is ruled by their needs and wishes. The needs and wishes of others are relevant only to the extent that they support those of the person. Effectively the person and others inhabit two "separate worlds" (childhood to adolescence).
* Stage 3: The person's sense of self is socially determined, based on the real or imagined expectations of others (post-adolescence).
* Stage 4: The person's sense of self is determined by a set of values that they have authored for themselves (rarely achieved, only in adulthood).
* Stage 5: The person's sense of self is no longer bound to any particular aspect of themselves or their history, and they are free to allow themselves to focus on the flow of their lives.

CDF refers to such stages as "social–emotional" in that they relate to the way a person makes meaning of their experience in the social world. CDF holds that people are rarely precisely at a single stage but more accurately are distributed over a range where they are subject to the conflicting influences of a higher and a lower stage.

=== Assessing the social–emotional profile of a person ===
The social–emotional profile of person is assessed by means of an interview, referred to as the "subject–object" interview.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt; In the interview, the interviewer offers prompts such as "success", "change", "control", "limits", "frustration", and "risk" and invites the interviewee to describe meaningful experiences under those headings. The interviewer serves as a listener, whose role is to focus the attention of the interviewee onto their own thoughts and feelings.

The interview is scored by identifying excerpts of speech that indicate a particular stage or sub-stage. Relevant sections are chosen from the transcript of the interview and analyzed for indications of the stage of development. The most frequent sub-stage revealed by the scoring is described as the interviewee's "centre of gravity". Stages scored at below the center of gravity are described as "risk" (of regression) while stages scored above the center of gravity are described as "potential" (for development). The distribution of scores is summarized by a "risk–clarity–potential" index (RCP) that can be used to characterize the nature of the developmental challenges facing a person.

== Cognitive development ==

=== Eras of adult cognitive development ===
According to [[Jean Piaget]], thinking develops in 4 stages from childhood to young adulthood. Piaget named these stages sensory-motor, pre-operational, concrete-operational, and formal-operational. Development of formal-operational thinking is considered to continue until approximately until the 25th year of life. Subsequent researchers have concentrated on the now famous question of Kohlberg: "Is there a life after 25?" In CDF, the development of post formal-operational thinking in an adult is indicated primarily by the strength of dialectical thinking measured in thought form use fluidity.&lt;ref name="MHD2"&gt;Laske, Otto E.: Measuring hidden dimensions. Foundations of requisite organization. Volume 2. Interdevelopmental Institute Press, Medford, MA 2009, {{ISBN|978-09776800-6-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

Following Bhaskar (1993), in CDF, human thinking is seen as developing in four sequential phases or 'eras', termed 'common sense', 'understanding', 'reason' and finally 'practical wisdom'.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, Roy: Dialectic. The pulse of freedom. Verso, London &amp; New York 1993, {{ISBN|0-86091-368-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first three phases of thinking development can be related to the different thinking systems put forward by the philosophers [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and Hegel. Each phase includes and transcends the thinking system of the previous phase. The final phase of 'practical wisdom' loops back to a higher form of 'common sense' in that it constitutes sophisticated thinking that has become second nature and is therefore effortless.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|128}} In contrast to other adult development researchers such as [[Kurt W. Fischer|Fischer]] and [[Michael Commons|Commons]], Laske describes post-formal cognitive development in terms of the use and co-ordination of dialectical thought forms and thought form constellations which were described by Basseches as mental schemata.&lt;ref name="basseches"&gt;Basseches, Michael: Dialectical thinking and adult development. Ablex Publishing, Norwood, NJ 1984, {{ISBN|0-89391-017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Four classes of dialectical thought forms ===
{{See also|DSRP}}
Dialectical thinking has its roots in Greek classical philosophy but is also found in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, and relates to the search for truth through reasoned argument. It finds its foremost expression in the work of the German philosopher Georg Hegel. Essentially, [[dialectics]] is viewed as the system by which human thought attempts to capture the nature of reality. Building on [[Roy Bhaskar|Bhaskar]] and Basseches, CDF uses a framework for dialectical thinking based on the idea that everything in reality is transient and composed of contradictions, part of a larger whole, related in some way to everything else, and subject to sudden transformation. This framework therefore distinguishes dialectical thinking in terms of four classes of dialectical thought forms that can be said to define reality:&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|224}}

* Process (P) – constant change; emergence from absence: this class of thought forms describes how things or systems emerge, evolve and disappear;
* Context (C) – stable structures: this class of thought forms describes how things are part of the structure of a larger, stable, organized whole. The contextualization of parts within a whole gives rise to different perspectives or points of view;
* Relationship (R) – unity in diversity; totality: this class of thought forms describes how things (which are all part of a larger whole) are related and the nature of their common ground;
* Transformation (T) – balance and evolution including breakdown: this class of thought forms describes how living systems are in constant development and transformation, potentially via a collapse of the previous form of organization, and subject to the influence of human agency.

In addition, CDF distinguishes seven individual thought forms for every class, making a total of 28 thought forms, representing a re-formulation of Basseches' 24 schematas.&lt;ref name="basseches"/&gt;

=== The cognitive profile of a person ===
The cognitive profile describes the thinking tools at a person's disposal and shows the degree to which a person's thinking has developed as indicated by their use of dialectical thought forms in the four classes. The profile is derived by means of a semi-structured interview where the interviewer has the task of eliciting the interviewee's use of thought forms in a conversation about the interviewee's work and workplace. The text of the interview is subsequently analyzed and scored to give a series of mathematical indicators.

According to CDF thinking that is highly developed is represented by the following features:

* a balanced use of all four classes of dialectical thought forms (P, C, R, T)
* a high index of systemic thinking—meaning the use of transformative thought forms (T) and
* balanced use of critical and constructive thought forms (P+R) vs. (C+T)

== Link between social–emotional development and cognitive development ==
Social–emotional and cognitive development are often seen as separate lines of development&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken: Integral spirituality. Shambala, Boston MA. 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-346-7}}, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; but Laske (2008) proposed that they are linked by "stages of reflective judgment"&lt;ref&gt;King, Patricia M. &amp; Kitchener, Karen S.: Developing reflective judgment. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-555-42629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "epistemic position",&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|137}} described as the view taken by a person on what constitutes "knowledge" and "truth". Epistemic position defines a person's ability to deal with uncertainty and insecurity in their knowledge of the world and, together with the stage of social–emotional development, reflects the "stance" that a person takes towards the world. Whilst cognitive development provides a person with "tools" for thinking consisting of thought forms derived from both logic and dialectics,&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt; the "stance" that a person takes determines whether they apply the thinking tools at their disposal.

== Personality ==

=== Psychogenic needs and press ===
CDF employs the theory put forward by psychologist Henry Murray that much of human behavior is determined by the effort to satisfy certain psychological (or "psychogenic" needs), most of which are unconscious. Personality is thus seen as characteristic behavior emerging from the dynamic between a person's pattern of psychogenic needs and the environmental forces acting on that person—termed "press".

The need–press analysis draws on [[Sigmund Freud]]'s model of the human psyche divided into the components of Id, Ego and Super-ego. In living, a person is subject to the unconscious yearnings of the Id, whilst consciously aspiring to certain ideals imposed by the Super-ego, which itself is influenced by the social context. It is the dynamic balance between the forces of Id and Super-ego and the work environment that determines a person's capacity for work. Imbalances between the social reality of work and a person's ideals lead to frustration, and imbalances between a person's unconscious needs and their ideals lead to a waste of energy or "energy sink."&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|419}}

=== The personality profile of a person ===
CDF assessment methodology uses a self-report psychometric questionnaire originated by Henry Murray's student Morris Aderman, called the need–press (NP) inventory.

The questionnaire assesses psychological characteristics in terms of three categories: ''self-conduct, task focus, and interpersonal perspective,'', each of them defined by 6 variables assessed independently. The questionnaire compares a person's current needs with 1) what they would be like in an ideal (moral) world and 2) what they perceive they are offered in actuality (such as a specific cultural environment they are in tune or at odds with). Each category is composed of several categories (scales) such as: need for control, drive to achieve, affiliation etc. Comparisons and interpretation can be made between a person's scores for "Need", and their scores for ideal and actual "Press". Comparisons can also be made between a person's scores and those of the group of people with whom they are working. Finally, NP scores can be linked to developmental scores (ED &amp; CD), whether of an individual or team.

== Applications ==

=== Assessment of work capability ===
The assessment methodology employed by CDF was created to measure peoples' capability and capacity for work. The theory of work used by CDF is derived from the work of [[Elliott Jaques]]. According to Jaques,&lt;ref name="jaques"&gt;Jaques, Elliott: Requisite organization: the CEO's guide to creative structure and leadership. Cason Hall, Arlington, VA 1989, {{ISBN|0-9621070-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; work is defined as the application of reflective judgment in order to pursue certain goals within certain time limits. This definition stresses the importance of how decisions are made in a complex world and the time-span within which decisions are carried out. While Jaques offers a strictly cognitive definition of work, CDF views the social–emotional aspects of work as equally important, also including the person's (manager's, CEO's) NP profile.

CDF distinguishes between two kinds of work capability, applied and potential. Applied capability refers to the resources that an individual can already apply in order to carry out work. Potential capability refers to the resources that an individual may be capable of applying in the future.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|57}} An individual can decide at any time not to apply their potential work capability. Equally circumstances may impede a person from applying their potential capability. Work capability is therefore not the same as the capacity to deliver work but rather defines and limits it.

In CDF work capacity is measured in terms of the need–press personality profile, whilst applied capability is measured in terms of the thinking tools shown up by the cognitive profile, and potential capability is measured in terms of the risk–clarity–potential score taken from the social–emotional profile.

=== Organizational talent management ===
For Elliot Jaques,&lt;ref name="jaques" /&gt; human organizations are structured managerially according to levels of accountability. Each level of accountability entails a higher level of complexity in the work required of the role-holder, termed "size of role". Jaques defined the notion of [[requisite organization]], where roles in an organization are hierarchically organized at specific levels of increasing complexity.

The application of CDF as an assessment methodology to measure the "size of person" in terms of their work capability and capacity provides a way forward for [[talent management system]]s to match the "size of person" to the "size of role". Progressively more complex roles require progressively higher levels of social–emotional development and cognitive development in the role-holder. In this way requisite organizations can align their human capability architecture with their managerial accountability architecture&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|84}} and design "growth assignments"&lt;ref&gt;DeVisch, Jan: The vertical dimension. 2010, {{ISBN|978-94-9069-538-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that facilitate the development of capability for more complex roles.

=== Coaching ===
CDF provides a platform for professional coaching such as in [[leadership development]] and [[management development]] in a variety of ways. Firstly it provides assessment tools from which the coach can construct an integrated model of the coachee complete with the developmental challenges of the client who is to be helped. Secondly, and in the sense used by [[Edgar Schein]]&lt;ref&gt;Schein, Edgar H.: Process consultation revisited. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA 1999, {{ISBN|0-201-34596-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the assessment tools and the feedback of results by the coach is an act of "process consultation" by which the client may come to understand better the assumptions, values, attitudes and behaviors that are helping or hindering their success. Thirdly, CDF provides tools for deeper and more sophisticated thinking, thereby enabling the client to explore and expand their conceptual landscape of a problem.

CDF distinguishes between behavioral and developmental coaching. The goal of behavioral coaching is to improve the client's actual performance at work, described in CDF terms as their applied capability. In contrast, the goal of developmental coaching is to illuminate and develop the client's current and emergent capabilities for work in the context of their cognitive and social–emotional development.

=== Self-organization in teams ===
As shown in the book ''Dynamic Collaboration: Strengthening Self Organization and Collaborative Intelligence in Teams'', by Jan De Visch and Otto Laske (2018), CDF can be a tool for building in organizations a ''dialogical culture'' by which distributed leadership in organizations can be realized.

A '''decompiler''' is a [[computer program]] that takes an executable file as input, and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is therefore the opposite of a [[compiler]], which takes a source file and makes an executable. Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce obfuscated code. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in the [[reverse engineering]] of [[computer software]].

==Introduction==
The term ''decompiler'' is most commonly applied to a program which translates [[executable]] programs (the output from a [[compiler]]) into [[source code]] in a (relatively) [[high level language]] which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program. By comparison, a [[disassembler]] translates an executable program into [[assembly language]] (and an assembler could be used to assemble it back into an executable program).

Decompilation is the act of using a decompiler, although the term can also refer to the output of a decompiler. It can be used for the recovery of lost source code, and is also useful in some cases for [[computer security]], [[interoperability]] and [[error correction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Van Emmerik |url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/WhyDecompilation |title=Why Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of decompilation depends on the amount of information present in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the analysis performed on it. The bytecode formats used by many virtual machines (such as the [[Java Virtual Machine]] or the [[.NET Framework]] [[Common Language Runtime]]) often include extensive [[metadata]] and high-level features that make decompilation quite feasible. The presence of [[Debugger|debug data]] can make it possible to reproduce the original variable and structure names and even the line numbers. [[Machine language]] without such metadata or debug data is much harder to decompile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Decompiling Java Bytecode: Problems, Traps and Pitfalls|first1=Jerome|last1=Miecznikowski|first2=Laurie|last2=Hendren|
pages=111–127|editor=R Nigel Horspool|title=Compiler Construction: 11th International Conference, proceedings / CC 2002|
isbn=3-540-43369-4|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compilers and post-compilation tools produce [[obfuscated code]] (that is, they attempt to produce output that is very difficult to decompile). This is done to make it more difficult to [[reverse engineer]] the executable.

==Design==
Decompilers can be thought of as composed of a series of phases each of which contributes specific aspects of the overall decompilation process.

===Loader===
The first decompilation phase loads and parses the input machine code or [[intermediate language]] program's binary file format. It should be able to discover basic facts about the input program, such as the architecture (Pentium, PowerPC, etc.) and the entry point. In many cases, it should be able to find the equivalent of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of a [[C (programming language)|C]] program, which is the start of the '''user written''' code. This excludes the runtime initialization code, which should not be decompiled if possible. If available the symbol tables and debug data are also loaded. The front end may be able to identify the libraries used even if they are linked with the code, this will provide library interfaces. If it can determine the compiler or compilers used it may provide useful information in identifying code idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decompilation of Binary Programs|journal=Software Practice and Experience|first1=Cristina|last1=Cifuentes|first2=K. John|last2=Gough|volume=25|issue=7|pages=811–829|date=July 1995|citeseerx = 10.1.1.14.8073|doi=10.1002/spe.4380250706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassembly===
The next logical phase is the disassembly of machine code instructions into a machine independent intermediate representation (IR). For example, the Pentium machine instruction
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
 mov    eax, [ebx+0x04]
&lt;/source&gt;
might be translated to the IR
 eax  := m[ebx+4];

===Idioms===
Idiomatic machine code sequences are sequences of code whose combined semantics is not immediately apparent from the instructions' individual semantics. Either as part of the disassembly phase, or as part of later analyses, these idiomatic sequences need to be translated into known equivalent IR. For example, the [[x86 assembly language|x86 assembly code]]:
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
    cdq    eax             ; edx is set to the sign-extension of eax
    xor    eax, edx
    sub    eax, edx
&lt;/source&gt;
could be translated to
 eax  := abs(eax);

Some idiomatic sequences are machine independent; some involve only one instruction. For example, {{code|2=nasm|xor eax, eax}} clears the &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; register (sets it to zero). This can be implemented with a machine independent simplification rule, such as &lt;code&gt;a = 0&lt;/code&gt;.

In general, it is best to delay detection of idiomatic sequences if possible, to later stages that are less affected by instruction ordering. For example, the instruction scheduling phase of a compiler may insert other instructions into an idiomatic sequence, or change the ordering of instructions in the sequence. A pattern matching process in the disassembly phase would probably not recognize the altered pattern. Later phases group instruction expressions into more complex expressions, and modify them into a canonical (standardized) form, making it more likely that even the altered idiom will match a higher level pattern later in the decompilation.

It is particularly important to recognize the compiler idioms for [[subroutine]] calls, [[exception handling]], and [[switch statement]]s. Some languages also have extensive support for [[String (computer science)|string]]s or [[long integer]]s.

===Program analysis===
Various program analyses can be applied to the IR. In particular, expression propagation combines the semantics of several instructions into more complex expressions. For example,
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
    mov   eax,[ebx+0x04]
    add   eax,[ebx+0x08]
    sub   [ebx+0x0C],eax
&lt;/source&gt;
could result in the following IR after expression propagation:
 m[ebx+12]  := m[ebx+12] - (m[ebx+4] + m[ebx+8]);
The resulting expression is more like high level language, and has also eliminated the use of the machine register &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; . Later analyses may eliminate the &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt; register.

===Data flow analysis===
The places where register contents are defined and used must be traced using [[data flow analysis]]. The same analysis can be applied to locations that are used for temporaries and local data. A different name  can then be formed for each such connected set of value definitions and uses. It is possible that the same local variable location was used for more than one variable in different parts of the original program. Even worse it is possible for the data flow analysis to identify a path whereby a value may flow between two such uses even though it would never actually happen or matter in reality. This may in bad cases lead to needing to define a location as a union of types. The decompiler may allow  the user to explicitly break such unnatural dependencies which will lead to clearer code. This of course means a variable is potentially used without being initialized and so indicates a problem in the original program.

===Type analysis===
A good machine code decompiler will perform type analysis. Here, the way registers or memory locations are used result in constraints on the possible type of the location. For example, an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; instruction implies that the operand is an integer; programs do not use such an operation on [[floating point]] values (except in special library code) or on [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]. An &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction results in three constraints, since the operands may be both integer, or one integer and one pointer (with integer and pointer results respectively; the third constraint comes from the ordering of the two operands when the types are different).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Type-Based Decompilation|title=Programming languages and systems: 8th European Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
|first1=Alan|last1=Mycroft|editor=S. Doaitse Swierstra|pages=208–223|year=1999|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-65699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various high level expressions can be recognized which trigger recognition of structures or arrays. However, it is difficult to distinguish many of the possibilities, because of the freedom that machine code or even some high level languages such as C allow with casts and pointer arithmetic.

The example from the previous section could result in the following high level code:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 struct T1 *ebx;
    struct T1 {
        int v0004;
        int v0008;
        int v000C;
    };
  ebx-&gt;v000C -= ebx-&gt;v0004 + ebx-&gt;v0008;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Structuring===
The penultimate decompilation phase involves structuring of the IR into higher level constructs such as &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if/then/else&lt;/code&gt; conditional statements. For example, the machine code
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
    xor eax, eax
 l0002:
    or  ebx, ebx
    jge l0003
    add eax,[ebx]
    mov ebx,[ebx+0x4]
    jmp l0002
 l0003:
    mov [0x10040000],eax
&lt;/source&gt;
could be translated into:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
    eax = 0;
    while (ebx &lt; 0) {
        eax += ebx-&gt;v0000;
        ebx = ebx-&gt;v0004;
    }
    v10040000 = eax;
&lt;/source&gt;
Unstructured code is more difficult to translate into structured code than already structured code. Solutions include replicating some code, or adding boolean variables.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cifuentes. ''Reverse Compilation Techniques''. PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology, 1994. (available as [http://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/download/papers/binary_analysis/cifuentes-thesis.pdf PDF Chapter 6])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code generation===
The final phase is the generation of the high level code in the back end of the decompiler. Just as a compiler may have several back ends for generating machine code for different architectures, a decompiler may have several back ends for generating high level code in different high level languages.

Just before code generation, it may be desirable to allow an interactive editing of the IR, perhaps using some form of [[graphical user interface]]. This would allow the user to enter comments, and non-generic variable and function names. However, these are almost as easily entered in a post decompilation edit. The user may want to change structural aspects, such as converting a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. These are less readily modified with a simple text editor, although source [[code refactoring]] tools may assist with this process. The user may need to enter information that failed to be identified during the type analysis phase, e.g. modifying a memory expression to an array or structure expression. Finally, incorrect IR may need to be corrected, or changes made to cause the output code to be more readable.

==Legality==
{{original research|date=April 2013}}
{{Expert-subject|Cyberlaw|section|talk=Legality section and copyright law|date=March 2011}}
The majority of computer programs are covered by [[copyright]] laws. Although the precise scope of what is covered by copyright differs from region to region, copyright law generally provides the author (the programmer(s) or employer) with a collection of exclusive rights to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Information technology law|first=Diane|last=Rowland|year=2005|edition=3rd|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=1-85941-756-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include the right to make copies, including copies made into the computer's [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] (unless creating such a copy is essential for using the program).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the decompilation process involves making multiple such copies, it is generally prohibited without the authorization of the copyright holder. However, because decompilation is often a necessary step in achieving software  [[interoperability]], copyright laws in both the United States and Europe permit decompilation to a limited extent.

In the United States, the copyright [[fair use]] defense has been successfully invoked in decompilation cases. For example, in ''[[Sega v. Accolade]]'', the court held that Accolade could lawfully engage in decompilation in order to circumvent the software locking mechanism used by Sega's game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/LegalityOfDecompilation |title=The Legality of Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (PUBLIC LAW 105–304&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ304/pdf/PLAW-105publ304.pdf |title=DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT |publisher=US Congress |date=1998-10-28 |accessdate=2013-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) has proper exemptions for both Security Testing and Evaluation in §1205(i), and Reverse Engineering in §1205(f).

In Europe, the [[Computer Programs Directive|1991 Software Directive]] explicitly provides for a right to decompile in order to achieve interoperability. The result of a heated debate between, on the one side, software protectionists, and, on the other, academics as well as independent software developers, Article 6 permits decompilation only if a number of conditions are met:

*First, a person or entity must have a [[Software license agreement|license]] to use the program to be decompiled.
*Second, decompilation must be necessary to achieve [[interoperability]] with the target program or other programs. Interoperability information should therefore not be readily available, such as through manuals or [[Application programming interface|API]] documentation. This is an important limitation. The necessity must be proven by the decompiler. The purpose of this important limitation is primarily to provide an incentive for developers to document and disclose their products' interoperability information.&lt;ref&gt;B. Czarnota and R.J. Hart, ''Legal protection of computer programs in Europe: a guide to the EC directive''. 1991, London: Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, the decompilation process must, if possible, be confined to the parts of the target program relevant to interoperability. Since one of the purposes of decompilation is to gain an understanding of the program structure, this third limitation may be difficult to meet. Again, the burden of proof is on the decompiler.

In addition, Article 6 prescribes that the information obtained through decompilation may not be used for other purposes and that it may not be given to others.

Overall, the decompilation right provided by Article 6 [[Codification (law)|codifies]] what is claimed to be common practice in the software industry. Few European lawsuits are known to have emerged from the decompilation right. This could be interpreted as meaning one of three things: 1) the decompilation right is not used frequently and the decompilation right may therefore have been unnecessary, 2) the decompilation right functions well and provides sufficient legal certainty not to give rise to legal disputes or 3) illegal decompilation goes largely undetected. In a recent report regarding implementation of the Software Directive by the European member states, the [[European Commission]] seems to support the second interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52000DC0199:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 52000DC0199 - EN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Diaphoresis|Dysmorphia}}
'''Dysphoria''' (from {{lang-el|δύσφορος}} (dysphoros), δυσ-, difficult, and φέρειν, to bear) is a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction. In a psychiatric context, dysphoria may accompany [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or agitation. The term is often used to refer to [[gender dysphoria]], experienced by people whose [[gender identity]] does not align with their [[Sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]], and who may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Common reactions to dysphoria include emotional distress; in some cases, even physical distress. The opposite state of mind is known as [[euphoria]].

==In psychiatry==
Intense states of distress and unease increase the risk of [[suicide]], as well as being unpleasant in themselves. Relieving dysphoria is therefore a priority of psychiatric treatment. One may treat underlying causes such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[bipolar disorder]] as well as the dysphoric symptoms themselves.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) categorizes specific dysphoria in the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].

[[Body integrity identity disorder]] is referred to as "Body integrity dysphoria" in the ICD-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/256572629|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{Main article|Gender dysphoria}}
Gender dysphoria is discomfort, unhappiness, or distress due to one's [[gender]] or physical sex. The current edition ([[DSM-5]]) of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' uses the term "gender dysphoria" where it previously referred to "gender identity disorder", making it clear that they no longer consider the gender identity to be disordered, but rather the emotional state of distress which results from the gender identity.&lt;ref name="recommendations"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=L| last2=Karasic |first2=D |last3=Meyer |first3=W |last4=Wylie |first4=K |title=Recommendations for Revision of the DSM Diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder in Adults|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|year=2010|volume=12|pages=80–85|doi=10.1080/15532739.2010.509202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">In [[statistics]], the '''Freedman&amp;ndash;Diaconis rule''' can be used to select the width of the bins to be used in a [[histogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=David|last2=Diaconis|first2=Persi|date=December 1981|year=|title=On the histogram as a density estimator: ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; theory|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/mp364022824748n3/fulltext.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|journal=Probability Theory and Related Fields|location=Heidelberg|publisher=Springer Berlin|volume=57|issue=4|pages=453–476|doi=10.1007/BF01025868|issn=0178-8051|via=|authorlink=David Freedman (statistician)|authorlink2=Persi Diaconis|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[David A. Freedman]] and [[Persi Diaconis]]. 

For a set of empirical measurements sampled from some [[probability distribution]], the Freedman-Diaconis rule is designed to minimize the difference between the [[integral|area under the empirical probability distribution]] and the area under the theoretical probability distribution.{{Clarify|reason=What is the empirical probability distribution? Why would minimizing this difference be a good thing?|date=June 2017}}

The general equation for the rule is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Bin width}=2\, { \text{IQR}(x) \over{  \sqrt[3]{n}  }}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{IQR}(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[interquartile range]] of the data and &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the number of observations in the sample &lt;math&gt; x. &lt;/math&gt;

==Other approaches==
Another approach is to use [[Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width|''Sturges' rule'']]: use a bin so large that there are about &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1+\log_2n&lt;/math&gt; non-empty bins (Scott, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = D.W. | year = 2009 | title = Sturges' rule | url = | journal = WIREs Computational Statistics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 303–306 | doi=10.1002/wics.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works well for ''n'' under 200, but was found to be inaccurate for large&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hyndman | first1 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = The problem with Sturges’ rule for constructing histograms | url = http://robjhyndman.com/papers/sturges.pdf | journal =  | volume =  | issue = | pages =  | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For a discussion and an alternative approach, see Birgé and Rozenholc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Birgé | first1 = L. | last2 = Rozenholc | first2 = Y. | year = 2006 | title = How many bins should be put in a regular histogram | url = http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PS_2006__10__24_0 | journal = ESAIM: Probability and Statistics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 24–45 | doi=10.1051/ps:2006001| citeseerx = 10.1.1.3.220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geodiversity''' is the variety of earth materials, forms and processes that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski&gt;Zwolinski, Zb. 2004. ''Geodiversity'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'', A.Goudie (ed.), Routledge: pp. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relevant materials include [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[soil]]s and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brilha2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brilha |first1=José |date=2014 |title=Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review |url= |journal=Geoheritage |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1007/s12371-014-0139-3 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms may comprise [[fold (geology)|folds]], [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[landform]]s and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example [[tectonics]], [[sediment transport]], [[pedogenesis]]) represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, M. 2004. ''Geodiversity: Valuing and Conserving Abiotic Nature''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd {{ISBN|978-0470848951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of [[Geology of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]]) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a [[Geoethics|geoethical]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), "[http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6099 Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges]". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. doi: 10.4401/ag-6099.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to José Brilha geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ''[[ex situ]]''. Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ''ex situ''.&lt;ref name=Brilha2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">'''Geographical segregation''' exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more [[population]]s are not [[wiktionary:homogenous|homogenous]] throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal [[species]], human [[gender]]s, followers of a certain [[religion]], people of different [[nationalities]], [[ethnic group]]s, etc.

In [[social geography]] segregation of [[ethnic group]]s, [[social class]]es and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the [[index of dissimilarity]]. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Massey |first=D. |last2=Denton |first2=N. |title=American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0674018206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies also highlight new local indices of segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.08.005 |pmid=26463550 |title=Patterns of local segregation: Do they matter for neighborhood crime? |journal=Social Science Research |volume=54 |pages=303–18 |year=2015 |last1=Krivo |first1=Lauren J |last2=Byron |first2=Reginald A |last3=Calder |first3=Catherine A |last4=Peterson |first4=Ruth D |last5=Browning |first5=Christopher R |last6=Kwan |first6=Mei-Po |last7=Lee |first7=Jae Yong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human geographical segregation==

Segregation, as a broad concept, has appeared in all parts of the world where people exist—in different contexts and times it takes on different forms, shaped by the physical and human environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segregation&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial concentration of [[population]] groups is not a new [[phenomenon]]. Since [[societies]] began to form there have been segregated inhabitants. Either segregated purposefully by force, or gradually over time, segregation was based on socio-economic, religious, educational, linguistic or ethnic grounds. Some groups choose to be segregated to strengthen social identity.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;https://www.un.org/ga/Istanbul+5/50.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="segregation.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segregation.ch/segregation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108131650/http://segregation.ch/segregation/ |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Legal segregation===
Segregation can be caused by [[legal]] frameworks, such as in the extreme example of apartheid in South Africa, and even Jewish ghettoization in Germany in the 20th century. Segregation can also happen slowly, stimulated by increased land and housing prices in certain neighborhoods, resulting in segregation of rich and poor in many urban cities.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Segregation can also be assigned arbitrarily. This can occur on a global scale, such as is seen in the [[Partition of India]], instances in [[Ireland]], and many other situations. Geographical boundaries were often put in place without much consideration for native peoples and natural geographic terrain and cultural limits that had long been in place.

In [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], segregation was very much a legal concept. Enforced by the government, Africans were discriminated against, and forced to comply with apartheid. Some of the [[legislation]] passed dealt with physical segregation in schools, land tenure, geographic segregation and state repression. These were very clearly legislative, but also in the case of most white South Africans, a [[social construct]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Scythe |first=N. C. |title=Early Apartheid: Race Laws in South Africa 1652–1836 |work=[[Master of Laws|LLM]] thesis, University of Witwatersrand |location=Johannesburg |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segregation can also be encouraged, using geographical boundaries, while not explicitly enforced. [[Public housing]] [[projects]], especially in the United States, have been criticized for this. Putting cheap housing in poor black neighborhoods encouraged local African-Americans to stay in the area, keeping other richer areas white by not building public housing there. This has been changing in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119220526/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/news/2007/09/scattered-site-era-coming-end-0 |archivedate=2013-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social segregation===
Segregation can also be caused by social factors that become evident as they happen, but are not necessarily government sanctioned. This could be things like informal ghettos, or simply rich neighborhoods. In terms of land capital, over time in a given area, [[humans]] will settle down and buy or take land. Some privileged people will acquire better land (that is, more [[Arable land|arable]], proximate to potential [[Capital (economics)|capital]], more pleasing views). Demand for these nicer habitats drives up prices, and areas deemed “better” based solely on geography become inherently exclusionary in their population makeup.

[[West Point Grey]], an area of [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]], is in part rich because of the views offered of [[Downtown Vancouver]], the [[Gulf Islands]], and its location near the water and [[University of British Columbia]]. Wealthy people had the resources to pay for advantages, and subsequently drove up prices. Examples of this can be seen all over the world. Geographical segregation is not defined by the sightline of places, though. It also occurs around certain structures, or simply in areas that are specifically developed with an income bracket in mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westsiderealty.ca West Side Realty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another segregation term, the [[ghetto]], has been used in many different contexts over time, generally meaning any physical part of a [[city]] predominantly occupied by any particular group of people. It implies that the group may be looked down upon and segregated purposefully. This does not mean that all ghettos are built up communities and buildings specifically for a segregation purpose, although many are. In the case of the United States, segregation of the [[African-American]] community was to a degree due to [[white flight]] out of the cities, than forcing African-Americans to live in the downtown cores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jdowd/masseydenton-apartheid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gated communities===
[[Gated communities]] could be seen as a combination of both [[legal]] frameworks and [[social]] conventions regarding segregation. A gated community today is a controlled [[neighborhood]], inhabited by people with [[common interests]], such as safety, or class separation, but not necessarily of the same [[ethnicity]] or [[religion]]—it is distinct from an international community (in most cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Behind-the-urban-curtains/2005/03/03/1109700606439.html |title=Behind the urban curtains |date=March 4, 2005 |first=Matt |last=O'Sullivan |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gated communities are very controversial, as they can be seen as encouraging distinction and separation, and therefore superiority from those who do not live with the gates community.

===Voluntary segregation===
Voluntary segregation is almost as common an occurrence as involuntary segregation is. Often, immigrants coming to a new and foreign country will band together for mutual benefit, and to keep a sense of community in the new country. These can be called ethnic enclaves and can be formed by any community or people group.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portes |first=Alejandro |first2=Leif |last2=Jensen |title=Disproving the Enclave Hypothesis: Reply |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=418–420 |jstor=2096246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known groups are [[Chinatowns]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatownology.com/usa.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Italy]]s and ''[[barrio]]s''. These localized phenomena also come in the form of [[ethnoburb]]s, which are essentially the same concept as an ethnic enclave, but specifically located in suburbs, rather than the traditional downtowns, where Chinatowns and Little Italys are usually based.

'''Holistic veterinary medicine''' is a type of [[veterinary medicine]] that uses [[alternative medicine]] in the treatment of animals.  The philosophy of a holistic veterinarian emphasizes empathy and minimal invasiveness. Alternative therapies offered by a holistic veterinarian may include, but are not limited to, [[Veterinary acupuncture|acupuncture]], [[Herbalism#Uses of herbal medicines by animals|herbal medicine]], [[Veterinary homeopathy|homeopathy]], [[Ethnoveterinary medicine|ethnomedicine]] and [[veterinary chiropractic|chiropractic]].

==Definition==

Many veterinarians use different terms to convey what is meant by ''holistic''. Alternative [[veterinary medicine]], complementary veterinary medicine, and integrative veterinary medicine may be used as synonyms.
All veterinary medicine may be considered ''holistic'' in that it considers all aspects of the animal patient in the context of its environment.  The task force for complementary and alternative veterinary medicine for the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] stresses that "There is only one veterinary medicine and only one standard by which it should be assessed. All treatments and modalities should be judged by the same criteria and held to the same standards.  Descriptive terms such as [[holistic]], [[conventional]], [[traditional medicine|traditional]], alternative, integrative, or [[complementary medicine|complementary]] do not enhance the quality of care provided and should not receive special consideration when judging the safety and efficacy of those treatments.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=An insight into the AVMA Guidelines for Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=218 |issue=11 |pages=1729–30 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11394818 |doi= 10.2460/javma.2001.218.1729|url= http://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/pdf/10.2460/javma.2001.218.1729 | accessdate = 2008-06-05 | format = pdf |author1= AVMA Alternative and Complementary Therapies Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual meaning for ''holistic veterinarian'' is a veterinarian who specializes in one or more alternative or complementary treatments. In practice, holistic veterinary medicine incorporates, but is not limited to, [[acupuncture]], [[botanical medicine]], [[chiropractic]], [[homeopathy]], [[massage therapy]], and [[nutraceuticals]]. A veterinarian interested in alternative treatments may be a member of the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahvma.org/ American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The modalities comprising holistic veterinary medicine vary in their evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterinarywatch.com/Primer1.htm Veterinarywatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
According to the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association (AHVMA), [[holistic health|holistic medicine]] is humane. The techniques promoted in holistic medicine are minimally invasive, and incorporate patient well-being, lifestyle, and stress reduction. Holistic thinking is centered on love, empathy and respect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.ahvma.org/ AHVMA - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of blood tests, x-rays, and similar objective diagnostic techniques is minimalized in favor of sensitivity to the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123131731/http://viim.org/research/articles/kinesiology.asp?article=kinesiology 403 Forbidden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every form of medicine and therapy used in [[alternative medicine]] for humans is also used in holistic veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ahvma.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=1 AHVMA - What is Holistic Medicine?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ideonella''''' is a genus of [[Comamonadaceae]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/36862|title=Ideonella|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== ''Ideonella sakaiensis'' ===
{{Main|Ideonella sakaiensis}}
In 2016 [[Ideonella sakaiensis|''I. sakaiensis'']] was shown to degrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], a [[polymer]] widely used in food containers, bottles and synthetic fibers. Adhered to a low-grade PET film, the bacteria used two novel [[enzyme]]s to decompose the plastic into two environmentally benign substances, which served as their main food source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-species-of-bacteria-eats-plastic-1457636401|title=New Species of Bacteria Eats Plastic|last=Long|first=Kat|date=March 10, 2016|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colony of ''I. sakaiensis'' could completely degrade a low-grade plastic water bottle in six weeks. Higher-grade PET products would require heating and cooling to weaken it before bacteria could start eating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The bacteria could also be used to reduce industrial waste during plastics manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Jason Anderson''' (born 17 February 1979) is a former [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cricketer. A right-handed [[wicket-keeper]]/[[batsman]], Anderson represented the [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermudian national side]] between 2010 and 2013, most notably at the [[2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two|2011 World Cricket League Division Two]] tournament and the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier|2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier]].

Having earlier played for [[Bermuda national under-19 cricket team|the national under-19 team]], Anderson made his senior debut for Bermuda in September 2010, at a cricket festival in Canada.&lt;ref name="misc"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/161/161401/Miscellaneous_Matches.html Miscellaneous matches played by Jason Anderson] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make his [[List A cricket|list-A]] debut in April 2011, against [[Papua New Guinea national cricket team|Papua New Guinea]] at the WCL Division Two tournament in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/161/161401/List_A_Matches.html|title=List A Matches played by Jason Anderson|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson finished the tournament with 176 runs from his five matches, made at an [[Batting average|average]] of 44.00, which was behind only [[Dion Stovell]] and [[Lionel Cann]] for Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/14/ICC_World_Cricket_League_Division_Two_2011/Bermuda_Batting.html Batting and fielding for Bermuda], ICC World Cricket League Division Two 2011 – CricketArchive.

Retrieved 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Anderson was selected as the only wicket-keeper in Bermuda's squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/world-twenty20-qualifier-2012/content/story/553199.html|title=Hemp leads Bermuda at T20 {{sic|nolink=y|Qualifers|expected=Qualifiers}}|date=13 February 2012|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play every match of the tournament,&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/161/161401/Twenty20_Matches.html Twenty20 matches played by Jason Anderson] – CricketArchive.

However, in September 2015, Anderson was involved in an on-field altercation that resulted in him being banned for life from Bermudian cricket. Playing in a league final against Willow Cuts Cricket Club, he struck an opposing batsman, [[George O'Brien (cricketer)|George O'Brien]], in the head, which provoked a brawl featuring both teams and several spectators. The [[Bermuda Cricket Board]] subsequently found Anderson guilty of a level-four violation of the code of conduct for players, with a life ban being the consequence.&lt;ref name="Ban"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bermuda/content/story/922573.html |title=Brawl in Bermuda club game leads to life ban |accessdate=22 September 2015 |work=ESPNCricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Port of Spain]], Jones was an altar boy and sang in the choir at St Patrick's RC Church while attending Newtown Boys' RC primary school. He later attended [[Fatima College]]. He was the grandson of the St Patrick's organist Ivy Telfer. His mother was Monica Jones, a British journalist, and his father, Mervyn Telfer, a television broadcaster on the national TV station [[Trinidad and Tobago Television|Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT)]]. Monica later married [[Rex Lassalle]], one of the leaders of a Regiment mutiny on April 21, 1970 (''see [[Black Power Revolution]]''). Jones was bullied as a child because "it was obvious to others" he was gay. He said in a newspaper interview that his parents "outed" him: “One day they sat me down and had a talk with me because there was so much homophobic bullying happening to me and I didn’t even know what a ''bullerman'' [a [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slur in Trinidad] was. They sat me down and explained what it meant. They didn’t avoid the pink elephant in the room.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.newsday.co.tt/2017/03/05/jason-jones-altar-boy-to-fighter/|title=Jason Jones: Altar boy to fighter - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday Archives|date=2017-03-05|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday Archives|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was a singer and left Trinidad in the 1985 to pursue his singing career in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Jones v Trinidad and Tobago==
Jones returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1992 and 1996 but "was forced away again" to the UK to avoid "persecution" and "[[homophobia]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He received death threats in Trinidad for his activism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/interview-jason-jones-activist-challenging-trinidad-and-tobago%E2%80%99s-anti-gay-law|title=Interview with Jason Jones, the Activist Challenging Trinidad and Tobago’s Anti-Gay Law|last=mmoneymaker|date=2017-03-03|work=OutRight|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/03/14/activist-threatened-challenging-trinidad-tobago-sodomy-law/|title=Activist threatened for challenging Trinidad and Tobago sodomy law|date=2017-03-14|work=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 and 2014 he returned to Trinidad and Tobago but returned to the UK again in the face of "intolerable" homophobia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He filed the historic lawsuit in the High Court of Trinidad and Tobago on February 23, 2017,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Gay-activist-files-lawsuit-challenging-Sexual-Offences-Act-in-T-T|title=Gay activist files lawsuit challenging Sexual Offences Act in T&amp;T|last=Limited|first=Jamaica Observer|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the constitutionality of Sections 13 and 16 in the Sexual Offences Act on the basis that: the “very existence of these sections continuously and directly affects the claimant’s private life by forcing him to either respect the law and refrain from engaging – even in private with consenting male partners – in prohibited sexual acts to which he is disposed by reason of his homosexual orientation, or to commit the prohibited acts and thereby become liable to criminal prosecution”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The lawsuit claimed the legislation infringed on his rights to privacy and freedom of thought and expression, and contravened his human rights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He further claimed those sections of the Act opened him up to ridicule and persecution because they criminalized consensual adult homosexual acts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Jones was represented by Richard Drabble QC, Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel; and the State by Fyard Hosein, SC, Keisha Prosper and Lesley Almarales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The court heard arguments in January 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2018-01-31/judge-sets-april-12-for-decision-in-lgbt-lawsuit|title=Judge sets April 12 for decision in LGBT lawsuit|website=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and delivered its judgment on April 12, 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In his judgement Justice Devindra Rampersad said Jones had proved the State's retention of the pertinent sections had “everything to do with homosexuality and the colonial abhorrence to the practice.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “It is a threat that is sanctioned by the State and that sanction is an important sanction because it justifies in the mind of others in society who are differently minded that the very lifestyle, life and existence of a person who chooses to live, in the way that the claimant does, is criminal and is deemed of a lesser value than anyone else. Those criminal sanctions have the potential to be used oppressively by differently minded citizens as a foundation for hate as condoned by the State,” the judgement said.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rampersad said of LGBTQI+ people in his judgment: “That is not their identity. That is not their soul. That is not the sum total of their value to society or their value to themselves. The experiences of apartheid South African and the USA during and after slavery, even into the mid- and late 20th century, have shown the depths that human dignity has been plunged as a result of presupposed and predetermined prejudices based on factors that do not accept or recognise humanity. Racial segregation, apartheid, the Holocaust – these are all painful memories of this type of prejudice.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The law cannot simply be struck from the books because of the Savings Provision of the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution, which retains laws that were in force before the Constitution was enacted in 1976. What Trinidadians and Tobagonians call the "Buggery Law" was inherited from the British legal code. However, since the original law was amended twice to raise penalties against homosexual sex acts, Jones argued the savings clause is not relevant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi, has since promised to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsday.co.tt/2018/04/13/govt-to-appeal-buggery-ruling/|title=Govt to appeal buggery ruling - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|date=2018-04-13|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Media activism==
Jones uses social media to raise funds for his legal campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalvoices.org/2017/12/09/transgender-womans-murder-in-trinidad-tobago-highlights-ostracism-faced-by-lgbtq-community/|title=Transgender Woman’s Murder in Trinidad &amp; Tobago Highlights Ostracism Faced by LGBTQ Community · Global Voices|date=2017-12-09|work=Global Voices|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/trinidad-trans-woman-shot-dumped-rubbish-murder-spree/#gs.CyjPWWQ|title=Trinidad trans woman shot and dumped in rubbish in murder spree|date=2017-12-07|work=Gay Star News|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Instagram&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/trinijayjay/|title=Jason Jones (@trinijayjay) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/trinijayjay|title=Jason Jones (@trinijayjay) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JJvTnT/|title=JONES v TnT|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accounts often feature posts on his campaign for LGBTQI+ rights in Trinidad and Tobago.

The '''Kind Movement''' (sometimes stylized as ''KIND Movement'') is a [[cause marketing|cause-marketing]] campaign&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12" /&gt; launched by [[KIND Healthy Snacks|Kind LLC]], a [[NYC|New-York]]-based [[snack food|snack-food]] manufacturer.

== History ==
Introduced in 2008, the Kind Movement was announced by Kind LLC's marketing director with the purpose of "[furthering] our mission to make the world a little kinder by inspiring kind acts." The Kind Movement is said to have "inspired thousands of unexpected acts of kindness around the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.

=== ''Kinded'' ===
The ''Kinded'' involved created and distributed uniquely coded cards that were to serve as 'licenses' to do kind acts. The hope was that this would start a chain of kind acts that could be publicly tracked by their unique code on an interactive online platform.

===''Do the KIND Thing''===
In March 2010, the company furthered its efforts to inspire unexpected acts of kindness with ''Do the KIND Thing'', a platform that empowered people to turn kind acts into support for causes.&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/business/media/12adnewsletter1.html "Depending on the Kind-ness of Strangers"] The New York Times, 2010-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; During the platform's three-month duration, ''Do The KIND Thing'' inspired more than 40,000 acts of kindness in support of nearly 150 causes. At the culmination, KIND awarded funds to the three causes that inspired the greatest number of KIND acts: Operation Gratitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opgratitude.com/|title=Operation Gratitude - Sending Care Packages to U.S. Military|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good Girls Give&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodgirlsgive.org/|title=Good Girls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Suffolk County JCC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkyjcc.org/|title=Home - SYJCC Your Community's Community Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, KIND unveiled a new iteration of ''Do the KIND Thing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.KINDsnacks.com/world|title=Let's celebrate kindness!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where people could transform their small acts of kindness into big KIND Acts that give back to the world.

On the first Tuesday of each month, KIND challenges its community to carry out a specific KINDING Mission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary#term-kinding-mission-proper-noun KINDING Mission]&lt;/ref&gt; (KIND Tuesday).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary#term-kind-tuesday-proper-noun KIND Tuesday]&lt;/ref&gt; If enough people sign up to complete that month's KINDING Mission, KIND carries out a BIG KIND Act&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404001123/http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary BIG KIND Act] &lt;/ref&gt; for a group of people that really needs it.

===#Kindawesome Card===
The #kindawesome card is a method noted on the Kind bar website. When someone does something nice, a #kindawesome card can be sent to them that can be redeemed for a free kind bar. The recipient gets another card to pass on to someone else and continue the kind gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howkindofyou.com|title=Let's celebrate kindness!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind Food Truck===
In April 2011, Kind introduced the Kind Food Truck to recruit people for the movement and to distribute samples of Kind products.

===Kind Charitable Support===
In 2010, Kind granted more than $100,000 in product and monetary donations to causes that inspired kindness—including organizations such as [[Surfrider Foundation]], [[Gail Simmons|Common Threads]], [[Autism Speaks]], [[Extreme Makeover Home Edition]] and the [[Great Kindness Challenges]].&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

==Reception==
The ''Kinded'' campaign received mixed press coverage, with [[NBC]] Connecticut asking, "Clever and optimistic or jaded marketing ploy?"&lt;ref name="nbcct"&gt;[http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/around-town/food-drink/Being-Kind-Kind-of-Pays-Off-63772162.html “Being Kind Pays Off, Kind Of”], NBC Connecticut. 2009-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognized by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as a "new way to make a difference"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1921428,00.html “New Ways to Make a Difference”], TIME Magazine. 2009-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=July 2016}} and by '' [[Ladies' Home Journal]]''as a way to "snack and give back."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/media-center/2009/10/ladies-home-journal-features-kind-and-kinded/ “Snack and Give Back”], Ladies’ Home Journal. 2009-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">{{Immanuel Kant}}

The '''Kingdom of Ends''' ({{lang-de|Reich der Zwecke}}) is a [[thought experiment]] centered on the moral philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant introduced the concept in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'' (4:439).  The thought experiment proposes a world in which all human beings are treated as ends (meaning treated as if they and their well-being are the goal), not as mere [[means to an end]] for other people.

== Overview ==

The Kingdom of Ends is a hypothetical state of existence that is derived from Kant's [[categorical imperative]]. A Kingdom of Ends is composed entirely of rational beings, whom Kant defines as those capable of moral deliberation (though his definition expands in other areas) who must choose to act by laws that imply an absolute necessity. It is from this point of view that they must judge themselves and their actions.

Though the term is usually translated as "Kingdom of Ends", the German word "[[Reich]]" is perhaps more appropriately translated as "[[realm]]". Kant uses it to mean the "systematic union of different rational beings under common laws". These common laws, established by the [[categorical imperative]], are the gauge used to evaluate the worthiness of an individual's actions. When all the kingdom's individuals live by the categorical imperative—particularly Kant's second formulation of it—each one will treat all of his fellowmen as ends in themselves, instead of means to achieving one's own selfish goals. This systematic whole is the Kingdom of Ends.

People can only belong to the Kingdom of Ends when they become subject to these universal laws. Such rational beings must regard themselves simultaneously as sovereign when making laws, and as subject when obeying them. Morality, therefore, is acting out of reverence for all universal laws which make the Kingdom of Ends possible.  In a true Kingdom of Ends, acting virtuously will be rewarded with happiness.

In his writings on religion, Kant interprets the Kingdom of God as a religious symbol for the moral reality of the Kingdom of Ends. As such, it is the ultimate goal of both religious and political organization of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KGH.html "'The Kingdom of God is at Hand!' (Did Kant really say that?)"], ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' 11:4 (October 1994), pp.421-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two notable allegations of '''lampshades made from human skin'''. After [[World War II]] it was alleged that [[Nazi]]s had made lampshades from murdered concentration camp inmates. In the 1950s, murderer [[Ed Gein]], possibly influenced by the stories about the Nazis, made a lampshade from the skin of one of his victims.

==History of anthropodermia==
The display of the flayed skin of defeated enemies has a long history. In ancient [[Assyria]], the flaying of defeated enemies and dissidents was common practice. The Assyrians would leave the skin to tan on their city walls.&lt;ref name=HLR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516 |title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? &amp;#124; The Record |publisher=[[Harvard Law Record]] |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several claims that the binding of some ancient and medieval books may be made of human skin. Allegedly, a 13th-century bible and a text of the Decretals were bound in human skin. Along with this hearsay, there are reports of copies of the [[French Constitution of 1793|1793 French Constitution]] being written on human skin and 19th-century anatomy textbooks being symbolically bound in skin.&lt;ref name=HLR/&gt;

==Nazi era==

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, claims circulated that [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], had possessed lampshades made of human skin, and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her conviction for war crimes, General [[Lucius D. Clay]], the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, reduced her sentence to four years' prison on the grounds "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected [[Nazi concentration camp]] inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Edward Smith]] in his biography, ''Lucius D. Clay, an American Life'', reported that the general had maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by General Clay years later:

:There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lamp shades were made out of goat skin.&lt;ref name="GoatSkin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lucius D. Clay: An American Life | publisher=Macmillan | author=Smith, Jean Edward | year=1990 | pages=301 | isbn=9780805009996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges were made once more when she was rearrested, but again were found to be groundless.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"/&gt; Journalist Mark Jacobson claims to be in possession of this lampshade, but those claims are disputed.&lt;ref name="SANTORO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santoro|first1=Gene|title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobson|first1=Mark|title=The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416566304|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ay4YLEhc_rUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Lampshade:+A+Holocaust+Detective+Story&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_qiC5PrXAhVCE7wKHb1TA6gQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Lampshade%3A%20A%20Holocaust%20Detective%20Story&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ed Gein==
[[Ed Gein]] was a killer and body snatcher, active in the 1950s, who made trophies from corpses he stole from a local graveyard. When he was finally arrested, a search of the premises revealed, among other disturbing artifacts, a lampshade made out of human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chloe Castleden|title=Ed Gein: The Psycho Cannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3_Wx5nIt_UC&amp;pg=PP11|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Limited|isbn=978-1-78033-341-0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Gelbin, Cathy, "Metaphors of Genocide", in Duttinger et al (ed), ''Performance and Performativity in German Cultural Studies'', Peter Lang, 2003, p.233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=December 2017}}
In a 1970 episode of the first series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketch "Mr. Hitler and the Minehead by-election", [[Adolf Hitler]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) says, "If he opens his big mouth again ... it's lampshade time!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 [[London Weekend Television]] drama ''[[The Death of Adolf Hitler]]'', Doctor [[Karl Gebhardt]] (played by [[Ray McAnally]]) claims to Hitler ([[Frank Finlay]]) that the lampshade in his office in the [[Führerbunker]] is made of human skin. Hitler is disgusted and flies into a rage, violently throwing the lamp away, showing Hitler's cognitive dissonance between his personal morality and the twisted inhumanity of his orders.

In 1995, [[August Kreis III]] was ejected from the set of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' after telling the host "Your relatives – weren't they all turned into [[soap made from human corpses|soap]] or lampshades?... I've got your mom in the trunk of my car".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/12/15/neo-nazi-leader-august-kreis-sentenced-for-fraud/ |title=Neo-Nazi Leader August Kreis Sentenced for Fraud |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |author=Lenz, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Skinned" from the 1995 [[Blind Melon]] album ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]'' is about Ed Gein and contains the lyrics "I'll make a lampshade of durable skin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Blind-melon-skinned-lyrics|title=Skinned|last=|first=|date=|website=genius.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human lampshade appears in [[Ken Russell]]'s 2007 short satire ''[[A Kitten for Hitler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |author2=Nayeri, Farah |first=Ian |title=U.K. Provocateur Ken Russell, Director of ‘Tommy,’ Dies at 84 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |accessdate=22 December 2012 |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185113/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Lenny, an American Jewish boy, who has a [[Nazi symbolism|swastika]]-shaped [[birthmark]], tries to soften Hitler's heart by giving him a kitten, but when Hitler sees the birthmark, he has [[Eva Braun]] kill Lenny to make him into a lampshade for their bedside table lamp. Near the end of the film, in what appears to be [[miracle#Judaism|an act of God]], the swastika transforms into the [[Star of David]].

In 2010 author [[Mark Jacobson]] published ''[[The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans]]''. In it he described how after [[Hurricane Katrina]] he uncovered a lamp which he believed to be made of human skin, and which may have come from a Nazi [[concentration camp]]. Initial flawed DNA testing appeared to show this was the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Santoro |first=Gene |url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm |title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust |publisher=Historynet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later more sophisticated testing proved it was cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Human Lampshade: A Holocaust Mystery|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNb1MZbqalk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2294|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a human-skin lamp appeared in the [[I Am Anne Frank (American Horror Story)|''I Am Anne Frank'']] episode of ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]''.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

'''Lea Lublin''' (born 1929, [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], Poland, died in 1999, [[Paris]], France&lt;ref name="Centre Pompidou"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personne: Lea Lublin|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAnXgG5/rGbggEp|website=Centre Pompidou|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Argentine-French performance artist. Her involvement with [[feminist movement]]s and themes included the [[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2007.

==Early life ==
Lea Lublin [[History of the Jews in Argentina|emigrated]] with her family to Argentina in 1931 and grew up in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;Lea Lublin: Retrospective 2015, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; There she attended classes at the [[:es:Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón|Prilidiano Pueyrredón National School of Fine Arts]] from age 12 on and graduated in 1949.&lt;ref name="re-act feminism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-act feminism: Léa Lublin - Mon fils|url=http://www.reactfeminism.org/entry.php?l=lb&amp;id=219&amp;e=t|website=Re-act feminism|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lublin began her artist life as painter, but in mid-1960 after her move to Paris, she began her interest in exploration of new media and materials. This interest lead her to cooperation with [[Centro de Artes Visuales of the Institute Torquato di Tella]], an Argentinean center for experimental and avant-garde art.

== Career ==
Lublin's work investigates imagery, often searching for what may not have yet been seen within imagery that is otherwise familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/contemporary-women-artists/oclc/40869639&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Contemporary women artists|last=Hillstrom|first=Laurie Collier|last2=Hillstrom|first2=Kevin|date=1999-01-01|publisher=St. James Press|isbn=1558623728|location=Detroit|page=407-409|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been influenced by psychoanalysis and feminist thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"LUBLIN, Lea." ''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''. ''Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lublin activated her works, often encouraging the viewer to interact with the work. For example, she mounted glass over painted reproductions of famous, iconographic paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and installed windshield wipers onto the glass. The audience was invited to squirt water on the painting, which would be cleared again by the wipers.&lt;ref&gt;Lea Lublin: Retrospective 2015, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Large-scale [[Installation art]] works followed. Lublin immersed viewers into the work, using made-to-specs inflatable tubes and objects, as well as black light and dark rooms or heaps of tiny plastic balls in which audience members could sit and cover themselves.

Lublin also created [[performance art]] sometimes called "exhibition-performances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In "Mon fils" (1968), she participated in the respectable May Exhibition in Paris by taking her baby son to the museums during the regular exhibition hours and exhibiting him and herself by doing the normal care of changing diapers, breast feeding and putting her son to sleep in his bed that she had brought with them.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt; This brought public attention to social and gender roles in her work. She continued performances of this kind in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] until the end of the 1960s. Her next work the "Terranauts" (1969) was deeply influenced by French feminism. Lublin eventually moved permanently to Paris, where she worked and lived until her death in 1999.

In her work, Lublin left behind the flat canvas that she had used as painter and became part of the movement of the 1960s that used art as a means for involved active social dialogue. Lublin supported the division on art and the life, building on [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]]' belief that art is a form of breathing. And her stand in it was feminist, involving the audience, critical but open for different receiver's groups.

Starting in the 1970s, Lublin tended to present her work in public rather than inside museums. She asked questions to passers by originally regarding art and later about the role of the women. Lublin also put provocative questions on large cloths, hoisted like flags to attract attention. By setting up closed circuit TV cameras nearby, she gave contributors the air of speaking as pundits on TV, breaking with role expectations and their own personal experience.

Beginning in the 1980s and until her last works in the mid 1990s, Lublin returned to interacting with iconographic works, particularly [[Renaissance]] paintings. She deconstructed the imagery of these paintings by, for example, removing the child from different paintings of Madonna with the child. This work explored the role of the baby and his mother in paintings created by male painters. Following [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] patterns, she identified the painter with the child looking for an eroticized image of the mother in the works or otherwise revealing sexual undertones in Christian imagery.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt;

When Lublin briefly returned to her former home [[Buenos Aires]] in 1989, she investigated [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] stay in the city from 1918 to 1919. Lublin got access to Duchamp's former apartment and noticed that both the old windows and the still mostly original colors of some walls matched those of Duchamp's iconic 1920 work ''Fresh Widow'' which he made after returning to Paris. Lublin also discovered that the female alter ego Duchamp used after 1920, Rose Sélavy, matched advertising in a Buenos Aires newspaper that he was known to have read. When she left, she stole the dilapidated letter box from Duchamp's former apartment and exhibited it later, recalling his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymade]] works.&lt;ref name="Lenbachhaus" /&gt; Lublin's interactions with Duchamp continued when she deconstructed the Rose advertising as well as his famous pissoirs in several of her own works, shifting them into a dispute with feminist statements. One of these was titled ''Le corps amer (à mère), l'objet perdu de M.D.'', shown at ''Femininmasculin'' at [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Beauborg]] in Paris. This piece consisted of a large, transparent skirt, stomach, and breasts with a urinal inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/re-enchantment/oclc/212627287&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Re-enchantment|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415960519|editor-last=Elkins|editor-first=James|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Morgan|editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lublin is considered to be part of the same generation as artists [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Allan Kaprow]].

==Works in collections==
Her works are in the collections of [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Centre national des arts plastiques]], the [[Fonds régional d’art contemporain Alsace]], and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name=Lenbachhaus&gt;{{cite web|title=Lea Lublin - Retrospective|url=http://www.lenbachhaus.de/exhibitions/lea-lublin/?L=1|website=Lenbachhaus - Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau München|publisher=Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau München|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the existing works are in her estate, administrated by Nicolas Lublin in Paris. In 2015 the [[Lenbachhaus]], in [[Munich]], Germany hosts the first ever retrospective, drawing heavily on the estate and works from several museum collections.

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

'''Malware analysis''' is the study or process of determining the functionality, origin and potential impact of a given [[malware]] sample such as a virus, worm, trojan horse, rootkit, or backdoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijarcsse.com/docs/papers/Volume_3/4_April2013/V3I4-0371.pdf|title=International Journal of Advanced Research in Malware Analysis |format=pdf|publisher=ijarcsse|accessdate =2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malware]] or malicious software is any computer software intended to harm the host operating system or to [[data breach|steal sensitive data]] from users, organizations or companies. Malware may include software that gathers user information without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchmidmarketsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/malware|title=Malware Definition|accessdate =2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use cases==
There are three typical use cases that drive the need for malware analysis:
* [[Computer security incident management]]: If an organization discovers or suspects that some malware may have gotten into its systems, a response team may wish to perform malware analysis on any potential samples that are discovered during the investigation process to determine if they are malware and, if so, what impact that malware might have on the systems within the target organizations' environment.
* [[Malware research]]: Academic or industry malware researchers may perform malware analysis simply to understand how malware behaves and the latest techniques used in its construction.
* [[Indicator of compromise]] extraction: Vendors of software products and solutions may perform bulk malware analysis in order to determine potential new indicators of compromise; this information may then feed the security product or solution to help organizations better defend themselves against attack by malware.

==Types==
The method by which malware analysis is performed typically falls under one of two types:
* '''Static malware analysis''': Static or Code Analysis is usually performed by dissecting the different resources of the binary file ''without executing it'' and studying each component. The binary file can also be disassembled (or [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]]) using a disassembler such as IDA. The machine code can sometimes be translated into assembly code which can be read and understood by humans: the malware analyst can then make sense of the assembly instructions and have an image of what the program is supposed to perform. Some modern malware is authored using evasive techniques to defeat this type of analysis, for example by embedding syntactic code errors that will confuse disassemblers but that will still function during actual execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Honig|first1=Andrew|last2=Sikorski|first2=Michael|title=Practical Malware Analysis|date=February 2012|publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=9781593272906|url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-malware-analysis/9781593272906/|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dynamic malware analysis''': Dynamic or Behavioral analysis is performed by observing the behavior of the malware while it is actually running on a host system. This form of analysis is often performed in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox environment]] to prevent the malware from actually infecting production systems; many such sandboxes are virtual systems that can easily be rolled back to a clean state after the analysis is complete. The malware may also be debugged while running using a [[debugging tool|debugger]] such as [[GNU Debugger|GDB]] or [[WinDbg]] to watch the behavior and effects on the host system of the malware step by step while its instructions are being processed. Modern malware can exhibit a wide variety of evasive techniques designed to defeat dynamic analysis including testing for virtual environments or active debuggers, delaying execution of malicious payloads, or requiring some form of interactive user input &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/detecting-malware-sandbox-evasion-techniques-36667|title=Detecting Malware and Sandbox Evasion Techniques|first1=Dilshan|last1=Keragala|date=January 2016|publisher=SANS Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Stages==
Examining malicious software involves several stages, including, but not limited to the following:

* Manual Code Reversing
* Interactive Behavior Analysis
* Static Properties Analysis
* Fully-Automated Analysis

'''Nationality''' is a legal relationship between an individual person and a [[sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name="Vonk2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vonk|first=Olivier|title=Dual Nationality in the European Union: A Study on Changing Norms in Public and Private International Law and in the Municipal Laws of Four EU Member States|date=March 19, 2012|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-22720-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. What these rights and duties are varies from state to state.&lt;ref name="Weis1979"&gt;Weis, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA29 Nationality and Statelessness in International Law]''. BRILL; 1979 [cited 19 August 2012]. {{ISBN|9789028603295}}. p. 29–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Customary international law|custom]] and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eudo-citizenship.eu/InternationalDB/docs/Convention%20on%20certain%20questions%20relating%20to%20the%20conflict%20of%20nationality%20laws%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226230108/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/InternationalDB/docs/Convention%20on%20certain%20questions%20relating%20to%20the%20conflict%20of%20nationality%20laws%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf |date=2014-12-26 }}. The Hague, 12 April 1930. Full text. Article 1, "It is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals...".&lt;/ref&gt; Such determinations are part of [[nationality law]]. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by [[public international law]]—for example, by [[Treaty|treaties]] on [[statelessness]] and the [[European Convention on Nationality]].

Nationality differs technically and legally from [[citizenship]], which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun ''national'' can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the [[Politics|political]] life of the state, such as by [[voting]] or [[Candidate|standing for election]]. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state.&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

In older texts, the word ''nationality'' rather than ''ethnicity'', often used to refer to an [[ethnic group]] (a group of people who share a common ethnic identity, language, culture, descent, history, and so forth). This older meaning of ''nationality'' is not defined by political borders or [[passport]] ownership and includes nations that lack an [[sovereign state|independent state]] (such as the [[Aramean people|Arameans]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[English people|English]], [[Basques]], [[Catalans]], [[Kurds]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyles]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Kashmiris]],
[[Palestinians]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]], [[Tamils]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Inuit]], [[Copts]], [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Sikhs]], [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]] and [[Székelys]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Individuals may also be considered nationals of groups with [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous status]] that [[devolution|have ceded some power]] to a larger government.

== International law ==
In international law, nationality is the status or relationship that gives a nation the right to protect a person from other nations.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  Diplomatic and [[consular protection]] are dependent upon this relationship between the person and the state.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadelbach |first1=Stefan |editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=Dirk |title=European Fundamental Rights and Freedoms |chapter=Part V: Citizenship Rights in Europe |date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter Recht |location=Berlin|isbn=9783110971965|pages=547–548|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHep8q-OxboC&amp;pg=PA547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person's status as being the national of a country is used to resolve the [[conflict of laws]].&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;

Nationality is also the status that allows a nation to grant rights to the subject and to impose obligations upon the subject.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In most cases, no rights or obligations are automatically attached to this status, although the status is a necessary precondition for any rights and obligations created by the state.&lt;ref name=Bast&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= von Bogdandy|editor1-first=Armin|editor2-last=Bast|editor2-first=Jürgen |title=Principles of European Constitutional Law.|date=2009|publisher=Hart Pub.|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847315502|pages=449–451|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the broad limits imposed by few treaties and international law, states may freely define who their nationals are and are not.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  However, since the [[Nottebohm case|''Nottebohm'' case]], other states are only required to respect their claim to protect an alleged national if the nationality is based on a true social bond.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In the case of dual nationality, states may determine the most effective nationality for a person, to determine which state's laws are most relevant.&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;  There are also limits on removing a person's status as a national. Article 15 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "Everyone has the right to a nationality," and "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality."

== National law ==
Nationals normally have the [[right of return|right to enter or return]] to the country they belong to. [[Passports]] are issued to nationals of a state, rather than only to citizens, because the passport is the travel document used to enter the country. However, nationals may not have the [[right of abode]] (the right to live permanently) in the countries that grant them passports.

==Nationality versus citizenship==
Conceptually, [[citizenship]] is focused on the internal political life of the state and nationality is a matter of international dealings.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"&gt;Turner, Bryan S; Isin, Engin F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtiZqLcJYZEC&amp;pg=PA278 Handbook of Citizenship Studies]''. SAGE; 2003-01-29. {{ISBN|9780761968580}}. p. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the concept of full citizenship encompasses not only active political rights, but full [[civil rights]] and [[social rights]].&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  Nationality is a [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessary but not sufficient condition]] to exercise full political rights within a state or other [[polity]].&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;  Nationality is required for full citizenship, and some people have no nationality in international law. A person who is denied full citizenship or nationality is commonly called a stateless person.

Historically, the most significant difference between a national and a citizen is that the citizen has the right to vote for elected officials, and to be elected.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  This distinction between full citizenship and other, lesser relationships goes back to antiquity. Until the 19th and 20th centuries, it was typical for only a small percentage of people who belonged to a city or state to be full citizens. In the past, most people were excluded from citizenship on the basis of gender, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, religion, and other factors. However, they held a legal relationship with their government akin to the modern concept of nationality.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

[[United States nationality law]] defines some persons born in U.S. outlying possessions as U.S. nationals but not citizens. [[British nationality law]] defines six classes of British national, among which "British citizen" is one class (having the [[right of abode]] in the United Kingdom, along with some "British subjects"). Similarly, in the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as [[Taiwan]], the status of [[national without household registration]] applies to people who have [[Republic of China nationality law|Republic of China nationality]], but do not have an automatic entitlement to enter or reside in the [[Taiwan Area]], and do not qualify for civic rights and duties there. Under the nationality laws of [[Mexican nationality law|Mexico]], [[Colombian nationality law|Colombia]], and some other Latin American countries, nationals do not become citizens until they turn 18.

==Nationality versus ethnicity==
{{Main|Ethnic nationalism}}

Nationality is sometimes used simply as an alternative word for [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] or national origin, just as some people assume that citizenship and nationality are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oommen, T. K. |title=Citizenship, nationality, and ethnicity: reconciling competing identities |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1997 |page=6 |isbn=0-7456-1620-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, the [[cognate]] word for ''nationality'' in local language may be understood as a synonym of ethnicity or as an identifier of cultural and family-based self-determination, rather than on relations with a state or current government. For example, some [[Kurds]] say that they have Kurdish nationality, even though there is no Kurdish [[sovereign state]] at this time in history.

[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|A Soviet birth certificate, in which the ''nacional'nost' '' of both parents (here both [[Jews|Jewish]]) was recorded. These records were subsequently used to determine the ethnicity of the child, as specified in his internal passport.]]
In the context of former [[Soviet Union]] and former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], "nationality" is often used as translation of the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''nacional'nost' '' and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''narodnost'', which were the terms used in those countries for [[ethnic group]]s and local affiliations within the member states of the [[federation]]. In the Soviet Union, more than 100 such groups were formally recognized. Membership in these groups was identified on Soviet [[internal passport]]s, and recorded in [[census]]es in both the USSR and Yugoslavia. In the early years of the Soviet Union's existence, ethnicity was usually determined by the person's native language, and sometimes through religion or cultural factors, such as clothing.&lt;ref name="Slezkine"&gt;Slezkine, Yuri (Summer 1994)  "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism" ''Slavic Review'' Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 414-452&lt;/ref&gt;  Children born after the revolution were categorized according to their parents' recorded ethnicities. Many of these ethnic groups are still recognized by modern [[Russia]] and other countries.

Similarly, the term ''[[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]'' refers to ethnic and cultural groups in China. Spain is one nation, made up of [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]], which are not politically recognized as nations (state), but can be considered smaller nations within the Spanish nation. Spanish law recognises the autonomous communities of [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as "[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]" (''nacionalidades'').

==Nationality versus national identity==
[[National identity]] is a person's subjective sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. A person may be a national of a state, in the sense of being its citizen, without subjectively or emotionally feeling a part of that state, for example many migrants in Europe often identify with their ancestral and/or religious background rather than with the state of which they are citizens. Conversely, a person may feel that he belongs to one state without having any legal relationship to it. For example, children who were brought to the U.S. illegally when quite young and grow up there with little contact with their native country and its culture often have a national identity of feeling American, despite legally being nationals of a different country.

==Dual nationality==
[[Multiple citizenship|Dual nationality]] is when a single person has a formal relationship with two separate, sovereign states.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;  This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country claims all offspring of the mother's as their own nationals, but the father's country claims all offspring of the father's.

Nationality, with its historical origins in allegiance to a sovereign monarch, was seen originally as a permanent, inherent, unchangeable condition, and later, when a change of allegiance was permitted, as a strictly exclusive relationship, so that becoming a national of one state required rejecting the previous state.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

Dual nationality was considered a problem that caused conflict between states and sometimes imposed mutually exclusive requirements on affected people, such as simultaneously serving in two countries' military forces. Through the middle of the 20th century, many international agreements were focused on reducing the possibility of dual nationality. Since then, many accords recognizing and regulating dual nationality have been formed.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

==Statelessness==
[[Statelessness]] is the condition in which an individual has no formal or protective relationship with any state. This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country rejects all offspring of mothers married to foreign fathers, but the father's country rejects all offspring born to foreign mothers. Although this person may have an emotional national identity, he or she may not legally be the national of any state.

Another stateless situation arises when a person holds a travel document (passport) which recognizes the bearer as having the nationality of a "state" which is not internationally recognized, has no entry in the International Organization for Standardization's country list, is not a member of the United Nations, etc.  In the current era, persons native to Taiwan who hold Republic of China passports are one example.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|quote=The Republic of China passport carried by native Taiwanese people clearly indicates the bearer's nationality as 'Republic of China.' Under international standards however, such a nationality designation does not exist. This is explained as follows.  ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, territories, etc. These three-letter abbreviations have been formally adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the official designation(s) of a 'recognized nationality' for use in manufacturing machine-readable passports, carried by travelers in order to deal with entry/exit procedures at customs authorities in all nations/territories of the world.  According to these three-letter ISO country codes adopted by ICAO, the 'Republic of China' is not a recognized nationality in the international community, and thus there is no 'ROC' entry.

'''Non-recurring engineering''' ('''NRE''') refers to the one-time cost to [[research]], [[design]], [[research and development|develop]] and [[physical test|test]] a new product or product enhancement. When [[budget]]ing for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be [[profit (accounting)|profitable]]. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike [[cost-of-production theory of value|production costs]], which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of [[fixed cost]] in [[economics]] terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost.

In a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project's costs, this can also be called [[research and development]] (R&amp;D). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from [[reserve (accounting)|reserves]], possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects.

The concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are necessarily high. However, Focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field. 

Mastery of NRE concepts as financial investments are a most excellent loss control tool and must be considered a key part of manufacturing profit enhancement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11091">In [[international law]], '''odious debt''', also known as '''illegitimate debt''', is a legal theory that says that [[government debt|the national debt]] incurred by a [[despotic]] [[regime]] should not be enforceable. Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under [[coercion]].&lt;ref name=UNCTAD&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Howse|title=The Concept of Odious Debt in Public International Law|date=July 2007| publisher=[[UNCTAD]]|location=Geneva |url= http://unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20074_en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite antecedents dating back to the 1800s and support from diverse fields such as [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[history]], and [[law]], odious debt is not part of [[international law]]; in fact, "[n]o national or international tribunal has ever cited Odious Debt as grounds for invalidating a sovereign obligation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mitu Gulati, Duke University School of Law; Ugo Panizza, The Graduate Institute Geneva and CEPR. The Hausmann-Gorky Effect. Working Paper No. HEIDWP02-2018. Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, International Economics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, international law holds governments strictly liable for all debt incurred by their predecessors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== History ==
The concept of odious debt was formalized in a 1927 treatise by [[Alexander Nahum Sack]], a [[Russia]]n émigré legal theorist. It was based on two 19th-century precedents—[[Mexico]]'s repudiation of debts incurred by [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], and the denial by the [[United States]] of [[Cuba]]n liability for debts incurred by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (20 November 2011), [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/a-new-euro-crisis-strategy-deny-the-debt/article2242826 "A new euro crisis strategy: Deny the debt"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.campbell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=fac_sw Sarah Ludington et al., ''Applied Legal History: Demystifying the Doctrine of Odious Debts''], 11 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 247, 253 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1656-1679_Online.pdf ''Developments in the Law — The International Place of Puerto Rico''], 130 HARV. L. REV. 1656 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sack wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the interests of the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc, this debt is odious for the people of the entire state. This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime. The reason why these odious debts cannot attach to the territory of the state is that they do not fulfil one of the conditions determining the lawfulness of State debts, namely that State debts must be incurred, and the proceeds used, for the needs and in the interests of the State. Odious debts, contracted and utilised for purposes which, to the lenders' knowledge, are contrary to the needs and the interests of the nation, are not binding on the nation &amp;ndash; when it succeeds in overthrowing the government that contracted them &amp;ndash; unless the debt is within the limits of real advantages that these debts might have afforded. The lenders have committed a hostile act against the people, they cannot expect a nation which has freed itself of a despotic regime to assume these odious debts, which are the personal debts of the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm Jubileeiraq.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306000652/http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm |date=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sack theorized that such debts are not enforceable when (1) the lender should have known that (2) the debt was incurred without the consent and (3) without benefit to the populace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183&amp;context=faculty_scholarship Patrick Bolton &amp; David Skeel, ''Odious Debts or Odious Regimes?''], 70 LAW &amp; CONTEMP. PROBS. 83 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many examples of similar debt repudiation.&lt;ref name=mystify&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Mitu Gulati| author2 = Sarah Ludington| author3= Alfred L. Brophy |title=Applied Legal History: Demystifying the Doctrine of Odious Debts| journal=[[Theoretical Inquiries in Law]] | date =January 2010| volume=11 |issue =1 |pages=247–281| doi=10.2202/1565-3404.1242| url= http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/2840/|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH | issn = 1565-3404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]], acting as an [[Arbitrator|arbiter]], used the doctrine to find that [[Costa Rica]] did not have to pay the [[United Kingdom]] debts incurred by the [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1336&amp;context=yjil Odette Lienau, ''Who Is the “Sovereign” in Sovereign Debt?: Reinterpreting a Rule-of-Law Framework from the Early Twentieth Century''], 33 YALE J. INT’L L. 63 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Patricia Adams, executive director of Probe International, a [[Canada|Canadian]] environmental and public policy advocacy organization and author of  ''Odious Debts: Loose Lending, Corruption, and the Third World's Environmental Legacy'', stated: "by giving creditors an incentive to lend only for purposes that are transparent and of public benefit, future tyrants will lose their ability to finance their armies, and thus the [[War on Terror|war on terror]] and the cause of world peace will be better served."&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Adams|title=Odious Debts: Loose Lending, Corruption, and the Third World's Environmental Legacy|date=1991|isbn=978-1853831225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K3YAwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Cato Institute]] policy analysis, Adams suggested that debts incurred by [[Iraq]] during [[Saddam Hussein]]'s reign were odious because the money was spent on weapons, instruments of repression, and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Adams, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-526es.html "Iraq's Odious Debt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103223442/http://www.cato.org//pubs/pas/pa-526es.html |date=2006-01-03 }}, Cato Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 article by economists Seema Jayachandran and [[Michael Kremer]] renewed interest in this topic.&lt;ref name=brook&gt;{{cite news | author1= Michael Kremer |author2 = Seema Jayachandran |title = Odious Debt: When Dictators Borrow, Who Repays the Loan?| url= http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2003/03/spring-development-kremer |work = Brookings Institution |date=Spring 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that the idea can be used to create a new type of economic sanction to block further borrowing by [[dictators]].&lt;ref name=imf&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Michael Kremer| author2= Seema Jayachandran|journal= [[Finance &amp; Development]]|title=Odious Debt|date=June 2002|volume = 39| issue=2| url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/06/kremer.htm | publisher =IMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayachandran proposed new recommendations in November 2010 at the 10th anniversary of the Jubilee movement at the [[Center for Global Development]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/1424565&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the loan sanctions model has been adapted by the Centre for Global Developments&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgdev.org/working-group/prevention-odious-debt-working-group&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the base for a number of further suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schneider | first = Friedrich Benjamin | title = The International Convention on the Prevention of Odious Agreements: A Human Rights-Based Mechanism to Avoid Odious Debts | journal=Leiden Journal of International Law | volume = 28 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2015 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9882300&amp;fileId=S0922156515000291 |issue=3  |pages=557–578}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some think the doctrine could aid [[international development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1435&amp;context=lcp Tom Ginsburg &amp; Thomas S. Ulen, ''Odious Debt, Odious Credit, Economic Development, and Democratization''], 70 LAW &amp; CONTEMP. PROBS. 115 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Others think that the doctrine should allow even more kinds of debt to be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=facpub Christiana Ochoa, ''From Odious Debt to Odious Finance: Avoiding the Externalities of a Functional Odious Debt Doctrine''], 49 HARV. INT’L L.J. 109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
In December 2008, [[Ecuador]]ian President [[Rafael Correa]] attempted to default on Ecuador's [[national debt]], calling it illegitimate odious debt, because it was contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecuador defaults on foreign debt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7780984.stm|work=BBC|date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded in reducing the price of the debt letters before continuing paying the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealnews.com/id/3622/April27,2009/%22Avenger+against+oligarchy%22+wins+in+Ecuador "'Avenger against oligarchy' wins in Ecuador"], ''[[The Real News]]'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the overthrow of [[Haiti]]'s [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] in 1986, there were calls to cancel Haiti's debt owed to multilateral institutions, calling it unjust odious debt, and Haiti could better use the funds for education, health care, and basic infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208224330/http://www.jubileeusa.org/jubilee.cgi?path=%2Ftake_action&amp;page=haiti06.html Haiti Debt Action]&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2008, the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution had 66 co-sponsors in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://waters.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=169193 "Congresswoman Maxine Waters Introduces Legislation to Cancel Haiti’s Debt"]&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations in the United States issued [[action alert]]s around the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution, and a Congressional letter to the [[U.S. Treasury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/articles/articles/article_recent_news_2-12-08.html |title=Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti |publisher=Ijdh.org |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Jubilee USA, the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]] and Pax Christi USA.

'''[[Evolution]]''' – change in [[heritable trait]]s of [[Organisms|biological organisms]] over generations due to [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]], and [[genetic drift]].  Also known as '''descent with modification'''. Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ([[speciation]]), changes within lineages ([[anagenesis]]), and loss of species ([[extinction]]). "Evolution" is also another name for [[evolutionary biology]], the subfield of [[biology]] concerned with studying [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[diversity of life]] on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">The '''passivation''' of a [[spacecraft]] is the removal of any internal energy contained in the vehicle at the end of its mission or useful life.&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt; Spent [[upper stage]]s are generally passivated after their use as launch vehicles is complete, as are [[satellite]]s when they [[:Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth|can no longer be utilized]] for their initial design purpose.  

==Overview==
For satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]], both the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) and [[United Nations]] (UN) recommend that GEO-satellites be designed such that they can, at end of life, remove themselves to a [[graveyard orbit|disposal orbit]] some {{convert|350|km}} above the [[geostationary orbit|GEO]] belt, and then passivate themselves by removing any internally stored energy. "There is no [international] enforcement of these recommendations" but the majority of these GEO spacecraft are being boosted up into the recommended [[graveyard orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="ss20111205"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/05-dec-2011/broadcast-1666-special-edition|title=Broadcast 1666 (Special Edition) - Topic: Space debris issues|last=Johnson|first=Nicholas|date=2011-12-05|editor-last=Livingston|editor-first=David|website=|publisher=[[The Space Show]]|at=1:03:05–1:06:20|type=podcast|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The largest component of internally stored energy is generally unused [[propellant]],&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt; although [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] are also important sources of stored energy that require passivation.&lt;ref name="bonnal2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonnal|first=Christophe|date=|year=2007|title=Design and operational practices for the passivation of spacecraft and launchers at the end of life|url=http://pig.sagepub.com/content/221/6/925.abstract|journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1243/09544100JAERO231|issn=2041-3025|accessdate=2012-12-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Empirical history has shown that stored energy that is not dissipated can often become an [[energy]] source for initiating an [[explosion]] or fragmentation, resulting in unwanted manmade [[space debris]].&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonnal2007/&gt;

==Standard practices==
Within national regimes, where national governments can control the [[launch license]]s of launch vehicles and spacecraft, there are some enforceable requirements for passivation.  

The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] has implemented a set of standard practices for both civilian ([[NASA]]) and military ([[United States Department of Defense|DoD]]/[[USAF]]) orbital debris mitigation that require passivation.  "All on-board sources of stored energy of a spacecraft or upper stage should be depleted or safed when they are no longer required for mission operations or postmission disposal. Depletion should occur as soon as such an operation does not pose an unacceptable risk to the [[payload]]. Propellant depletion burns and compressed gas releases should be designed to minimize the probability of subsequent accidental collision and to minimize the impact of a subsequent accidental explosion."&lt;ref name="us20131128"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/USG_OD_Standard_Practices.pdf|title=U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices|last=|first=|date=|website=[[NASA]]|publisher=United States Federal Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html|title=Orbital Debris – Important Reference Documents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA Orbital Debris Program Office|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702025151/http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html|archive-date=2016-07-02|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53895">'''Pessimism''' is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an [[optimism|optimist]] is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Bennett, Oliver. ''Cultural pessimism.'' Edinburgh university press.  2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical pessimism''' is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often [[existential nihilism|existential nihilists]] believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.

==Etymology==
The term pessimism derives from the Latin word ''pessimus'' meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by [[Jesuit]] critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel '[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of [[Leibniz]] who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the ''Revue de Trévoux'' accused him of ''pessimisme''.&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dienstag |first=Joshua Foa |title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=February 17, 2009 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical pessimism==&lt;!-- "Philosophical pessimism" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:DOI Rousseau.jpg|thumb|250px|Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' was an attack on the enlightenment idea of social progress which he saw as morally decadent.]]
Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a [[worldview]] or [[ethic]] that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the [[Idea of Progress]] and [[religious faith]]) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the [[Dialogue of Pessimism]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] (which maintains that everything is ''hevel'', literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean '[[senseless]]' and '[[absurdity|absurd]]'.)

In [[Western philosophy]], philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit'', Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as "that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense [[irony|ironic]]; that [[free will|freedom]] and [[happiness]] are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical pessimists see the [[self-consciousness]] of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this "terror" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can "progress" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, "our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense "absurd". [[Absurdism|Absurdity]] is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: "a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to [[Socrates]] and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Mainländer]], recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in [[Indian religions]] and [[Christian monasticism]]). Some followers tend to believe that "expecting the worst leads to the best." [[Rene Descartes]] even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to "negative" events were removed.  [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace [[nothingness]]. Others like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]] respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a "Dionysian pessimism", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: [[Suicide]], a [[leap of faith]] (as per [[Kierkegaard]]'s [[knight of faith]]), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers ([[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/|title= Wicks, Robert "Arthur Schopenhauer"|chapter= Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is [[aphorism|aphoristic writing]], and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Dino Buzzati]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], [[Thomas Ligotti]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]].

==Notable proponents==

===Ancient Greeks===
In ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]] (called "the Weeping Philosopher") and [[Parmenides]] represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the "enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heraclitus]] denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable "indefinite." And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: "I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before." ''The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.&lt;ref name="diogquote"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Hegesias}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: "for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference".&lt;ref name="diogquote"/&gt; According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called ''Death by Starvation'', which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BCE, [[Stoicism]] propounded as an exercise "the premeditation of evils"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Burkeman |title=The Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92fgjq7-qLwC |accessdate=2013-01-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921922671 |pages=32–33 |quote=[...] the Stoics propose a[n] elegant, sustainable and calming way to deal with the possibility of things going wrong: rather than struggling to avoid all thought of these worst-case scenarios, they counsel actively dwelling on them, staring them in the face. Which brings us to an important milestone on the negative path to happiness — a psychological tactic that William [B.] Irvine argues is 'the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' toolkit'. He calls it 'negative visualisation'. The Stoics themselves, rather more pungently, called it 'the premeditation of evils'. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltasar Gracián===
[[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel ''El Criticón'' was his favorite book{{citation needed|reason=This is a very definite claim|date=January 2015}}. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's ''The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence'' into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style ([[conceptismo]]) and often quoted him in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History dictionary of Schopenhauer's philosophy |last=Cartwright |first=David E. |publisher=Scarecrow press, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracian's novel ''El Criticón'' (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for [[happiness]] which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. ''The Critic'' paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His ''Pocket Oracle'' was a book of [[aphorisms]] on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence |last=Gracian |first=Balthasar |publisher=Penguin books |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltaire===
Voltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to his critique of [[Alexander Pope]]'s optimistic "An Essay on Man", and [[Leibniz]]' affirmation that "we live in the best of all possible worlds." Voltaire's novel [[Candide]] is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his [[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Poem on the Lisbon Disaster]] is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a [[Deist]], Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the [[problem of evil]].

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
The major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called "the patriarch of pessimism".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, humans in their "natural goodness" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the [[state of nature]] as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by ''amour propre'', a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives "always outside himself", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of "perfectibility" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus ''[[The Social Contract]]'' opens with the famous phrase "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are "greater slaves" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live "outside themselves".

===Giacomo Leopardi===
Though a lesser known figure outside Italy, [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that "Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that "it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing."

Leopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of [[Christopher Columbus]] who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogue between Columbus and Pedro Gutierrez (Operette morali) |last=Leopardi |first=Giacomo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: "He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die."

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer had an influence upon later thinkers and artists such as Freud and Wagner]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism comes from his elevating of [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] above [[reason]] as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] is the ultimate metaphysical animating [[noumenon]] and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one [[metaphor]], Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Pessimism |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60206-349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. 
He pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — ''The world as will and representation, pg 319'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging "like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', pg 312&lt;/ref&gt; This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (''nichtigkeit'') and to realize that "the purpose of our existence is not to be happy".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', vol II, pg 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt;

Schopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through "losing yourself" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of [[asceticism]] (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by "saintly persons") could free oneself from the Will altogether.

Schopenhauer never used the term ''pessimism'' to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common terms used to describe his thought were [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] and [[irrationalism]] which he also never used.

=== Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism&lt;!--'Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism' and 'Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, '''post-Schopenhauerian pessimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a rather popular "trend" in 19th century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Langer, ''Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as [[Hegelianism]], [[materialism]], [[Neo-Kantianism]] and the emerging [[positivism]]. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in [[science]], the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's [[transcendental idealism]] into what [[Frederick C. Beiser]] calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser]] reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: "Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of ''transcendental realism'', i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience." (Beiser, Frederick C., ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not [[things-in-themselves]]), the transcendental realist thesis is that "the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves."&lt;ref name=Beiser147&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the "Post-Schopenhauerian" thinkers inherited from the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt sage]]'s teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would "assuage" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing [[historicism]], as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor [[Julius Frauenstadt]] and with [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist).&lt;ref name=Beiser147/&gt; [[Julius Bahnsen]] would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Philipp Mainländer]] set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a "pessimism of the future", a "[[Dionysian]] pessimism."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'', book V&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek [[pre-socratic]]s and also saw it at the core of ancient [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as "morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and [[nihilism]]. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a "great liberation" through a "pessimism of strength" which "does not sit in judgement of this condition".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to "make oneself a new pair of wings", i.e. to [[Transvaluation of values|re-evaluate all values]] and create new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of [[amor fati]] and [[eternal recurrence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is "good for one's health" as a "remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Camus===
[[Image:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camus used the punishment of [[Sisyphus]] to represent the human condition.]]

In a 1945 article, [[Albert Camus]] wrote "the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea."&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=DV6H76TX&amp;tocp=13|title= Albert Camus, ''Pessimism and Courage''}}, ''Combat'', September 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Camus helped popularize the idea of "[[Absurdism|the absurd]]", a key term in his famous essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which "sets me in opposition to all creation".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Camus |title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-73373-7 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through "eluding" (''l'esquive''), a 'trickery' for "those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth" /&gt; He considered [[suicide]] and [[religion]] as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of [[Sisyphus]], who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

==Other forms==

=== Epistemological ===
There are several theories of [[epistemology]] which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to [[nihilism]], [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[relativism]].

[[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819), analyzed [[rationalism]], and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy in order to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} according to which all rationalism reduces to [[nihilism]], and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]].

[[Richard Rorty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|social relations of power]], or [[language-games]] that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of [[anti-foundationalism]], while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.

===Political and cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural pessimism}}
Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the [[optimism]] or even [[utopianism]] of [[Hegelian]] philosophies. [[Emil Cioran]] claimed "Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"&lt;ref name="Cioran"&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienstag|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of [[social progress]] can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, "every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 178&lt;/ref&gt; Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an "idolatry of tomorrow" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in [[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]].

There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of [[cultural criticism]] and [[social decline]] which is seen in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s '[[The Decline of the West]]'. Spengler promoted a [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]] similar to the theories of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Spengler believed modern [[western civilization]] was in the 'winter' age of decline (''untergang''). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in [[Weimar Germany]]. Similarly, traditionalist [[Julius Evola]] thought that the world was in the [[Kali Yuga]], a dark age of moral decline.

Intellectuals like [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] correlate economic progress with [[economic inequality]], the stimulation of artificial needs, and [[affluenza]]. [[Anti-consumerist]]s identify rising trends of [[conspicuous consumption]] and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like [[Jean Baudrillard]] have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt;

[[Conservative]] thinkers, especially [[social conservatives]], often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. [[William F. Buckley]] famously remarked that he was "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" and [[Whittaker Chambers]] was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to [[communism]], though he was himself violently [[anti-communist]]. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in [[Christianity]] and/or [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosophy]], leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. [[Robert Bork]]'s ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah'' and [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''The Closing of the American Mind'' are famous expressions of this point of view.

Many economic conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the [[welfare state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lowenthal |first=D |title=Orwell's Political Pessimism in '1984' |publisher=Polity |year=1969 |jstor=3234097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to [[emigrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brym |first=RJ |title=The emigration potential of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Russia: recent survey results |publisher=International Sociology |year=1992 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/soc101y/brym/is.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] in the United States, the [[neologism]] "[[pessimism porn]]" was coined to describe the alleged [[Eschatology|eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn?

===Technological and environmental===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|right|Luddites destroy machines (1812)]]
Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the [[industrial revolution]] with the [[Luddite]] movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The [[Romantic movement]] was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |title=Romanticism |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718052334/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social critics and environmentalists believe that [[globalization]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the economic practices of modern [[capitalist]] states over-stress the planet's [[Balance of nature|ecological equilibrium]]. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, [[climate change]] will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/apr/27/the-global-delusion/ The Global Delusion, John Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] believes that the [[ecology]] of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/a-great-jump-to-disaster/ A Great Jump to Disaster?, Tim Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]], [[anti-globalization]] activists, and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-luddites]] can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern "progress". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is [[anarcho-primitivism]] which faults the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote [[deindustrialization]], abandonment of modern technology and [[rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]].

An infamous anarcho-primitivist is [[Theodore Kaczynski]], also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'' he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern "industrial-technological system".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto begins thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the [[voluntary human extinction movement]] which argues for the extinction of the human race through [[antinatalism]].

[[Pope Francis]]' controversial [[Laudato si'|2015 encyclical on ecological issues]] is ripe with [[Laudato si'#Technology|pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world]].

====Entropy pessimism====
{{See also |Heat death of the universe |Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #The relevance of thermodynamics to economics |Ecological economics #Methodology}}
[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution.]]
'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principles]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#First law|first law of thermodynamics]], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] — also known as [[Entropy|the entropy law]] — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the [[heat death of the universe]], taken as a whole.

The term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field |progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts |paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|magnum opus on ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|545}}

Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369-371}} &lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253-256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168-171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150-153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106-109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546-549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142-145}}

Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [[ecological economics]] and in the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]].

===Legal===
Bibas writes that some [[criminal defense attorney]]s prefer to err on the side of pessimism: "Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bibas |first=Stephanos |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |publisher=Harvard Law Review |volume=117 |number=8 |date=Jun 2004 |pages=2463–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a psychological disposition==
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
In the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with [[Melancholia|melancholy]], and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. 
The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional [[suffering|pain]] or even biology. [[Aaron Beck]] argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world.  Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in [[Depressive realism]] or ([[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic realism]]).&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt; Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirszner |first=Laurie |date=January 2012 |title=Patterns for College Writing |location=United States |publisher=Bedford/St.Martins |page=477 |isbn=978-0-312-67684-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pessimism item on the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] has been judged useful in predicting suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=RA |last2=Steer |first3=M |last3=Kovacs |title=Hopelessness and eventual suicide: a 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=5 |pages=559–563 |year=1985 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/5/559|doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.559 |pmid=3985195 |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.6328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=A |last2=Weissman |first3=D |last3=Lester |first4=L |last4=Trexler |title=The measurement of pessimism: the hopelessness scale |publisher=Journal of Consulting and Clinical |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wender |first=PH |last2=Klein |first2=DF |title=Mind, Mood and Medicine |publisher=New American Library |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Pragmatic criticism===
Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael R. Michau. "Doing, Suffering, and Creating": William James and Depression.  http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mmichau/james-and-depression.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[William James]] rejected their pessimism after suffering [[psychological illness|psychological]], or even [[psychosomatic]] illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term "pessimism" is being abused. The link between pessimism and [[nihilism]] is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to [[optimism]], nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. ''[[Personality Plus]]'' opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. [[melancholy temperament|melancholy]] and [[phlegmatic temperament|phlegmatic]]) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. [[choleric temperament|choleric]] and [[sanguine temperament|sanguine]]) miss.

The '''Petter Chamor''' ({{lang-he|פטר חמור}}) or '''Redemption of the firstborn donkey''', is a [[mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]] in which a male firstborn ([[Firstborn (Judaism)|bechor]]) [[donkey]] is redeemed by the owner of the donkey, who gives a [[sheep|lamb]] or [[goat|kid]] to a [[Kohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/44853/ |title=Petter Chamor &amp;ndash; Redeeming A Donkey |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rabbi Gershon |work=[[The Jewish Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228044820/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/44853/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamb is not required to be firstborn. 
  
The mitzvah, albeit rare in modern times, is listed as an "obligation of the body" &lt;ref&gt;("chovath haguf" vs. "chovath hakarka" -an obligation required solely on one of the [[land of Israel]])&lt;/ref&gt; and thus mandatory for diasporic Jewry.

A '''population pyramid''', also called an "'''age-sex pyramid'''", is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a [[population]] (typically that of a country or region of the world), which forms the shape of a [[pyramid]] when the population is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://populationpyramid.net/|title=Population Pyramids of the World from 1950 to 2100|website=PopulationPyramid.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured by raw number or as a percentage of the total population. This tool can be used to visualize and age of a particular population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population An introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species.

==Structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Population pyramids often contain continuous stacked-histogram bars, making it a horizontal bar diagram. The population size is depicted on the x-axis (horizontal) while the age-groups are represented on the y-axis (vertical).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/population-pyramid|title=population pyramid {{!}} sociology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the population can either be measured as a [[percent]]age of the total population or by raw number. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right. Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.state.pa.us/hpa/stats/techassist/pyramids.htm Department of Health Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830154203/http://www.health.state.pa.us/hpa/stats/techassist/pyramids.htm |date=2009-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid, and this can shed light on the [[Sustainable development|extent of development]] and other aspects of the population.

The measures of central tendency, mean, median, and mode, should be considered when assessing a population pyramid. since the data is not completely accurate. For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur.

A population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low [[fertility rate]]. The broad base of the pyramid means the majority of population lies between ages 0–14, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population [[sub-replacement fertility]] level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter [[life expectancy]] of sixty years.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/population-pyramids.aspx|title=From Population Pyramids to Pillars|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'' women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The [[dependency ratio]] refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15–64). According to Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. [[Population momentum]], when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term [[doubling time]], which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the [[age stratification]]  since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population.

In the [[demographic transition]] model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone.  In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.

==Types==
Each country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, most population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.&lt;ref name=osu&gt;[http://www.fsl.orst.edu/pnwerc/wrb/Atlas_web_compressed/5.Human_Populations/5h.pyramids_web.pdf Population Pyramids] - Oregon State University&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Stationary" pyramid
:A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remains constant over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population An Introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|isbn=978-1305094505|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stationary population is when a population contains equal birth rates and death rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

;"Expansive" pyramid
:A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with high birth rate and low life expectancy.&lt;ref name=osu/&gt; The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort gets larger than the size of the previous year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korenjak-Cˇ erne, Kejžar, Batagelj|first=|year=2008|title=Clustering of Population Pyramids|url=|journal=Informatica|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Constrictive" pyramid
:A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom. The population is generally older on average, as the country has long life expectancy, a low death rate, but also a low birth rate.&lt;ref name=osu/&gt; However, the percentage of  younger population are extremely low, this can cause issues with dependency ratio of the population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This pyramid is more common when immigrants are factored out. This is a typical pattern for a very developed country, a high level of education, easy access to and incentive to use birth control, good health care, and few negative environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/what-are-different-types-population-pyramids|title=What are the different types of population pyramids?|last=Boucher|first=Lauren|date=10 March 2016|website=www.populationeducation.org |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth bulge phenomenon==
{{See also|Baby boom|List of countries by median age}}
[[File:2017 world map, median age by country.svg|thumb|300px|[[Median]] age by country. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent for West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

]]

Gary Fuller (1995) described Youth bulge as a type of expansive pyramid. [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] (2003) argues that an excess in especially young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest, [[war]] and [[terrorism]], as the "third and fourth sons" that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology.

Heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment) and most [[genocide]]s can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge, including [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|European colonialism]], 20th-century [[fascism]], rise of [[Communism]] during the [[Cold War]], and ongoing conflicts such as that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2615183|title=Why a two-state solution doesn't guarantee peace in the Middle East|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This factor has been also used to account for the [[Arab Spring]] events.&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A. et al.[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=1 A Trap At The Escape From The Trap?

A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough&amp;nbsp;– in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16–30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males. In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P. 1996.

To reverse the effects of youth bulges, specific policies such as creating more jobs, improving family planning programs, and reducing over all infant mortality rates should be a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/effects-youth-bulge-civil-conflicts/p13093|title=The Effects of ‘Youth Bulge’ on Civil Conflicts|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East and North Africa===
{{Further|Demographic trap}}
The [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] are currently experiencing a prominent youth bulge. "Across the Middle East, countries have experienced a pronounced increase in the size of their youth populations over recent decades, both in total numbers and as a percentage of the total population. Today, the nearly 111 million individuals aging between 15 to 29 living across the region make up nearly 27 percent of the region’s population." &lt;ref name="Hassan and Dyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassan|first1=Islam|last2=Dyer|first2=Paul|title=The State of Middle Eastern Youth.|journal=The Muslim World|date= 2017|volume=107|issue=1|pages=3–12|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/1042998/TheMuslimWorld_CIRS_Special_Issue_Intro_January2017.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural changes in service provision, especially health care, beginning in the 1960s created the conditions for a demographic explosion, which has resulted in a population consisting primarily of younger people. It is estimated that around 65% of the regional population is under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/blog/detail/986/|title=Middle East Youth Initiative|website=Middle East Youth Initiative|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle East has invested more in education, including religious education, than most other regions such that education is available to most children.&lt;ref name="Middle East Youth Initiative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/623/1|title=Middle East Youth Initiative|website=Middle East Youth Initiative|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that education has not led to higher levels of employment, and youth unemployment is currently at 25%, the highest of any single region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shababinclusion.org/section/topics/employment|title=Middle East Youth Initiative|website=Middle East Youth Initiative|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this 25%, over half are first time entrants into the job market.&lt;ref name="Middle East Youth Initiative"/&gt;

The youth bulge in the Middle East and North Africa has been favorably compared to that of East Asia, which harnessed this human capital and saw huge economic growth in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth – An Undervalued Asset: Towards a New Agenda in the Middle East and North Africa, Progress, Challenges and Way Forward," Middle East and North Africa Region Human Development Department (MNSHD), The World Bank, 2007|url=http://www.childmigration.net/files/433720SR0WHITE11PUBLIC10YPN1English.pdf|accessdate= 27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth bulge has been referred to by the [[Middle East Youth Initiative]] as a [[demographic gift]], which, if engaged, could fuel regional economic growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Youth Initiative: About: Why Shabab?|url=http://www.shababinclusion.org/section/about/why_shabab|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "While the growth of the youth population imposes supply pressures on education systems and labor markets, it also means that a growing share of the overall population is made up of those considered to be of working age; and thus not dependent on the economic activity of others. In turn, this declining dependency ratio can have a positive impact on overall economic growth, creating a demographic dividend. The ability of a particular economy to harness this dividend, however, is dependent on its ability to ensure the deployment of this growing working-age population towards productive economic activity, and to create the jobs necessary for the growing labor force." &lt;ref name="Hassan and Dyer"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18903">In [[mathematical logic]], '''predicate functor logic''' ('''PFL''') is one of several ways to express [[first-order logic]] (also known as [[predicate logic]]) by purely algebraic means, i.e., without [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variable]]s. PFL employs a small number of algebraic devices called predicate functors (or predicate modifiers) that operate on terms to yield terms. PFL is mostly the invention of the [[logic]]ian and [[philosopher]] [[Willard Quine]].

==Motivation==
The source for this section, as well as for much of this entry, is Quine (1976). Quine proposed PFL as a way of algebraizing [[first-order logic]] in a manner analogous to how [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] algebraizes [[propositional logic]]. He designed PFL to have exactly the expressive power of [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]. Hence the [[metamathematics]] of PFL are exactly those of first-order logic with no interpreted predicate letters: both logics are [[consistency proof|sound]], [[Completeness (logic)|complete]], and [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Most work Quine published on logic and mathematics in the last 30 years of his life touched on PFL in some way.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

Quine took "functor" from the writings of his friend [[Rudolf Carnap]], the first to employ it in [[philosophy]] and [[mathematical logic]], and defined it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The word ''functor'', grammatical in import but logical in habitat... is a sign that attaches to one or more expressions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an expression of a given grammatical kind." (Quine 1982: 129)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ways other than PFL to algebraize [[first-order logic]] include:
*[[Cylindric algebra]] by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his American students. The simplified cylindric algebra proposed in Bernays (1959) led Quine to write the paper containing the first use of the phrase "predicate functor";
*The [[polyadic algebra]] of [[Paul Halmos]]. By virtue of its economical primitives and axioms, this algebra most resembles PFL;
*[[Relation algebra]] algebraizes the fragment of [[first-order logic]] consisting of formulas having no atomic formula lying in the scope of more than three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. That fragment suffices, however, for [[Peano arithmetic]] and the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]]; hence relation algebra, unlike PFL, is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. Most work on relation algebra since about 1920 has been by Tarski and his American students. The power of relation algebra did not become manifest until the monograph Tarski and Givant (1987), published after the three important papers bearing on PFL, namely Bacon (1985), Kuhn (1983), and Quine (1976);
*[[Combinatory logic]] builds on [[combinator]]s, [[higher order function]]s whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is another combinator or function, and whose [[range (mathematics)|range]] is yet another combinator. Hence [[combinatory logic]] goes beyond first-order logic by having the expressive power of [[set theory]], which makes combinatory logic vulnerable to [[paradox]]es. A predicate functor, on the other hand, simply maps predicates (also called [[Term (mathematics)|terms]]) into predicates.
PFL is arguably the simplest of these formalisms, yet also the one about which the least has been written.

Quine had a lifelong fascination with [[combinatory logic]], attested to by his (1976) and his introduction to the translation in Van Heijenoort (1967) of the paper by the Russian logician [[Moses Schönfinkel]] founding combinatory logic. When Quine began working on PFL in earnest, in 1959, combinatory logic was commonly deemed a failure for the following reasons:
* Until [[Dana Scott]] began writing on the [[model theory]] of combinatory logic in the late 1960s, almost only [[Haskell Curry]], his students, and [[Robert Feys]] in Belgium worked on that logic;
*Satisfactory axiomatic formulations of combinatory logic were slow in coming. In the 1930s, some formulations of combinatory logic were found to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]]. Curry also discovered the [[Curry paradox]], peculiar to combinatory logic;
*The [[lambda calculus]], with the same expressive power as [[combinatory logic]], was seen as a superior formalism.

==Kuhn's formalization==
The PFL [[syntax]], primitives, and axioms described in this section are largely Kuhn's (1983). The [[semantics]] of the functors are Quine's (1982). The rest of this entry incorporates some terminology from Bacon (1985).

===Syntax===
An ''atomic term'' is an upper case Latin letter, ''I'' and ''S'' excepted, followed by a numerical [[superscript]] called its ''degree'', or by concatenated lower case variables, collectively known as an ''argument list''. The degree of a term conveys the same information as the number of variables following a predicate letter. An atomic term of degree 0 denotes a [[Boolean variable]] or a [[truth value]]. The degree of ''I'' is invariably 2 and so is not indicated.

The "combinatory" (the word is Quine's) predicate functors, all monadic and peculiar to PFL, are '''Inv''', '''inv''', '''∃''', '''+''', and '''p'''. A term is either an atomic term, or constructed by the following recursive rule. If τ is a term, then '''Inv'''τ, '''inv'''τ, '''∃'''τ, '''+'''τ, and '''p'''τ are terms. A functor with a superscript ''n'', ''n'' a [[natural number]] &gt; 1, denotes ''n'' consecutive applications (iterations) of that functor.

A formula is either a term or defined by the recursive rule: if α and β are formulas, then αβ and ~(α) are likewise formulas. Hence "~" is another monadic functor, and concatenation is the sole dyadic predicate functor. Quine called these functors "alethic." The natural interpretation of "~" is [[negation]]; that of concatenation is any [[Logical connective|connective]] that, when combined with negation, forms a [[functional completeness|functionally complete]] set of connectives. Quine's preferred functionally complete set was [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[negation]]. Thus concatenated terms are taken as conjoined. The notation '''+''' is Bacon's (1985); all other notation is Quine's (1976; 1982). The alethic part of PFL is identical to the ''Boolean term schemata'' of Quine (1982).

As is well known, the two alethic functors could be replaced by a single dyadic functor with the following [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]: if α and β are formulas, then (αβ) is a formula whose semantics are "not (&amp;alpha; and/or &amp;beta;)" (see [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] and [[Logical NOR|NOR]]).

===Axioms and semantics===
Quine set out neither axiomatization nor proof procedure for PFL. The following axiomatization of PFL, one of two proposed in Kuhn (1983), is concise and easy to describe, but makes extensive use of [[free variable]]s and so does not do full justice to the spirit of PFL. Kuhn gives another axiomatization dispensing with free variables, but that is harder to describe and that makes extensive use of defined functors. Kuhn proved both of his PFL axiomatizations [[consistency proof|sound]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].

This section is built around the primitive predicate functors and a few defined ones. The alethic functors can be axiomatized by any set of axioms for [[sentential logic]] whose primitives are negation and one of ∧ or ∨. Equivalently, all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic can be taken as axioms.

Quine's (1982) semantics for each predicate functor are stated below in terms of [[abstraction]] (set builder notation), followed by either the relevant axiom from Kuhn (1983), or a definition from Quine (1976). The notation &lt;math&gt;\{x_1...x_n : Fx_1...x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of [[n-tuple]]s satisfying the atomic formula &lt;math&gt;Fx_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

*''Identity'', ''I'', is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; IFx_1x_2...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_1x_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2x_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
Identity is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (''Ixx''), [[symmetric]] (''Ixy''→''Iyx''), [[transitive relation|transitive]] ( (''Ixy''∧''Iyz'') → ''Ixz''), and obeys the substitution property:
:&lt;math&gt;(Fx_1...x_n \land Ix_1y) \rightarrow Fyx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Padding'', '''+''', adds a variable to the left of any argument list.
:&lt;math&gt;\ +F^n =_{def} \{x_0x_1...x_n : F^n x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;+Fx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Cropping'', '''∃''', erases the leftmost variable in any argument list.
:&lt;math&gt; \exist F^n =_{def} \{x_2...x_n : \exist x_1 F^n x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fx_1...x_n \rightarrow \exist Fx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

''Cropping'' enables two useful defined functors:
* ''Reflection'', '''S''':
:&lt;math&gt;\ SF^n =_{def} \{x_2...x_n : F^n x_2x_2...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;SF^n \leftrightarrow \exist IF^n.&lt;/math&gt;
'''S''' generalizes the notion of reflexivity to all terms of any finite degree greater than 2. N.B: '''S''' should not be confused with the [[combinatory logic|primitive combinator]] '''S''' of combinatory logic.
*''[[Cartesian product]]'', &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;F^m \times G^n \leftrightarrow F^m \exist^m G^n.&lt;/math&gt; 
Here only, Quine adopted an infix notation, because this infix notation for Cartesian product is very well established in mathematics. Cartesian product allows restating conjunction as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;F^mx_1...x_mG^nx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow (F^m \times G^n)x_1...x_mx_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
Reorder the concatenated argument list so as to shift a pair of duplicate variables to the far left, then invoke '''S''' to eliminate the duplication. Repeating this as many times as required results in an argument list of length max(''m'',''n'').

The next three functors enable reordering argument lists at will.  
*''Major inversion'', '''Inv''', rotates the variables in an argument list to the right, so that the last variable becomes the first.
:&lt;math&gt;\ InvF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^nx_nx_1...x_{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Inv Fx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_nx_1...x_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Minor inversion'', '''inv''', swaps the first two variables in an argument list.
:&lt;math&gt;\ invF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^n x_2x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; invFx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2x_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Permutation'', '''p''', rotates the second through last variables in an argument list to the left, so that the second variable becomes the last.
:&lt;math&gt;\ pF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^n x_1x_3...x_nx_2\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; pFx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Inv  inv Fx_1x_3...x_nx_2.&lt;/math&gt;
Given an argument list consisting of ''n'' variables, '''p''' implicitly treats the last ''n''-1 variables like a bicycle chain, with each variable constituting a link in the chain. One application of '''p''' advances the chain by one link. ''k'' consecutive applications of '''p''' to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; moves the ''k''+1 variable to the second argument position in ''F''.

When ''n''=2, '''Inv''' and '''inv''' merely interchange ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''n''=1, they have no effect. Hence '''p''' has no effect when ''n''&lt;3.

Kuhn (1983) takes ''Major inversion'' and ''Minor inversion'' as primitive. The notation '''p''' in Kuhn corresponds to '''inv'''; he has no analog to ''Permutation'' and hence has no axioms for it. If, following Quine (1976), '''p''' is taken as primitive, '''Inv''' and '''inv''' can be defined as nontrivial combinations of '''+''', '''∃''', and iterated '''p'''.

The following table summarizes how the functors affect the degrees of their arguments.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|c}
\textbf{Expression} &amp;
\textbf{Degree} \\
\hline
p;\ Inv;\ inv;\ \lnot;\ I &amp;
\text{no change}
\\
+F^{n-1};\ \exist F^{n+1}; \ SF^{n+1} &amp;
n
\\
\alpha^m\beta^n;\ F^m \times G^n &amp;
\ \max(m,n)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules===
All instances of a predicate letter may be replaced by another predicate letter of the same degree, without affecting validity. The [[first-order logic|rules]] are:
* [[Modus ponens]];
* Let α and β be PFL formulas in which &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; does not appear. Then if &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \land Fx_1...x_n) \rightarrow \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a PFL theorem, then &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \land \exist Fx_2...x_n) \rightarrow \beta &lt;/math&gt; is likewise a PFL theorem.

===Some useful results===
Instead of axiomatizing PFL, Quine (1976) proposed the following conjectures as candidate axioms.

*&lt;math&gt;\exist I&lt;/math&gt;
''n''-1 consecutive iterations of '''p''' restores the ''status quo ante'':
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \leftrightarrow p^{n-1}F^n&lt;/math&gt;
'''+''' and '''∃''' annihilate each other:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \rightarrow +\exist F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \leftrightarrow \exist +F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
Negation distributes over '''+''', '''∃''', and '''p''':
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;+\lnot F^n \leftrightarrow \lnot +F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;\lnot\exist F^n \rightarrow \exist \lnot F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;p\lnot F^n \leftrightarrow \lnot pF^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
'''+''' and '''p''' distributes over conjunction:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;+(F^nG^m) \leftrightarrow (+F^n+G^m)&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;p(F^nG^m) \leftrightarrow (pF^npG^m)&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
Identity has the interesting implication:
*&lt;math&gt;IF^n \rightarrow p^{n-2} \exist p+F^n&lt;/math&gt;

Quine also conjectured the rule: If &lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a PFL theorem, then so are &lt;math&gt;\ p\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ +\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exist \lnot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bacon's work==
Bacon (1985) takes the [[Material conditional|conditional]], [[negation]], ''Identity'', ''Padding'', and ''Major'' and ''Minor inversion'' as primitive, and ''Cropping'' as defined. Employing terminology and notation differing somewhat from the above, Bacon (1985) sets out two formulations of PFL:
* A [[natural deduction]] formulation in the style of [[Frederick Fitch]]. Bacon proves this formulation [[consistency proof|sound]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] in full detail.
*An axiomatic formulation which Bacon asserts, but does not prove, equivalent to the preceding one. Some of these axioms are simply Quine conjectures restated in Bacon's notation.

Bacon also:
*Discusses the relation of PFL to the [[term logic]] of Sommers (1982), and argues that recasting PFL using a syntax proposed in Lockwood's appendix to Sommers, should make PFL easier to "read, use, and teach";
*Touches on the [[group theory|group theoretic]] structure of '''Inv''' and '''inv''';
*Mentions that [[sentential logic]], [[monadic predicate logic]], the [[modal logic]] [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]], and the Boolean logic of (un)permuted [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, are all fragments of PFL.

==From first-order logic to PFL==
The following [[algorithm]] is adapted from Quine (1976: 300-2). Given a [[sentence (mathematical logic)|closed formula]] of [[first-order logic]], first do the following:
* Attach a numerical subscript to every predicate letter, stating its degree;
* Translate all [[universal quantifier]]s into [[existential quantifier]]s and negation;
* Restate all [[atomic formula]]s of the form ''x''=''y'' as ''Ixy''.

Now apply the following algorithm to the preceding result:

'''1.''' Translate the matrices of the most deeply nested quantifiers into [[disjunctive normal form]], consisting of [[logical OR|disjuncts]] of [[logical AND|conjuncts]] of terms, negating atomic terms as required. The resulting subformula contains only negation, conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantification.

'''2.''' Distribute the existential quantifiers over the disjuncts in the matrix using the [[rules of passage (logic)|rule of passage]] (Quine 1982: 119):
:&lt;math&gt;\exist x[\alpha (x) \lor \gamma (x)] \leftrightarrow (\exist x \alpha (x) \lor \exist x \gamma (x)).&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.''' Replace conjunction by [[Cartesian product]], by invoking the fact:
:&lt;math&gt;(F^m \land G^n) \leftrightarrow (F^m \times G^n) \leftrightarrow (F^m \exist^m G^n); m&lt;n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''4.''' Concatenate the argument lists of all atomic terms, and move the concatenated list to the far right of the subformula.

'''5.''' Use '''Inv''' and '''inv''' to move all instances of the quantified variable (call it ''y'') to the left of the argument list.

'''6.''' Invoke '''S''' as many times as required to eliminate all but the last instance of ''y''. Eliminate ''y'' by prefixing the subformula with one instance of '''∃'''.

'''7.''' Repeat (1)-(6) until all quantified variables have been eliminated. Eliminate any disjunctions falling within the scope of a quantifier by invoking the equivalence:
:&lt;math&gt; (\alpha \lor \beta \lor ...) \leftrightarrow \lnot(\lnot\alpha \land \lnot\beta \land ...).&lt;/math&gt;

The reverse translation, from PFL to first-order logic, is discussed in Quine (1976: 302-4).

The canonical [[foundation of mathematics]] is [[axiomatic set theory]], with a background logic consisting of [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], with a [[universe of discourse]] consisting entirely of sets. There is a single [[first-order logic|predicate letter]] of degree 2, interpreted as set membership. The PFL translation of the canonical [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] is not difficult, as no [[ZFC]] axiom requires more than 6 quantified variables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html#staxioms Metamath axioms.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bayesian statistics}}

The '''principle of maximum entropy''' states that the [[probability distribution]] which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a [[proposition]] that expresses [[#Testable information|testable information]]).

Another way of stating this:  Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function. Consider the set of all trial probability distributions that would encode the prior data. According to this principle, the distribution with maximal [[information entropy]] is the best choice.

==History==
The principle was first expounded by [[E. T. Jaynes]] in two papers in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.108.171  |mr=96414
|bibcode = 1957PhRv..108..171J }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasized a natural correspondence between [[statistical mechanics]] and [[information theory]]. In particular, Jaynes offered a new and very general rationale why the Gibbsian method of statistical mechanics works. He argued that the [[entropy]] of statistical mechanics and the [[information entropy]] of [[information theory]] are basically the same thing. Consequently, [[statistical mechanics]] should be seen just as a particular application of a general tool of logical [[inference]] and information theory.

==Overview==
In most practical cases, the stated prior data or testable information is given by a set of [[conserved quantities]] (average values of some moment functions), associated with the [[probability distribution]] in question. This is the way the maximum entropy principle is most often used in [[statistical thermodynamics]]. Another possibility is to prescribe some [[symmetries]] of the probability distribution. The equivalence between [[conserved quantities]] and corresponding [[symmetry groups]] implies a similar equivalence for these two ways of specifying the testable information in the maximum entropy method.

The maximum entropy principle is also needed to guarantee the uniqueness and consistency of probability assignments obtained by different methods, [[statistical mechanics]] and [[logical inference]] in particular.

The maximum entropy principle makes explicit our freedom in using different forms of [[prior information|prior data]]. As a special case, a uniform [[prior probability]] density (Laplace's [[principle of indifference]], sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason), may be adopted. Thus, the maximum entropy principle is not merely an alternative way to view the usual methods of inference of classical statistics, but represents a significant conceptual generalization of those methods.

However these statements do not imply that thermodynamical systems need not be shown to be [[ergodic]] to justify treatment as a [[statistical ensemble]].

In ordinary language, the principle of maximum entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most ignorance beyond the stated prior data.

==Testable information==
The principle of maximum entropy is useful explicitly only when applied to ''testable information''. Testable information is a statement about a probability distribution whose truth or falsity is well-defined. For example, the statements

:the [[expected value|expectation]] of the variable ''x'' is 2.87
and
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.6

(where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are probabilities of events) are statements of testable information.

Given testable information, the maximum entropy procedure consists of seeking the [[probability distribution]] which maximizes [[information entropy]], subject to the constraints of the information. This constrained optimization problem is typically solved using the method of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

Entropy maximization with no testable information respects the universal "constraint" that the sum of the probabilities is one. Under this constraint, the maximum entropy discrete probability distribution is the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\frac{1}{n}\ {\rm for\ all}\ i\in\{\,1,\dots,n\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The principle of maximum entropy is commonly applied in two ways to inferential problems:

===Prior probabilities===
The principle of maximum entropy is often used to obtain [[prior probability|prior probability distributions]] for [[Bayesian inference]]. Jaynes was a strong advocate of this approach, claiming the maximum entropy distribution represented the least informative distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Posterior probabilities===
Maximum entropy is a sufficient updating rule for [[radical probabilism]]. [[Richard Jeffrey]]'s [[probability kinematics]] is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=[[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms, B]] | year=1987 | title=Updating, supposing and MAXENT | journal=Theory and Decision | volume=22 | pages=225–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximum entropy models===
Alternatively, the principle is often invoked for model specification: in this case the observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Such models are widely used in [[natural language processing]]. An example of such a model is [[logistic regression]], which corresponds to the maximum entropy classifier for independent observations.

===Probability density estimation ===
One of the main applications of the maximum entropy principle is in discrete and continuous density estimation.

Similar to [[support vector machine]] estimators, 
the maximum entropy principle may require the solution to a [[quadratic programming]] and thus provide 
a sparse mixture model as the optimal density estimator. One important advantage of the method is able to incorporate prior information in the density estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==General solution for the maximum entropy distribution with linear constraints==
{{main article|maximum entropy probability distribution}}

===Discrete case===
We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' taking values in {''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}. We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; that is, we require our probability distribution to satisfy the moment inequality/equality constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i)f_k(x_i) \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the probabilities must sum to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution with maximum information entropy subject to these equality constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(x_i) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m)} \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes called the [[Gibbs distribution]]. The normalization constant is determined by:

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m) = \sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and is conventionally called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]].  (The [[Pitman&amp;ndash;Koopman theorem]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a sampling distribution to admit [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistics]] of bounded dimension is that it have the general form of a maximum entropy distribution.)

The λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; parameters are Lagrange multipliers. In the case of equality constraints their values are determined from the solution of the nonlinear equations

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of inequality constraints, the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program with linear constraints.&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt; 
In both cases, there is no [[closed form solution]], and the computation of the Lagrange multipliers  usually requires  [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].

===Continuous case===
For [[continuous distribution]]s, the Shannon entropy cannot be used, as it is only defined for discrete probability spaces.  Instead [[E. T. Jaynes|Edwin Jaynes]] (1963, 1968, 2003) gave the following formula, which is closely related to the [[relative entropy]] (see also [[differential entropy]]).

:&lt;math&gt;H_c=-\int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''(''x''), which Jaynes called the "invariant measure", is proportional to the [[limiting density of discrete points]]. For now, we shall assume that ''m'' is known; we will discuss it further after the solution equations are given.

A closely related quantity, the relative entropy, is usually defined as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] of ''m'' from ''p'' (although it is sometimes, confusingly, defined as the negative of this).  The inference principle of minimizing this, due to Kullback, is known as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence#Principle of minimum discrimination information|Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information]].

We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' which takes values in some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the [[real numbers]] (all integrals below are over this interval). We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e. we require our probability density function to satisfy the inequality (or purely equality) moment constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)f_k(x)\,dx \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \dotsc,m.&lt;/math&gt;

And of course, the probability density must integrate to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)\,dx = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability density function with maximum ''H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' subject to these constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m)} m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] determined by

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m) = \int m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the discrete case, in the case where all moment constraints are equalities, the values of the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; parameters are determined by the system of nonlinear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case with  inequality moment  constraints the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program.&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

The invariant measure function ''m''(''x'') can be best understood by supposing that ''x'' is known to take values only in the [[bounded interval]] (''a'', ''b''), and that no other information is given. Then the maximum entropy probability density function is

:&lt;math&gt; p(x) = A \cdot m(x), \qquad a &lt; x &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a normalization constant. The invariant measure function is actually the prior density function encoding 'lack of relevant information'.  It cannot be determined by the principle of maximum entropy, and must be determined by some other logical method, such as the [[principle of transformation groups]] or [[Marginalization (probability)|marginalization theory]].

===Examples===
For several examples of maximum entropy distributions, see the article on [[maximum entropy probability distribution]]s.

==Justifications for the principle of maximum entropy==
Proponents of the principle of maximum entropy justify its use in assigning probabilities in several ways, including the following two arguments. These arguments take the use of [[Bayesian probability]] as given, and are thus subject to the same postulates.

===Information entropy as a measure of 'uninformativeness'===
Consider a '''discrete probability distribution''' among ''m'' mutually exclusive [[proposition]]s. The most informative distribution would occur when one of the propositions was known to be true. In that case, the information entropy would be equal to zero. The least informative distribution would occur when there is no reason to favor any one of the propositions over the others. In that case, the only reasonable probability distribution would be uniform, and then the information entropy would be equal to its maximum possible value, log&amp;nbsp;''m''. The information entropy can therefore be seen as a numerical measure which describes how uninformative a particular probability distribution is, ranging from zero (completely informative) to log&amp;nbsp;''m'' (completely uninformative).

By choosing to use the distribution with the maximum entropy allowed by our information, the argument goes, we are choosing the most uninformative distribution possible. To choose a distribution with lower entropy would be to assume information we do not possess. Thus the maximum entropy distribution is the only reasonable distribution.

===The Wallis derivation===
The following argument is the result of a suggestion made by [[Graham Wallis]] to E. T. Jaynes in 1962.&lt;ref name=Jaynes2003/&gt; It is essentially the same mathematical argument used for the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] in [[statistical mechanics]], although the conceptual emphasis is quite different. It has the advantage of being strictly combinatorial in nature, making no reference to information entropy as a measure of 'uncertainty', 'uninformativeness', or any other imprecisely defined concept. The information entropy function is not assumed ''a priori'', but rather is found in the course of the argument; and the argument leads naturally to the procedure of maximizing the information entropy, rather than treating it in some other way.

Suppose an individual wishes to make a probability assignment among ''m''  [[mutually exclusive]] propositions. She has some testable information, but is not sure how to go about including this information in her probability assessment. She therefore conceives of the following random experiment. She will distribute ''N'' quanta of probability (each worth 1/''N'') at random among the ''m'' possibilities. (One might imagine that she will throw ''N'' balls into ''m'' buckets while blindfolded. In order to be as fair as possible, each throw is to be independent of any other, and every bucket is to be the same size.) Once the experiment is done, she will check if the probability assignment thus obtained is consistent with her information. (For this step to be successful, the information must be a constraint given by an open set in the space of probability measures). If it is inconsistent, she will reject it and try again. If it is consistent, her assessment will be

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{n_i}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition, while ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of quanta that were assigned to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition (i.e. the number of balls that ended up in bucket ''i'').

Now, in order to reduce the 'graininess' of the probability assignment, it will be necessary to use quite a large number of quanta of probability. Rather than actually carry out, and possibly have to repeat, the rather long random experiment, the protagonist decides to simply calculate and use the most probable result. The probability of any particular result is the [[multinomial distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(\mathbf{p}) = W \cdot m^{-N}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!}&lt;/math&gt;

is sometimes known as the multiplicity of the outcome.

The most probable result is the one which maximizes the multiplicity ''W''. Rather than maximizing ''W'' directly, the protagonist could equivalently maximize any monotonic increasing function of ''W''. She decides to maximize

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac 1 N \log W 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{(Np_1)! \, (Np_2)! \, \dotsb \, (Np_m)!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( \log N! - \sum_{i=1}^m \log ((Np_i)!) \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, in order to simplify the expression, the protagonist takes the limit as &lt;math&gt;N\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. as the probability levels go from grainy  discrete values to smooth continuous values. Using [[Stirling's approximation]], she finds

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{N \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{N}\log W\right) 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( N\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m Np_i\log (Np_i) \right)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log (Np_i)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \log N \sum_{i=1}^m p_i - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \right)\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i \\[6pt]
&amp;= H(\mathbf{p}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains for the protagonist to do is to maximize entropy under the constraints of her testable information. She has found that the maximum entropy distribution is the most probable of all "fair" random distributions, in the limit as the probability levels go from discrete to continuous.

===Compatibility with Bayes' theorem===
Giffin and Caticha (2007) state that [[Bayes' theorem]] and the principle of maximum entropy are completely compatible and can be seen as special cases of the "method of maximum relative entropy". They state that this method reproduces every aspect of orthodox Bayesian inference methods. In addition this new method opens the door to tackling problems that could not be addressed by either the maximal entropy principle or orthodox Bayesian methods individually. Moreover, recent contributions (Lazar 2003, and Schennach 2005) show that frequentist relative-entropy-based inference approaches (such as [[empirical likelihood]] and [[exponentially tilted empirical likelihood]] – see e.g. Owen 2001 and Kitamura 2006) can be combined with prior information to perform Bayesian posterior analysis.

Jaynes stated Bayes' theorem was a way to calculate a probability, while maximum entropy was a way to assign a prior probability distribution.&lt;ref name=Jaynes1988/&gt;

It is however, possible in concept to solve for a posterior distribution directly from a stated prior distribution using the [[Cross entropy|principle of minimum cross entropy]] (or the Principle of Maximum Entropy being a special case of using a [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] as the given prior), independently of any Bayesian considerations by treating the problem formally as a constrained optimisation problem, the Entropy functional being the objective function.  For the case of given average values as testable information (averaged over the sought after probability distribution), the sought after distribution is formally the [[Gibbs measure|Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution]] the parameters of which must be solved for in order to achieve minimum cross entropy and satisfy the given testable information.

==Relevance to physics==

The principle of maximum entropy bears a relation to a key assumption of [[kinetic theory of gases]] known as [[molecular chaos]] or ''Stosszahlansatz''. This asserts that the distribution function characterizing particles entering a collision can be factorized. Though this statement can be understood as a strictly physical hypothesis, it can also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis regarding the most probable configuration of particles before colliding &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chliamovitch | first1 = G. | last2 = Malaspinas | first2 = O. | last3 = Chopard | first3 = B. | doi = 10.3390/e19080381 | title = Kinetic theory beyond the Stosszahlansatz | journal = Entropy | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | year = 2017| bibcode = 2017Entrp..19..381C | page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20098">The '''involvement of the public in patent examination''' is used in some forms to help identifying relevant [[prior art]] and, more generally, to help assessing whether [[patent application]]s and [[invention]]s meet the requirements of [[patent|patent law]], such as [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]], and [[sufficiency of disclosure]].

==Rationale==
The rationale for [[public participation]] in patent-application reviews is that knowledgeable persons in fields that are relevant to a particular patent application will provide useful information to [[patent examiner]]s if the proper forum is provided.  One model for such a forum is a [[wiki]] model where the public may submit the prior art and commentary that are relevant to a given patent application, and patent examiners can consult that forum. The intended effect is that patent examination will be more efficient and thorough so that the patents that are issued will be of a higher quality than is currently possible.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, Manny, [http://dotank.nyls.edu/communitypatent/BNA_10-20-06.html ''Open Collaboration Is Medicine for Our Ailing Patent System''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219161705/http://dotank.nyls.edu/communitypatent/BNA_10-20-06.html |date=2007-02-19 }}, BNA's Patent, Trademark &amp; Copyright Journal, Vol. 72, No. 1789, pp. 682-685, Oct. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, patent examination in France for novelty and utility was performed by the private [[French Academy]] under commission from the French government.  The Academy sought the input of outside experts in the specific fields of the inventions.  [[Galileo]], for example, was consulted when a patent was applied for regarding a new method of determining longitude according to the position of the moon. Galileo’s conclusion is that the method would work in principle, but the measuring techniques are not accurate enough to provide meaningful results; therefore, the patent was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-10152009.html |title=Nowotarski, Bakos, "A Short History of Private Patent Examination", Insurance IP Bulletin Oct. 2009 |publisher=Marketsandpatents.com |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal constraints==

===United States===
In the United States, the third parties may not provide commentary or opinions directly to a patent examiner during the prosecution of a patent unless the patent applicant gives the examiner written permission to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1100_1134.htm#sect1134 |title=35 USC 122 plus MPEP commentary |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2003-04-22 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 99, which previously allowed a member of the public to submit prior art to an examiner within two months of an application publication, has been repealed by the AIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/consolidated_rules.pdf |title=Consolidated Patent Rules |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate =2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules 290 (37 CFR 1.290) and 35 USC 122(e) control the submission of prior-art references by third parties after the publication of an application and before the issuance of the patent. The cited prior-art references must be dated at least six months from the date of the publication, the first rejection of any claim, or the notice of allowance.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==History==

===Observations by third parties===
The [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) provides that any person may present [[Observations by third parties under the European Patent Convention|observations concerning the patentability of an invention described in a European patent application]].&lt;ref name="ART115"&gt;{{EPC Article|115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of public participation to patent examination. Filing such observations by third parties at the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] (EPO) is free of charge, but the observations must include a statement of grounds.&lt;ref name="ART115"/&gt; The statement of grounds must be in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="GUIDEV3"&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|v|3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The person filing the observations does not become party to the proceedings.&lt;ref name="ART115"/&gt;

In the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO), third parties may submit prior art relevant to a published patent application within two months of said publication or before a notice of allowance is given, whichever comes first.  In contrast to European practice, however, third parties are not allowed to provide any additional explanation of the relevance of the prior art.

=== Wiki review ===
The review of [[patent]] and [[patent application]]s through [[wiki]] projects was proposed in 2005 by patent attorney J. Matthew Buchanan on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://promotetheprogress.com/blog/patent-reform-and-third-party-submission-of-art-a-proposed-solution/358/ |title=Patent Reform and Third Party Submission of Art: A proposed solution |publisher=Promotetheprogress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141252/http://promotetheprogress.com/blog/patent-reform-and-third-party-submission-of-art-a-proposed-solution/358/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent proposal was made in ''Fortune'' magazine in 2006.&lt;ref name="FORTUNE"&gt;Nicholas Varchaver, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/08/21/8383639/index.htm ''Patent review goes Wiki''], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', VOL. 154, NO. 4 - August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The claimed purpose is the improvement of the quality of the patent examination, as well as any re-examinations, through the involvement of the public, to help identify any relevant [[prior art]]. The USPTO has endorsed some of these projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

According to [[Dave Kappos]], former vice president for [[intellectual property|intellectual-property]] law at [[IBM]], and later head of the USPTO, "it's a very powerful concept because it leverages the enormous capabilities of the entire world of technical talent."&lt;ref name="FORTUNE"/&gt;

Wikipedia itself has been used by the U.S. [[patent examiner]]s as a reference to get a "quick outline of an unfamiliar topic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2007/01/17/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701004710/http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2007/01/17/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-01 |title=Just-n-Examiner blog, January 17, 2007 |publisher=Just-n-examiner.livejournal.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citations of Wikipedia as prior art, however, are not allowed in the U.S. due to the fluid and open nature of its editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2006/10/01/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715204129/http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2006/10/01/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title="Just a Patent Examiner" blog, October 1, 2006 |publisher=Just-n-examiner.livejournal.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the related area of [[trademark]] examination, entries from Wikipedia have been cited in [[precedent|precedential opinions]] by the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] of the USPTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2aissues/2006/78146926.pdf |title=In re Grand Forest Holdings Incorporated S/N 78220033, 20 October 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206144631/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2aissues/2006/78146926.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blackboard patent====
Wikipedia has also been used to collect early references related to controversial patents.  [[History of virtual learning environments]], for example, is an article that was created primarily to list prior art that would potentially invalidate {{US patent|6988138}}, “Internet-based education support system and methods”.  This patent issued to [[Blackboard Inc.]] in June 2000.  The [[Moodle]] wiki has a similar page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/en/Online_Learning_History#1999 |title=Online Learning History, Moodledocs wikipage |publisher=Docs.moodle.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052431/http://docs.moodle.org/en/Online_Learning_History |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the patent was issued, Blackboard Inc. sued its competitor [[Desire2Learn]] to stop them from [[patent infringement|infringing the patent]].  In July 2009, the [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] held that all of the claims of the Blackboard patent were invalid either for being too vague or for being already  in practice before Blackboard filed their application.  Blackboard, however, has four [[continuation]] applications pending where it can correct the deficiencies in its claims and get new patents to issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/07/blackboard-v-desire2learn-fed-cir-2009-blackboards-patent-covers-an-internet-based-educational-support-system-and-metho.html |title=Patently O announcement of CAFC Blackboard decision |publisher=Patentlyo.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the lawsuit was moving forward, the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] filed for a [[reexamination]] citing that new prior art had been discovered that raised a substantial new question of validity.  The USPTO agreed and the patent is currently undergoing reexamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/20070125a.html |title="Patent Office Orders Re-Examination of Blackboard Patent", Software Freedom Law Center, January 25, 2007 |publisher=Softwarefreedom.org |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USPTO community patent review (Peer to Patent)==
On June 15, 2007, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] began a two-year pilot community patent review called [[Peer to patent]] or Community Patent Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-10152007.html |title=Schecter, Manny, Murray, Susan, "Peer to Patent:Community Patent Review", Insurance IP Bulletin, Oct. 15, 2007 |publisher=Marketsandpatents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program organizers anticipate having 250 pending [[software patent]] applications reviewed by members of the interested public.  They can submit prior art along with commentary and vote on the most relevant prior art.  Four months after a patent application is posted the most relevant prior art is provided to the [[patent examiner]].

In the first five months of the program, over 20 applications have been opened to the public and 8 have completed reviews.  Over 28,000 site visits have been recorded.  1,600 reviewers from more than 100 different countries have registered.  Over one hundred thirty potential prior art references have been submitted. [[General Electric]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], and [[Oracle Corporation]] each have volunteered some of their pending patent applications for review.

Patent examiners will have access to the commentary and will consider it in their examination.  Applications that are part of the pilot program will get accelerated examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schrock |first=Andrew |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=19419 |title=Shrock, Andrew, "Opening up the Patent Process", MIT Technology Review, Sep 24, 2007 |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the first 19 office actions received by Peer-to-Patent applications, 5 cited the prior art submitted by reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairns.typepad.com/peertopatent/2008/04/public-successf.html |title=Public Successfully Participates In U.S. Patent Examination Process, New York Law School Press Release |publisher=Cairns.typepad.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5466">{{for|the quotient of an [[abelian category]] by a [[Serre subcategory]]|Quotient of an abelian category}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''quotient category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] obtained from another one by identifying sets of [[morphism]]s. Formally, it is a [[quotient object]] in the [[category of small categories|category of (small) categories]], analogous to a [[quotient group]] or [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]], but in the categorical setting.

==Definition==

Let ''C'' be a category. A ''[[congruence relation]]'' ''R'' on ''C'' is given by: for each pair of objects ''X'', ''Y'' in ''C'', an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; on Hom(''X'',''Y''), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. That is, if
:&lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2 : X \to Y\,&lt;/math&gt;
are related in Hom(''X'', ''Y'') and
:&lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2 : Y \to Z\,&lt;/math&gt;
are related in Hom(''Y'', ''Z''), then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in Hom(''X'', ''Z'').

Given a congruence relation ''R'' on ''C'' we can define the '''quotient category''' ''C''/''R'' as the category whose objects are those of ''C'' and whose morphisms are [[equivalence class]]es of morphisms in ''C''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}/R}(X,Y) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/R_{X,Y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Composition of morphisms in ''C''/''R'' is [[well-defined]] since ''R'' is a congruence relation.

==Properties==

There is a natural quotient [[functor]] from ''C'' to ''C''/''R'' which sends each morphism to its equivalence class. This functor is bijective on objects and surjective on Hom-sets (i.e. it is a [[full functor]]).

Every functor ''F'' : ''C'' &amp;#x2192; ''D'' determines a congruence on ''C'' by saying ''f'' ~ ''g'' [[iff]] ''F''(''f'') = ''F''(''g''). The functor ''F'' then factors through the quotient functor ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''/~ in a unique manner. This may be regarded as the &amp;#x201C;[[first isomorphism theorem]]&amp;#x201D; for functors.

==Examples==

* [[Monoid]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s may be regarded as categories with one object. In this case the quotient category coincides with the notion of a [[quotient monoid]] or a [[quotient group]].
* The [[homotopy category of topological spaces]] '''hTop''' is a quotient category of '''Top''', the [[category of topological spaces]]. The equivalence classes of morphisms are [[homotopy class]]es of continuous maps.
*Let ''k'' be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] and consider the [[abelian category]] Mod(''k'') of all [[Vector space|vector spaces]] over ''k'' with ''k''-linear maps as morphisms. To "kill" all finite-dimensional spaces, we can call two linear maps ''f'',''g'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y'' congruent iff their difference has finite-dimensional image. In the resulting quotient category, all finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic to 0. [This is actually an example of a quotient of additive categories, see below.]

== Related concepts ==
===Quotients of additive categories modulo ideals===
If ''C'' is an [[additive category]] and we require the congruence relation ~ on ''C'' to be additive (i.e. if ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'' with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the quotient category ''C''/~ will also be additive, and the quotient functor ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''/~ will be an additive functor. 

The concept of an additive congruence relation is equivalent to the concept of a ''two-sided ideal of morphisms'': for any two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' we are given an additive subgroup ''I''(''X'',''Y'') of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''Y'') such that for all ''f'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''X'',''Y''), ''g'' &amp;isin; Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'', ''Z'') and ''h''&amp;isin; Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'', ''X''), we have ''gf'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''X'',''Z'') and ''fh'' &amp;isin; ''I''(''W'',''Y''). Two morphisms in Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''Y'') are congruent iff their difference is in ''I''(''X'',''Y'').

Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] may be viewed as an additive category with a single object, and the quotient of additive categories defined above coincides in this case with the notion of a [[quotient ring]] modulo a two-sided ideal.

===Localization of a category===
The [[localization of a category]] introduces new morphisms to turn several of the original category's morphisms into isomorphisms. This tends to increase the number of morphisms between objects, rather than decrease it as in the case of quotient categories. But in both constructions it often happens that two objects become isomorphic that weren't isomorphic in the original category. 

===Serre quotients of abelian categories===
The [[Quotient of an abelian category|Serre quotient]] of an [[abelian category]] by a [[Serre subcategory]] is a new abelian category which is similar to a quotient category but also in many cases has the character of a localization of the category.

      <comment>/* What is shape analysis? */ tweak heading</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">This article describes '''shape analysis''' to analyze and process geometric [[shape]]s. 
The shape analysis described here is related to the [[statistical shape analysis|statistical analysis of geometric shapes]], to shape matching and shape recognition. It applies purely to the geometry of an object, not to the [[structural analysis]] that deals with predicted behaviour of mechanical parts.

==Description==
''Shape analysis'' is the (mostly){{Clarification needed|reason=|date=May 2017}} automatic analysis of geometric shapes, for example using a computer to detect similarly shaped objects in a database or parts that fit together. For a computer to automatically analyze and process geometric shapes, the objects have to be represented in a digital form. Most commonly a [[boundary representation]] is used to describe the object with its boundary (usually the outer shell, see also [[3D model]]). However, other volume based representations (e.g. [[constructive solid geometry]]) or point based representations ([[point cloud]]s) can be used to represent shape.

Once the objects are given, either by modeling ([[computer-aided design]]), by scanning ([[3D scanner]]) or by extracting shape from 2D or 3D images, they have to be simplified before a comparison can be achieved. The simplified representation is often called a ''shape descriptor'' (or fingerprint, signature). These simplified representations try to carry most of the important information, while being easier to handle, to store and to compare than the shapes directly.
A ''complete shape descriptor'' is a representation that can be used to completely reconstruct the original object (for example the [[medial axis]] transform).

==Application fields==
Shape analysis is used in many application fields:
*[[archeology]] for example, to find similar objects or missing parts
*[[architecture]] for example, to identify objects that spatially fit into a specific space
*[[medical imaging]] to understand shape changes related to illness or aid [[surgical planning]]
*[[Virtual reality|virtual environments]] or on the [[3D models|3D model market]] to identify objects for copyright purposes
*security applications such as face recognition
*entertainment industry (movies, games) to construct and process geometric models or animations
*[[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] to process and to compare designs of mechanical parts or design objects.

==Shape descriptors==
Shape descriptors can be classified by their invariance with respect to the transformations allowed in the associated shape definition. Many descriptors are invariant with respect to ''congruency'', meaning that congruent shapes (shapes that could be translated, rotated and mirrored) will have the same descriptor (for example [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] or [[spherical harmonic]] based descriptors or [[Procrustes analysis]] operating on point clouds).

Another class of shape descriptors (called ''intrinsic'' shape descriptors) is invariant with respect to [[isometry]]. These descriptors do not change with different isometric embeddings of the shape. Their advantage is that they can be applied nicely to deformable objects (e.g. a person in different body postures) as these deformations do not involve much stretching but are in fact near-isometric. Such descriptors are commonly based on geodesic distances measures along the surface of an object or on other isometry invariant characteristics such as the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplace-Beltrami]] [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] (see also [[spectral shape analysis]]).

There are other shape descriptors, such as ''graph-based'' descriptors like the [[medial axis]] or the [[Reeb graph]] that capture geometric and/or topological information and simplify the shape representation but can not be as easily compared as descriptors that represent shape as a vector of numbers.

From this discussion it becomes clear, that different shape descriptors target different aspects of shape and can be used for a specific application. Therefore, depending on the application, it is necessary to analyze how well a descriptor captures the features of interest.

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

In [[criminology]], '''social control theory''' proposes that exploiting the process of [[socialization]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]] builds [[self-control]] and reduces the inclination to indulge in behavior recognized as antisocial. It derives from [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] theories of crime and was developed by Ivan Nye (1958), who proposed that there were four types of control:
* Direct: by which [[punishment]] is threatened or applied for wrongful behavior, and compliance is rewarded by parents, family, and [[authority]] figures.
* Internal: by which a youth refrains from delinquency through the conscience or [[superego]].
* Indirect: by [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with those who influence behavior, say because his or her delinquent act might cause pain and disappointment to parents and others with whom he or she has close relationships.
* Control through needs satisfaction, i.e. if all an individual's needs are met, there is no point in criminal activity.

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Social control theory proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs encourage them not to break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and have a stake in their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply stating that human beings may choose to engage in a wide range of activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] view of human nature as represented in [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit [[social contract]]s, agreements and arrangements among people. Thus, [[morality]] is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/command/detail?sid=2e47adb5-a167-49da-9d88-1fae2da5d377%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=16&amp;hid=101|title = Role-Taking And Recidivism: A Test Of Differential Social Control Theory|date = 2011|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = JQ: Justice Quarterly 28.5|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Ngo|first = Fawn T|pages = 667–697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
===Edward A. Ross===
The earliest form of the theory (or at least the earliest recorded) was proposed by [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward A. Ross]] in 1901, who defined social control as "the more that the smooth running of social machinery implies the frequent breaking off or turning aside of individual activities, the more perfect is the social order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/socialcontrolas00rossgoog|title=Social control; a survey of the foundations of order |date=1901|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the more perfect that the social order is, the more social control is achieved.  His best-known work, Social Control (1901), deals with the reasons for and the means of societal limitation of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Social-Control-by-Ross |title=Social Control - Work by Ross |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert J. Reiss===
Another early form of the theory was proposed by Reiss (1951: 196) who defined delinquency as, "...behavior consequent to the failure of personal and social controls."  Personal control was defined as, "...the ability of the individual to refrain from meeting needs in ways which conflict with the norms and rules of the community" while social control was, "...the ability of social groups or institutions to make norms or rules effective." Reiss' version did not specify the sources of such "abilities" nor the specific control mechanisms leading to conformity, but he did assert that the failure of primary groups such as the family to provide reinforcement for non-delinquent roles and values was crucial to the explanation of delinquency.
Reiss also wrote extensively on the application of his work to [[criminology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T7rH13P3NKMC&amp;pg=PA785&amp;lpg=PA785&amp;dq=Reiss+criminology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1w9eEy6NVI&amp;sig=iFsZtmL6xYGy8fVAYq9kCc7IYDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMIr6uL98S_xwIVR30aCh3E1A7s#v=onepage&amp;q=Reiss%20criminology&amp;f=false Albert J Reiss] in ''Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory vol I'' (2010) FT Cullen, P Wilcox&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Toby===
Jackson Toby (1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toby|first1=Jackson|title=Social Disorganization and Stake in Conformity: Complementary Factors in the Predatory Behavior of Hoodlums|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|date=1957|volume=48|issue=1|pages=12–17|doi=10.2307/1140161|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4566&amp;context=jclc|ref=Stake in Conformity}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that "the uncommitted adolescent is a candidate for gang socialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karachi|first1=Larry|last2=Toby|first2=Jackson|title=The Uncommitted Adolescent: Candidate for Gang Socialization|journal=Sociological Inquiry|date=April 1962|volume=32|issue=2|pages=203–215|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1962.tb00541.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging "gang socialization" as part of the causal, motivational dynamic leading to delinquency, but introduced the concept of ''stakes in conformity'' to explain "candidacy" for such learning experiences. He believed that all could be tempted into delinquency, but most refused because they considered that they had too much to lose. The young who had few stakes or investments in conformity were more likely to be drawn into gang activity. The notion of ''stakes in conformity'' fits very well with concepts invoked in later versions of social control theory.

===F. Ivan Nye===
Ivan Nye (1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nye|first1=Francis Ivan|title=Family relationships and delinquent behavior|date=1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780837169675|edition=2. repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only elaborated a social control theory of delinquency, but specified ways to "operationalize" (measure) control mechanisms and related them to self-reports of delinquent behavior. He formulated the theory after interviewing 780 young people in Washington State. The sample was criticized because it did not represent any urban environments, and those selected might have been more apt to describe their families unfavorably. Some were concerned that criminal activity was only mentioned in two of the questions, so the extrapolations to crime in general were considered unsafe. Like Reiss, he focused on the family as a source of control. Moreover, Nye specified three different types of control:
*direct control = punishments and rewards
*indirect control = affectionate identification with non-criminals; and
*internal control = conscience or sense of guilt.
Youth may be directly controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting the opportunity for delinquency, as well as through parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of criminogenic motivation at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2e47adb5-a167-49da-9d88-1fae2da5d377%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=101|title = Family Theory 20 Years Later|date = 1980|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Contemporary Sociology 9.2|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Heiss|first = Jerold|pages = 201–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, "...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control" (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, "...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control..."

===Walter Reckless===
[[Walter Reckless]] (1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reckless|first1=Walter C.|title=A New Theory of Deliquency and Crime|journal=Federal Probation|date=December 1961|volume=25|issue=4|pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed [[containment]] theory by focusing on a youth's self-conception or self-image of being a good person as an insulator against peer pressure to engage in delinquency.
*inner containment = positive sense of self;
*outer containment = supervision and discipline.
This inner containment through self-images is developed within the family and is essentially formed by about the age of twelve. Outer containment was a reflection of strong social relationships with teachers and other sources of conventional socialization within the neighborhood. The basic proposition is there are "pushes" and "pulls" that will produce delinquent behavior unless they are counteracted by containment. The motivations to deviate as pushes are:
*discontent with living conditions and family conflicts;
*aggressiveness and hostility, perhaps due to biological factors; and
*frustration and boredom, say arising from membership of a minority group or through lack of opportunities to advance in school or find employment;
and the pulls are:
*delinquent peers, and
*delinquent subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=34502fec-0fcb-460a-a2e2-b72973264d7f%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=101|title = The Impact Of Self Esteem, Family Rituals, Religiosity, And Participation In Conforming Activities Upon Delinquency: A Comparison Of Young Adults In Turkey And The United States|date = 2011|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=42 |issue=1|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Roberts|first = Joanne|last2 = Gunes|first2 = Ismail Dincer|pages = 49–76|last3 = Seward|first3 = Rudy Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Matza===
An analysis of 'neutralization' was developed by Sykes and Matza (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Gresham M.|last2=Matza|first2=David|title=Techniques of Neutralization: A Theory of Delinquency|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=664–670|doi=10.2307/2089195|jstor=2089195}}&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that there was little difference between delinquents and non-delinquents, with delinquents engaging in non-delinquent behavior most of the time. They also asserted that most delinquents eventually opt out of the delinquent lifestyle as they grow older, suggesting that there is a basic code of morality in place but that the young are able to deviate by using techniques of neutralization, i.e. they can temporarily suspend the applicability of norms by developing attitudes "favorable to deviant behavior". The five common techniques were:
*denial of responsibility (I couldn't help myself)
*denial of injury (nobody got hurt)
*denial of victim (they had it coming)
*condemnation of the condemners (what right do they have to criticize me?)
*appeal to higher loyalties (I did it for someone else).
Later Matza (1964) developed his theory of "drift" which proposed that people used neutralization to drift in and out of conventional behaviour, taking a temporary break from moral restraints. Matza based his "drift" theory upon four observations which were:
*Delinquents express guilt over their criminal acts
*Delinquents often respect law-abiding individuals
*A line is drawn between those they can victimize and those they can not
*Delinquents are not immune to the demands of conforming&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://resolver.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/openurl?sid=EBSCO%3aa9h&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00380385&amp;ISBN=&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=3&amp;date=19700901&amp;spage=403&amp;pages=403-404&amp;title=Sociology&amp;atitle=Becoming+Deviant+(Book).&amp;aulast=Box%2c+Steven&amp;id=DOI%3a&amp;site=ftf-live|title = Becoming Deviant (Book)|date = 1970|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Sociology 4.3|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Box|first = Steven|pages = 403–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this theory of drift has not been widely supported by empirical tests, it remains a key idea in criminology despite not answering why some conform and others don't.

===Travis Hirschi===
[[Travis Hirschi]] adopted Toby's concept of an investment in conventionality or "stake in conformity". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued that a person was less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.

==== The general theory of crime ====
{{Main|Self-control theory of crime}}
Hirschi has since moved away from his bonding theory, and in co-operation with [[Michael R. Gottfredson]], developed a general theory or "self-control theory" in 1990. Akers (1991) argued that a major weakness of this new theory was that Gottfredson and Hirschi did not define self-control and the tendency toward criminal behavior separately. By not deliberately operationalizing self-control traits and criminal behavior or criminal acts individually, it suggests that the concepts of low self-control and propensity for criminal behavior are the same. Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993) rebutted Akers argument by suggesting it was actually an indication of the consistency of general theory. That is, the theory is internally consistent by conceptualizing crime and deriving from that a concept of the offender's traits. The research community remains divided on whether the general theory is sustainable but there is emerging confirmation of some of its predictions (e.g. LaGrange &amp; Silverman: 1999)

===Jack P. Gibbs===
[[Jack Gibbs|Gibbs]] (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbs|first1=Jack P.|title=Control : sociology's central notion|date=1989|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0252015908}}&lt;/ref&gt; has redefined social control and applied it to develop a control theory of [[homicide]]. Any attempt to get an individual to do or refrain from doing something can be considered an attempt at control. To qualify as 'social' control, such attempts must involve three parties. One or more individuals intends to manipulate the behavior of another by or through a third party. Gibbs' third party can be an actual person or a reference to "society", "expectations" or "norms". For example, if one party attempts to influence another by threatening to refer the matter to a third party assumed to have authority, this is referential social control. If one party attempts to control another by punishing a third (e.g. general deterrence), it is a form of vicarious social control. The presence of the third party distinguishes social control from mere external behavioral control, simple interpersonal responses, or issuing orders for someone to do something. This definition clearly distinguishes social control from mere "reactions to deviance" and from deviant behavior itself.

Gibbs argues that "Homicide can be described either as control or as resulting from control failure" (1989: 35), and proposes that the homicide rate is a function not just of the sheer volume of disputes, but also of the frequency of recourse to a third party for peaceful dispute settlement (p37). When one person fails to control the actions of another through the third party, murder represents another violent attempt at direct control. People resort to self-help when forms of social control are unavailable or fail. Gibbs is critical of Hirschi's Social Control Theory because it merely assumes that social relationships, personal investments and beliefs that discourage delinquency are social controls (which is one reason why Hirschi's theory is often referred to as a Social Bond Theory).

==Criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Much of the early research on social control theory is based on self-reporting studies. Critics of self-report data note that there may be various motives for disclosing information, and that questions may be interpreted differently by individual participants. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions are intuitively convincing, e.g. that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others, or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face [[imprisonment]]. Davies (1994 and 2004), reports that in late-nineteenth century Britain, crime rates fell dramatically, as did drug and alcohol abuse, and illegitimacy became less common. All of these indexes of deviance were fairly steady between World War I and 1955. After 1955, they all rose to create a U-curve of deviance, over the period from 1847 to 1997. He attributes the initial shift to adoption of a culture in which the assumptions of [[Protestant]] Christianity were taken for granted. Everyone at the time believed—at least somewhat—in a moral code of helping others. This belief was rooted in religion. The same social norms for the defense of the person and property that informed the law before 1955 remain the policy norms. Furthermore, the concept that people are uncontrollable and may offend against those norms in social interactions, cannot be explained by simply counting how many people practice the [[golden rule]] (see the general discussion in Braithwaite: 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braithwaite|first1=John|title=Crime, shame and reintegration|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521356688|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The '''Standard RPG System''' (SRS for short) is a Japanese [[role-playing game system]] developed by [[FarEast Amusement Research]] and used in ''[[Alshard]]'', ''[[Tenra War]]'', ''Kaze no Stigma RPG'', ''[[Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica]] RPG'' and so on. The newest, the 14th game that use SRS are the ''[[Full Metal Panic!]] RPG'' based upon the [[anime]] and [[light novel]]s  of the same title. SRS games are published by several companies such as Game Field, Softbank Creative, JIVE and [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa]](Former [[Enterbrain]] and [[Fujimi Shobo]]).

Standard RPG System is available under an open content license for non-commercial uses.

==Core mechanic==
Standard RPG System uses only 6-sided dice. To determine whether the action is successful or not the player rolls only [[dice notation|2d6]], if the total of the dice rolled by the player and ability/class adjustments is more than or equal to difficulty score the action succeeds. To determine damage the player rolls a number of 6-sided dice. The number of dice that are rolled increases with various class abilities.

Players choose up to three [[character class]]es during [[character creation]] - for example, fighter/fighter/fighter (a 3rd-level fighter), valkyrie/valkyrie/scout (a 2nd-level valkyrie/1st-level scout), or black magician/white mage/wizard (a 1st-level black magician/1st-level white mage/1st-level wizard).

There are 6 [[statistic (role-playing games)|attributes]]: ''Tairyoku'' "Strength", ''Hansha'' "Reflexes", ''Chikaku'' "Perception", ''Richi'' "Reason", ''Ishi'' "Will" and ''Kouun'' "Luck". In [[Tenra War]], ''[[Tianxia|Tenka]]'', representing social ability, is present instead of ''Kouun''. Characters' attributes are decided by the selection of classes almost automatically. Attribute scores also determine the eight combat ability scores.

==Scene system==
{{see also|:ja:シーン制}}

The game session is proceeded under the "Scene system" and divided into 4 phases: opening phase, middle phase, climax phase and ending phase.
In the opening phase, [[player character]]s (PCs) get into the incident with each one having a motivation such as business, adventure, curiosity and romantic feeling for the heroine. PCs do not need to make up a party in this phase. In the middle phase, the PCs get together. And they fight against creatures and research the incident.
In the climax phase, the boss enemy appears as the arch-foe against PCs. The ending phase is the phase for the epilogue.
Each phase is also divided into several scenes. The Game Master(GM) chooses a ''scene player'' as the scene's protagonist. If the GM allows and the player succeed in an Appear roll, other PCs can appear on the scene as well.

==Breakthrough systems==
Each SRS game have a different "Breakthrough system" work much like hero points.

In ''[[Alshard]]'' and ''[[Alshard Gaia]]'', characters possess supreme divine powers according to their classes. For example, fighters possess the power of 'Thor', which adds extra damage to damage rolls, while white mages possess the power of 'Idun', which can raise the dead. Supreme divine powers are named ''Kago'' (加護, lit. divine protection). Each character can use ''Kago'' three times every a session, according to the three classes chosen during character creation.

In ''[[Tenra War]]'', its Breakthrough system is called ''Gou system'' (業システム, lit. [[karma]] system). Player characters earn ''[[Aikido#Etymology_and_basic_philosophy|Aiki]]'' (合気, lit. harmonious spirit) points by good [[roleplaying]] in the sessions. ''Aiki points'' can be transferred into ''Kiai'' (気合, lit. fighting spirit or willpower) points work much like costs for more powerful abilities.

Player characters in ''Kaze no Stigma RPG'' and ''[[Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica]] RPG'' can use ''Kizuna Kouka'' (絆効果, lit. bonds effect) depends on their human relationships.

Trinity x Venus SRS is based upon the [[superhero]] [[manga]] of the same title. Player Characters are the users of supernatural abilities called V.I.P. abilities. Trinity x Venus SRS's breakthrough system is named ''Advanced V.I.P. system'', PCs (player characters) can use customizable supernatural abilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9907">In [[economics]] and [[game theory]], a participant is considered to have '''superrationality''' (or '''renormalized rationality''') if they have [[perfect rationality]] (and thus maximize their own utility) but assume that all other players are superrational too and that a superrational individual will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational thinker when facing the same problem. Applying this definition, a superrational player playing against a superrational opponent in a [[prisoner's dilemma]] will cooperate while a rationally self-interested player would defect. 

This [[decision rule]] is not a mainstream model within [[game theory]] and was suggested by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his article, series, and book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|date=June 1983|title=Dilemmas for Superrational Thinkers, Leading Up to a Luring Lottery|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/1985-hofstadter#dilemmas-for-superrational-thinkers-leading-up-to-a-luring-lottery|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=248|number=6}} – reprinted in: {{Cite book|title=[[Metamagical Themas]]|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|publisher=Basic Books|year=1985|isbn=0-465-04566-9|pages=737–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative type of rational [[decision making]] different from the widely accepted [[game-theoretic]] one. Superrationality is a form of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reviews |first=Paul J. |last=Campbell |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=57 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages=51–55 |jstor=2690298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volunteer's Dilemma |first=Andreas |last=Diekmann |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=605–610 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029004003 |jstor=174243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Hofstadter provided this definition: "Superrational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Note that contrary to the [[Homo reciprocans]], the superrational thinker will not always play the equilibrium that maximizes the total social utility, and is thus not a [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

==Prisoner's dilemma==
The idea of superrationality is that two logical thinkers analyzing the same problem will think of the same correct answer. For example, if two people are both good at math and both have been given the same complicated problem to do, both will get the same right answer. In math, knowing that the two answers are going to be the same doesn't change the value of the problem, but in game theory, knowing that the answer will be the same might change the answer itself.

The [[prisoner's dilemma]] is usually framed in terms of jail sentences for criminals, but it can be stated equally well with cash prizes instead. Two players are each given the choice to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). The players choose without knowing what the other is going to do. If both cooperate, each will get $100. If they both defect, they each get $1. If one cooperates and the other defects, then the defecting player gets $200, while the cooperating player gets nothing.

The four outcomes and the payoff to each player are listed below

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Player B cooperates !! Player B defects
|-
! Player A cooperates
| Both get $100|| Player A: $0 &lt;br/&gt;Player B: $200
|-
! Player A defects
| Player A: $200&lt;br/&gt; Player B: $0 || Both get $1
|}

One valid way for the players to reason is as follows:
# Assuming the other player defects, if I cooperate I get nothing and if I defect I get a dollar.
# Assuming the other player cooperates, I get $100 if I cooperate and $200 if I defect.
# So whatever the other player does, my payoff is increased by defecting, if only by one dollar.

The conclusion is that the rational thing to do is to defect. This type of reasoning defines game-theoretic rationality, and two game-theoretic rational players playing this game both defect and receive a dollar each.

Superrationality is an alternative method of reasoning. First, it is assumed that the answer to a symmetric problem will be the same for all the superrational players. Thus the sameness is taken into account ''before'' knowing what the strategy will be. The strategy is found by maximizing the payoff to each player, assuming that they all use the same strategy. Since the superrational player knows that the other superrational player will do the same thing, whatever that might be, there are only two choices for two superrational players. Both will cooperate or both will defect depending on the value of the superrational answer. Thus the two superrational players will both cooperate, since this answer maximizes their payoff. Two superrational players playing this game will each walk away with $100.

Note that a superrational player playing against a game-theoretic rational player will defect, since the strategy only assumes that the superrational players will agree. {{Citation needed span|text=A superrational player playing against a player of uncertain superrationality will sometimes defect and sometimes cooperate, based on the probability of the other player being superrational.|date=September 2013}}

Although standard game theory assumes common knowledge of rationality, it does so in a different way. The game theoretic analysis maximizes payoffs by allowing each player to change strategies independently of the others, even though in the end, it assumes that the answer in a symmetric game will be the same for all. This is the definition of a game theoretic [[Nash equilibrium]], which defines a stable strategy as one where no player can improve the payoffs by unilaterally changing course. The superrational equilibrium in a symmetric game is one where all the players' strategies are forced to be the same before the maximization step. (There is no agreed upon extension of the concept of superrationality to asymmetric games.)

Some argue that superrationality implies a kind of [[magical thinking]] in which each player supposes that their decision to cooperate will cause the other player to cooperate, despite the fact that there is no communication. Hofstadter points out that the concept of "choice" doesn't apply when the player's goal is to figure something out, and that the decision does not cause the other player to cooperate, but rather same logic leads to same answer independent of communication or cause and effect. This debate is over whether it is reasonable for human beings to act in a superrational manner, not over what superrationality means, and is similar to arguments about whether it is reasonable for humans to act in a 'rational' manner, as described by game theory (wherein they can figure out what other players will or have done by asking themselves, what would I do if I was them, and applying [[backwards induction]] and [[iterated elimination of dominated strategies]]).

==Probabilistic strategies==
For simplicity, the foregoing account of superrationality ignored [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]]: the possibility that the best choice could be to flip a coin, or more generally to choose different outcomes with some probability. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], it is superrational to cooperate with probability 1 even when mixed strategies are admitted, because the average payoff when one player cooperates and the other defects is the same as when both cooperate, and so defecting increases the risk of both defecting, which decreases the expected payout. But in some cases, the superrational strategy is mixed.

For example, if the payoffs in are as follows:

:: CC – $100/$100
:: CD – $0/$1,000,000
:: DC – $1,000,000/$0
:: DD – $1/$1

So that defecting has a huge reward, the superrational strategy is defecting with a probability of 499,900/999,899 or a little over 49.995%. As the reward increases to infinity, the probability only approaches 1/2 further, and the losses for adopting the simpler strategy of 1/2 (which are already minimal) approach 0. In a less extreme example, if the payoff for one cooperator and one defector was $400 and $0, respectively, the superrational mixed strategy world be defecting with probability 100/299 or about 1/3.

In similar situations with more players, using a randomising device can be essential. One example discussed by Hofstadter is the [[platonia dilemma]]: an eccentric trillionaire contacts 20 people, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him or her a telegram (assumed to cost nothing) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If they receive more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and communication between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do (if it is known that all 20 are superrational) is to send a telegram with probability p=1/20 — that is, each recipient essentially rolls a [[Icosahedron|20-sided die]] and only sends a telegram if it comes up "1".  This maximizes the probability that exactly one telegram is received.

Notice though that this is not the solution in a conventional game-theoretical analysis. Twenty game-theoretically rational players would each send in telegrams and therefore receive nothing. This is because sending telegrams is the [[dominant strategy]]; if an individual player sends telegrams they have a chance of receiving money, but if they send no telegrams they cannot get anything. (If all telegrams were guaranteed to arrive, they would only send one, and no one would expect to get any money.)

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that may be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The symbols and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]
A '''logical symbol''' is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]], [[type–token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.{{dubious|date=November 2012}} In logic, symbols build literal utility to illustrate ideas.

==Overview==
Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols ''of'' anything. For instance there are [[logical constant]]s which do not refer to any idea, but  rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

A symbol or [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols may comprise a [[well-formed formula]] if it is consistent with the [[formation rule]]s of the language.

In a [[formal system]] a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations.   The set of formal symbols in a [[formal language]] is referred to as an alphabet (hence each symbol may be referred to as a "letter")&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hopcroft]], [[Rajeev Motwani]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]], [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

A formal symbol as used in [[first-order logic]] may be a variable (member from a [[universe of discourse]]), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] (mapping to T/F).

Formal symbols are usually thought of as purely [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] structures, composed into larger structures using a [[formal grammar]], though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]).

==Can words be modeled as formal symbols?==

The move to view units in natural language (e.g. English)  as formal symbols was initiated by [[Noam Chomsky]] (it was this work that resulted in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] in formal languages).  The [[generative grammar]] model looked upon syntax as autonomous from semantics.  Building on these models, the logician [[Richard Montague]] proposed that semantics could also be constructed on top of the formal structure:
:There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates." &lt;ref&gt;Richard Montague, ''Universal Grammar'', '''1970'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}
This is the philosophical premise underlying [[Montague grammar]].

However, this attempt to equate linguistic symbols with formal symbols has been challenged widely, particularly in the tradition of [[cognitive linguistics]], by philosophers like [[Stevan Harnad]], and linguists like [[George Lakoff]] and [[Ronald Langacker]].

[[File:Truthiness.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Stephen Colbert]] uses "truthiness" on the debut episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'']]

'''Truthiness''' is the belief or assertion that a particular statement is true based on the [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to [[evidence]], [[logic]], [[Intelligence|intellectual]] examination, or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/12/opinion/meyer/main2250923.shtml |title=The Truth of Truthiness |first=Dick |last=Meyer |publisher=CBS News |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Truthiness | website=Dictionary.com Unabridged | publisher=Random House | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/truthiness | accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"&gt;{{cite book | title=Truthiness Fever | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRIE3PGf-1YC | author=Hayes-Roth, Rick | publisher=BookLocker.com, Inc. | year=2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wPMCwAAQBA | title=Rethinking Psychology: Good Science, Bad Science, Pseudoscience | author=Hughes, Brian | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2016 | page=35 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of truthiness has emerged as a major subject of discussion surrounding [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]] during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"/&gt;

American television comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] coined the term ''truthiness'' in this meaning&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002586.html |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Language Log: Truthiness or Trustiness?}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the subject of a segment called "[[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report#The Wørd|The Wørd]]" during the pilot episode of his political satire program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of [[appeal to emotion]] and "gut feeling" as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/stephen-colbert-13970 |title=Interview: Stephen Colbert |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |publisher=A.V. Club |date=January 25, 2006 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly applied it to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|nomination]] of [[Harriet Miers]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and the [[Rationale for the Iraq War|decision to invade Iraq]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="word"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness |date=October 17, 2005 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: The Word (Truthiness)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including [[Wikiality|Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=72347 |title=The Colbert Report / Comedy Central recording of The WØRD "Wikiality" |work=[[Comedy Central]] |date=July 31, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053730/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=72347 |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert has sometimes used a [[Dog Latin]] version of the term, "Veritasiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://firedoglake.com/2006/06/05/a-stop-on-the-veritasiness-tour-2006/ |accessdate=September 3, 2010 |date=June 5, 2006 |title=A Stop on the Veritasiness Tour 2006 |work=Firedoglake |first=Christy Hardin |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Colbert's "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" the word "Veritasiness" can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.

''[[wikt:truthiness|Truthiness]]'' was named [[Word of the Year]] for 2005 by the [[American Dialect Society]] and for 2006 by [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name="dialectsoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year by American Dialect Society |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm |title=Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and ''OED'' consultant [[Benjamin Zimmer]]&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/ |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Benjamin Zimmer homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the word ''truthiness''&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ |title=The Truthiness Teller |first=Marc |last=Peyser |journal=Newsweek |issn=0028-9604 |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425101629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; already had a history in literature and appears in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), as a derivation of ''[[:wikt:truthy|truthy]]'', and ''[[The Century Dictionary]]'', both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as "truthfulness, faithfulness".&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt; Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert said, "Truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my [[wikt:keister|keister]]".&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

==Use by Stephen Colbert==
[[Stephen Colbert]], portraying his character [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Dr. Stephen T. Colbert]], chose the word ''truthiness'' just moments before taping the premiere episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – "truth" – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: "We're not talking about truth, we're talking about something that seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/22322/index1.html |title=Stephen Colbert Has America by the Ballots |first=Adam |last=Sternbergh |journal=New York Magazine |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColbertWriters"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvnHf3MQtAk&amp;t=1m |title=Colbert Report Writers – The Truthiness Behind The Lines, Truthiness and Pun Journals |publisher=The Paley Center, YouTube channel |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at [[Merriam-Webster|Webster's]] are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen."&lt;ref name="word" /&gt;

When asked in an [[Breaking character|out-of-]][[Stephen Colbert (character)|character]] interview with ''[[The Onion]]'''s [[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]] for his views on "the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart", Colbert elaborated on the critique he intended to convey with the word:&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

{{quote|Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word ...

It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the President [George W. Bush] because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true?...

Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I ''feel'' it to be true, but that ''I'' feel it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality.}}

During an interview on December 8, 2006, with [[Charlie Rose]],&lt;ref name="Charlie Rose"&gt;Charlie Rose (December 8, 2006), [http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert "A conversation with comedian Stephen Colbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915040747/http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert |date=September 15, 2008 }}. Retrieved on August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert stated:

{{quote|I was thinking of the idea of passion and emotion and certainty over information. And what you feel in your gut, as I said in the first Wørd we did, which was sort of a thesis statement of the whole show – however long it lasts – is that sentence, that one word, that's more important to, I think, the public at large, and not just the people who provide it in prime-time cable, than information.}}

On his April 2, 2009 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert added an addendum to the definition: a word so straight that it drives men wild.

==Coverage by news media==
After Colbert's introduction of truthiness, it quickly became widely used and recognized. Six days after, [[CNN]]'s ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' featured a discussion of ''The Colbert Report'' by host [[Howard Kurtz]], who played a clip of Colbert's definition.&lt;ref&gt;It was also used September 23, 2008 by CNN's American Morning by John Roberts.

Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised.

Within a few months of its introduction by Colbert, truthiness was discussed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Weekly]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[Fox News]], the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', [[CNET]], and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

The February 13, 2006 issue of ''Newsweek'' featured an article on ''The Colbert Report'' titled "The Truthiness Teller", recounting the career of the word ''truthiness'' since its popularization by Colbert.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;

===''The New York Times'' coverage and usage===
In its issue of October 25, 2005, eight days after the premiere episode of the ''Report'', ''The New York Times'' ran its third article on ''The Colbert Report'', "Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/television/25watc.html&lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |title=Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News |first=Allesandra |last=Stanley |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article specifically discussed the segment on "truthiness", although the ''Times'' misreported the word as "trustiness". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the ''Times'' ran a correction. On the next episode of the ''Report'', Colbert took the ''Times'' to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that "trustiness" is "not even a word".&lt;ref&gt;Many dictionaries (e.g. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010192553/http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html |date=October 10, 2006 }}, [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=trustiness Merriam-Webster], New Oxford Dictionary of English, etc.) offer definitions for ''trustiness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' again discussed "truthiness" in its issue of December 25, 2005, this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's [[zeitgeist]], in an article titled "2005: In a Word; Truthiness" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting ''truthiness'', Steinberg said, "the [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html?ei=5090&amp;en=0ad1e6ef6392c7da&amp;ex=1293166800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1137484544-pMx4vqbEIRjCInvXH5mFzg |title=2005: In a Word: Truthiness |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Jacques Steinberg |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=December 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 22, 2006 issue, columnist [[Frank Rich]] used the term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/opinion/truthiness-101-from-frey-to-alito.html |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the [[Samuel Alito]] nomination, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], and [[Jack Murtha]]'s [[Vietnam War]] record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' reported on Rich's use of "truthiness" in his column, saying he "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/-NY-Times-Frank-Rich-Taking-Book-Leave |title='NY Times' Frank Rich Taking Book Leave |author=Strupp, Joe |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' published two letters on the 2006 [[White House]] [[White House Correspondents' Association|Correspondents' Dinner]], where [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|Stephen Colbert was the featured guest]], in its May 3, 2006 edition, under the headline "Truthiness and Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/opinion/l03colbert.html?ex=1149652800&amp;en=be69d253b7aa626d&amp;ei=5070 |title=Truthiness and Power |last1=Howard |first1=Gloria D. |last2=Phillian |first2=William M. |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Rich referenced truthiness again in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008, describing the strategy of [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's presidential campaign]] as being "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness",&lt;ref name="Rich '08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21rich.html |title=Truthiness Stages a Comeback |last=Rich |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because "McCain, [[Sarah Palin]] and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt; Rich also noted, "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on '' '[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'.'' [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Joy Behar]] called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated [[Sarah Palin#Federal funding|fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks]] for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt;

==Widespread recognition==

Usage of "truthiness" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, [[etymology]] professor [[Anatoly Liberman]] began an hour-long program on [[public radio]] by discussing truthiness and predicting that it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/programs/midmorning/listings/mm20060102.shtml |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Where Words Come From}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the ''Macmillan English Dictionary'' featured ''truthiness'' as its Word of the Week a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Word of the Week Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323074132/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=March 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. [[Global Language Monitor]],&lt;ref&gt;
|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com&lt;/ref&gt; which tracks trends in languages, named ''truthiness'' the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, ''[[Wikipedia in culture#Wikiality|wikiality]]'', as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was listed in the annual "[[Banished Word List]]" released by a committee at [[Lake Superior State University]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] in 2007. The list included "truthiness" among other overused terms, such as "awesome" celebrity couple [[portmanteau]]s such as "[[Brangelina]]", and "[[pwn]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php Lake Superior State University 2007 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919133033/http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php |date=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on January 8, 2007 Colbert stated that Lake Superior State University was an "[[attention-seeking]] second-tier state university".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=720 Colbert Report Episode 3001 (1/8/2006) overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 List of Banished Words restored "truthiness" to formal usage, in response to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php Lake Superior State University 2008 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001524/http://lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Dialect Society's Word of the Year===
On January 6, 2006, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2005 [[Word of the Year (American Dialect Society)|Word of the Year]]. The Society described its rationale as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted ''truthiness'' as the word of the year. First heard on ''The Colbert Report'', a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Central television channel, ''truthiness'' refers to the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As Stephen Colbert put it, "I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart."&lt;ref name="dialectsoc" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year===
On December 10, 2006 the [[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year on [[Lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year|Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year]], based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word ''[[Google (verb)|google]]''.&lt;ref name="mw" /&gt; "We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. {{"'}}Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4389349.html |title=Colbert's 'truthiness' pronounced Word of the Year |first=Adam |last=Gorlick |publisher=AP/Houston Chronicle |date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during "The Wørd" segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured "truthiness". To make room for the definition of "truthiness", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word "try" was removed with Colbert stating "Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder." He also sarcastically told viewers to "not" download the new page and "not" glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/182467/december-12-2006/who-s-honoring-me-now----merriam-webster-s-word-of-the-year |title=Who's Honoring Me Now? – Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year |first=Stephen |last=Colbert |publisher=Colbert Nation |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle ===
In the June 14, 2008 edition of ''The New York Times'', the word was featured as 1-across in the [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|crossword puzzle]]. Colbert mentioned this during the last segment on the June 18 episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', and declared himself the "King of the Crossword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=174004&amp;title=daily/colbert-crossword-puzzle |title=Daily/Colbert – Crossword Puzzle |date=June 18, 2008 |work=Comedy Central |format=video |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2008/06/saturday-jun-14-2008-brendan-emmett.html |work=Rex Parker does the NYT crossword puzzle (personal blog) |title=Saturday, Jun . 14, 2008 |first=Rex |last=Parker |date=June 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BBC "portrait of the decade" ===
In December 2009, the [[BBC]] online magazine asked its readers to nominate suggestions of things to be included on a poster which would represent important events in the 2000s (decade), divided into five different categories: "People", "Words", "News", "Objects" and "Culture". Suggestions were sent in and a panel of five independent experts shortened each category to what they saw as the 20 most important. Among the nominations selected in the "Words" category was "Truthiness". As a result, the word "Truthiness" appeared in the poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8406898.stm |title=A portrait of the decade |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
In 2012, a study examining truthiness was carried out by PhD student Eryn Newman of [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. The experiments showed that people are more likely to believe that a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |title=Pictures aid 'truthiness', study reveals |first=Dan |last=Satherley |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212053537/http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |archive-date=February 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1385843-0 |title=Scientists discover the truth behind Colbert's "truthiness" |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitty Genovese case retrospective===

As noted by Jesse Singal in an April 5, 2016 piece "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral" in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] upon the death of [[Murder of Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese]]'s murderer, the entire escalation of a myth surrounding the murder, alleging that 38 people had been silent witnesses allowing a vicious death to proceed in front of them, was attributable to the myth's appeal to "truthiness" (grounded in fear – of insecurity and lack of community spirit) over full investigation into actual truth:

"Today, of course, there is exponentially more news coverage than there was in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'”&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/04/how-the-false-story-of-kitty-genovese-s-murder-went-viral.html?om_rid=AAWrdT&amp;om_mid=_BXBAs3B9MJ$ivU "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Frey controversy===
The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an editorial in its January 16, 2006 issue titled "The Truthiness Hurts", crediting the rise of ''truthiness'' as serendipitously providing an apt description of the [[Oprah Book Club]] controversy over [[James Frey]]'s fictionalized "memoir", ''[[A Million Little Pieces]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125010138/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2006 |title=The Truthiness Hurts |author=Chicago Tribune editorial board |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |issn=1085-6706 |date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 1, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see contemporaneous access at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truthiness&amp;diff=37600469&amp;oldid=37592567 --&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also used to describe the controversy over the factual accuracy of Frey's book by ''[[USA Today]]'' in its January 15, 2006 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-15-truth-debate_x.htm |title=Truth falls to "Pieces" after suspect memoir |first=Marco R. |last=Della Cava |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=January 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several other publications including ''[[The New York Times]],'' and by the television news program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' on its October 23 and January 26 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0B12F7395B0C718EDDA80894DE404482 |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] also discussed ''truthiness'' with [[Frank Rich]] on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column "Truthiness 101" Rich had recently published in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml |date=January 26, 2006 |title=The Oprah Winfrey Show (transcript) |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401154709/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also mentioned Colbert's role in making the word "truthiness".&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html |title=How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness |first=David |last=Carr |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, [[MSNBC]] ran a commentary titled "Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert", making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a "small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness", but also opportunistic and too little too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11044071/ |title=Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness |first=Jon |last=Bonné |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Canadian Parliament===
In 2006, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leadership contender [[Ken Dryden]] used truthiness as an extensive theme in a speech in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The speech dealt critically with the [[28th Canadian Ministry|Harper]] government's [[Universal Child Care Plan]].&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2179089#Int-1515982 |date=May 4, 2006 |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |title=''Hansard''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dryden defined truthiness as "something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true."

The transcript of all debates in the House ([[Hansard]]) is made available in both official languages; the translators into French chose to render "truthiness" as ''fausse vérité'' ("false truth").&lt;ref name="hansard" /&gt;

===Alleged snubbing by the Associated Press, and Colbert's response===
The [[Associated Press]] reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |title=Honestly, "truthiness" is selected the word of 2005 |last=Clark |first=Heather |newspaper=The Seattle Times |agency=Associated Press |date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528050238/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |archivedate=May 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Michael Adams, a professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in lexicology, said "truthiness" means "truthy, not facty". "The national argument right now is, one, 'Who's got the truth?' and, two, 'Who's got the facts?{{'"}} he said. "Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going to make much progress."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On each of the first four episodes of the ''Report'' after the selection of ''truthiness'' as ''Word of the Year,'' Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his "On Notice" board, and Associated Press reporter Heather Clark, the author of the article, to his "Dead to Me" board:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/notice/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: On Notice (A Glaring Omission)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, written by one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me," Colbert said during his show Monday. "I'm not mentioned, despite the fact that truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister."&lt;ref name=Kiser &gt;{{Citation |last=Kiser |first=Emily |date=January 10, 2006 |title=Colbert puts professor 'on notice': Michael Adams, featured in a recent Associated Press article, incurs the wrath of Comedy Central 'pundit' |publisher=''[[Technician (newspaper)|Technician]]'' |url=http://www.technicianonline.com/article_895be1b8-7968-5f83-b414-2957431242ac.html |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Adams admitted the "absolutely hilarious" nature of the show and said he couldn't "think of any greater honor than to be placed on Colbert's 'On Notice' board," and that he "owes Colbert thanks."&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

On the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the "Threat-Down",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/threatdown/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: Threatdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of bears. On the following episode he called Adams and asked for an apology. Though Adams never apologized, Colbert "accepted" his "apology", but failed to take him "off notice".

====Associated Press response to Colbert====
On January 13, the first day after the four-day run of criticism of the AP on the ''Report,'' the AP ran a story about ''The Colbert Report'' being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled "Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |title=Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America |first=Jake |last=Coyle |publisher=CBS News / Associated Press |date=January 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005202936/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |archivedate=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of ''truthiness''; excerpts of the story are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his muse [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] might lead in all seriousness."

{{"'}}It's a sin of omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...'It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what ''Hamlet'' is about,' he said."

"The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s....'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.{{'"}}

"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as ''The New York Times'' wrote, 'a summation of what [Colbert] sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.{{'"}}

"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting leading up to the Iraq War. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On January 14, Clark herself responded in an article titled "Exclusive 'News' – I'm dead to Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |last=Clark |first=Healther |date=January 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Exclusive "News": I'm Dead to Stephen Colbert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161104/http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She furthered the rise of "truthiness" in published English in conceding, "Truthiness be told, I never had seen ''The Colbert Report'' until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time...It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact."

===Arianna Huffington===
On January 31, 2006, [[Arianna Huffington]] used ''truthiness'' in [[The Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/will-americas-new-love-a_b_14809.html |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Will America's New Love Affair With the Truth Extend to Bush's SOTU Speech? |work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huffington later appeared as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of ''The Colbert Report''. She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word ''truthiness''. During the interview, Colbert declared, "I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father." Huffington corrected him, citing Wikipedia, that he had merely "popularized" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: "Fuck them!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/59703/march-01-2006/arianna-huffington |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos (Arianna Huffington)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President George W. Bush===
At the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]], Colbert, the featured guest, described President Bush's thought processes using the definition of truthiness. ''Editor and Publisher'' used "truthiness" to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, in an article published the same day titled "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?" ''E&amp;P'' reported that the "blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" and that many people at the dinner "looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power".&lt;ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 |publisher=Editor and Publisher |title=Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused? |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531012834/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=May 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E&amp;P'' reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published a letter to the editor asserting that "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/TUESDAY-S-LETTERS-Colbert-Offensive-Colbert-Mediocre-Colbert-a-Hero-Colbert-Vicious-Colbert-Brave |title=Tuesday's Letters: Colbert Offensive, Colbert Mediocre, Colbert a Hero, Colbert Vicious, Colbert Brave |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=May 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same weekend, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and others also reported on the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/29/AR2006042900126.html |title=Dept. of Truthiness: The Colbert Rapport |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |title=The truthiness hurts |first=Michael |last=Scherer |journal=Salon |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615011439/http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's "Fake" Newsman |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, in a column titled "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] called Colbert's after-dinner speech a "cultural primary" and christened it the "defining moment" of the United States' [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/opinion/05rich.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |title=Throw the Truthiness Bums Out |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-bubble-trouble"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/11/07/BL2006110700726_5.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |title=Bubble Trouble |first=Dan |last=Froomkin |authorlink=Dan Froomkin |date=November 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Krauthammer===
Conservative commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] brought the term up in a discussion about President Obama on the show ''[[Fox News All-Stars]]'' in June 2010, saying:
{{quote|What we see here is conditional truthiness. When the administration needs to say, oh, we knew how bad it was, it says it, and when it needs to say we had no idea how bad it was, it says it. It depends when it needs it; it'll invent a new truth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cato Institute amicus brief===
In 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] filed an amicus brief to the [[United States Supreme Court]] co-authored by humorist [[P. J. O'Rourke]] in the ''[[Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus]]'' free speech case. The brief included an extended discussion of the role of truthiness in American political discourse:&lt;ref name="urlCato AmicusBrief"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/sba-list-merits-filed-brief.pdf |title=Brief for the Cato Institute and P. J. O'Rourke as Amici Curiae |format= |work= |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In modern times, "truthiness"—a "truth" asserted "from the gut" or because it "feels right," without regard to evidence or logic—is also a key part of political discourse. It is difficult to imagine life without it, and our political discourse is weakened by Orwellian laws that try to prohibit it.

After all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag-burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the UN to take over America? Voters have to decide whether we'd be better off electing Republicans, those hateful, assault-weapon-wielding maniacs who believe that George Washington and Jesus Christ incorporated the nation after a Gettysburg reenactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it isn't administered quickly enough to secular-humanist professors of Chicano studies.}}

==={{anchor|Trumpiness}}''The Late Show with Stephen Colbert''===
Colbert refreshed "truthiness" in an episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' on July 18, 2016, using the neologism "Trumpiness" regarding statements made by [[Donald Trump]] during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/22/colbert_goes_after_trumpiness_his_live_rnc_coverage_revives_the_comedy_of_the_colbert_report/ | title=Colbert goes After Trumpiness: His live RNC coverage revives the comedy of "The Colbert Report" | work=Salon | date=22 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=McClennen, Sophia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, "Trumpiness" does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his "wildest promises" but supported him anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/636881/stephen-colbert-resurrects-colbert-report-word-segment-define-trumpiness | title=Stephen Colbert resurrects his Colbert Report 'The Word' segment to define 'Trumpiness' | work=The Week | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/19/12222520/the-word-colbert-trumpiness-rnc | title=Watch: Stephen Colbert brings back "The Word" to deconstruct the Trump supporter's psyche | work=Vox | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=Golshan, Tara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/stephen-colbert-late-show-rnc-jon-stewart | title=Stephen Colbert Brought Back "Stephen Colbert" (and Jon Stewart) During His R.N.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">In the study of language and [[literary style]], a '''vulgarism''' is an expression or usage considered [[standard language|non-standard]] or characteristic of uneducated speech or writing. In [[colloquial]] or [[Lexical definition|lexical]] English, "vulgarism" or "vulgarity" may be [[synonym]]ous with [[profanity]] or [[obscenity]], but a linguistic or literary vulgarism encompasses a broader category of perceived fault not confined to [[scatology|scatological]] or sexual offensiveness. These faults may include [[Received Pronunciation|errors of pronunciation]], [[orthography|misspellings]], word malformations,&lt;ref name="Tromp"&gt;Johannes Tromp, ''The Assumption of Moses: A Critical Edition with Commentary'', ''Studia in Veteris Testamenti Pseudepigrapha'' (Brill, 1993), pp. 27, 39–40, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[malapropism]]s. "[[wikt:vulgarity|Vulgarity]]" is generally used in the more restricted sense. In regular and mostly informal conversations, the presence of vulgarity, if any, are mostly for intensifying, exclaiming or scolding. In modern times, vulgarism continues to be frequently used by people. A [[research]] paper produced by [[Oxford University]] in 2005 shows that the age group of 10-21 years old speak more vulgarity than the rest of the world's [[population]] combined. The frequent and prevalent usage of vulgarity as a whole has led to a [[paradox]], in which people use vulgarity so often that it becomes less and less offensive to people, according to the [[New York Times]].

==Classicism==
The English word "vulgarism" derives ultimately from [[Latin]] ''vulgus,'' "the common people", often as a [[pejorative]] meaning "the [unwashed] masses, undifferentiated herd, a mob". In [[classical studies]], [[Vulgar Latin]] as the Latin of everyday life is conventionally contrasted to [[Classical Latin]], the [[literary language]] exemplified by the [[Latin literature|"Golden Age"]] [[literary canon|canon]] ([[Cicero]], [[Caesar]], [[Vergil]], [[Ovid]], among others).&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;J. N. Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language'', pp. 300–301, 765, ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Social Variation and the Latin Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was always an untenable mode of [[literary criticism]], unduly problematizing, for instance, the so-called "Silver Age" novelist [[Petronius]], whose complex and sophisticated prose style in the ''[[Satyricon]]'' is full of conversational vulgarisms.&lt;ref name="Laird"&gt;Andrew Laird, ''Powers of Expression, Expressions of Power: Speech Presentation and Latin Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social class==
Vulgarism has been a particular concern of [[British English]] traditionalists.&lt;ref name="Crowley"&gt;Tony Crowley, ''Language in History: Theories and Texts'' (Routledge, 1996), pp. 168&amp;ndash;169.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the English [[lexicographer]] [[Henry Wyld]] defined "vulgarism" as:&lt;blockquote&gt;a peculiarity which intrudes itself into [[Standard English]], and is of such a nature as to be associated with the speech of vulgar or uneducated speakers. The origin of pure ''vulgarisms'' is usually that they are importations, not from a regional but from a class [[dialect]]—in this case from a dialect which is not that of a province, but of a low or uneducated social class. ... [A vulgarism] is usually a variety of Standard English, but a bad variety.&lt;ref name="Wyld"&gt;Henry Wyld, as quoted by Crowley (1996) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The moral and aesthetic values explicit in such a definition depends on [[social class|class hierarchy]] viewed as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; For instance, the "misuse" of [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] ([[H-dropping]], such as pronouncing "have" as {{"'}}ave") has been considered a mark of the lower classes in England at least since the late 18th century,&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Görlach"&gt;Manfred Görlach, ''English in Nineteenth-Century England: An Introduction'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ihalainen"&gt;Ossi Ihalainen, "The Dialects of English since 1776", in ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), vol. 5, pp. 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; as dramatized in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Because linguistic vulgarism betrayed social class, its avoidance became an aspect of [[etiquette]]. In 19th-century England, books such as ''The Vulgarisms and Improprieties of the English Language'' (1833) by W. H. Savage, reflected upper-middle-class anxieties about "correctness and good breeding".&lt;ref name="Görlach" /&gt;

Vulgarisms in a literary work may be used deliberately to further [[characterization]],&lt;ref name="Tromp" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Görlach" /&gt; by use of "[[eye dialect]]" or simply by [[vocabulary]] choice.

'''''What Darwin Got Wrong''''' is a 2010 book by philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] and cognitive scientist [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], in which the authors criticize [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]. It is an extension of an argument first presented as "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings" in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;Fodor J (2007) [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/jerry-fodor/why-pigs-dont-have-wings Why Pigs Don't Have Wings]. ''London Review of Books'' '''29'''(20): 19-22. Letters, '''29'''(21), '''29'''(22), '''29'''(23), '''30'''(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Fodor published an article, entitled "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings", in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' in October 2007.&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt; It stated that "In fact, an appreciable number of perfectly reasonable biologists are coming to think that the theory of [[natural selection]] can no longer be taken for granted."

In support of this proposed disestablishment of [[natural selection]], the article stated two arguments:
* Conceptually, it argued that the theory of natural selection contains an equivocation, as to whether selection acts upon individuals or on traits, and that to juxtapose both "depends on whether [[adaptationism]] is able to provide the required notion of ‘selection for’", and that adaptionism fails to meet this burden. Fodor credits the work of [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] on [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] as being the first to notice this problem. Fodor concludes that:
{{quotation|The crucial test is whether one’s pet theory can distinguish between selection for trait A and selection for trait B when A and B are coextensive: were polar bears selected for being white or for matching their environment? Search me; and search any kind of adaptationism I’ve heard of. Nor am I holding my breath till one comes along.}}
* Fodor suggested that there is also an "''empirical issue''" involving [[phenotype|phenotypic]] "free-riders" (the evolutionary byproducts that Gould and Lewontin developed the 'spandrel' metaphor for).&lt;!-- This last sentence is rather vague, but the article is so elliptical on this point that I am unsure what the exact "empirical issue" is --&gt; Fodor suggests that "serious alternatives to adaptationism have begun to emerge", and offers [[evolutionary development]]al theory ('evo-devo') as one such alternative.

The ''London Review of Books'' published eleven letters (including two from Fodor himself) over the following three months. They included negative responses from [[Simon Blackburn]], [[Tim Lewens]], [[Jerry Coyne]] and [[Philip Kitcher]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] and a mixed response from [[Steven Rose]].&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

Coyne and Kitcher dispute Fodor's "striking claim that evolutionary biologists are abandoning natural selection as the principal, or even an important, cause of evolutionary change" and state that "[t]his is news to us, and, we believe, will be news to most knowledgeable people as well." They go on to criticise his conceptual and empirical issues, and state that "[t]he rival mechanisms Fodor cites are supplements to natural selection, not replacements", and that "Evo-devo is not an alternative to adaptation; rather, it is a way to explain how the genes mechanistically produce adaptations."&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt; Evolutionary developmental biologist [[PZ Myers]] has expressed a similar criticism of this characterisation of evolutionary developmental biology.&lt;ref&gt;"As bad as building an argument on the faulty premise of ignorance might be, there's another approach that Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini take that is increasingly common, and personally annoying: the use of a growing synthesis of evolutionary ideas with developmental biology to claim that evolution is dead. This is rather like noting that the replacement of carburettors with electronic fuel injection systems means that internal combustion engines are about to be extinct — evo-devo is a ''refinement'' of certain aspects of biology that has, we think, significant implications for evolution, especially of multicellular organisms. It is not a new engine. People who claim it is understand neither development nor evolution." [http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/fodor_and_piattelli-palmarini.php Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini get everything wrong], [[PZ Myers]], [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]], 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennett states that Fodor's discussion of Gould and Lewontin’s spandrel argument misrepresents that argument, stating "that far from suggesting an alternative to adaptationism, the very concept of a spandrel depends on there being adaptations".&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

Blackburn writes that "His problem is fortunately quite easily solved [...] Two traits may be found together in nature, but one can play a causal role in producing a reproductive advantage, when the other does not." We can thus know that the trait that gives the advantage is the one being selected. Fodor replies that the problem is not merely about our knowledge of what is being selected, but the process of selection itself: "how can the operation of selection distinguish traits that are coextensive in a creature's ecology?" Blackburn writes back that Fodor's question is irrelevant to the process of natural selection as actually formulated by biologists, ''viz.'' organisms with genes that enhance reproductive success are more likely to pass on genes to the next generation, and so the frequency of those genes increases. "Is this incoherent? Nothing Fodor says bears on that question."&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

==Summary==

The book is divided into two parts. Part One is a review of "new facts and new non-selectional mechanisms that have been discovered in biology".&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Part Two is a discussion of "the logical and conceptual bases of the theory of natural selection".&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xx.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset, the authors state their [[atheism]] and commitment to [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic]] explanations,&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and add that they accept [[evolution]] and [[common descent]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but doubt that evolution proceeds by natural selection.

The authors' central argument against the concept of natural selection is what they call "the problem of selection-for".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6: Many are called but few are chosen: the problem of 'selection-for'.&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]]'s concept of [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], the authors note that certain traits of organisms always come together. The authors give examples:

# A heart both ''pumps blood'' and ''makes heart-like noises'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A frog both ''snaps at flies'' and ''snaps at ambient black nuisances'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A polar bear is both ''white'' and ''camouflaged against its environment'' &lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these traits come together, they are both correlated with [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Therefore, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini argue that the theory of natural selection "cannot predict/explain what traits the creatures in a population are selected-for",&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; and so "the claim that selection is the mechanism of evolution cannot be true".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way the authors put the same point is as follows: If the mechanism of natural selection (as it is currently formulated) is correct, then it is a paradigm example of intensional causation. Intensional causation requires either (1) there be a mind involved in the causal process, or (2) the causal mechanism has access to nomological laws. Since there is neither (1) nor (2) at the biological level, the theory of natural selection cannot be correct. 

In a response, published by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' in November 2007, to "Why Pigs Don't Have Wings", [[Tim Lewens]] states that [[Elliott Sober]] gave the following solution to this problem in 1984:&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;
{{quote|“Selection of” pertains to the effects of a selection process, whereas “selection for” describes its causes. To say there is selection for a given property means that having the property causes success in survival and reproduction.}}
Lewens continues:
{{quote|If a property doesn’t cause success in survival and reproduction, but is linked to one that does, then there is no selection for that property. This is precisely why Fodor thinks that although there is selection of curly tails, there is no selection for curly tails.}}

== Reception ==
Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini published a short summary of their book in ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527466.100-survival-of-the-fittest-theory-darwinisms-limits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] wrote that ''What Darwin Got Wrong'' "strikes an outsider as an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The journalist [[Oliver Burkeman]] wrote an article entitled "Why everything you've been told about evolution is wrong" in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/19/evolution-darwin-natural-selection-genes-wrong&lt;/ref&gt; but concludes "It would be jawdroppingly surprising, to say the least, were Fodor to be right. A safer, if mealy-mouthed, conclusion to draw is that his work acts as an important warning to those of us who think we understand natural selection".

The book also received a positive review from [[intelligent design|intelligent-design]] proponent [[William Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/what-darwin-got-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers [[Michael Ruse]],&lt;ref name=RuseBoston&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/02/14/new_critique_intends_to_rebut_darwins_ideas/?page=full Origin of the specious], [[Michael Ruse]], [[Boston Globe]], 14 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseChron&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/What-Darwins-Doubters-Get/64457/ Philosophers Rip Darwin], [[Michael Ruse]], [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]], 7 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Kitcher]] (writing with [[Philosophy of mind|philosopher of mind]] [[Ned Block]])&lt;ref name=BlockKitcher&gt;[http://bostonreview.net/BR35.2/block_kitcher.php Misunderstanding Darwin], [[Ned Block]] and [[Philip Kitcher]], [[Boston Review]], March/April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/81pigliucci.htm ''What Darwin Got Wrong'' by Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini], [[Massimo Pigliucci]], [[Philosophy Now]], October/November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have written reviews critical of the book.

Pigliucci criticises the first part of the book for claiming that 'Darwinism' "put[s] far too much emphasis on external causes of biological change, namely natural selection, and has ignored internal mechanisms", whilst failing to acknowledge that biology has long addressed such internal mechanisms, with Darwin himself "explicitly referring his readers to ‘the laws of correlation of growth’ – that is, to the fact that the internal structure of living organisms imposes limits and direction to evolution". He criticises the second part of the book for raising correlated traits as a new issue when "Biologists have long known about the problem" and have dealt with it:&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt;
{{quotation|This is why hypotheses about natural selection are usually tested by means of functional analyses rooted in physiology, genetics and developmental biology, and why observations of selection in the field are whenever possible coupled with manipulative experiments that make it possible to distinguish between, say, flies and 'dark spots moving in front of your tongue' kinds of objects.}}

Ruse makes the following suggestion for the motivation for the book:
{{quotation|At the beginning of their book, they proudly claim to be atheists. Perhaps so. But my suspicion is that, like those scorned Christians, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini just cannot stomach the idea that humans might just be organisms, no better than the rest of the living world. We have to be special, superior to other denizens of Planet Earth. Christians are open in their beliefs that humans are special and explaining them lies beyond the scope of science. I just wish that our authors were a little more open that this is their view too.&lt;ref name=RuseBoston/&gt;}}

The [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Jerry Coyne]] describes this book as "a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection"&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/worst-science-journalism-of-the-year-darwin-completely-wrong-again/ Worst science journalism of the year: Darwin completely wrong (again)]&lt;/ref&gt; and "as biologically uninformed as it is strident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/improbability-pump The Improbability Pump], [[Jerry Coyne]], [[The Nation]], 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] concluded:
{{quotation|Because they are prominent in their own fields, some readers may suppose that they are authorities on evolution who have written a profound and important book.  They aren't, and it isn't.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas J. Futuyma, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/692.1.citation Two Critics Without a Clue], ''Science'' 7 May 2010:692-69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Adam Rutherford]],  writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', also reviewed the book negatively.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5088">In many countries (such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]]), a '''white-collar worker''' is a person who performs professional, managerial, or administrative work. White-collar work may be performed in an office or other administrative setting. Other types of work are those of a [[blue-collar worker]], whose job requires [[manual labor]] and a [[pink-collar worker]], whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales, or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white and pink (service) industry categorizations.&lt;ref name="M-Z"&gt;{{cite book|title=Work in America: M-Z|pages=597|year=2003|isbn=9781576076767|publisher=ABC-Clio Ltd|location=CA, USA|last=Van Horn|first=Carl|last2=Schaffner|first2=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term refers to the white [[dress shirt]]s of male office workers common through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Western countries, as opposed to the blue overalls worn by many manual laborers.

The term "white collar" is credited to [[Upton Sinclair]], an American writer, in relation to contemporary [[Clerk (position)|clerical]], administrative, and management workers during the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition. Electronically indexed online document. White collar, usage 1, first example.&lt;/ref&gt; though references to white-collar work appear as early as 1935.

==Demographics==
Formerly a minority in the [[agrarian society|agrarian]] and early [[industrial society|industrial]] societies, white-collar workers have become a majority in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] due to modernization and [[outsourcing]] of manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref name="M-Z"/&gt;

The blue-collar and white-collar descriptors as it pertains to work dress may no longer be an accurate descriptor as office attire has broadened beyond a white shirt and tie.  Employees in office environments may wear a variety of colors, may dress [[business casual]] or wear casual clothes altogether. In addition work tasks have blurred.  "White-collar" employees may perform "blue-collar" tasks (or vice versa). An example would be a [[Restaurant management|restaurant manager]] who may wear more formal clothing  yet still assist with cooking food or taking customers' orders or a construction worker who also performs desk work.

==Health effects==
Less physical activity among white-collar workers has been thought to be a key factor in increased life-style related health conditions such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[cancer]], and [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schröer|first1=S|last2=Haupt|first2=J|last3=Pieper|first3=C|title=Evidence-based lifestyle interventions in the workplace--an overview.|journal=[[Occupational Medicine (Oxford University Press journal)|Occupational Medicine]]|date=January 2014|volume=64|issue=1|pages=8–12|pmid=24280187|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/1/8.long|accessdate=18 March 2016|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqt136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace interventions such as alternative activity workstations, sit-stand desks, promotion of stair use are among measures being implemented to counter the harms of sedentary workplace environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Commissaris|first1=DA|last2=Huysmans|first2=MA|last3=Mathiassen|first3=SE|last4=Srinivasan|first4=D|last5=Koppes|first5=LL|last6=Hendriksen|first6=IJ|title=Interventions to reduce sedentary behavior and increase physical activity during productive work: a systematic review.|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health|date=18 December 2015|pmid=26683116|url=http://www.sjweh.fi/show_abstract.php?abstract_id=3544|accessdate=18 March 2016|doi=10.5271/sjweh.3544|volume=42|pages=181–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane [[systematic review]] published in 2018 concluded that "At present there is low-quality evidence that the use of sit-stand desks reduce workplace sitting."
