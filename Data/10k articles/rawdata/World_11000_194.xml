== Letter from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy ==

In a letter dated 18 May 2017, the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] on the right to privacy, Joseph Cannataci wrote a letter to the Japanese Prime-Minister, [[Shinzō Abe]], expressing concerns about the bill. The United Nations Special Rapporteur is an individual, independent expert appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate, monitor, advise upon, and publicize the human rights situation in specific countries. Joseph Cannataci wrote that the bill,

{{Quote
| text        = Would permit the application of laws for crimes which appear to be totally unrelated with the scope of organized crime and terrorism, such as ... theft of forestry products in reserved forests ... exporting without permission and destroying important cultural properties.}}

and that,

{{Quote
| text        = Serious concern is expressed that the proposed bill, in its current form and in combination with other legislation, may affect the exercise of the right to privacy as well as other fundamental public freedoms given its potential broad application.  In particular I am concerned by the risks of arbitrary application of this legislation given the vague definition of what would constitute the ‘planning’ and ‘preparatory actions’ and given the inclusion of an overbroad range of crimes in the Appendix which are apparently unrelated to terrorism and organized crime.
| author      = Joseph Cannataci
| source      = {{cite web
| url         = http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/OL_JPN.pdf
| title       = Mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the right to privacy
| publisher   = United Nations Human Rights Officer of the High Commissioner
| format      = PDF
| access-date = 19 June 2017}}}}

At a press conference on May 22, the Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Yoshihide Suga]]
responded aggressively to the letter, saying, "The letter was released
unilaterally without the Japanese government or the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs having had the opportunity to directly explain the
legislation (to Cannataci). The content was inappropriate, and we
lodged a strong protest" with Cannataci.&lt;ref name="cannataci_response"&gt;{{cite news

| access-date  = 19 June 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannataci responded in a second letter that "The 'strong protest' received from the Japanese government was just angry words
but no substance" "It did not address even one of my many concerns about privacy or other defects.", "There is absolutely no justification for the Japanese government to behave in this way and push through seriously defective legislation in such a rush."&lt;ref name="cannataci_response" /&gt;

'''BBC World News''' is the [[BBC]]'s international news and current affairs television channel. It has the largest audience of any channel, with an estimated 99 million viewers weekly in 2015/16, part of the estimated 265&amp;nbsp;million users of the BBC's four main international news services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/global-audience-measure|title=BBC – BBC's global audience rises to 372m – Media Centre|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched on 11 March 1991 as '''[[BBC World Service Television]]''' outside Europe, its name was changed to '''BBC World''' on 16 January 1995 and to '''BBC World News''' on 21 April 2008. It broadcasts news bulletins, documentaries, lifestyle programmes and interview shows. Unlike the BBC's domestic channels, BBC World News is owned and operated by BBC Global News Ltd., part of the BBC's commercial group of companies, and is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom television licence]]. It is not owned by [[BBC Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=BBC News  – About BBC World News TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|BBC World Service Television}}
The channel originally started as BBC World Service Television and was a commercial operation. The [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] refused to fund to the new television service using grant-in-aid. ([[BBC World Service|BBC World Service radio]] was funded by a [[grant-in-aid]] from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT.

In 1995, BBC World Service Television was split into two services:
* ''BBC World'' started broadcasting on Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] and became a 24-hour English free-to-air international news channel.
* ''[[BBC Prime]]'' started broadcasting on Monday, 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became the BBC's light entertainment channel, later renamed ''[[BBC Entertainment]]''.

BBC World's on-air design was changed significantly on 3 April 2000, bringing it closer to the look of its sister channel in the UK which was then known as BBC News 24, the on-air look of which had been redesigned in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0004/S00001.htm|title=BBC World Unveils A New Look and a New Schedule – Scoop News|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The look of both channels was made up of red and cream and designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], a departure from the general orchestral nature of music used by other news programmes.

On 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 2000. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became ''Putting News First'', replacing ''Demand a Broader View''.

The channel's present name -BBC World News- was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's overall news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated studio vacated by BBC News 24 (now the BBC News Channel). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe.

===Move to Broadcasting House===
BBC World News relocated to [[Broadcasting House]] from its previous home at [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of £1&amp;nbsp;billion. A new newsroom and several state-of-the-art studios were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|title=The news from the BBC: its £1bn new base is finally coming on air|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/07/bbc-1bn-new-base-broadcasting|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Live news output originates from studios B and C in [[Broadcasting House]] with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC [[Millbank]] studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.

Previously, the channel was broadcast in [[aspect ratio (image)|4:3]], with the news output fitted into a [[14:9]] frame for both [[Digital television|digital]] and [[Analog television|analogue]] broadcasting, resulting in [[Letterbox|black bands]] at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to [[16:9]] format, initially in Europe on [[Astra 19.2°E|Astra 1L satellite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRISaJNfTM&amp;fmt=18|title=BBC World News goes widescreen |date=13 January 2009|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009.

===High-definition===
As a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC World News gained high-definition studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. On 5 August 2013, BBC World News was offered as a [[High-definition television|High Definition]] (HD) feed across the [[Middle East]] when it launched its international HD channel on [[Arabsat]]. Arabsat was the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the channel in HD. On 1 April 2015 BBC World News in English started broadcasting in high definition from the 11.229&amp;nbsp;GHz/V transponder on [[Astra 1KR]] at the [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2°E]] orbital position, available [[free-to-air]] to viewers with 60&amp;nbsp;cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2015/bbc-world-news-hd-service-europe ''BBC World News launches HD service in Europe''] BBC Media Centre. 1 April 2015.  Retrieved 29 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldwide===
BBC World News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BBC World News TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC World News is most commonly watched as a [[free-to-air]] (FTA) channel.

In the United States, the channel is available through providers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where and how to watch BBC World News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-14563857|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cablevision]], [[Comcast]], [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]], [[Verizon FiOS]], and [[AT&amp;T U-verse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC World News launches on AT&amp;T U-verse|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/world-news-at-t|publisher=BBC|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, U.S. distribution and advertising sales for the channel are handled by [[AMC Networks]], who are the minority partner for the BBC's entertainment channel [[BBC America]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg-amcbbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=AMC Buys Half of BBC America to Bolster Pay-TV Leverage|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-23/amc-networks-pays-200-million-for-half-of-bbc-america|website=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline-amcbbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=AMC Networks Pays $200M For 49.9% Of BBC America|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/amc-networks-pays-200m-49-9-bbc-america-859244/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, BBC World News syndicates its daytime and evening news programmes to [[public broadcasting|public television]] stations throughout the U.S., originally maintaining a distribution partnership with [[Garden City, New York]]-based [[WLIW]] that lasted from 1998 until October 2008, when the BBC and WLIW mutually decided not to renew the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Long Island PBS Channel To Get Live BBC Newscasts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/business/international-business-long-island-pbs-channel-to-get-live-bbc-newscasts.html|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=30 July 1998|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC World News signs new US distributor|url=http://www.campaignlive.com/article/bbc-world-news-signs-new-us-distributor/806066|author=Paul McNally|website=CampaignUS|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Tailors Its News Broadcast|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/02/entertainment/et-jensen2|author=Elizabeth Jensen|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=2 October 2002|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC World News subsequently entered into an agreement with Community Television of Southern California, Inc., in which [[Los Angeles]] PBS member station [[KCET]] (which was a [[noncommercial educational|public]] [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] from 2011 to 2018) would take over distribution rights to ''BBC World News America'' (the KCET agreement has since been extended to encompass a half-hour simulcast of the 90-minute-long midday news bulletin ''GMT'', which airs in the U.S. as a morning show, and a weekly edition of the BBC newsmagazine ''Newsnight'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=KCET Expands Audience Reach for 'BBC World News' With Station Upgrades and Improved Time Periods; Cleared in Top 30 Markets With Six New Stations Added to Line-Up|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080924006056/en/KCET-Expands-Audience-Reach-BBC-World-News|publisher=[[BBC]]|via=[[BusinessWire]]|date=24 September 2008|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New-Look 'BBC World News' Uses Unrivaled Newsgathering Resources to Bring PBS Audiences News from around the World|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20081001006313/en/New-Look-BBC-World-News-Unrivaled-Newsgathering-Resources|publisher=BBC|via=BusinessWire|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KCET Picks Up 'BBC World News' Distribution From WLIW|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2008/04/kcet-picks-up-bbc-world-news-d/|website=TVWeek|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS separately began distributing another program aired by the channel, ''Beyond 100 Days'', as a tape-delayed late night broadcast on January 2, 2018, as an interim replacement for ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]''.

===Online===
BBC World News began streaming its content on [[YouTube]] on 16 July 2017.  The channel is available in the United States as part of [[Sling TV|Sling's]] World News add-on package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC America and BBC World News now on Sling TV|url=http://blog.sling.com/announcements/bbc-america-and-bbc-world-news-now-on-sling-tv/|website=Sling|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 until it closed in 2016, BBC World News was available on [[LiveStation]].

===United Kingdom===
The channel is not officially available as a stand-alone, full-time channel in the United Kingdom because it carries and is funded by advertising (BBC's domestic channels are funded by a [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licence fee]] which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay), although it can be easily received due to its '[[free-to-air]]' status on many European satellite systems, including [[SES Astra|Astra]] and [[Hot Bird]] and is available in selected London hotels.  BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and café).

However, some BBC World News programmes are available to UK audiences. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of ''[[BBC World News (TV series)|BBC World News]]'' on [[BBC One]] and the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]], followed by an edition of ''[[World Business Report]]''. This programme was previously branded as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''The World Today''''. However, since November 2017 this has been rebranded as ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing''.

While international audiences see advertisements during the break, UK viewers see domestic headlines.  This simulcast is in addition to overnight simulcasts at the top of the hour from 00.00 to 05.00 UK time on both BBC World News and BBC News Channel and are simply branded as ''BBC News'' (except for Newsday which simulcasts at 00.00 UK time weekdays), even if they are produced by BBC World News. The 11:30 UK edition of ''[[BBC World News (TV series)|BBC World News]]'' was shown on [[BBC Two]] Mon-Fri (but not on Wednesdays when Parliament is sitting and there is Prime Minister's Questions), but was discontinued as of December 2015, having been quietly replaced by the next half-hour of national BBC News (now known as ''Newsroom Live''). This had formed '''BBC News at 11''' on BBC Two, which was made up of half an hour of BBC News and then half an hour of BBC World News. Nowadays, this also happens on rare occasions during big news events and the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels. This was done for example for coverage of events such as the Glasgow Helicopter Crash, Election of Pope Francis and Boston Marathon Bombings. Previously ''[[GMT (programme)|GMT]]'' was shown at 12:30 on the channel.

BBC World News also produces a version of ''[[Outside Source]]'' at 21:00 Monday-Thursday ''World News Today'' at 19:00 Monday-Friday and 21:00 Friday-Sunday UK time. The first half-hour of this programme can be seen in the UK on [[BBC Four]] or [[BBC News Channel]] on weekends. The edition of the programme replaced ''The World'', which had been broadcast as a simulcast on the channel between 2002 and 2007.
Both World and the BBC News Channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news programme due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.

===World News bulletins===
[[File:BBC News Room August 2013.JPG|thumb|right|The BBC newsroom at Broadcasting House in London]]
Half-hour ''BBC World News'' bulletins are made available to [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States through Los Angeles' [[KCET]], a non-commercial independent public television station which has been separate from PBS since the beginning of 2011 due to a rights fee dispute. 80 to 90% of Americans are able to receive the bulletins, though broadcast times vary between different localities. The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]].

On PBS stations, ''BBC World News'' is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the [[Met Office]] international [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are [[Broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] on some stations.

BBC America airs a three-hour block of BBC World News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and it is broadcast with advertisements.

''BBC World News'' bulletins also appear on [[Hong Kong]] [[TVB Pearl|TVB English Channel]] instead of an ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' [[simulcast]] from [[NBC News]] via its East Coast Feed at 07:30 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:30 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]), [[CGTN (TV channel)|China 24]] [[simulcast]]ing on [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]] at 20:15 [[Beijing Time|Beijing]]/[[Hong Kong Time]] and [[News at 7:30]] at 19:30 [[Hong Kong Time]]. In [[Singapore]], the [[English language|English]] daily [[evening]]-[[night]]ly [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] mainly [[news bulletin]]s appear on: [[MediaCorp]]'s [[Channel NewsAsia]] instead of [[Singapore Tonight]] at 22:00 [[Singapore Standard Time]].

Many airlines from across the world also play pre-recorded extracts of the BBC World News, have text headlines from it or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems. Airlines showing BBC World News include [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Emirates Airlines]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Royal Brunei Airlines]], [[Myanmar Airways International]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Air New Zealand]], [[Air Canada]] and [[Qantas]].

===Previous bulletins===
Another BBC World News programme, the hour-long ''[[BBC World News America]]'', aired on BBC America at 19:00 [[Eastern Time]]. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that ''BBC World News America'' would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local [[PBS]] stations in the United States as a 30-minute program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news 'BBC World News America' Shifts To BBC World News] Multichannel News, 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:
* [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] service from [[Marina Bay MRT Station|Marina Bay]] to [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi International Airport]]
* [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]] service from [[Airport Express (MTR)|Chek Lap Kok International Airport]]-[[Disneyland Resort Station]] to [[Disneyland Resort Line]]

These broadcasts began with the statement: "Welcome to BBC World News on board the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]]". The short bulletin was updated twice a day, and has since been replaced by a similar programme from [[MediaCorp]]'s [[Channel NewsAsia]].

Travellers on the [[Heathrow Express]] rail service from [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] to [[London Heathrow Airport]] could watch a specially recorded BBC World News bulletin. The short bulletin was updated twice a day, and was shown in both classes on [[Liquid crystal display television|LCD televisions]] throughout the train. However, a similar programme from [[Sky News]] is now shown instead.

==Presentation==
[[File:BBC World News countdown.png|thumb|right|250px|Part of the countdown sequence in 2013, showing Broadcasting House]]
BBC World News is, for the most part, the same channel all over the world; the [[Advertising|commercials]] are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and ''The Record Europe'', which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather focuses more on the area the viewer is watching from.

On most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the [[commercial break]]. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the United States on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.

On 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.

Since its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]], the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air. The countdown can range from 45 seconds to 3 seconds.

==Awards==
BBC World News was named ''Best International News Channel'' at the [[Association for International Broadcasting]] Awards in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/ |title=Key Dates |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2007 for ''White Horse Village''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village 67th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and another in 2009 for ''Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence 69th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The '''Beatrix Canal''' (Dutch: ''Beatrixkanaal'') is an 8.4&amp;nbsp;km long [[canal]] in the southern [[Netherlands]]. It was constructed to provide the city of [[Eindhoven]] with access to the [[Wilhelmina Canal]].

In order to be able to regulate the level of the [[Gender (stream)|Gender]] and [[Dommel]] streams, which regularly threatened to flood Eindhoven's inner city, an additional Discharge Canal (''Afwateringskanaal''), which is not open to navigation, was dug to connect the Beatrix Canal and the Dommel stream. Into this branch, the Gender now discharges.

Upon completion, the canal was named in honour of the newborn eldest daughter of the [[heir apparent|heiress apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch throne]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Princess Beatrix]].

The '''Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy''' (est. 1750) is a [[public library]] in [[Nancy, France]]. It houses approximately 400,000 documents, books, maps, plans and prints. Polish king [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] began the collection in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Library Annual: 1914-1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The library is located in a 1769 building of the historical University of Nancy. At 43, rue Stanislas, it is close to the [[Place Stanislas]] and the [[Gare de Nancy-Ville]].

'''Culture 2000''' was a 7-year [[European Union]] (EU) programme, which had among its key objectives to preserve and enhance Europe's cultural heritage. Its duration was between 2000 and 2006, and it had a budget of €236.5 million. 

Culture 2000 provided grants to cultural cooperation projects in all artistic and cultural fields (performing arts, plastic and visual arts, literature, heritage, cultural history, etc.). 

The objective of Culture 2000 was to promote a common cultural area characterised by its cultural diversity and shared cultural heritage. Its stated aims were to encourage creativity and mobility of artists, public access to culture, the dissemination of art and culture, inter-cultural dialogue and knowledge of the history and cultural heritage of the peoples of Europe.

The program contributed to the financing of [[European Community]] co-operations in all artistic fields: performing arts, visual arts, literature, music, history and cultural heritage, etc. Equipped with €240 million over the period 2000-2006, this program aimed to develop the cultural diversity of the European Union, the creativity and the exchange between European cultural actors, whilst making culture more accessible to a larger public. Financial support was granted to projects which were selected on the basis of an annual Call for Proposals.

The Forum was founded by Zygmunt Berdychowski&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emerging-europe.com/special-reports/economic-forum-2016/krynica-mapping-the-road-to-central-and-eastern-europe-26-years-on/|title=Krynica: Mapping the Road to Central and Eastern Europe — 26 Years On - Emerging-Europe.com|date=2016-09-12|newspaper=Emerging-Europe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 and it is organised by the Foundation Institute for Eastern Studies in [[Warsaw]].
Within 25 years of its history the Krynica Economic Forum has evolved from a small conference, with about 100 participants, to one of the biggest and most recognisable meetings of the political and business leaders of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://innpoland.pl/129177,od-spotkania-w-malej-salce-po-miano-davos-europy-srodkowo-wschodniej-jak-forum-ekonomiczne-w-krynicy-podbil-europe|title=Od spotkania w małej salce, po miano "Davos Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej".

According to the organisers, the mission of the Economic Forum is to create a favorable climate for development of political and economic cooperation in Europe. The opinions of the Forum's speakers are often quoted by the international media and discussed by leading analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrotapodlasia.pl/pl/region_i_gospodarka/wiadomosci/gospodarka/rozpoczyna-sie-xxvi-forum-ekonomiczne-w-krynicy.html|title=Trwa XXVI Forum Ekonomiczne w Krynicy {{!}} Wrota Podlasia|website=www.wrotapodlasia.pl|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fairmont Monte Carlo''' is a luxury resort located in [[Monte Carlo]] managed by the Canadian-based hotel chain [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]].

==History==
Construction of the hotel was completed in the early 1970s. The hotel was built on the spot of the first Monegasque railway station, by the real estate development company [[Caroli Group]].&lt;ref name="groupecaroli"&gt;[http://caroli-realestate.com/fr/presentation Groupe Caroli: Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; As it stands today,{{when|date=January 2018}} there is still a section of the original station wall hidden in one of the hotel's offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-fairmont-monaco.federal-hotel.com/page_en_1.html| title=Hôtel Fairmont Monte Carlo - History |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of building the hotel up the rocks, the property is partially built into the Mediterranean coast. The hotel started under the name of Loews Hotel Monte-Carlo and opened in August 1975. In 1998, [[Toufic Aboukhater]] bought the hotel from Loews Hotels Holding Corporation for an undisclosed price and renamed it the Monte Carlo Grand Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/archive/archive-49516 |title=Hotel Online Special Report - Loews Monte Carlo Hotel Sold |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the hotel was acquired by hotel chain [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]] for 215 million euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forsters.co.uk/index.php?page=60&amp;content=229| title=Unwritten law - The message: Agreements between friends should be recorded in writing to ensure they are enforceable. |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first purchase by a joint venture of Fairmont, Kingdom Hotels International and Bank of Scotland Corporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1030561/000114420404022498/v010272_ex99-1.htm

A renovation project began in 2005 and in 2009 the hotel  began its second round of renovations.

During the annual Formula 1 racing event on [[Circuit de Monaco]], the racers make use of the tunnel under the hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelimages.net/Monaco_Montecarlo.html | title=The most famous part of Monaco, that gave name to the famous Monte Carlo rally |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered{{by who|date=January 2018}} one of the most dangerous parts of the circuit. One of the corners is still{{when|date=January 2018}} named after the previous hotel name, the Grand Hotel.

The '''flag of the Commonwealth of Nations''' is the official flag used by and representing the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Its current design dates to 2013, a modification of a design adopted in 1976.

==Description==
The flag consists of the Commonwealth symbol in gold on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]].  The symbol centres on a [[globe]], representing the global nature of the Commonwealth and the breadth of its membership.

==History==
[[File:Commonwealth flag Ottawa.jpg|thumb|The Commonwealth flag flies at the [[Parliament of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]]]]
The flag developed from car pennants produced for the first time at the 1973 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], held in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].  The initiative for its design is credited to two Canadians: the first [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]], [[Arnold Smith]]; and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].  It was officially adopted on March 26, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/cwn.html |title=Commonwealth of Nations |first=Dean |last=Thomas |accessdate=2008-01-14 |date=2004-03-31 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original design===
[[File:Flag of the Commonwealth of Nations (1976).svg|thumb|Previous flag design as adopted in 1976]]
The original design featured a globe surrounded by 61 radiating, approximately quadrilateral, spears, which form a 'C' for 'Commonwealth'.  The number of spears did not represent the number of member states (there have never been 61 members); instead, the large number represented the many ways in which the Commonwealth cooperates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/37832/symbolandflag/ |title=Symbol and Flag |accessdate=2008-01-14 |date= |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124065315/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/37832/symbolandflag/ |archivedate=2008-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 redesign===
In 2013, the globe was tilted, and the number of spears reduced to 34. The colourings used in the flag were also slightly modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/cwn.html|title=Commonwealth of Nations |publisher=[[Flags of the World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The flag of the Commonwealth of Nations is flown at [[Marlborough House]], [[London]], the headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], throughout the year, and for a limited period at other venues where Commonwealth meetings, events, or visits are taking place (for example, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings). The [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]] does not stipulate that the flag be flown for [[Commonwealth Day]], instead directing that the British [[Union Jack]] (officially called the Royal Union Flag) be flown at federal installations which have a second flagpole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/union_e.cfm |title=The Royal Union flag |accessdate=2008-01-14 |date=2007-09-24 |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Commonwealth Secretary-General [[Don McKinnon]] encourages the flying of the Commonwealth flag on Commonwealth Day, and the Office of the Secretary-General notes that "it is not the case that the Union Jack – or the flag of any other member country for that matter – is a substitute for the Commonwealth flag which represents the association of 53 members and their peoples."&lt;ref&gt;[http://makepeace.ca/commonwealth-flag.pdf Letter from the office of the Commonwealth Secretary-General, January 30, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525153024/http://makepeace.ca/commonwealth-flag.pdf |date=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, the Commonwealth flag is flown at the [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in [[Edinburgh]] on Commonwealth Day, from the fourth flagpole in addition to the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]], the [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish saltire]] and the [[European Union flag]] which all fly daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-01/pa01-010.htm |title=School Pupils Help Parliament Mark Commonwealth Day |accessdate=2008-01-14 |date=2001-03-13 |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703065610/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-01/pa01-010.htm |archivedate=2009-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 the Commonwealth flag has been flown alongside the Union Flag, over the [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland Assembly's]] home at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings Stormont]] every Commonwealth Day. It is also flown on Commonwealth Day in the territory of Gibraltar, from the third flagpole alongside the Union Flag and the Flag of Gibraltar, which fly on the roof of No. 6 Convent Place, the office of the Chief Minister of Gibraltar.

On 28 September 2016, the [[Welsh Conservative]] [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|AM]] in the [[National Assembly for Wales]] [[Mohammad Asghar]] suggested that once the [[United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|leaves the European Union]], the Welsh Assembly should replace the EU Flag alongside the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] and the [[Flag of Wales|Welsh Flag]]. It has been suggested that the Flag of the Commonwealth be the replacement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assembly.wales/en/bus-home/pages/plenaryitem.aspx?category=statements+of+opinion&amp;itemid=789&amp;c=Statements+of+Opinion&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fédération Gabonaise du Scoutisme''', the national federation of several [[Scouting]] organizations of [[Gabon]], was founded under [[French Equatorial Africa]] in 1936, although Scouting appeared years before brought by colonists, and became a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] in 1971. The coeducational Fédération Gabonaise du Scoutisme has 3,809 members as of 2008.&lt;ref name="WOSM-TR_05-08"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triennial Report 2005-2008 |url=http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909204757/http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three Scout Associations that make up the Scout Federation. They are ''Scouts et Guides Catholiques du Gabon'' (Catholic Scouts and Guides of Gabon), ''Eclaireuses-Eclaireurs du Gabon'' (Scouts and Guides of Gabon) and ''Eclaireurs et Eclaireuses Unionistes du Gabon'' (Protestant Scouts and Guides of Gabon).

Scouting in Gabon is involved in public service in cooperation with sports and cultural organizations. Tree planting campaigns have been carried out as well as projects to improve some public areas. 

==Program sections==
* [[Cub Scouts]] - ages 7 to 11
* Scouts - ages 12 to 15
* [[Rover Scouts]] - ages 16 to 20

The [[Scout Motto]] is ''Toujours Prêt'', ''Always Ready'' in [[French language|French]].

==History==
The newspaper appeared first in 1743 as the '''Geoctrojeerde Groninger Courant'''.&lt;ref name=kb/&gt; Later that year it became the '''Opregte Nieuwe Groninger Courant'''.&lt;ref name=kb/&gt; In 1748 it continued as the '''Opregte Groninger Courant'''.&lt;ref name=kb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kb.nl/organisatie/onderzoek-expertise/digitaliseringsprojecten-in-de-kb/project-databank-digitale-dagbladen/geselecteerde-titels-en-selectieprocedure/selectie-van-titels/1618-1800|work=Project Databank Digitale Dagbladen|title=Selectie van titels: 1618-1800|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 1773 the paper became the Groninger Courant and was published as such until its publication was ceased on 1 July 1811.&lt;ref name="europeana"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200359/BibliographicResource_3000100633293.html|title=Groninger courant - 1773-07-16|website=[[Europeana]]|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent publications that included the name "Groninger Courant" were no longer related to the original Groninger Courant.

'''''Izgled''''' was a pop-culture magazine published in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] during the early 1980s. Only five issues were published.

== History ==
The magazine was published by [[Belgrade]]'s [[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]] (Student Cultural Centre).

In addition to editor-in-chief Vlaja Jovanović, the inaugural issue was prepared by [[Nebojša Pajkić]] and [[Slavica Vukadinović]]. For its second issue the magazine received input from painter [[Dragoš Kalajić]]. The third issue came out as a catalog for Vlaja Jovanović's art exhibition. The fourth and fifth issues were prepared by Slavko Timotijević.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.co.rs/blickomentar.php?id=920 Časopis „Izgled“, ''Blic'', November 13, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Andy Warhol]] and his ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, Jovanović gathered creative people from Belgrade such as: designers Marko Pešić, Peđa Gavrović and Srba Travanov, musicians Miško Mihajlovski and [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as various locally (in)famous misfits from the city's night life such as Biljana "Bezideja" Trifunović. The magazine's concept was presenting snapshots of urban life, featuring young men and women of Belgrade who spend their mornings and early afternoons sleeping, their late afternoons engaged in artistic and creative work, and their nights partying. The magazine ran party photo spreads, featuring locally-known individuals, bands, artists etc.

''Izgled'' and its sister magazine ''Vidici'' published photos of the embrionic [[Idoli]] conceptual band called VIS Dečaci and both financed the recording of the first [[Idoli]] single. ''Izgled'' appeared as a record label for the debut single "[[Pomoć, pomoć]]" / "[[Retko te viđam sa devojkama]]" and the single was given as a present with the April, 1980 copy of the ''Vidici'' magazine.

The '''Labor Union of National Taiwan University''' ('''LUNTU'''; {{zh|c=國立臺灣大學工會}}), proposed by full-time research assistants, contract staffs, and school-time workers, was a labor union that organized the workers at the [[National Taiwan University]]. And on December 19, 2012, it convened the inaugural meeting at [[Taipei]] [[Taiwan]]. Then, according to the "Trade Union Law" of Taiwan, on April 1, 2013, the [[Taipei City Government]] approved the establishment of the LUNTU, as an enterprise union to tertiary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"[[National Chengchi University]] Industrial Union", in Taiwan, which was the first university institution to set up trade union, but the composition of the main elements is the basic level workers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceng, Xiang (曾翔),"Facing the impoverishment of the youth: Some ideas for the establishment of labor union at NTU (面對青年貧窮化:對台大工會成立的一些心得)"{{cite web |url=http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-115674 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107031844/http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-115674 |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}, Lihpao Daily (立報), Taipei Taiwan, 2012-2-23 22:21 [2012-11-12] {{zh icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Qing-Huei (胡清暉),"The first university-college institution labor union proposed by the NTU full-time RA, contract staffs, and school-time workers (第一個以大學為事業單位的工會　台大學生發起)"[http://cpaper-blog.blogspot.tw/2012/09/blog-post_6597.html], [[Liberty Times]], Taiepi Taiwan,  2012-01-08 13:22 [2012-11-02] {{zh icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Milarepa''''' ({{bo|t=མི་ལ་རས་པའི་རྣམ་ཐར།།|w=mi-la-ras-pa'i rnam-thar}}) is a 2006 [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan-language]] film about the life of the most famous Tibetan tantric yogi, eponymous Milarepa. The film was shot in the [[Spiti Valley]], high in the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Zanskar]] region close to the border between [[India]] and [[Tibet]] due to the location's resemblance to the Tibetan landscape.

Directed by [[Neten Chokling]], a Lama from Western [[Bhutan]] who has previously worked with [[Khyentse Norbu]] on the films such as ''[[The Cup (1999 film)|The Cup]]'' and ''[[Travellers and Magicians]]'', the film is the first part about the adventurous formative years of the legendary buddhist mystic, [[Milarepa]] (1052-1135) who is one of the most widely known [[Yoga|Tibetan Saint]]s.  The film combined myth, biography, adventure, history and docudrama.

The film featured [[Lhakpa Tsamchoe]] in her return to the silver screen in a supporting role as Aunt Peydon during young Milarepa's formative years.

The tale is a staple in Tibetan Traditions, Buddhism, and the legend of Milarepa elevates him to the status of national hero in [[Tibet]] and nearly so in Buddhist regions of [[India]], [[China]] and [[Pakistan]]. He is one of the so-called [[Yoga|Tibetan Saints]] or [[yogi|great yogi]]'s in Tibetan [[Buddhism]].

The second part of the film, where Milarepa meets his Master Marpa the Translator and his ultimate enlightenment, was stated to be released in 2009 as per the information at the end of the first part of the film.

The '''Movement for Quality Government in [[Israel]]''' ({{lang-he|התנועה למען איכות השלטון בישראל}}, ''HaTnu'a Lema'an Ekhut HaShilton BeYisrael'') is an Israeli [[non-profit organization]] that claims a membership of about 17,000. Formed as a protest movement in March 1990 during the coalition crisis, it is today the leading public petitioner to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]]. 

The organization is influential in Israeli society and has had many favourable court rulings, some which had a decisive impact on [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]]. It has been at the forefront of various scandals and has been given considerable exposure in the Israeli media.

Its nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in [[Kiribati]], {{convert|300|km}} to the east. It further lies northwest of [[Tuvalu]], north of the [[Solomon Islands]], east-northeast of [[Papua New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and south of the [[Marshall Islands]]. With {{UN Population|Nauru}} residents in a {{convert|21|km2|adj=on}} area, Nauru is the smallest state in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], smallest republic and [[list of countries and dependencies by area|third-smallest state by area in the world]], behind only [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]].

Settled by people from [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]] {{circa|1000 BC}}, Nauru was [[annexation|annexed]] and claimed as a colony by the [[German Empire]] in the late 19th century. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Nauru became a [[League of Nations mandate]] administered by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Nauru was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into UN trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.

Nauru is a [[Phosphorite|phosphate-rock]] island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy [[Surface mining|strip mining]] operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, are not economically viable for extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hogan, C Michael |year=2011 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557 |title=Phosphate |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |accessdate=17 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a [[tax haven]] and illegal [[money laundering]] centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/magazine/the-billion-dollar-shack.html?mcubz=1|title=The Billion-Dollar Shack|first=Jack|last=Hitt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] in exchange for hosting the [[Nauru Regional Processing Centre]], an [[Australian immigration detention facilities|offshore Australian immigration detention facility]].

The British sea captain [[John Fearn (whaler)|John Fearn]], a [[Whaling|whale hunter]], became the first Westerner to visit Nauru, in 1798, calling it "Pleasant Island". From around 1830, Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies, particularly fresh water, at Nauru.&lt;ref name="spennemann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spennemann|first=Dirk HR |journal=Aquaculture International |date=January 2002 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=551–562 |doi=10.1023/A:1023900601000 |title=Traditional milkfish aquaculture in Nauru }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, deserters from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic [[palm wine]] and firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=Mac |author2=Marshall, Leslie B |title=Holy and Unholy Spirits: The Effects of Missionization on Alcohol Use in Eastern Micronesia |journal=Journal of Pacific History |date=January 1976|volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=135–166 |doi=10.1080/00223347608572299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firearms were used during the 10-year [[Nauruan Civil War|Nauruan Tribal War]] that began in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New York Law School Journal of International and Comparative Law |title=Nauru v.

After an [[Anglo-German Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean|agreement with Great Britain]], Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's [[Marshall Islands]] Protectorate for administrative purposes.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966.

[[Phosphate]] was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector [[Albert Fuller Ellis]].&lt;ref name=firth/&gt; The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manner |first=HI |author2=Thaman, RR |author3=Hassall, DC |title=Plant succession after phosphate mining on Nauru |journal=[[Australian Geographer]] |date=May 1985 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=185–195 |doi=10.1080/00049188508702872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, following the outbreak of [[World War I]], Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919 it was agreed by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]] that [[George V|His Britannic Majesty]] should be the administering authority under a [[League of Nations mandate]]. The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and for extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental [[British Phosphate Commission]] (BPC).&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966.

Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area leaving it uninhabitable,&lt;ref name="KN-20180916" /&gt; and has also affected the surrounding [[exclusive economic zone]]; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNCCC"&gt;{{cite web |author=Republic of Nauru |year=1999 |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf |title=Climate Change&amp;nbsp;– Response |work=First National Communication |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are limited natural sources of fresh water on Nauru. Rooftop [[Rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater. The islanders are mostly dependent on three [[desalination]] plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency.

=== Climate ===
Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by [[monsoon]] rains between November and February, but usually no cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], with several significant recorded droughts.&lt;ref name="UNCCD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Affaire de certaines terres à phosphates à Nauru |year=2003 |publisher=International Court of Justice |isbn=978-92-1-070936-1 |pages=107–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature on Nauru ranges between {{convert|30|and|35|C}} during the day and is remarkably stable at around {{convert|25|C}} at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |title=Pacific Climate Change Science Program |accessdate=10 June 2012 |publisher=Government of Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175200/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
Fauna is sparse on the island, because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/nauru/countryprofile.html|title=NAURU Information on Government, People, History, Economy, Environment, Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727070348/http://www.un.int/nauru/countryprofile.html|archivedate=27 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 60&amp;nbsp;recorded [[vascular plant]] species native to the island, none of which are [[Endemism|endemic]].

There are no native land [[mammal]]s, but there are native [[insect]]s, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic [[Nauru reed warbler]]. The [[Polynesian rat]], cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Birdlife-Pacific/Important%20Bird%20Area%20Coverage%20by%20Country.htm |accessdate=18 June 2012 |author=BirdLife International|title=Important Bird Areas in Nauru |publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island; also popular are [[scuba diving]] and [[Snorkeling|snorkelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalwildlifelaw.org/NauruFish.html |title=Nauru Ecotourism Tours – Sustainable Tourism &amp; Conservation Laws |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Nauru}}
[[File:Baron Waqa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Baron Waqa]], the incumbent [[President of Nauru]]]]
[[File:Nauru-parliament.jpg|thumb|Parliament of Nauru]]

The president of Nauru is [[Baron Waqa]], who heads a 19-member [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. Nauru also participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Olympic Games]]. Recently Nauru became a member country of the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April 2016.

Nauru is a republic with a [[parliamentary system]] of government.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt; The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years.&lt;ref&gt;Matau, Robert (6 June 2013) [http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/nauru/1413/president-dabwido-gives-it-another-go/ "President Dabwido gives it another go"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926030215/http://islandsbusiness.com/news/nauru/1413/president-dabwido-gives-it-another-go/ |date=26 September 2013 }}. ''Islands Business''.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levine |first=Stephen |author2=Roberts, Nigel S |title=The constitutional structures and electoral systems of Pacific Island states |journal=Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics |date=November 2005 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=276–295 |doi=10.1080/14662040500304866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19&amp;nbsp;members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the [[Democratic Party of Nauru|Democratic Party]], [[Nauru First]] and the [[Centre Party (Nauru)|Centre Party]]. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anckar |first1=D |last2=Anckar |first2=C |title=Democracies without Parties |journal=Comparative Political Studies |year=2000 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=225–247 |doi=10.1177/0010414000033002003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hassell, Graham |author2=Tipu, Feue |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ComJlLocGov/2008/3.html |title=Local Government in the South Pacific Islands |journal=Commonwealth Journal of Local Governance |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land tenure]] on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.&lt;ref name=UNCCD/&gt;

Nauru had 17&amp;nbsp;changes of administration between 1989 and 2003.&lt;ref name=DFAT&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/nauru/nauru_brief.html |title=Republic of Nauru Country Brief |date=November 2005 |accessdate=2 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Dowiyogo]] died in office in March 2003 and [[Ludwig Scotty]] was elected as the president, later being re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004. Following a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] on 19 December 2007, Scotty was replaced by [[Marcus Stephen]]. Stephen resigned in November 2011, and [[Freddie Pitcher]] became President. [[Sprent Dabwido]] then filed a motion of no confidence in Pitcher, resulting in him becoming president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connell |first=John |title=Nauru: The first failed Pacific State? |journal=The Round Table |date=January 2006 |volume=95 |issue=383 |pages=47–63 |doi=10.1080/00358530500379205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15433901 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=17 June 2012 |date=24 October 2011 |title=Nauru profile }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Nauruan parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary elections in 2013]], [[Baron Waqa]] was elected president.

Its [[Supreme Court of Nauru|Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on [[constitution of Nauru|constitutional issues]]. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the [[High Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act (Australia) 1976 |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ncaa1976254 |publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=7 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dale |first=Gregory |title=Appealing to Whom?

Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm |title=Background Note: Nauru |publisher=[[Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs|State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs]] |date=September 2005 |accessdate=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.&lt;ref name=DFAT/&gt; Nauru uses the [[Australian dollar]] as its official currency.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both [[Taiwan]] (ROC) and China (PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the [[One-China policy]]. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting US$130&amp;nbsp;million from the PRC for this action.&lt;ref name="harding"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Harding, Luke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/nauro-recognises-abkhazia-south-ossetia |title=Tiny Nauru struts world stage by recognising breakaway republics |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 14 December 2009|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later.

In 2008, Nauru recognised [[Kosovo]] as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise [[Abkhazia]], a breakaway region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US$50&amp;nbsp;million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt; On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9&amp;nbsp;million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=54715 |title=Nauru expects to earn more from exports after port upgrade with Russian aid |date=15 July 2010 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']], a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438&amp;nbsp;refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as [[Tampa affair|the ''Tampa'' affair]], the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS ''Manoora'' and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's [[Pacific Solution]]. Nauru operated two [[Nauru Regional Processing Centre|detention centres known as State House and Topside]] for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MarStudies/2002/2.html |author=White, Michael |title=M/V Tampa Incident and Australia's Obligations&amp;nbsp;– August 2001 |year=2002 |journal=Maritime Studies |accessdate=18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2005, only two refugees, [[Mohammed Sagar]] and [[Muhammad Faisal]], remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gordon, M |date=5 November 2005 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/naurus-last-two-asylum-seekers-feel-the-pain/2005/11/04/1130823401609.html |title=Nauru's last two asylum seekers feel the pain |newspaper=[[The Age]] |accessdate=8 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007.

{{Main|Economy of Nauru}}
[[File:Nauru satellite.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of Nauru, 2002]]

The Nauruan economy peaked in the mid-1970s to early-1980s,&lt;ref name="KN-20180916" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CER-NAU-2007"/&gt;{{RP|5}} when the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds began to be depleted. At its peak, Nauru's [[GDP]] per capita was estimated to be US$50,000, second only to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="KN-20180916" /&gt; There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[BBC News Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm |title=Big tasks for a small island |accessdate=10 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the [[Nauru Phosphate Corporation]].&lt;ref name=state/&gt; The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the [[Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust]]. The trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/oceania/AE26Ah01.html |accessdate=19 June 2012 |title=Nauru turns to dust |newspaper=Asia Times |author=Seneviratne, Kalinga |date=26 May 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of mismanagement, the trust's fixed and [[current asset]]s were reduced considerably and may never fully recover. The failed investments included financing ''[[Leonardo the Musical: A Portrait of Love|Leonardo the Musical]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref name=mellow&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aYRrEEKDq05Y&amp;refer=australia |accessdate=19 June 2012 |title=GE Poised to Bankrupt Nauru, Island Stained by Money-Laundering |author=Mellor, William |date=1 June 2004 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309123320/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aYRrEEKDq05Y&amp;refer=australia |archivedate=9 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mercure Hotel in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/08/1089000294157.html |title=Nauru, receivers start swapping legal blows |author=Skehan, Craig |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 9 July 2004 |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nauru House]] in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and [[Air Nauru]]'s only [[Boeing&amp;nbsp;737]] was repossessed in December 2005.

The value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 1991 to A$138&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent. The CIA World Factbook estimated a [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] of US$5,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US$2,400 to US$2,715.&lt;ref name="CER-NAU-2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/CERs/NAU/CER-NAU-2007.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607064452/http://www.adb.org/Documents/CERs/NAU/CER-NAU-2007.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2011 |title=Country Economic Report: Nauru |publisher=[[Asian Development Bank]]|page=6|accessdate=20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations (2013) estimates the GDP per capita to 15,211 and ranks it 51 on its GDP per capita country list.

In the 1990s, Nauru became a [[tax haven]] and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/magazine/the-billion-dollar-shack.html |title=The Billion Dollar Shack |accessdate=19 July 2011 |date=10 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inter-governmental [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 "[[FATF Blacklist|non-cooperative]]" countries in its fight against [[money laundering]]. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US$25,000 with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign [[hot money]] left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FATF|date=13 October 2005 |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/13/36/35497629.pdf |title=Nauru de-listed |accessdate=11 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230091334/http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/13/36/35497629.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2007, the [[Nauru detention centre]] provided a significant source of income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nauru-fears-gap-when-camps-close/2007/12/10/1197135374481.html |title=Nauru fears gap when camps close |author=Topsfield, Hewel |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Dr [[Kieren Keke]], stated that the closure would result in 100&amp;nbsp;Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10&amp;nbsp;per cent of the island's population directly or indirectly: "We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.theage.com.au/nauru-hit-by-detention-centre-closure/20080207-1qs6.html |title=Nauru 'hit' by detention centre closure |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.&lt;ref name="SBS World News"/&gt;

In July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations. The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a "largely compliant" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/334976/nauru-gets-an-oecd-upgrade|title=Nauru gets an OECD upgrade|date=12 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nauru 2017–2018 budget, delivered by Minister for Finance David Adeang, forecasted A$128.7 million in revenues and A$128.6 million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Modest economic growth forecast for Nauru |url=http://www.loopnauru.com/nauru-news/modest-economic-growth-forecast-nauru-60701 |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=Loop Pacific |date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Demographics of Nauru}}
Nauru had {{UN_Population|Nauru}}&amp;nbsp;residents as of July {{UN_Population|Year}}, making it the second smallest sovereign state after [[Vatican City]].{{UN_Population|ref}} The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500&amp;nbsp;people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant workers from [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]]. The repatriation was motivated by large force reductions in phosphate mining.&lt;ref name="CER-NAU-2007"/&gt; Nauru is the least populous country in Oceania.

'''Nikšić Royal Palace''' is a (former) royal [[residence]] in [[Nikšić ]], [[Montenegro]]. The two-storied palace was built by king [[Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš]] in 1890. However, it was rarely used. Currently, it houses the Zavičajni Muzej (County Museum), documenting the historical development of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">The '''North City''' was an administrative area in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Amarna]] in [[Upper Egypt]], the short-lived capital of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]]. It contains the ruins of royal palaces, especially the [[Northern Palace (Amarna)|Northern Palace]] and other administrative buildings and occupies an area between the river and the cliffs that terminate the plains to the north of the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/north_city/index.shtml|title=North City, Amarna The Place|work=The Amarna Project|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhetaten was the capital city of the Dynasty XVIII king, Akhenaten, called by some ‘the heretic king’. Akhenaten, formerly Amenhotep IV, built his city in a bay of cliffs on the east bank of the Nile as a centre for the worship of his ‘new’ religion, Atenism. The archaeology of the city is defined by low excavated or reconstructed walls and in some cases only bare outlines of the structures can be made out on the sand-covered plain, since most of the stonework was removed in ancient times and any remaining mudbrick is badly decayed. Only one generation after Akhenaten’s death, there were few physical remains of his superb innovative structures, for a short moment in history one of the greatest cities of ancient Egypt. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akhetaten at el-Amarna|url=https://egyptsites.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/akhetaten-at-tell-el-amarna/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief Age of Amarna was a period of startling artistic and cultural breakthroughs. Amenhotep IV came to the throne about 1350 B.C. and redirected the state religion to the worship of one god, the sun god Aten, and suppressed the worship of others. Some have called him the world's first monotheist. Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten ("One Who Serves Aten") and moved his capital from Thebes down the Nile to an area he named Akhetaten ("Horizon of the Sun-Disk"), today known as Amarna. It was previously unoccupied and thus was a blank page upon which the pharaoh could write his new history of the world. Despite his radical beliefs (monotheism), Akhenaten did not abandon all tradition, and he apparently prepared a royal tomb for himself and his family in the cliffs of Amarna. His mummy is yet to be found. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Scarlet|title=The Age of Amarna|journal=A Blink in the Eye of Eternal Egypt|volume=15|issue=3|quote=Despite his radical beliefs, Akhenaten did not abandon all tradition, and he apparently prepared a royal tomb for himself and his family in the cliffs of Amarna.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[postal history]] of [[San Marino]]''' can be traced to October 7, 1607, with the introduction of public postal services.&lt;ref name=SMS&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =120th Anniversary of the First Stamps of San Marino | publisher =Republicca di San Marino Azienda Autonoma di Stato Filatelica e Numistatica | date =1997 | url =http://www.aasfn.sm/previous97/ef7e.htm | accessdate =2009-03-23 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20020621150104/http://www.aasfn.sm/previous97/ef7e.htm | archivedate =2002-06-21 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The republic’s postal needs were handled by a post office in nearby [[Rimini]], [[Italy]]; the first San Marino post office opened in 1833.&lt;ref name=SMS /&gt;

== History ==
When postage stamps were introduced in the mid-19th century, San Marino signed a postal treaty with Italy to use Italian stamps for its mail.&lt;ref name=SMS /&gt; On March 2, 1877, a new agreement was signed between the two countries that enabled San Marino to issue its own stamps.&lt;ref name=SSM&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =Stamps San Marino, Philately San Marino | publisher =Il Portale della Repubblica di San Marino | date = | url =http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/filatelia.html | accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first San Marino postage stamps were a [[definitive stamp]] edition consisting of two designs covering seven [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Fred J. Melville | title =The Postage Stamps of San Marino | publisher =The Connoisseur | date =1907 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zyMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=postage+stamps+san+marino&amp;ei=qM3HScyULYioM8mfzYsM#PPA177,M1 | accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stamps, which depicted the [[Three Towers of San Marino]] at [[Monte Titano]], were created by the design firm Fratelli Pellas in [[Genoa]] and the stamps were printed on Italian watermarked paper by the Officina Carta e Valori in [[Turin]].&lt;ref name=SSM /&gt; [[Commemorative stamp]] editions were introduced in 1894.&lt;ref name=SSM /&gt;

Over the years, the attractive designs of San Marino’s stamps have been extremely popular with philatelists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQFzO_v_uwwC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=postage+stamps+san+marino&amp;ei=qM3HScyULYioM8mfzYsM |title=Secrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe  | author=Thomas M.

'''Ratanakiri Airport''' {{airport codes|RBE&lt;ref&gt;{{GCM|RBE}}&lt;/ref&gt;|VDRK}} is an [[airport]] in [[Ban Lung]] town in [[Ratanakiri Province]], [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Location Indicators.''  ICAO Doc 7910/128, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In November 2005, there was a minor accident at Ratanakiri Airport when a plane arriving from [[Phnom Penh]] hit the side of the runway and ground looped, which caused the right hand main landing gear to collapse. The [[Antonov An-24|Y-7]]-100C aircraft was operated by [[PMT Air]] and leased from [[Royal Phnom Penh Airways]]. There were 59 passengers and 6 crew aboard at the time of the crash, but there were no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20051121-0|title=Accident description|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this incident, and the more serious crash of [[PMTair Flight 241]] in [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] in July, PMT Air ceased regular commercial flights to Ratanakiri. Since then, no commercial flights to Ban Lung are available and only chartered and private flights use the airport.

The '''Union for the Development of the Comoros''' ({{lang-fr|Union pour le Développement des Comores}}, UPDC) is a [[political alliance]] in the [[Comoros]]. The party's president is [[Mohamed Halifa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.indian-ocean-times.com/Comoros-Controversy-surrounding-the-election-commission-on-the-eve-of-the-start-of-the-campaign-for-parliamentary-and_a4947.html Comoros: Controversy surrounding the election commission on the eve of the start of the campaign for parliamentary and municipal elections] Indian Ocean Times, 15 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The UPDC was established in February 2013 as an alliance of parties that supported President [[Ikililou Dhoinine]].&lt;ref name=TL&gt;Tom Lansford (2014) ''Political Handbook of the World 2014'', CQ Press, p307&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially named the '''Rally for Democracy in the Comoros''' (''Rassemblement pour la Démocratie aux Comoros'', Radeco), but was later renamed Union for the Development of the Comoros.&lt;ref name=TL/&gt;

In the [[Comorian legislative election, 2015|2015 parliamentary elections]] the UPDC emerged as the largest party, winning eight of the 24 directly-elected seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comores-actualites.com/non-classe/comores-elections-resultats-de-la-ceni-pour-le-2eme-tour/ Comorian elections: CENI results for the second round!] Comores Actualités, 26 February 2015 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uzbekistan''' ({{IPAc-en|US|audio=en-us-Uzbekistan.ogg|ʊ|z|ˈ|b|ɛ|k|ᵻ|s|t|æ|n|,_|-|s|t|ɑː|n}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ʊ|z|ˌ|b|ɛ|k|ᵻ|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|n|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|æ|n}}, {{lang-uz|Ўзбекистон/Oʻzbekiston}}, {{IPA-uz|ozbekiˈstɒn|pron}}, {{lang-ru|Узбекистан}}), officially also the '''Republic of Uzbekistan''' ({{lang-uz|Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi}}) ({{lang-ru|Республика Узбекистан}}), is a [[landlocked country]]—the only doubly landlocked one (i.e. surrounded solely by other landlocked countries)—in [[Central Asia]] and one of the only two in Eurasia or anywhere the world. The [[sovereign state]] is a [[secular]], [[unitary state|unitary]] constitutional republic, comprising 12 provinces, one autonomous republic, and a capital city. Uzbekistan is bordered by five landlocked countries: [[Kazakhstan]] to the north; [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast; [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast; [[Afghanistan]] to the south; and [[Turkmenistan]] to the southwest.

What is now Uzbekistan was in ancient times part of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking region of [[Transoxiana]] and [[Turan]]. The first recorded settlers were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as [[Scythians]], who founded kingdoms in [[Khwarezm]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Bactria]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Sogdia]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Kingdom of Fergana|Fergana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD), and [[Margiana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD). The area was incorporated into the [[Achaemenids|Persian Empire]] and, after a period of [[Baktria|Macedonian Greek rule]], was ruled mostly by Persian dynasties.  The [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] in the 7th century converted the majority of the population, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of [[Islam]]. During this period, cities such as Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara began to grow rich from the [[Silk Road]]. The local [[Khwarezmian dynasty]], and Central Asia as a whole, were decimated by the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century. After the Mongol Conquests, the area became increasingly dominated by Turkic peoples. The city of [[Shahrisabz]] was the birthplace of the Turco-Mongol warlord [[Timur]], also known as one of [[Genghis Khan]]'s grandchildren, who in the 14th century established the [[Timurid Empire]] and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of [[Turan]] with his capital in [[Samarkand]]. The area was conquered by [[Shaybanids|Uzbek Shaybanids]] in the 16th century, moving the centre of power from Samarkand to [[Bukhara]]. The region was split into three states: [[Khanate of Khiva]], [[Khanate of Kokand]], and [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. It [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|was gradually incorporated]] into the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century, with [[Tashkent]] becoming the political center of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In 1924, after [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation]], the constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] known as the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created. Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]], it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991.

Uzbekistan has a diverse cultural heritage due to its storied history and strategic location. Its first major official language is [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], a Turkic language written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and spoken natively by approximately 85% of the population. [[Russian language|Russian]] has widespread use as a governmental language; it is the most widely taught second language. [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] constitute 81% of the population, followed by [[Russian people|Russians]] (5.4%), Tajiks (4.0%), Kazakhs (3.0%), and others (6.5%). [[Muslims]]&amp;nbsp;constitute 79% of the population while 5% of the population follow&amp;nbsp;[[Russian Orthodox|Russian Orthodox Christianity]], and 16% of the population follow other religions or are non-religious. A majority of Uzbeks are [[non-denominational Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation". The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity.

Uzbekistan lies between latitudes [[37th parallel north|37°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian east|56°]] and [[74th meridian east|74° E]]. It stretches {{convert|1425|km|mi}} from west to east and {{convert|930|km|mi}} from north to south. Bordering [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Aral Sea]] to the north and northwest, [[Turkmenistan]] to the southwest, [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast, and [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast, Uzbekistan is one of the largest [[Central Asian]] states and the only Central Asian state to border all the other four. Uzbekistan also shares a short border (less than {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with [[Afghanistan]] to the south.

Uzbekistan is a dry, [[landlocked]] country. It is one of two [[doubly landlocked]] countries in the world (that is, a country completely surrounded by landlocked countries), the other being [[Liechtenstein]]. In addition, due to its location within a series of [[endorheic]] basins, none of its rivers lead to the sea. Less than 10% of its territory is intensively cultivated irrigated land in river valleys and oases. The rest is vast desert ([[Kyzyl Kum]]) and mountains.[[File:Uzbekistan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|left|Uzbekistan map of Köppen climate classification]]The highest point in Uzbekistan is the [[Khazret Sultan]], at {{convert|4643|m|ft}} above sea level, in the southern part of the [[Gissar Range]] in [[Surkhandarya Province]], on the border with Tajikistan, just northwest of [[Dushanbe]] (formerly called Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party).&lt;ref name=uzstat&gt;[http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2051 Uzbekistan will publish its own book of records&amp;nbsp;– Ferghana.ru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513010043/http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2051 |date=13 May 2013 }}. 18 July 2007.

Uzbekistan has a rich and diverse natural environment. However, decades of questionable [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] policies in pursuit of greater [[cotton]] production have resulted in a catastrophic scenario with the agricultural industry being the main contributor to the pollution and devastation of both air and water in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/uzbekistan/17.htm Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208033959/http://countrystudies.us/uzbekistan/17.htm |date=8 December 2013 }}".

Due to the Aral Sea problem, high salinity and contamination of the soil with [[heavy elements]] are especially widespread in [[Karakalpakstan]], the region of Uzbekistan adjacent to the Aral Sea. The bulk of the nation's water resources is used for farming, which accounts for nearly 84% of the water usage and contributes to high [[soil salinity]]. Heavy use of [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s for cotton growing further aggravates [[soil contamination]].&lt;ref name="LoC:Climate"/&gt;

The first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were [[Scythians]] who came from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan, sometime in the first millennium BC; when these nomads settled in the region they built an extensive irrigation system along the rivers.&lt;ref name="Lubin-earlyhistory"&gt;''This section incorporates text from the following source, which is in the [[public domain]]'': Lubin, Nancy (1997).

As China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Persian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centres of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and rural settlements in the province of [[Transoxiana]], and further east in what is today China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region, the Sogdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. As a result of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Lubin-earlyhistory"/&gt;

In 327 BC Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] provinces of Sogdiana and Bactria, which contained the territories of modern Uzbekistan. A conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the Macedonian [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].  The kingdom was replaced with the Yuezhi dominated [[Kushan Empire]] in the 1st century BC. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by the Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires, as well as by other empires, for example those formed by the Turko-Persian [[Hephthalite]] and Turkic [[Gokturk]] peoples.

In the 8th century, Transoxiana, the territory between the [[Amu Darya|Amudarya]] and [[Syr Darya|Syrdarya]] rivers, was conquered by the Arabs (Ali ibn Sattor) who enriched the region with the Early Renaissance. Many notable scientists lived there and contributed to its development during the Islamic Golden Age. Among the achievements of the scholars during this period were the development of [[trigonometry]] into its modern form (simplifying its practical application to calculate the phases of the moon), advances in [[optics]], in [[astronomy]], as well as in poetry, philosophy, art, calligraphy and many others, which set the foundation for the Muslim Renaissance.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Transoxiana was included into the [[Samanid]] State. Later, Transoxiana saw the incursion of the Turkic-ruled [[Karakhanids]], as well as the [[Seljuks]] (Sultan Sanjar) and [[Kara-Khitans]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Davidovich|first = E.

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest under [[Genghis Khan]] during the 13th century would bring about a change to the region. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] led to the displacement of some of the Iranian-speaking people of the region, their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the [[Mongols|Mongolian]]-[[Turkic peoples]] who came thereafter. The invasions of Bukhara, Samarkand, [[Köneürgenç|Urgench]] and others resulted in [[Destruction under the Mongol Empire|mass murders]] and unprecedented destruction, such as portions of [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarezmia]] being completely razed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118054002/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities (XI – XIII century)]. faculty.washington.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, the Mongol law of the Mongol Empire maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan]], the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom (Ulus Batiy, Sattarkhan).&lt;ref name="Lubin-Timur"&gt;''This section incorporates text from the following source, which is in the [[public domain]]'': Lubin, Nancy (1997).

During this period, most of present Uzbekistan was part of [[Chagatai Khanate]] except [[Khwarezm]] was part of [[Golden Horde]].

He also invaded [[Russia]] before dying during an invasion of [[Ming dynasty|China]] in 1405.&lt;ref name="Lubin-Timur"/&gt;

Timur was known for his extreme brutality and his conquests were accompanied by [[genocidal massacre]]s in the cities he occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Totten, Samuel and Bartrop, Paul Robert (2008) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C Dictionary of Genocide: A-L] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018194024/https://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C |date=18 October 2017 }}'', ABC-CLIO, p. 422, {{ISBN|0313346429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timur initiated the last flowering of Transoxiana by gathering together numerous artisans and scholars from the vast lands he had conquered into his capital, Samarqand. By supporting such people, he imbued his empire with a rich Perso-Islamic culture. During his reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction masterpieces were undertaken in Samarqand and other population centres.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, &amp; Henley, David: ''[http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&amp;acid=120613150427&amp;aiid=120613151433 Timur's Legacy: The Architecture of Bukhara and Samarkand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524193127/http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&amp;acid=120613150427&amp;aiid=120613151433 |date=24 May 2013 }}'' (CPA Media).&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Timur initiated an exchange of medical discoveries and patronized physicians, scientists and artists from the neighbouring countries such as India;&lt;ref&gt;Medical Links between India &amp; Uzbekistan in Medieval Times by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Historical and Cultural Links between India &amp; Uzbekistan, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 1996. pp. 353–381.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Transoxiana, although the Timurids were Persianate in nature. The greatest Chaghataid writer, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], was active in the city of [[Herat]] (now in northwestern Afghanistan) in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Lubin-Timur"/&gt;

The Timurid state quickly split in half after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Uzbek nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea.

On 20 June 1990, Uzbekistan declared its state sovereignty. On 31 August 1991, Uzbekistan declared independence after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup attempt]] in Moscow. 1 September was proclaimed the National Independence Day. The Soviet Union was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] on 26 December of that year.

Islam Karimov, ruler of Uzbekistan since independence, died on 2 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37218158|title=Obituary: Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov|website=[[BBC News]]|date=2 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903142534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37218158|archivedate=3 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by his long-time [[Prime Minister of Uzbekistan|Prime Minister]], Shavkat Mirziyoyev, on 14 December of the same year.

After Uzbekistan declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, an election was held, and [[Islam Karimov]] was elected as the [[List of Presidents of Uzbekistan|first President]] of Uzbekistan.

The elections of the [[Supreme Assembly (Uzbekistan)|Oliy Majlis]] (Parliament or Supreme Assembly) were held under a resolution adopted by the 16th Supreme Soviet in 1994. In that year, the Supreme Soviet was replaced by the Oliy Majlis.

The third elections for the bicameral 150-member Oliy Majlis, the Legislative Chamber, and the 100-member Senate for five-year terms, were held on 27 December 2009. The second elections were held in December 2004 to January 2005. The Oliy Majlis was unicameral up to 2004. Its size increased from 69 deputies (members) in 1994 to 120 in 2004–05, and currently stands at 150.

{{Confusing|section|reason=the last paragraph seems to lack preceding context|date=August 2018}}

The referendum passed, and Islam Karimov's term was extended by an act of parliament to December 2007. Most international observers refused to participate in the process and did not recognize the results, dismissing them as not meeting basic standards. The 2002 referendum also included a plan for a bicameral parliament consisting of a lower house (the Oliy Majlis) and an upper house (Senate). Members of the lower house are to be "full-time" legislators. Elections for the new bicameral parliament took place on 26 December.

==Human rights==
{{Main|Human rights in Uzbekistan}}
{{see also|2005 Andijan Unrest}}
The Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan asserts that "democracy in the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be based upon common human principles, according to which the highest value shall be the human being, his life, freedom, honour, dignity and other inalienable rights."

The official position is summarised in a memorandum "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"&lt;ref&gt;Embassy of Uzbekistan to the US, [https://archive.is/20121228073428/http://www.uzbekistan.org/press/archive/283/ Press-Release: "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"], 24 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and amounts to the following: the government does everything that is in its power to protect and to guarantee the human rights of Uzbekistan's citizens. Uzbekistan continuously improves its laws and institutions in order to create a more humane society. Over 300 laws regulating the rights and basic freedoms of the people have been passed by the parliament. For instance, an office of [[Ombudsman]] was established in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Uzbekistan Daily Digest,{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/uzbekistan/hypermail/200304/0029.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 February 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904102609/http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/uzbekistan/hypermail/200304/0029.shtml |archivedate=4 September 2008 }}, 25 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2005, President Islam Karimov signed a decree that abolished capital punishment in Uzbekistan on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/uzbekistan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323213748/https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/uzbekistan |archivedate=23 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] human rights organizations, such as [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|IHF]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], as well as [[United States Department of State]] and [[Council of the European Union]], define Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with limited civil rights"&lt;ref name="US State Dept - human rights"&gt;US Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119143.htm 2008 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uzbekistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624054113/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119143.htm |date=24 June 2017 }}, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, 25 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and express profound concern about "wide-scale violation of virtually all basic human rights".&lt;ref&gt;IHF,{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=3&amp;d_id=3860 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 February 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129175624/http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=3&amp;d_id=3860 |archivedate=29 January 2010 }}, 23 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing a multitude of economic challenges upon acquiring independence, the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy, with an emphasis on state control, reduction of imports and self-sufficiency in energy. Since 1994, the state-controlled media have repeatedly proclaimed the success of this "Uzbekistan Economic Model"&lt;ref&gt;Islam Karimov's interview to Rossijskaya Gazeta, 7 July 1995{{cite web|url=http://2004.press-service.uz/rus/knigi/9tom/3tom_12.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 November 2005 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922045122/http://2004.press-service.uz/rus/knigi/9tom/3tom_12.htm |archivedate=22 September 2008 }}  (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that it is a unique example of a smooth transition to the market economy while avoiding shock, pauperism and stagnation.

The gradualist reform strategy has involved postponing significant macroeconomic and structural reforms. The state in the hands of the [[new class|bureaucracy]] has remained a dominant influence in the economy. Corruption permeates the society and grows more rampant over time: Uzbekistan's 2005 [[Corruption Perception Index]] was 137 out of 159 countries, whereas in 2007 Uzbekistan was 175th out of 179 countries. A February 2006 report on the country by the [[International Crisis Group]] suggests that revenues earned from key exports, especially cotton, gold, corn and increasingly gas, are distributed among a very small circle of the ruling elite, with little or no benefit for the populace at large.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gary (16 February 2006). {{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/New-Report-Paints-Grim-Picture-of-Uzbekistan.cfm?CFID=281017252&amp;CFTOKEN=40626492&amp;jsessionid=00308b85b39c112dba1e6241221e37211353 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090825223014/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/New-Report-Paints-Grim-Picture-of-Uzbekistan.cfm?CFID=281017252&amp;CFTOKEN=40626492&amp;jsessionid=00308b85b39c112dba1e6241221e37211353 |archive-date=25 August 2009 |title=New Report Paints Grim Picture of Uzbekistan |dead-url=yes |accessdate=1 June 2016}}.

US Department of State, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the largest barrier to foreign companies entering the Uzbekistan market has been the difficulty of converting currency. In 2003 the government accepted the obligations of Article VIII under the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03188.htm |title=Press Release: The Republic of Uzbekistan Accepts Article VIII Obligations |publisher=Imf.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121134806/http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03188.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and the tightening of borders have lessened the effect of this measure.

Uzbekistan experienced rampant [[inflation]] of around 1000% per year immediately after independence (1992–1994). Stabilisation efforts implemented with guidance from the IMF&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfa.uz/eng/inter_cooper/econ_org/Inter_MF/ Uzbekistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on IMF's role in economic stabilisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510075000/http://mfa.uz/eng/inter_cooper/econ_org/Inter_MF/ |date=10 May 2011 }}.

The government of Uzbekistan restricts foreign imports in many ways, including high import duties. Excise taxes are applied in a highly discriminatory manner to protect locally produced goods. Official tariffs are combined with unofficial, discriminatory charges resulting in total charges amounting to as much as 100 to 150% of the actual value of the product, making imported products virtually unaffordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Reports_Publications/2004/2004_National_Trade_Estimate/2004_NTE_Report/asset_upload_file327_4803.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 December 2005 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815015618/http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Reports_Publications/2004/2004_National_Trade_Estimate/2004_NTE_Report/asset_upload_file327_4803.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2008 }}.

The [[Tashkent Stock Exchange|Republican Stock Exchange]] (RSE) opened in 1994. The stocks of all Uzbek joint stock companies (around 1250) are traded on RSE. The number of listed companies as of January 2013 exceeds 110. Securities market volume reached 2 trillion in 2012, and the number is rapidly growing due to the rising interest by companies of attracting necessary resources through the capital market. According to Central Depository as of January 2013 par value of outstanding shares of Uzbek emitters exceeded 9 trillion.

Uzbekistan's external position has been strong since 2003.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Thanks in part to the recovery of world market prices of gold and cotton (the country's key export commodities), expanded natural gas and some manufacturing exports, and increasing labour migrant transfers, the current account turned into a large surplus (between 9% and 11% of GDP from 2003 to 2005) and foreign exchange reserves, including gold, more than doubled to around US$3 billion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Islam is the dominant religion in Uzbekistan, although religious belief was not allowed during Soviet rule (1924–1991). Greater population is believed to be non-religious but spiritual. A 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report stated that Uzbekistan's population is 93.3% Muslim.&lt;ref name=Pew2009&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf Mapping the Global Muslim Population.

Despite its predominance, the practice of [[Islam]] is far from monolithic. Many versions of the faith have been practised in Uzbekistan. The conflict of Islamic tradition with various agendas of [[reform movement|reform]] or [[secularization]] throughout the 20th century has left a wide variety of Islamic practices in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2"/&gt; 54% of Muslims are [[non-denominational Muslims]], 18% are [[Sunni]]s and 1% are [[Shia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life. 9 August 2012. Retrieved 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of Soviet power in Uzbekistan did not bring an immediate upsurge of [[fundamentalism]], as many had predicted, but rather a gradual re-acquaintance with the precepts of the faith. However, in the latter half of the 2010s there has been a slight increase in Islamist activity, with organisations such as the Islamic Movement of Uzkebistan committing allegiance to [[ISIL]] and contributing fighters for terror attacks overseas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rising Islamic State threat in Central Asia|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-central-asia-islamic-state-edit-20170203-story.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=3 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803221345/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-central-asia-islamic-state-edit-20170203-story.html|archivedate=3 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the terror threat in Uzbekistan itself remains low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbekistan's real problem is not terrorism, it's politics|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/uzbekistans-real-problem-is-not-terrorism-its-politics-aliyev-karimov/|website=Politico.eu|publisher=Politico|accessdate=3 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803212101/http://www.politico.eu/article/uzbekistans-real-problem-is-not-terrorism-its-politics-aliyev-karimov/|archivedate=3 August 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Terrorism in Uzbekistan]]).

====Jewish community====
{{main|Uzbek Jews|Bukharan Jews}}
According to local traditions Jews began to settle in the area 2,500 years ago after the exile from the kingdom of Israel by the Babylonians. Other traditions focus on Jewish merchants settling in the area of the [[silk road]].

The Jewish community flourished for centuries with occasional hardships during the reign of certain rulers. During the rule of [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th century Jews contributed greatly to his efforts to rebuild Samarkand and a great Jewish centre was established there.&lt;ref name="jvlib"&gt;"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Uzbekistan.html Uzbekistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712005324/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Uzbekistan.html |date=12 July 2015 }}".

[[File:Bukharan Jews (before 1899).jpg|thumb|Bukharan Jews, c. 1899]]

After the area came under Russian rule in 1868, Jews were granted equal rights with the local population.&lt;ref name="jvlib"/&gt; In that period some 50,000 Jews lived in [[Samarkand]] and 20,000 in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name="jvlib"/&gt; After the Russian revolution in 1917, and the establishment of the Soviet regime, Jewish religious life was restricted. By 1935 only one synagogue out of 30 was left in Samarkand; nevertheless, underground community life continued during the Soviet era.&lt;ref name="jvlib"/&gt;

During World War II one million of Jews from the European parts of the Soviet Union arrived in Uzbekistan as refugees or were exiled by Stalin. By 1970 there were 103,000 Jews registered in the republic.&lt;ref name="jvlib"/&gt;

At the late 1980s with the rise of nationalistic riots as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, damaging, among others, the Jewish quarter in [[Andijan]], most of the Jews of Uzbekistan emigrated to Israel and to the US. A small community of several thousand remains today in the country: some 7,000 live in Tashkent, 3,000 in Bukhara and 700 in Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eajc.org/page277 Euro-Asian Jewish Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120130/http://eajc.org/page277 |date=24 December 2013 }} (retrieved 29 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uzbek language is one of the [[Turkic languages]] close to [[Uyghur language]] and both of them belong to the [[Karluk languages]] branch of the Turkic language family. Uzbek language is the only [[de jure]] official national language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mansurov, Nasim |url=http://www.arbuz.com/Umid/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan |publisher=Umid.uz |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117175844/http://www.arbuz.com/Umid/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1992 is officially written in the [[Latin alphabet]].

Although the [[Russian language]] is not formally clarified to be an official language in the country, it is widely used in all fields, including official documents. Digital information from all forms of the government is bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State Education Portal of Uzbekistan |url=http://ziyonet.uz/ru |website=Ziyonet |publisher=Government of Uzbekistan |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fbuz"&gt;{{cite web |title=President's FaceBook |url=https://www.facebook.com/Mirziyoyev |website=FaceBook |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pres.uz"&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidential Site of Uzbekistan |url=http://www.president.uz/ru |website=President.uz |publisher=The Government of Uzbekistan |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Russian language is the de facto second official language in Uzbekistan. Russian is an important language for interethnic communication, especially in the cities, including much day-to-day social, technical, scientific, governmental and business use.

[[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], is also a Turkic language but closer to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], is spoken in the [[Karakalpakstan|Republic of Karakalpakstan]] and has an official status there. This language is spoken by half a million people. More than 800,000 people also speak the Kazakh language.

Before the 1920s, the written language of Uzbeks was called Turki (known to Western scholars as [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]) and used the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script. In 1926 the Latin alphabet was introduced and went through several revisions throughout the 1930s. Finally, in 1940, the Cyrillic alphabet was introduced by Soviet authorities and was used until the fall of Soviet Union. In 1993 Uzbekistan shifted back to the Latin script ([[Uzbek alphabet]]), which was modified in 1996 and is being taught in schools since 2000. In schools, colleges and universities teach only in Latin script. At the same time, in the country for Uzbek language is also used officially abolished the Cyrillic alphabet. Cyrillic is used in a number of popular newspapers and websites. Some of the text on the TV on some channels is duplicated on the Cyrillic alphabet. Cyrillic is popular with the older generation of Uzbeks who grew up on this alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Woman in Uzbekistan: Islam, Modernity, and Unveiling Under Communism |last=Kamp |first=Marianne |year=2008 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-98819-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&amp;pg=PP14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405011646/http://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&amp;pg=PP14 |archivedate=5 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tashkent]], the nation's capital and largest city, has a three-line [[rapid transit|rapid transit system]] built in 1977, and expanded in 2001 after ten years' independence from the [[Soviet Union]].

A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near a station entrance.

There are government-operated trams and buses running across the city. There are also many taxis, registered and unregistered. Uzbekistan has plants that produce modern cars. The car production is supported by the government and the Korean auto company [[Daewoo]].

There is a large airplane plant that was built during the Soviet era&amp;nbsp;– [[Tashkent Aviation Production Association|Tashkent Chkalov Aviation Manufacturing Plant]] or ТАПОиЧ in Russian. The plant originated during World War II, when production facilities were evacuated south and east to avoid capture by advancing Nazi forces. Until the late 1980s, the plant was one of the leading aeroplane production centres in the USSR. With dissolution of the Soviet Union its manufacturing equipment became outdated; most of the workers were laid off. Now it produces only a few planes a year, but with interest from Russian companies growing, there are rumours of production-enhancement plans.

With close to 65,000 servicemen, Uzbekistan possesses the largest armed forces in Central Asia. The military structure is largely inherited from the [[Turkestan Military District]] of the [[Soviet Army]], although it is going through a reform to be based mainly on motorized infantry with some light and special forces{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. The Uzbek Armed Forces' equipment is not modern, and training, while improving, is neither uniform nor adequate for its new mission of territorial security{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

The government has accepted the arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union, acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as a non-nuclear state), and supported an active program by the U.S. [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) in western Uzbekistan ([[Nukus]] and [[Vozrozhdeniye Island]]). The Government of Uzbekistan spends about 3.7% of GDP on the military but has received a growing infusion of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and other security assistance funds since 1998.

Following 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Uzbekistan approved the [[U.S. Central Command]]'s request for access to an air base, the [[Karshi-Khanabad]] airfield, in southern Uzbekistan. However, Uzbekistan demanded that the U.S. withdraw from the airbases after the [[Andijan massacre]] and the U.S. reaction to this massacre. The last US troops left Uzbekistan in November 2005.

On 23 June 2006, Uzbekistan became a full participant in the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] (CSTO), but informed the CSTO to suspend its membership in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/politics/uzbekistan-quits-pro-russian-bloc-996/ |title=Uzbekistan quits Russia-led CSTO military bloc |date=28 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502184452/http://rt.com/politics/uzbekistan-quits-pro-russian-bloc-996/ |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|International organization membership of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Clarence Moore House.JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Uzbekistan]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA]]
Uzbekistan joined the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in December 1991. However, it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the CIS collective security arrangement in 1999. Since that time, Uzbekistan has participated in the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and in UN-organized groups to help resolve the Tajikistan and Afghanistan conflicts, both of which it sees as posing threats to its own stability.

Previously close to Washington (which gave Uzbekistan half a billion dollars in aid in 2004, about a quarter of its military budget), the government of Uzbekistan has recently restricted American military use of the airbase at [[Karshi-Khanabad]] for air operations in neighbouring Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt, Erich and Wolfe, Adam (17 October 2005) [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html Rice Attempts to Secure US Influence in Central Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503094751/http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html |date=3 May 2012 }}, Global Policy Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; Uzbekistan was an active supporter of U.S. efforts against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalitions that have dealt with both Afghanistan and Iraq.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States began to deteriorate after the so-called "[[colour revolutions]]" in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]] (and to a lesser extent [[Kyrgyzstan]]). When the U.S. joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at [[Andijan massacre|Andijan]], the relationship further declined, and President Islam Karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to Russia and China.

In late July 2005, the government of Uzbekistan ordered the United States to vacate an air base in Karshi-Kanabad (near Uzbekistan's border with Afghanistan) within 180 days. Karimov had offered use of the base to the U.S. shortly after [[9/11]]. It is also believed by some Uzbeks that the protests in Andijan were brought about by the U.K. and U.S. influences in the area of Andijan. This is another reason for the hostility between Uzbekistan and the West.

Uzbekistan is a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) (since 2 March 1992), the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC), [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It belongs to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO) (comprising the five Central Asian countries, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]]). In 1999, Uzbekistan joined the [[GUAM]] alliance (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and [[Moldova]]), which was formed in 1997 (making it GUUAM), but pulled out of the organization in 2005.

[[File:2015 Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 03.jpg|thumb|Leaders present at the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]] summit in [[Ufa]], Russia in 2015]]
Uzbekistan is also a member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (SCO) and hosts the SCO's Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in Tashkent. Uzbekistan joined the new [[Central Asian Cooperation Organisation]] (CACO) in 2002. The CACO consists of Uzbekistan, [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and Kyrgyzstan. It is a founding member of, and remains involved in, the [[Central Asian Union]], formed with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and joined in March 1998 by Tajikistan.

In September 2006, [[UNESCO]] presented Islam Karimov an award for Uzbekistan's preservation of its rich culture and traditions. Despite criticism, this seems to be a sign of improving relationships between Uzbekistan and the West.

The month of October 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of Uzbekistan from the West. The [[European Union|EU]] announced that it was planning to send a delegation to Uzbekistan to talk about human rights and liberties, after a long period of hostile relations between the two. Although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the [[Andijan Massacre]] is true, the EU is evidently willing to ease its economic sanctions against Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed among Uzbekistan's population that the government will stand firm in maintaining its close ties with the [[Russian Federation]] and in its theory that the 2004–2005 protests in Uzbekistan were promoted by the US and UK.

In January 2008, [[Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva]] was appointed to her current role as Uzbekistan's ambassador to [[UNESCO]]. Karimova-Tillyaeva and her team have been instrumental in promoting inter-cultural dialogue by increasing European society's awareness of Uzbekistan's cultural and historical heritage.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Uzbekistan}}
{{See also|Kurash|Islam in Uzbekistan|Scout Association of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Taschkent-42.JPG|thumb|Traditional Uzbek [[pottery]]]]
[[File:Theatre Alisher Navoi.JPG|thumb|right|[[Navoi Theater|Navoi Opera Theater]] in [[Tashkent]]]]
Uzbekistan has a wide mix of ethnic groups and cultures, with the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] being the majority group. In 1995 about 71% of Uzbekistan's population was Uzbek. The chief minority groups were Russians (8%), [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (5–30%),&lt;ref name="Karl Cordell 1999. pg 201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lena Jonson 2006. pg 108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foltz2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cornellcaspian.com"/&gt; [[Kazakhs]] (4%), [[Tatar]]s (2.5%) and [[Karakalpaks]] (2%). It is said, however, that the number of non-Uzbek people living in Uzbekistan is decreasing as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former [[Soviet Union]].
[[File:Suzani (Boukhara, Ouzbékistan) (5657423581).jpg|thumb|Embroidery from Uzbekistan]]
When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991, there was concern that [[Muslim fundamentalism]] would spread across the region. The expectation was that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith. As of 1994, over half of Uzbekistan's population was said to be Muslim, though in an official survey few of that number had any real knowledge of the religion or knew how to practice it. However, Islamic observance is increasing in the region.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Boukhara 4696a.jpg|thumb|Silk and Spice Festival in [[Bukhara]]]]
Central Asian classical music is called [[Shashmaqam]], which arose in [[Bukhara]] in the late 16th century when that city was a regional capital. Shashmaqam is closely related to [[Azerbaijan]]i [[Mugam]] and [[Uyghur muqam]]. The name, which translates as ''six maqams'' refers to the structure of the music, which contains six sections in six different [[Musical mode]]s, similar to classical [[Persian traditional music]]. Interludes of spoken [[Sufi poetry]] interrupt the music, typically beginning at a lower register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone.

===Education===
Uzbekistan has a high [[literacy rate]], with about 99.3% of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write. However, with only 76% of the under-15 population currently enrolled in education (and only 20% of the 3–6 year olds attending pre-school), this figure may drop in the future. Students attend school Monday through Saturday during the school year, and education officially concludes at the end of the 12th grade. There are two international schools operating in Uzbekistan, both in Tashkent: The British School catering for elementary students only, and [[Tashkent International School]], a K-12 international curriculum school.

Uzbekistan has encountered severe budget shortfalls in its education program. The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform, but the physical base has deteriorated and curriculum revision has been slow. A large contributor to this decline is the low level of wages received by teachers and the lack of spending on infrastructure, buildings and resources on behalf of the government. Corruption within the education system is also rampant, with students from wealthier families routinely bribing teachers and school executives to achieve high grades without attending school, or undertaking official examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Kozlova, Marina (21 January 2008) [http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft Uzbekistan: Lessons in Graft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608053517/http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft |date=8 June 2012 }}.  Chalkboard.tol.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Uzbekistan's universities create almost 600,000 graduates annually, though the general standard of university graduates, and the overall level of education within the tertiary system, is low. Several universities, including [[Westminster International University in Tashkent|Westminster University]], [[Turin University]], [[Management Development Institute of Singapore in Tashkent|Management University Institute of Singapore]] and [[Inha University Tashkent]] maintain a campus in Tashkent offering English language courses across several disciplines. The Russian-language high education is provided by most national universities, including foreign [[Moscow State University]] and [[Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas]], maintaining campuses in Tashkent.

===Cuisine===

{{See also|List of Uzbek dishes|Soviet cuisine}}
[[File:Plov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palov]]]]
[[File:Uzbek Manti (bright).jpg|thumb|right|Uzbek [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]]]]
Uzbek cuisine is influenced by local [[agriculture]], as in most nations. There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as "noodle-rich". [[Mutton]] is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is part of various Uzbek dishes.

Uzbekistan's signature dish is [[palov]] (''plov'' or ''osh''), a main course typically made with [[rice]], pieces of [[meat]], and grated [[carrot]]s and [[onion]]s. ''Oshi nahor'', or morning ''plov'', is served in the early morning (between 6 am and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. Other notable national dishes include [[shurpa]] (''shurva'' or ''shorva''), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually [[mutton]]), and fresh vegetables; [[Naryn (soup)|norin]] and [[Laghman (soup)|laghman]], noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course; [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[chuchvara]], and [[somsa]], stuffed pockets of [[dough]] served as an appetizer or a main course; [[dimlama]], a meat and vegetable stew; and various [[kebabs]], usually served as a main course.

[[Green tea]] is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; [[teahouses]] (''chaikhanas'') are of cultural importance. [[Black tea]] is preferred in [[Tashkent]], but both green and black teas are taken daily, without milk or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality that is automatically offered: green or black to every guest. [[Ayran]], a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in summer, but does not replace hot tea.

The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West, but wine is comparatively popular for a Muslim nation as Uzbekistan is largely secular. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in [[Samarkand]] (established in 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] dessert wine in Russian). Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to Russia and other countries.

===Sport===

Uzbekistan is home to former racing cyclist [[Djamolidine Abdoujaparov]]. Abdoujaparov has won the [[green jersey]] points contest in the [[Tour de France]] three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/coureur/4976.html |title=Le Tours archive |accessdate=23 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111162430/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/coureur/4976.html |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdoujaparov was a specialist at winning stages in tours or one-day races when the bunch or [[peloton]] would finish together. He would often 'sprint' in the final kilometre and had a reputation as being dangerous in these bunch sprints as he would weave from side to side. This reputation earned him the nickname 'The Terror of Tashkent'.

[[Artur Taymazov]] won Uzbekistan's first wrestling medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympic Games]], as well as three gold medals at the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games|2004]], [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]] and [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]] in Men's 120&amp;nbsp;kg.

[[Ruslan Chagaev]] is a former professional boxer representing Uzbekistan in the WBA. He won the WBA champion title in 2007 after defeating Nikolai Valuev.

Uzbekistan is the home of the International [[Kurash]] Association. Kurash is an internationalized and modernized form of traditional Uzbek wrestling.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan's premier football league is the [[Uzbek League]], which has consisted of 16 teams since 2015. The current champions (2016) are [[Lokomotiv Tashkent]]. [[FC Pakhtakor|Pakhtakor]] holds the record for the most Uzbekistan champion titles, having won the league 10 times. The current [[Uzbekistan Footballer of the Year|Player of the Year]] (2015) is [[Odil Akhmedov]]. Uzbekistan's football clubs regularly participate in the [[AFC Champions League]] and the [[AFC Cup]]. Nasaf won [[2011 AFC Cup|AFC Cup in 2011]], the first international club cup for Uzbek football.

Before Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, the country used to be part of the Soviet Union [[Soviet Union national football team|football]], [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|rugby union]], [[Soviet Union national basketball team|basketball]], [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|ice hockey]], and handball national teams. After independence, Uzbekistan created its own [[Uzbekistan national football team|football]], [[Uzbekistan national rugby union team|rugby union]], [[Uzbekistan national basketball team|basketball]] and [[Uzbekistan national futsal team|futsal]] national teams.

[[Tennis]] is also a very popular sport in Uzbekistan, especially after Uzbekistan's independence in 1991. Uzbekistan has its own Tennis Federation called the "UTF" (Uzbekistan Tennis Federation), created in 2002. Uzbekistan also hosts an International WTA tennis tournament, the "Tashkent Open", held in Uzbekistan's capital city. This tournament has been held since 1999, and is played on outdoor hard courts. The most notable active players from Uzbekistan are [[Denis Istomin]] and [[Akgul Amanmuradova]].

[[Chess]] is quite popular in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan-born [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] was the FIDE World Chess Champion in 2004.

Other popular sports in Uzbekistan include [[basketball]], [[judo]], [[team handball]], [[baseball]], [[taekwondo]], and [[futsal]].
