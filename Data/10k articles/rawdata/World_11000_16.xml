      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37877">'''Agri-Energy Roundtable''' (AER) is a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] and [[non-governmental organization]] accredited by the [[United Nations]] and established in 1980 as a forum for encouraging dialogue on cooperative [[Energy development|energy]] and agricultural development between industrialized and developing nations.  AER conducts international conferences, regional seminars and workshops, [[trade mission]]s and technical assistance for the formation of autonomous indigenous counterpart associations.&lt;ref&gt;Agri-business Council, www.agribusinesscouncil.org/aer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Undertaken as a conference project in mid-1979, the agri-energy concept  evolved into an independent forum following a [[New Orleans]] meeting held February 7–9, 1980 which attracted  business and government leaders from energy-surplus nations.  The first conference benefited from the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]]’s Soviet grain embargo - announced weeks earlier - which created unprecedented congestion at the Port of New Orleans. Undersecretary of Agriculture Dale E. Hathaway keynoted the event which attracted major agricultural interest,&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, Hill &amp; Knowlton, “Ag Undersecretary Hathaway to Discuss Soviet Embargo Regulations at New Orleans Agri-Energy Roundtable”, January 28, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], as well as media exposure nationally. Among the corporate sponsors was the chairman of [[Occidental Petroleum Corporation]]- Dr. [[Armand Hammer]].

AER was formally incorporated in March 1980 by [[Nicholas Everett Hollis]] as a non-profit association. Hollis had conceived organized and conducted the New Orleans conference. and recognized the potential for a forum. Later, AER produced a publication entitled “The Agri-Energy Roundtable 1980- U.S. Agribusiness and the Energy-Rich Nations: Partners for Agricultural Development in the ‘80s”. The document featured themes of trilateral development Hollis had championed while in the [[United States State Department|State Department]] as well as a compilation of papers presented at the conference Hollis also used contacts in the Mid-East to advance the AER and helped organize an [[Egypt]]ian agricultural conference in [[Alexandria]] in July.

==Building a multilateral forum==
Determined to broaden AER's international profile, Hollis mobilized European contacts and began organizing a program in [[Switzerland]] with encouragement from US Senator [[Jennings Randolph]] and Dr. Armand Hammer. These plans were also advanced in the Arab world following a speech before the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce on February 3 in [[Kuwait]].

During AER's [[Geneva]] conference April 27–29 at the [[Intercontinental Hotel]] Senator Randolph presided over a gathering which included  Occidental Petroleum's president A. Robert Abboud, Dr. Satmoko Soedirdjo, [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), Warren Lebeck, president of the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], [[Edgard Pisani]], European Commissioner and member of the Brandt Commission, Chief Alhaji Bamalli, a Nigerian agribusiness leader and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Commerce, “International Group Urges Build-up of Agriculture” , H. Peter Dreyer, April 23, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribune de Geneve, “Dialogue Entre deux forces: L’energie et l’alimentation”, April 23, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribune de Geneve, “Debut de la rencontre internationale sur les resources en energie et en alimentation,” Vyes Magat, April 27, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter Dr. Sakmoko Soedirdjo, head of office of Secretary-General, Organization for     Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to AER secretariat, January 21, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AER Report “Geneva Conference Update- Food and Energy Development- Laying the Groundwork for Cooperation”, Summer/Fall, 1981, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In July AER organized a [[Capitol Hill]] luncheon for Dr. Hammer and Senator Randolph at which more than a dozen senators participated.&lt;ref&gt;AER Report “Geneva Conference Update- Food and Energy Development- Laying the Groundwork for Cooperation”, Summer/Fall, 1981, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year AER conducted meetings for advisory committees in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and Geneva- and hosted a one-day conference on agricultural training with the [[Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies]] (SAIS) in December.

==Further progress==
[[File:Desert Plenary Seesion 1982.jpg|thumb]]
By spring 1982 AER was gathering recognition in the energy-surplus nations, particularly in the [[Middle East]]. The third annual AER held in Geneva May 23–26 produced a breakthrough with [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] minister for agriculture and water Dr. A. Al-Sheikh and Senator Randolph forging a head table dialogue – and a pledge for continued cooperation on agricultural exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Report: Geneva Update: Third Annual Agri-Energy Roundtable, Summer/Fall 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year AER organized a seminar of [[barter]]/counter-trade in [[agriculture]] and formed a subcommittee on these trade finance issues.

In November, AER produced a worldwide mission linked with four independent conferences in Riyadh,&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Economic Report, “Saudi Arabia Farms for Self Sufficiency”, June 4, 1980, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Gazette, “Move to Develop Saudi-US Farm Extension Services”, Randall Palmer, October 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore, Bangkok and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;AER Business Development Mission, Delegates Handbook, Nov.27-Dec. 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The final conference was held at the [[Maui]] Intercontinental, with a keynote speech by [[Robert O. Anderson]], chairman of [[Atlantic Richfield]]&lt;ref&gt;Speech: “How the Dollar Stole Christmas” Robert O. Anderson, chairman , Atlantic Richfield Company, presented before the Asian Pacific Regional Conference of AER, Maui, Hawaii, December 9, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, “Arco Chairman Warns Against Deficit Pitfalls” , Robert Rosenblatt, February 1, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and AER began attracting more corporate sponsors.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Desert Planary Session 1982.jpg|thumb|center|400x274px]] --&gt;

In early February 1983 Senator Randolph hosted another Capitol Hill luncheon with featured speaker Robert O. Anderson discussing the overvalued dollar and its negative impact on U.S. trade to an audience in the Senate Russell building which included [[Paul Volcker]], [[Federal Reserve Board]] chairman, Jacques d. Rosiere, head of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], a number of senators and business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, “Arco Chairman Warns Against Deficit Pitfalls” , Robert Rosenblatt, February 1, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Later, that spring Randolph and Anderson teamed up at the fourth AER (May 23–26) to spark another program success which included representatives from the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) The conference was reported in the [[London Observer]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;The Observer (London) “New Food, Energy Crises Loom” Geoffrey Lean, May 29, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission to China==
Falling oil and commodity prices along with unfavorable economic conditions stymied AER's membership expansion. In late fall Hollis traveled to [[China]] – visiting [[Beijing]] and [[Zhengzhou]] ([[Henan]]). After meetings and tours Hollis negotiated a memorandum of agreement&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of Discussion, (Zhengzhou/Henan Scientific Exchange and Technological Exchange with Foreign Countries and N.E. Hollis, AER, Nov. 3, 1983 (Agreement document for AER Mission to PRC)&lt;/ref&gt; with Henan authorities (November 3) which resulted in an international AER mission and workshop series in China (March 16–24, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Commerce, “China to Host Global Mission, March 16–24”, January 10, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The 24 member AER delegation represented six countries and was led by Gustavo de los Reyes D. president of Rio Yaracuy Ranch [[Venezuela]] (King Ranch). Follow-up PRC representation on the AER board resulted in another AER achievement –[[United Nations]] accreditation (recognition) of AER as a non-governmental organization.&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Report, China Business Development Mission Spring 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
==Agricultural subsidies==
The fifth international AER annual meeting in Geneva (May 27–30) saw Senator Randolph introduce a colleague, US Senator [[Edward Zorinsky]] (D-NE), who challenged the international forum to press [[GATT]] for successful agricultural negotiations and a reduction of European subsidies. Years later the same issues pitting the US, [[Europe]] and the emerging nations would resurface to frustrate trade negotiations, leading to the collapse of the [[Doha Round]] (July 2008)

In June AER attended the UN World Food Council ministerial meetings at [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] as a non-governmental organization representing the private sector. In July AER organized a two-day seminar on agricultural technologies in partnership with the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]] (RASE) at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], July 4–6.&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Report: “Geneva and Stratford-upon-Avon Updates”, Summer 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brochure “Emerging Agricultural Technologies- New Dimensions For Food Security, Stratford-upon-Avon (in cooperation with the Royal Agricultural Society of England), July 4–6, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Hollis used his participation at these annual UK events to solidify high level industry support throughout the [[Commonwealth]].

AER primary sponsors in the UK&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman National Coal Board to N.E. Hollis, AER January. 31, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; included [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) plc, [[Taylor Woodrow]]  plc,., [[Paterson-Zochonis]], [[Prudential Bache|Prudential Bache Trading]], Universal Leaf Tobacco and others. Sir [[Ian MacGregor]], chairman of the [[National Coal Board]] and Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]’s chief industrial advisor, was instrumental in generating support for AER in the UK  MacGregor had been a close Hollis ally as a founding member of the US-European Business Council at the [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] conference of March 1972.

During this same period the subcommittee on counter-trade began meeting in [[London]] under the chairmanship of Andreas Calice of Prudential-Bache Trading in response to the recognition that debt was choking trade with much of the [[Third World]].
==West African outreach==
In late 1984 Hollis was invited to visit [[Nigeria]] at the inspiration of several sponsors who had hoped to organize an African regional conference in [[Lagos]]. This effort was pursued for eighteen months but was suspended when it was determined that local sponsors could not assure a conference success. The campaign did spark interest in establishing an indigenously supported counterpart Agri-Energy Roundtable/Nigeria.

==Competition for public funding==
Shortly after retiring his Senate seat, Jennings Randolph assumed the chairmanship of AER and visited AID Administrator [[M. Peter McPherson]] to request program assistance to enable the Roundtable to develop its task force and subcommittee activities for more substantive focus in various agro-food processing, distribution, technology and finance sectors. This approach would have insured greater private sector participation as well which appealed to the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter -Michael Deaver, Assistant to the President (Reagan) to Senator Jennings Randolph, September 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as the AID interest in the proposal seemed to gel, a reorganization at the [[White House]] undercut higher level encouragement at a critical juncture and  AID's Bureau for Science and Technology (S&amp;T) itself underwent a sharp downsizing- which effectively left AER's proposal shelved and unnoticed. It is worth noting that AID was under pressure to terminate its ongoing support for a [[USDA]] backed group called the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee (JACC) after internal reviews cited poor performance and other issues. JACC was considered competitive with AER.

AER staff pulled out of the quicksand of AID meetings and produced a Sixth annual International Agriculture Forum in Geneva, June 2–5, 1985. Senator Randolph introduced [[James Ingram]], executive director of the [[World Food Programme]] and presided over a gathering which featured representations from nearly forty countries. A letter from President Reagan was read to the conferees.&lt;ref&gt;Letter- President Ronald Reagan to AER delegates, Sixth Annual IAF, May 26, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; AER opened a Geneva office, staffed by Carl Bjertnes and Brooks Ford.

==Participation at UN World Food Council Meetings==
AER fielded a small delegation to represent private enterprise at the UN World Food Council ministerial conference in [[Paris]] (June 10–13) led by Gustavo de los Reyes. AER celebrated its new status as an officially accredited non-governmental organization before the United Nations.

Following these meetings, Hollis met with [[James Callaghan]], former UK prime minister at the [[Royal Show]] and Callaghan agreed to help advance AER in the Commonwealth. Callaghan had been familiar with AER through [[Henry Walston, Baron Walston|Lord Walston]], a former Labour minister for development and one of the UK's leading agriculturalists.

==Self-help Solutions for Africa’s Food Security==

AER continued its campaign for the private sector, self-help solutions in Africa- as contrasted with famine relief programs of [[Bob Geldof]] which captured the public imagination with video and musical appeals linked with the Ethiopian tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Farming News, Skill is Still the Best Form of AID”, Anthony Rosen, June 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; However AER had difficulty finding a suitable base from which to launch an  African operation.

Nonetheless, in September 1985 AER hosted a Washington seminar on Africa and later Hollis revisited Nigeria where a workshop was conducted in Lagos aimed at mobilizing broader support for a West African regional conference. [[Texaco]]’s director on the AER board, Jean Poupeau- had pioneered a [[cassava]] farm demonstrating how a multinational oil company could contribute directly to a nation’s [[food security]]- by using its gas station network to distribute basic foodstuffs.(See TexAgri, Ltd)  Later that year AER’s Hollis was invited  by U.S. Representative [[Mickey Leland]] (D-Texas) to serve as an advisor to the House Select Committee on Hunger.

In the spring of 1986 AER began suffering a serious subscription/dues decline triggered by declining commodity prices, the retirement of key corporate supporters, and competitive forces led by [[Orville Freeman]]’s JACC. Although JACC collapsed in mid-1986, Freeman joined the Agriculture Council of America (ACA) from which he launched more broadsides. Significantly, a key ACA contributor was Freeman’s old friend, [[Dwayne Andreas]], chairman of [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM). ADM had been a contributing sponsor to AER but expressed dissatisfaction over AER’s refusal to actively promote [[ethanol]] and withdrew its support.

==International program momentum==
AER’s international programming continued to generate momentum overseas. AER pursued public funding after receiving an invitation from Philippine Agriculture Minister [[Ramon Mitra, Jr.|Ramon Mitra]] to organize a conference in [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Report: Philippine Government Invites AER Mission/Conference, Summer/Fall 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter- Ramon V. Mitra, Minister of Agriculture and Food/Philippines to N.E. Hollis, AER, June 3, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; At the Seventh annual International Agriculture Forum in Geneva (May 25–28) three agriculture ministers participated ([[Turkey]], [[Jordan]] and [[the Gambia]]) with [[Eugene Whelan|Honorable Eugene F. Whelan]], former Canadian minister of agriculture and president of the UN World Food Council, and Lord Harry Walston of the UK House of Lords also on the program. ”.

Organizationally, the AER board of directors and committee of honor gathered cohesion around Senator Randolph while other subcommittees similar in structure to the counter-trade/finance subgroup began to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;Countertade Outlook, Vol. VIII, No. 23, July 17, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A strong outreach aimed at attracting Soviet high-level AER participation orchestrated from ICI and the US Embassy in [[Moscow]] produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;Letter- Curtis W. Kamman, Charge d’Affaires, US Embassy Moscow to Hon. Jennings Randolph, AER, April 23, 1985 ( Re: Soviet participation in AER)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine initiative broadens to ASEAN and South Asia==
In the summer AER was invited by Philippine Ambassador [[Emmanuel Pelaez]] (former vice president under [[Ferdinand Marcos]]) to organize an  agribusiness program during the state visit of newly inaugurated Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]] to Washington in September. This program at the Madison Hotel was accomplished so successfully that Agriculture Minister Ramon Mitra invited AER staff to visit Manila and organize an [[ASEAN]] wide conference featuring Philippine agro-industry investment potentials. Hollis traveled to Manila in October and secured pledges from [[USAID]]/[[Philippines]] to provide seed grant funding for the conference. On this trip Hollis also visited [[Hong Kong]] and [[India]] and began discussions aimed at starting an AER counterpart association in Bombay ([[Mumbai]]).

Early in 1987 AER received a request from the chairman of a competitive association – The Agribusiness Council (ABC)—to form an alliance, The [[New York City|New York]] based ABC wanted a Washington presence and more international programming scope. After protracted negotiations and board approvals, a management services agreement was worked out whereby AER would assume day-to-day staff management of the Council which became a de facto U.S. affiliate of the international AER network.

AER overcame a funding logjam (working with Vice President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush's]] intervention) and proceeded to organize a  conference at the [[Manila Hotel]] (May 24–27).&lt;ref&gt;Manila Standard (Editorial) “A Meaningful Conference” Celso Al-Carunungan,  May 25, 1987 (Manila, Philippines)&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the formation of an indigenous, free-standing AER/Filpinas – the first international affiliate of AER under the elected leadership of [[Celso Al. Carunungan]].

==A passage to India==
AER‘s delegation then proceeded to Hong Kong and Mumbai where large meetings were conducted with local organizers interested in forming counterpart associations. In Mumbai, more than 100 Indian business leaders and local politicians turned out. The AER/India&lt;ref&gt;- K.L.Khanna, AER/India to Delegates Mumbai Conference, May 19, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated on May 29, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Times of India, Agri-Energy Roundtable, May 31, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cable -UNCLAS Bombay 2674, “Agri-Energy Roundtable Makes Impressive Debut in India” June 3, 1987 (From AmConsul to SecState, copies to other posts)&lt;/ref&gt;

AER's Eighth Annual International Agriculture Forum (IAF) in Geneva (June 1–3, 1987) was chaired by Jennings Randolph- his seventh consecutive. Other country groups at the IAF were provided “starter kits” for association building and two new vice chairmen from [[Canada]] and the Gambia assisted Senator Randolph in conducting the conference.

==Forging new cooperation==
In the fall AER began negotiating two agreements with AID and finalized terms of the alliance with the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, “Two Agribusiness Groups Team Up to Increase Clout”, M.B. Christie , November 16, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; A board of directors meeting for ABC was organized on December 9 and the legal instruments were transferred from New York. At this meeting Hollis was elected president of the ABC. One of the AID grant contracts offered the promise of modest funding to accelerate training for AER counterpart association development in selected emerging countries over a three-year timeframe – with the potential for increases based on performance&lt;ref&gt;Cable-UNCLAS STATE 342248 Re: Follow-Up Ideas: LDC Participants Attending 8th Annual International Agriculture Forum, June 1–3, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the year AER accepted an invitation to visit the [[Persian Gulf]] for the purpose of organizing a regional Roundtable. Hollis also visited India and the Philippines conducting board meetings and briefing the counterpart groups at each stop.

In March AER partnered with a new sponsor, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) Office of Biomass and launched a special Subcommittee on Renewable Energy Technology. The two-day event at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] was chaired by John Shields of the TVA and included representatives of two dozen leading  companies interested in [[renewable energy]] from solar, wind, geothermal, [[biomass]] and others primarily in relation to agriculture.  Enthusiasm dropped a few weeks later when Shields resigned, claiming budget cuts would downsize TVA's commitment to biomass energy.

==High Tide for Agri-Energy Roundtable==
The Ninth Annual International Agriculture Forum (June 5–8)&lt;ref&gt;Tribune de Geneve, “L’Agro-Business se met a table” Daniel Wermus, April 25, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; attracted a Mideast and African attendance led by Saudi Arabian Minister of Agriculture Al-Sheikh. Three other ministers attended and AER hosted an event in their honor with a steamboat cruise on [[Lake Leman]]. AER Vice chairman Eugene Whelan (Canada) and Saihou Sabally (Gambia) co-chaired the conference. Delegations from AER counterpart associations, including India, [[Kenya]] and the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]- added a new dynamism to the proceedings&lt;ref&gt;African Agriculture Magazine, “Caution Sounded Over Untimely Privatization”, August 1988, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official interest at AID was growing, centering on the AER counterpart association development and training program.&lt;ref&gt;Tribune de Geneve, “L’Agro-Business se met a table” Daniel Wermus, April 25, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; AID departments and USAID missions pressed to accelerate the process and/or “buy-in” with programs tailored to their agri-enterprise settings.  In mid August AER met in London to finalize plans for the Gulf regional conference in UAE and to conduct meetings with the London-based non-conventional finance subgroup. Plans were announced for the formation of a new sub-group on transport/distribution related to agro-food systems.

In October AER combined with ABC to host a conference in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on the effects of the great North American [[drought]] on U.S. agricultural reliability and the transportation system. One of the sessions on high technology in agriculture attracted such interest that participating AID and USDA officials pledged funding for a sequel to be conducted by ABC on the more specialized theme of non-feed industrial uses for agriculture, [[biotechnology]] and other related themes. The proposed conference theme was “The Agro-Industrial Revolution”.

==Dire straits: Gulf Agro-Industrial Roundtable at Khorfakkan/UAE==
In 1989 conducted two conference events in the Persian Gulf ([[Bahrain]] and UAE) in early February.&lt;ref&gt;Letter- John W. Limbert, Consul General, AmConsulate Dubai, UAE to H.E. Shaikh Faisal bin Khalid al Qassemi, Director, Emiri Court/Sharjah, February 11, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings received international participation and support, particularly from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Report- “Gulf Roundtable Highlights Food Security Issues and Agri-Business Opportunities”, Spring 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A paper was presented by a UN official from [[Baghdad]] calling for Pan-Arab food security cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Speech- Dr. Mahmoud Sherif, UN Economic &amp; Social Commission/West Asia Baghdad, Iraq, “Regional Food Security: Workable Vision or Impossible Dream?” (Before the AER Gulf Regional Transshipment Conference, Khorfakkan/UAE)&lt;/ref&gt;

AER conducted meetings in [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and the Philippines adding to momentum generated before the Gulf conference with a workshop in Manila on Agrarian Land Reform (February 2) at the Manila Garden Hotel.

==Barnstorming for food security==
Throughout the remainder of the spring AER expanded its program horizons: 
* in the [[Caribbean]] ([[Jamaica]] and [[Dominican Republic]]), 
* in Europe (planning for the Tenth Annual International Agriculture Forum in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], 
* by attending the World Food Council ministerial conference in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where AER conducted a parallel workshop for Egyptian agro-enterprise professionals interested in establishing an affiliated counterpart association, 
* in East Africa ([[Nairobi]]) providing ideas/training for the local Kenyan start-up. 
* and in Zimbabwe where Hollis addressed the Ninth [[UNIDO]] African Industry Ministers Conference.&lt;ref&gt;UNIDO Ninth African Ministers’ of Industry Conference, Harare, Zimbabwe Remarks on Agri-Energy Roundtable, N.E. Hollis, June 2, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

At home ABC's agenda was advanced via meetings with its planning and Washington advisory committees. The aim was to consolidate and rehabilitate ABC using the organization of a large conference on new agricultural technologies. The idea had sprouted during the St. Louis conference and hinged on a grant pledge which AID's S&amp;T Bureau had dangled.

In July Hollis resumed travels to [[New Delhi]], conducting a workshop at the [[Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts|Oberoi Hotel]] with Indian business leaders, including Lala Bansidhar of DCM, S.K. Birla of Birla Industries and others (July 6). Hollis also briefed political leaders including [[Najma Heptulla]] and the Speaker of India's Parliament [[Bal Ram Jakhar]]. The aim was to jump start AER/India which had languished under weak leadership in Mumbai with an All-India format.

Hollis also visited [[Colombo]] for talks on sparking a counterpart association in [[Sri Lanka]] with allies developed via previous Geneva conferences. A key element was the potential USAID use of local currencies generated from the sale of US commodities under the [[Food for Peace]] program (described in a White House encouragement cable on November 3, 1987- see UNCLAS State 342248)

Growing AER recognition with international donor agencies was signaled with an invitation to [[UNDP]]’s African Leadership Forum at [[Olusegun Obasanjo|General Obasanjo’s]] farm in [[Ota, Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter- General Olusegun Obasanjo, chairman, African Leadership Forum to N.E. Hollis, AER, June 29, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Hollis and several AER African directors participated in this conference on West African agriculture . During the visit a workshop was conducted at the Lagos Sheraton Hotel for AER/Nigeria development and the overall African program was discussed with former US President Jimmy Carter. As a follow-up UNDP circulated a worldwide cable to its regional offices encouraging support for the agro-enterprise association concept.&lt;ref&gt;Cable, UNDP/DGIP No. 261 to Selected Missions, September 25, 1989 (Tim Rothermel) Re: UNDP Travel Support Vienna AER delegates
&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:AER-Jimmy Carter at Lagos, July 1989.jpg|400px]]

==Opening to the East: Tenth Annual Meeting in Vienna- October 1989==
AER’s Tenth Annual International Agriculture Form  (October 8–11) in Vienna, Austria opened new doors for program expansion to [[Eastern Europe]] with strong delegations from [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;58.	Business America, “Agro-Industry Experts Meet in Budapest and Vienna”, (Department of Commerce), December 4, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; AER counterpart groups in formation, most notably from Kenya, Uganda and the Gambia, also field good groups. Over thirty five countries were represented and AER received the “Green Oman” award from the [[Sultanate of Oman]] in recognition of AER's recent contributions to regional food security and trade development in the Gulf region.

Following the Vienna meetings, AER senior director Gustavo de los Reyes led a 14-member delegation to [[Budapest]], Hungary for two days of talks and field visits hosted by the Hungarian Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The Vienna conference also produced an invitation from the Polish Government to visit and organize an international roundtable in [[Warsaw]].

==AER and the Counterpart Association Projects==
Over the next five years AER concentrated its program momentum with Eastern Europe and [[East Africa]] developing programs, conferences and in-country training for counterpart association development. In November 1991 AER/Uganda was inaugurated at a conference sponsored by AER and local organizers. Uganda's vice president Dr. [[Samson Kisekka]] and several ministers presided at this conference at the Kampala Sheraton including Dr. S. Wandira Kazibwe, Minister of Women's Affairs, Youth and Culture and Mrs. [[Victoria Sekitoleko]], Minister of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;The New Vision, “Dr, Kisekka Inaugurates Agri-Energy Roundtable”, Dec. 3, 1991(Kampala, Uganda)&lt;/ref&gt; As news of this program success rippled across Africa, other country organizers became encouraged to study the AER model – including [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], Ethiopia and [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter- [[Ahmed Diraige]] (Former governor, Darfur/Sudan) to Andrew S.Natsios Assistant Administrator/AID/FHA , April 8, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Kampala Conference.jpg|thumb|center|400x274px|East Africa/Kampala Conference: Uganda Vice President Kisekka Opens Sessions of AER/Uganda at Kampala Sheraton November 25, 1991.Sources: Agri-Energy Roundtable]] --&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Despite AER's successes on the international front, leadership transition issues and interference directed at its US affiliate- the Agribusiness Council (ABC)- traced to rival domestic agricultural interests- created sufficient doubt to enable opponents in AID to terminate a number of key grant contracts in mid-1992 (after reinstating ABC/AER following some initial confusion in early 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum: Jerre Manarolla, AID/FHA/PPM to Phil Christensen, AA/FVA “Recent Progress with the Agri-Energy Roundtable”, December 5, 1989 (w/att.)&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional supporters of ABC/AER forced an inquiry which resulted in the abrupt termination/redirection of several AID/USDA careers,&lt;ref&gt;Letter- US Senator Robert C. Byrd, Senate Appropriations Committee to Phil Christensen, Assistant Administrator/AID, Re; AER Support, January 12, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter- Jan Miller, AID/General Counsel office to Betsy Amin-Arsala, Winrock International, February 21, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter- James A. Hafner, University of Massachusetts to US Senator Edward Kennedy, March 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter- US Representative Harley O. Staggers to  Ray Randlett, AA/AID Legislative Affairs, March 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; but after the smoke cleared several years later, AER watched its contract support dry up. The effect of this truncation left numerous AER organizational efforts and potentially supportive USAID missions in the lurch.&lt;ref&gt;Letter- Andrew S. Natsios, Assistant Administrator/AID/FHA to N.E. Hollis, AER May 21, 1992 (Declining further AID support due to bureaucratic shifts)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agri-Energy Africa Bulletin, Winter/Spring 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Agriculture , “Aspects of the Agriculture and Energy Relationship”, N.E.Hollis, (May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Letter- Ahmed Diraige (Former governor, Darfur/Sudan) to Andrew S.Natsios Assistant Administrator/AID/FHA , April 8, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press Release – Caribbean Agricultural Communications Services, Ltd. “New Agro-Industry Link for Jamaica Formed”, April 28, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; AER's track record for assisting in the creation of agricultural associations, themselves seen as key barometers of societal health, seemed to demand more official support. Thus the government's posture became particularly troubling.&lt;ref&gt;Letter-US Senator Mark O. Hatfield to Mark Edelman, Act’g Administrator, AID, March 8, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business America, “Agribusiness Mission Assesses Opportunities and Needs in Poland”, May 7, 1990, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; For example, AER's visit to Moscow and the conduct of a workshop with interested Soviet Republics in September 1990, triggered a series of requests from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia SSR]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]]. Without timely government support for follow-up training and visits these feelers were allowed to wither.

==The Poland Agribusiness Association Project (1990-1995)==
Notable exceptions to the AID political decision to cut support for AER – and ABC- came with program successes in Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;Cable- UNCLAS Kingston 04775 to SecState, “Agri-Energy Roundtable – AER/Jamaica Workshop Success”, May 15, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Poland and later, Sri Lanka where independent counterpart associations modeled after AER emerged in the nineties following Hollis visits. The most dramatic breakthrough project occurred in late 1994 in Poland, where Hollis and an ABC team traveled and campaigned around the country in some fifteen towns and cities&lt;ref&gt;Nova Europa “American Advisor Says Polish Agribusiness Council is going to be Established”, (Warsaw) December 7, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a formation conference for the Polish Agribusiness Association in March 1995 at the Forum Hotel in Warsaw. This success capped a five-year effort beginning with an AER mission to Warsaw in March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Business America, “Agribusiness Mission Assesses Opportunities and Needs in Poland”, May 7, 1990, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The USAID mission in Poland provided low-key logistical support, but no funding for the newly established Polish association.

Eventually PAA turned to Europe's funding agency for agriculture ([[European Union#Agriculture|FAPA]]) for support. For its part, USDA coordinated an aggressive effort –both from Washington and Warsaw, to undercut the Polish program, and later utilized the threat of withholding agricultural support services to the US Embassy in [[Vilnius]] in a separate campaign to suffocate interest in an initiative aimed at forming an agribusiness association in Lithuania (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Memo, US-Lithuaniam, Bilateral Working Group April 6, 2000 Vilnius EU/NB talking points "Agribusiness Councils" April 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Protocol Memo, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, Alan Larson to H.E Algirdas Rimkunas Deputy Minister Foreign Affairs/Lithuaniam May 31, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electronic mail, Matthew Christ/US Embassy Vilnius to State/Baltic Affairs Office Re: NGO Proposal, November 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
USG agencies, including USAID, USDA and the Department of State, also continued to request ABC proposals for planned agribusiness association development, formatted around the AER model, particularly in Indonesia,  Ukraine, Lithuania, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bulgaria]],  – but these government initiatives were not sustained. More recently, US government proxy groups have sought to enlist ABC for training and/or briefings for incoming agricultural groups many of which apparently have requested ABC involvement in their visit planning.(i.e. Azerbaijan(Ganja)Agribusiness Association- March 2003, Albania Agribusiness Council-October 2003,Georgian Agribusiness Association Workshop- January 2015,Eurasian Agribusiness Association Seminar- March 2015). Despite periodic letters from leading US Senators to top AID administrators encouraging a resumption of  AER support, especially in Africa, AID management have sidestepped all requests.&lt;ref&gt;Letter- US Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-AZ) to J. Brian Atwood, Administrator AID, July 21, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter: US Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) to Administrator AID J. Brian Atwood, June 7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, “Remembering a Citizen of the World” Lagos, Nigeria May 8, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

AER continues to function as a clearinghouse for ag/energy information dissemination and provides support for the affiliated counterpart network. AER has relied on private support for almost twenty years.  Memoranda and reports are circulated following important events with agricultural significance such as the 2008 collapse of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) Doha Round talks due to intransigence surrounding ethanol and [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (AP) “US Farmers Disappointed at Failed WTO Talks”, Christopher Leonard, July 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; AER also monitors UN FAO activities in pursuing the action plan agreed at the 1996 World Food Security Summit in [[Rome]]-(AER attended and spoke before the non-governmental organization conference linked with the Summit).&lt;ref&gt;Memo: N.E. Hollis AER to AER Directors, “The Quest for World Food Security: The World Food Summit- A Report from Rome”, November 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BDWM Transport''' is a transport company in [[Switzerland]], which operates regional rail and bus services in the cantons of [[Canton of Aargau|Aargau]] and [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]]. The company was formed in 2000 by the merger of the [[Bremgarten–Dietikon railway]] (BD) and {{ill|Wohlen–Meisterschwanden railway|de}} (WM) companies.&lt;ref name=unt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdwm.ch/unternehmen |title=Unternehmen Wissenswertes und Stellenangebote |trans-title=Companies to know and Careers |publisher=BWDM Transport |accessdate=2014-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001717/http://bdwm.ch/unternehmen |archivedate=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company operates:&lt;ref name=unt/&gt;
* The [[Bremgarten–Dietikon railway line]] (line S17 of the [[Zürich S-Bahn]])
* The Wohlen–Meisterschwanden bus service
* The SBB bus Zofingen / Reiden
* The express bus Bremgarten / Busslingen–Zurich Enge
* The Limmat Bus AG

In May 2016 it was announced that the [[Limmattal light rail line]], to be constructed in the densely populated [[Limmattal]] area to the west of [[Zürich]], would be operated by BDWM. The line will connect [[Killwangen]], [[Spreitenbach]], [[Dietikon]], [[Urdorf]] and [[Schlieren, Zurich|Schlieren]] to [[Zürich-Altstetten railway station]], with connection to the Bremgarten–Dietikon line at Dietikon and to [[Zürich tram route 2]] at ''Farbhof''. Construction is scheduled to start in late 2017, with a planned opening in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limmattalbahn.ch/|title=Limmattalbahn - Ein Projekt des Zürcher Verkehrsbundes ZVV und des Kantons Aargau| last= |first= |date= |website=www.limmattalbahn.ch |publisher= |language=de| access-date=2016-12-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204095223/http://www.limmattalbahn.ch/ |archivedate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186 |first1=Stefan |last1=Hotz |first2=André |last2=Müller |title=Nur das Limmattal selbst stimmt gegen «sein» neues Tram |language=German |trans-title=Only the Limmattal itself voted against "its" new tram |work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405 |first=Corsin |last=Zander |title=Aargauer betreiben Zürcher Limmattalbahn |language=German |trans-title=Aargau company to operate Zürcher Limmattalbahn |work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">The '''Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat''' ({{lang-ar|بنو بكر}}) were an Arabian tribe of the [[Hejaz]] region,Bani Bakr bin Abd Manat bin Kenana bin Khuzaymah bin Mdarka bin Elias bin Mudar bin Nizar bin Ma'ad bin Adnan, one of the most famous tribe of the Kenana tribes in the pre-Islamic era and Islam was issued during the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphate, and is one of the largest Arab tribes number. They are the cousins ​​of the Quraish tribe of the Prophet Muhammad and were competing with their cousins ​​Quraysh for honor and the sovereignty of Mecca.

Bakr was named after his grandfather by his mother Bakr ibn Wael, since his mother is Hind bint Bakr ibn Wael.

During [[tribes of Arabia during Muhammad's era|Muhammad's lifetime]], they were allies of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] of Mecca.

In 630, their attack against [[Banu Khuza'a]], who had recently become allies of [[Muhammad]], violated the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyya]] of 628, which led to the [[conquest of Mecca]] by the Muslim armies, which occurred without battle.

They are distinct from the similarly named, but more famous tribe of [[Bakr ibn Wa'il]].

Bakr bin Abdul Manat is divided into old tribes, most famously:

1)[[Banu Damrah]]
2)Banu Du’al
3)Banu Laith
4)Banu Areej

'''Battle of Kaukaba''' was a skirmish that took place on May 9, 1978 when [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] soldiers attacked Norwegian peacekeepers. The battle took place only a few days after the first Norwegian troops arrived in Lebanon.

The skirmish is regarded as one of the hardest battles fought by Norwegian soldiers in the [[UNIFIL]] force, and the PLO soldiers got as close as 30 meters. Throughout the skirmish, the Norwegians fired about 200 machinegun shots, 50 shots from automatic weapons and two [[Carl Gustav RFK]] grenades. The PLO fired about ten times more shots from hand weapons, as well as eight gun grenades. Eventually the PLO gave up, and pledged not to fire at the Norwegians again. One Norwegian  suffered light injuries during the attack. Official PLO casualties were one dead and one wounded. The Norwegian soldiers believed the real number of Palestinians dead to be closer to eight.

'''"Boom Boom Boomerang"''' was the [[Austria]]n representative in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977]], performed in [[German Language|German]] (with some lyrics in [[English Language|English]]) by {{Interlanguage link|Schmetterlinge (band)|lt=Schmetterlinge|WD=Q2246135}}. (A different song with that title was a 1955 U.S. hit for the DeCastro Sisters.)

The song was performed fourth on the night, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Heddy Lester]] with "[[De mallemolen]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Anita Skorgan]] with "[[Casanova (Anita Skorgan song)|Casanova]]". At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 17th in a field of 18.

The song is one of the more controversial entries in Contest history, as it is the first to send the entire event up. The chorus, for example, features the nonsense lyrics of:

''Boom boom boomerang, snadderydang''&lt;br&gt;
''Kangaroo, boogaloo, didgeridoo''&lt;br&gt;
''Ding dong, sing the song, hear the guitar twang''&lt;br&gt;
''Kojak, hijack, me and you''

The performance is also memorable, as the band featured four male singers wearing cream suits and red shirts. During the performance, the men would turn their backs to the audience at various points, revealing a costume which looked like the front of a tuxedo, complete with a fake face. A performance like this had not previously been seen at the Contest, although it would not be the last time that Austria would be represented so irreverently, with [[Alf Poier]] doing similar at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 Contest]] with "[[Weil der Mensch zählt]]".

The song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 Contest]] by [[Springtime (band)|Springtime]], performing "[[Mrs. Caroline Robinson]]".

The '''Cantabrians''' ([[Cantabrian dialect|Cantabrian]] and {{lang-es|cántabros}}) are a native ethnic group who constitute the native inhabitants living in the [[region]] of [[Cantabria]], in northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;"Even today, Cantabrians (the Pasiego included, Lebaniegos excluded), at the North of Spain, seem to be a genetically well differentiated community, as deduced from uniparental and autosomal markers, perhaps to a higher degree than their neighbours, the Basques". http://grupos.unican.es/acanto/aep/bolpas/Ann-Hum-Genet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are referred to as ''"montañeses"'' (meaning ''Highlanders''). The traditional dialects in this region, known as [[Cantabrian dialect|''Cantabru'' or ''Montañés'']], are related to the [[Astur-Leonese languages]].

'''Clique''' is a brand of [[vodka]].

{{Culture of Burundi}}

[[Burundi]] is situated in [[East Africa]] and has a territory full of [[mountain]]s, [[savanna]]s and agricultural fields, with forests in the surrounding of rivers and waters. [[Agriculture]] is spread on 80% of the country's surface and it especially includes [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[corn]], [[bean]]s and [[manioc]]. Due to these characteristics, the Burundi cuisine is very representative of the African culinary culture, as it includes [[bean]]s, which are the staple of Burundi cooking, exotic fruits (mainly [[banana]]s) [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[cassava]], [[pea]]s, [[maize]] and [[cereal]]s, like corn and [[wheat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/africa/burundi/food-and-drink/ |title=Burundi Food and Drink}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Profiterole]]s are also sometimes enjoyed as a rare delicacy. Not much [[meat]] is consumed in Burundi, because [[animal breeding]] is a secondary occupation; still, there are some dishes that include [[goat]] and [[sheep]] meat but [[cow]]s are very sacred.

A major aspect when discussing Burundian cuisine is based on the economic conditions of the country: the Burundian people usually eat homemade food, from homemade vessels also used for drinking, carrying water and storing [[grain]].

'''Duborg-Skolen''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] secondary school undenominational school with gymnasial extension located in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]]. It is one of a number of schools operated by members of the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig]], and it is the leading school for this community.

The school teaches both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[German language|German]] on a native-speaker level. All other topics are instructed in Danish.

Duborg-Skolen was established in 1924 as a Danish ''[[Realschule|realskole]]'' and in 1958 it was recognized as a ''undenominational school'' with gymnasial extension. The curriculum enables its students to continue education in both Germany and Denmark.

Its buildings are located in the Flensburg district of Duburg (Danish: ''Duborg''), hence the name, and operated by the [[Dansk Skoleforening for Sydslesvig]] (''Danish School Association for Southern Schleswig'')

Melomakarona, another type of Greek cookie dessert, is made with the same ingredients, but after baking, is dipped into a syrup mixture consisting of sugar, honey, water, orange zest, and cloves. Then it is rolled in the ground walnut, sugar and cinnamon mixture.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

The '''flag of the European Coal and Steel Community''' was a horizontal bicolour flag defaced with stars which represented the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) between 1958 (six years after the ECSC was founded) until 2002 when the Community was merged into the [[European Union]] (EU). Prior to 1958 the ECSC did not have a flag, and no other flag has been used by a historical part of the [[European Union]] other than the [[flag of Europe]].

==Design==
The flag consisted of two horizontal stripes, blue on the top and black on the bottom. Black stood for coal while the blue stood for steel, the two resources the community managed. There were a number of gold, later white, [[star]]s equivalent to the number of [[Member State of the European Union|states]] belonging to the community (until 1986, when the number was frozen at twelve). These stars were equally divided between each strip, aligned close to the centre border (if there were an odd number of stars, then the smaller number would be on the top stripe.&lt;ref name="FOTW ECSC"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)|publisher=Flags Of The World|date=28 October 2004|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu-ecsc.html|accessdate=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The flag was first unveiled at the [[Expo '58|1958 Exposition]] in [[Brussels]], seven years after the establishment of the Community.&lt;ref name="FOTW ECSC"/&gt; At the Expo, its rivalling flag, the flag of Europe, was also on one of its first public displays.

The number of stars began at six and increased with the membership of the Community until 1986 when it reached twelve. After this it was decided not to increase the number of stars to reflect the new members joining in the 1990s. This kept it inline with the [[flag of Europe]] (used by its sister organisations) which displayed twelve stars representing perfection and unity.

The Treaty of Paris setting up the ECSC expired on 23 July 2002 and the ECSC ceased to exist. On this day the ECSC flag outside the [[European Commission]] in [[Brussels]] was lowered for the final time by [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Romano Prodi]] and replaced with the EU flag.&lt;ref name="FOTW ECSC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_ecsc_flag_1986_2002-en-d3f3644b-131b-4ef9-9b8b-8b40072db1c8.html The ECSC flag 1986–2002], CVCE (Centre for European Studies) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_ecsc_flag_1978-en-02b2a5e9-0ed5-481a-9416-0753535b41a9.html The ECSC flag 1978], CVCE (Centre for European Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

One original copy of the flag of the ECSC with 12 stars is exposed in the office of the President of the [[European University Institute]] in Florence, Prof. [[Joseph H.H. Weiler|J. H.H. Weiler]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1263">The '''Fourth All Russian Conference of Trade Unions''' took place 12–17 March 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (1968) p202&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolshevik, [[Mikhail Tomsky]], proposed the resolution concerning the ''Relations between the Trade Unions and the [[People's Commissariat for Labour|Commissariat for Labour]]'' which stated that the October revolution had changed  "the meaning and character of state organs and significance of proletarian organs as well". It was elaborated that previously the old ministry of Labour had acted as arbitrator between [[Labour (economics)|Labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|Capital]], whereas the new Commissariat was the champion of the economic policy of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (1968) p 214&lt;/ref&gt; Paragraph 9 of this resolution, which was adopted, removed labour relations from the purview of the [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s to that of the Commissariat for Labour, which was controlled by the Bolshevik [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]

The '''Hargeisa Provincial Museum''' ('''HPM''') was established in 1977 in [[Hargeisa]], situated in the northwestern [[Woqooyi Galbeed]] province in [[Somalia]]. It was the first museum to be established in the country since independence in 1960.&lt;ref name="mi1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0033.1986.tb00633.x|title=The Provincial Museum of Hargeisa|author=Cobelj, Stefanja|work=Museum International|date=April 24, 2009|volume=38|pages=150–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
In the mid-1970s, a strong cultural movement arose in [[Hargeisa]]. This movement was the driving force behind the establishment of the museum. The museum was a part of a cultural center in the city that consisted of a theater, a library and a provincial museum. The building consisted of two concentric rings with a meeting area and temporary exhibit room. The circular building in the center was inspired by the "mundul" witch is a traditional hut used by [[Somali people|Somali]] farmers. The museum was 650 m² large and was designed and built by a local contractor, Osman Dahir Adan.&lt;ref name="unescorap1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000787/078773eo.pdf|title=Museum development and monuments conservation: Somalia|author=Crespo-Toral, H.|work=[[UNESCO]]|year=1988|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3336446|title=The Hargeisa Provincial Museum|author=McMahon, Kathryn|work=African Arts|date=May 1988|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
When the museum was opened in 1977, it had an ethnographic exhibition, most of the parts for which had been donated by the residents of Hargeisa. The items where displayed in two 20 meters long cabinets without any glass, one in each of the halls. There were only two attendants, the gardener and a cleaning woman and both the collection and building soon started to deteriorate. Renovating was started in 1981. The two large showcases where dismantled and 23 smaller cases with glass were built. Netting was installed in front of the windows, the building repainted and the collection was cleaned. Original it had been around 4,000 items on display. However, the new exhibition was reduced to around 1.400 items, with the rest was put into storage. A special display was made for firearms used by [[Sayyid]] [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and his men between 1901 and 1921.&lt;ref name="aa1"/&gt;

==Destruction==
The museum was completely destroyed by the civil war in 1988.

==Reconstruction==
Reconstruction is taking place on the building and is set to be completed in 2012.

In the '''Kindu rail accident''' on November 29, 2005, at least 60 people were killed on the [[Vicicongo line]] when they were swept off the roof of a train into the river below as the train crossed a bridge in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. After speaking with local officials in his region, Koloso Sumaili, the governor of [[Maniema]] province, says it seemed there were over 60 dead in this accident. He said the accident happened  around {{convert|200|km|mi}} south of the town of [[Kindu]], as the train travelled towards the southern town of [[Lubumbashi]]. "Trains that travel on that line have lots of people and goods on the roof. When the train was crossing over a bridge, the beams supporting the bridge swept people and goods off the train and into the river below," he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-11-30/dozens-killed-in-train-accident-in-dr-congo/751292&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magicworld''' is a general entertainment channel produced for [[Dstv]] by [[MNET Series]].

==History==
When Mnet's Open Time Prime Time block was closed they sought a new service to keep viewership of the popular programs in the block up. To do this they would need to be affordable to all families in order to do this. [[Dstv]] wanted to launch a scaled down package for low income households for the cost of R19.00. The second half of open time was kept for this new pay TV package and also wanted to launch with a service called Mnet Lite. Up to the end of the Open Time block this new offer was heavily advertised on the pay TV [[Terrestrial channel]]. A lot of secrecy was around this new channel and when launched it was a combination of rerun and first run content from [[Channel O]] and the rest of the Mnet Channels. From 2200 to 1100 the channel would simulcast completely with [[Channel O]]. It was also  launched to promote South African movies but later evolved into a fullscale General Entertainment Channel. Its prime time also has reruns but also contains the [[United States|American]] [[reality show]] ''[[Starting Over (TV series)|Starting Over]]''. It still contains African produced movies during prime time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==2009==
In 2009 the channel started simulcasting [[M-Net|Mnet]]'s New Youth Channel [[Vuzu's]] flagship program, V Entertainment. Whenever there is a major local reality program running it will broadcast on the channel like ''[[Idols (South Africa)|Idols]]'' in its entirety and later ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'''s weekly highlight show. When [[Dstv]] cut ''[[All Africa Poker]]'', they moved it content to be broadcast on Magicworld from 2230 to 0430 with [[Channel O]] picking up where they leave off all the way to 1100. It now also reruns popular [[Kenyan]] [[talk show]], ''[[The Patricia Show]]''.

==2015==
M-Net Family a general entertainment channel launched on channel 162 to replace the underperforming channel Magicworld and the only shows remaining on this new channel were ''[[The Wild (Drama Series)|The Wild]]'', ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'' and the kids block Koowe later in 2016 the channel had a program reshuffle leaving only ''The Talk'' as the only current program from the defunct Magicworld. In 2017, M-Net Family was discontinued due to low ratings and programs from M-Net Family moved to [[Vuzu]].

The '''Marine Stewardship Council''' ('''MSC''') is an independent [[non-profit organization]] which sets a standard for [[sustainable fishing]]. Fisheries that wish to demonstrate they are well-managed and sustainable compared to the science-based MSC standard are assessed by a team of experts who are independent of both the fishery and the MSC. [[Seafood products]] can display the blue MSC [[ecolabel]] only if that seafood can be traced back through the supply chain to a fishery that has been certified against the MSC standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/standards/standards |title=MSC standards — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the MSC is to use its ecolabel, for which the MSC receives [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for licensing it to products, and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world’s oceans by recognizing and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/vision-mission |title=Vision and mission — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another organisation, the [[Aquaculture Stewardship Council]], promotes and certifies sustainable [[aquaculture]].

==Contribution to changes in the oceans==

When buyers choose MSC-certified fish, well-managed fisheries are rewarded for sustainable practices.  In turn, the growing market for certified [[sustainable seafood]] generates a powerful incentive for other fisheries to demonstrate they are fishing sustainably or to improve their performance so that they too can be eligible for MSC certification. In this way, the MSC program helps to harness market forces to incentivise positive environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/business-support/theory-of-change |title=Our theory of change — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental benefits==

A study found that MSC-certified fisheries show improvements that deliver benefits to the marine environment. Benefits included: increased stocks; improved management of stocks; reduced bycatch; expansion of environmentally protected areas; and increased knowledge about ecosystem impacts amongst fishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erik Stokstad |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/746 |title=Science &amp;#124; From AAAS |publisher=M.sciencemag.org |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study published in the scientific journal PLoS One found

==Key facts and figures==

The MSC was founded in 1996, inspired by the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]] [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|cod fishery collapse]]. In 1999 it became independent of its founding partners, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and [[Unilever]].&lt;ref name="MSC history"/&gt; MSC has a staff of around 140 spread across the headquarters in London, regional offices in London, Seattle, Singapore and Sydney, and local offices in Edinburgh, Berlin, The Hague, Paris, Cape Town, Tokyo, Reykjavik, and the Baltic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/offices-staff |title=Offices and staff — MSC |publisher=msc.org |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSC program is open to all fisheries regardless of size, scale, location and intensity and runs a Developing World Program to ensure equal access to the program.

As of February 2016, there are over 20,000 [[seafood]] products available with the MSC ecolabel, sold in around 100 countries around the world. As of May 2016, there are over 280 fisheries that have been independently certified as meeting the MSC’s environmental standard for sustainable fishing and over 90 are currently undergoing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/certified-fisheries-on-the-map |title=Certified fisheries on the map — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3,300 companies operating in 34,500 sites have met the MSC Chain of Custody standard for seafood traceability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msc.org/about-us/ocean-to-plate-traceability/ocean-to-plate-traceability |title=MSC Chain of Custody Standard for seafood traceability |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MSC works in partnership with a number of organisations, businesses and funders around the world but is fully independent of all.&lt;ref name="msc.org"/&gt;

==Standard for sustainable fishing==

The MSC environmental standard for sustainable fishing was developed over two years through a [[Public consultation|consultative]] process involving more than 300 expert organizations and individuals around the world. It is consistent with the ‘Guidelines for the Eco-labelling of Fish and Fishery Products from Marine Wild Capture Fisheries’ adopted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1119t/i1119t00.htm |title=Guidelines for the Ecolabelling of Fish and Fishery Products from Marine Capture Fisheries. Revision 1. / Directives pour l'étiquetage écologique du poisson et des produits des pêches de capture marines. Révision 1. / Directrices para el ecoetiquetado de pescado y productos pesqueros de la pesca de captura marina. Revisión 1. / |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles of sustainability===

The MSC standard consists of three core principles that each fishery must demonstrate it meets:

* Principle 1: Sustainable fish stocks
The fishing activity must be at a level which is sustainable for the targeted fish population. Any certified fishery must operate so that fishing can continue indefinitely and is not overexploiting the resources. 
* Principle 2: Minimising environmental impact
Fishing operations should be managed to maintain the structure, productivity, function and diversity of the ecosystem on which the fishery depends.
* Principle 3: Effective management
The fishery must meet all local, national and international laws and must have a management system in place to respond to changing circumstances and maintain sustainability.

===How sustainability is measured===

Under the three principles are a total of 28 performance indicators that a fishery is scored against by an independent team of [[experts]]. The minimum passing score for each of the 28 performance indicators is set at a level which gives a good level of assurance that the productivity of all key elements of the ecosystem on which the fishery has an impact are not compromised.  The MSC system therefore not only takes into account the impact of the fishery on the target stock, but also other vital components of the wider ecosystem, such as habitat structure, productivity and biodiversity. This minimum level equates to a score of 60 and if the fishery scores below 60 on any one of the 28 Performance Indicators it is an automatic failure. However, achieving only the minimum, 60 performance level is not adequate to become certified against the MSC standard; average scores of at least 80 for the Performance Indicators under each of the three principles have to be achieved. As a result, every fishery certified against the MSC standard is operating at a very high level of precaution. This means the fishery is more resilient to potential changes such as natural stock fluctuations, and better able to secure its long-term sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/standards/standards/msc-environmental-standard |title=MSC environmental standard for sustainable fishing — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisheries that want certification and to use the ecolabel pay {{US$|20,000}} to more than $100,000 to an independent, for-profit contractor that assesses the fishery against the MSC standard and determines whether to recommend certification.&lt;ref name=jolly/&gt; The assessors are independently accredited to perform MSC assessments by Accreditation Services International (ASI). After certification, fisheries undergo annual audits costing $75,000 per audit and are recertified every five years.&lt;ref name=jolly&gt;{{cite news|last=Jolly|first=David|title=Certification of Krill Harvest Upsets Conservationists|work=The New York Times|page=6|date=23 June 2010|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/science/earth/23krill.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encouraging further improvement in fisheries===

Because a certified fishery must achieve average scores of at least 80 across the three principles it is possible for a fishery to be certified with a score of between 60 and 80 for a small number of performance indicators. In these cases it is called a conditional certification: conditions are placed on the fishery, which it must fulfil within a set period, in order to remain certified. Even though the fishery is operating sustainably, it must introduce a plan of action that will raise its performance to the more precautionary level demanded by the MSC standard by increasing any score of between 60 and 80 to at least 80 within a set period of time. In almost all cases, scores of 80 have to be achieved for all performance indicators by the end of the first certificate period (five years).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

To remain certified, fisheries also have to undertake an annual surveillance to check that they continue to meet the MSC standard. After 5 years, the fishery must be reassessed in full if it wants to continue to be certified.

==Aquaculture==
The Marine Stewardship Council is a program for [[Wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]] and does not include [[aquaculture]] production.

Some types of ‘enhanced fisheries’ can be certified but there is a well-defined type of enhancement to which the MSC standard for sustainability can be applied:

* The fishery must rely on catching fish from the wild at some stage, either Catch and Grow or Hatch and Catch.
* Species must be native to the geographic region of the fishery.
* It is not possible to substantially augment the fishes’ food or give them medicines (except in the case of Hatch and Catch fisheries such as salmon hatcheries, where the fry are reared only to a small size prior to release to the wild).
* Habitat can be modified but it must be possible to reverse the impact the enhanced fishery has on the habitats and wider ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/newsroom/news/msc-board-statement-on-aquaculture |title=MSC Board statement on aquaculture — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder input into assessments==

To ensure a robust assessment and to ensure that the independent team of experts has all the available information on the fishery, the assessment process is open to  a range of stakeholders to participate – this could be other fisheries, NGOs, governments, or other bodies.

Stakeholders are invited to participate in the process from the outset, and throughout the assessment, stakeholders are given the opportunity to submit information and comment on reports, all of which are made public and available for anyone to see on the MSC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/have-your-say |title=Have your say — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The MSC is governed by a Board of Trustees of up to 15 members. In addition a Technical Advisory Board and a Stakeholder Council advise the Board. The structure of these bodies involves a wide range of stakeholders with different views so that decisions reflect many sectors and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/governance/structure |title=Structure — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board sets the strategic direction of the MSC, monitors progress and ensures the MSC meets its objectives. The MSC Technical Advisory Board is made up of 15 experts in the fields of marine science, policy and seafood supply chains: it advises the MSC Board on technical and scientific matters. The MSC Stakeholder Advisory Council ensures that the opinions of groups with a stake in sustainable fishing and seafood supply are heard by the MSC Board. It comprises up to 17 members who represent a broad range of sectors and geographical areas, including fishing organisations, NGOs, consumer groups, retailers, and others.

Through these bodies, the MSC is continually improving its program, and stakeholders are invited to contribute to its development through regular meetings of the Stakeholder Advisory Council and public consultations.

==Ensuring seafood purchased is from a sustainable fishery==

The MSC manages a second standard called Chain of Custody for traceability. If seafood is to be sold with the MSC ecolabel, every business in the supply chain must be assessed and certified by an independent body against the MSC Chain of Custody standard. This ensures that only seafood from a certified sustainable fishery is sold with the MSC label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/standards/standards/chain-of-custody |title=MSC chain of custody standard for seafood traceability — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==

The MSC is a registered charity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1066806 |title=Charity overview |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-profit organisation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/98-0470539/marine-stewardship-council.aspx |title=Nonprofit Report for Marine Stewardship Council |publisher=.guidestar.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depends on various sources of funding. From 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, the MSC’s total income was £15 million. Total expenditure for the same period was £12 million. The MSC Board recognises it as generally good practice to hold reserves as a protection against any financial difficulties in the future. A reserves target of 6 to 9 months’ cover is considered to be necessary, at least as an aspiration, given the MSC’s absence of a subscribing membership and uncertainty, as a market-based program, of its various income streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/about-us/finances |title=Our finances — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent opinion and criticisms==
In 2009 Greenpeace published a comprehensive assessment of the MSC. Overall the report states several positive effects, but also many aspects that make the MSC a weak certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/report/2009/7/assessment-of-the-msc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085600/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/report/2009/7/assessment-of-the-msc.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jared Diamond]]'s 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]'' discussed MSC and the similar [[Forest Stewardship Council]] as good examples of collaboration among [[environmentalist]]s and businesses for a [[sustainable economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail Or Succeed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYPXUHZCp3gC|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-670-03337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Balmford’s book ''Wild Hope'' (Chicago University Press, 2012) devotes a chapter to the MSC as a successful strategy for achieving conservation goals through a collaborative, market-based solution.

Since 2009, the MSC has been criticized for certifying fisheries that have, in the view of some, questionable sustainability. The most controversial certification has been that of the [[Ross Sea]] [[Antarctic toothfish]] fishery.&lt;ref name=smith2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Lewis|title=Sustainable fish customers 'duped' by Marine Stewardship Council|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/06/fish-marine-stewardship-council|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rue89.com"&gt;[http://www.rue89.com/planete89/2011/02/22/peche-durable-msc-lecolabel-qui-encourage-le-massacre-191747 Amélie Lescroël and Sylvain Angerand, ''{{lang|fr|Pêche durable : MSC, l'écolabel qui encourage le massacre}}'' / ''Durable fishing: MSC, the ecolabel that promotes the massacre'', ''Rue89 Planète''].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists and stakeholders in the seafood industry consider the fishery "exploratory", since so little is known about it.&lt;ref name=smith2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacquet&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacquet | first1 = J. | last2 = Pauly | first2 = D. | last3 = Ainley | first3 = D. | last4 = Holt | first4 = S. | last5 = Dayton | first5 = P. | last6 = Jackson | first6 = J. | title = Seafood stewardship in crisis | journal = Nature | volume = 467 | issue = 7311 | pages = 28–29 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20811437 | doi = 10.1038/467028a}}&lt;/ref&gt; However toothfish has been fished commercially for over 30 years and the fishery has been closely managed by Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/gen-intro.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222175430/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/gen-intro.htm |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists had accused the assessor, which recommended the fishery for certification, of ignoring unfavorable data. The independent adjudicator later sent back the recommendation for certification to the assessor for reconsideration.&lt;ref name=jolly/&gt; The fishery was certified with adjustments to the scoring on the contested indicators and additional requirements for providing scientific data to aid research on toothfish stocks.

The MSC received criticism from [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Pew Environment Group]] among others over its certification of [[Antarctic krill]]. Although the fishery may have been healthy, critics believed that "scientific data on the fishery’s impact [wa]s lacking, and that the council’s decision [wa]s thus based on guesswork". As a result, [[Whole Foods Market]] stated it would stop selling all krill oil supplements even with the ecolabel.&lt;ref name=jolly/&gt;

As part of the MSC certification the krill fishery committed to further scientific research and 100% observer coverage, specifically addressing the concerns about risks posed to other species by krill fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/aker-biomarine-antarctic-krill/sustainability-notes |title=Sustainability notes — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing pressure on krill is very low – less than 1% of estimated biomass - and the management rules established by CCAMLR ensure fishing activities minimise risks to the krill population or other species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/kri-surv-intro.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204103907/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/kri-surv-intro.htm |date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the MSC was criticised by environmental groups like the [[Sierra Club]] for certifying the [[British Columbia]] [[sockeye salmon]] fishery&lt;ref name=hume&gt;{{cite news|last=Hume|first=Mark|title=Sustainable sockeye ‘eco-fraud'|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/sustainable-sockeye-eco-fraud/article1437794/| newspaper= The Globe and Mail|accessdate=5 December 2011|location=Toronto|date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=&amp;day=22&amp;id=35267&amp;l=e&amp;special=&amp;ndb=1%20target= MSC criticised for sockeye certification]."

The year before, the [[salmon run]] of the Fraser River (a part of the fishery) was only 1.4 million (M) of a predicted 11 M salmon and had prompted the [[Canada|Canadian]] Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] to launch a judicial enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Missing salmon stocks to be probed: PM| url=http://fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=11-2009&amp;day=6&amp;id=34470&amp;l=e&amp;country=0&amp;special=&amp;ndb=1&amp;df=0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123095358/http://fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=11-2009&amp;day=6&amp;id=34470&amp;l=e&amp;country=0&amp;special=&amp;ndb=1&amp;df=0|archivedate=23 November 2009|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=Fish Info &amp; Services|date=6 November 2009|author=AFP|authorlink=Agence France-Presse|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appropriate management response to the decreased stocks was taken and the fishery was closed to allow the stocks to recover. The fishery is now operating successfully and has an ongoing commitment to protecting weak populations and decreasing bycatch. Catch level is set in-season in accordance with each year's run size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/pacific/british-columbia-sockeye-salmon/fishers-story |title=British Columbia sockeye salmon: the fishers' story — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, several European [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] chapters objected to certification of the Denmark [[North Sea]] [[plaice]] fishery.&lt;ref name=holland&gt;{{cite web|last=Holland|first=Richard|title=Objection: Denmark North Sea Plaice Trawl Fishery|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/north-east-atlantic/Denmark-North-Sea-plaice/Objection-documents-1/17.02.2011-Objection%20Denmark%20trawl%20plaice.pdf|work=Memo to MSC|publisher=Marine Stewardship Council|accessdate=5 December 2011|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns raised were taken into account and the fishery concerned implemented a habitat strategy to ensure enhanced protection of vulnerable habitats through measures such as closed areas, gear modifications, technical developments and targeted research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/newsroom/news/danish-north-sea-plaice-trawl-fishery-receives-msc-certificate?fromsearch=1&amp;newsquery=denmark+north+sea+plaice&amp;year=&amp;month=&amp;isnewssearch=1 |title=Danish North Sea plaice trawl fishery receives MSC certificate — MSC |publisher=Msc.org |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in an independent study of seven different seafood ecolabelling and certification programs, commissioned by WWF International and carried out by Accenture Development Partnerships in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?206131/Marine-Stewardship-Council-MSC-Wild-Seafood-Sustainability-Certification-Remains-Best-In-Class|title=Marine Stewardship Council wild seafood sustainability certification remains best in class|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC ranked highest across all 103 criteria.  The study was repeated in 2012 and the MSC again was determined ‘best in class’, scoring twice as highly as the next nearest certification program analysed.

Some scientists like [[Sidney Holt]] and [[Daniel Pauly]] have suggested that a system where assessments are carried out by commercial contractors paid by the fisheries creates a [[conflict of interest]] because assessors have a financial incentive in recommending fisheries and getting more work and profits from the resulting annual audits.&lt;ref name=jacquet/&gt; However, the practice of companies paying external auditors for assessments to independent standards (such as accounting or quality standards) is  widespread throughout all business and non-profit sectors. Third party assessment by accredited certifiers, independent of the standard setter, is also a key feature of the United Nations FAO guidelines on ecolabelling fisheries and fish products, and one of the criteria that the global community of MSC stakeholders value in the MSC program.&lt;ref name=jolly/&gt;

In December 2016 ''[[Private Eye]]'' reported that a leaked internal WWF document concluded that because the MSC receives royalties from licensing its ecolabel (providing 75% of the organisation's revenue) there is a [[conflict of interest]] and it has relaxed its sustainability requirements, enabling more products to carry its label, thereby increasing its own income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=9 December 2016 |title=Singing out of tuna |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;
