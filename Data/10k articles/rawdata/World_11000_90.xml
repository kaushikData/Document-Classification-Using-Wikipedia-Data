The '''2008 Iceland earthquake''' was a [[doublet earthquake]] that struck on May 29  at 15:46 [[UTC]] in southwestern [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Decriem"&gt;{{harvnb|Decriem|Árnadóttir|Hooper|Geirsson|2010|p=1144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The recorded [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]]s of the two main quakes were 5.9 {{M|w|link=y}} and 5.8 {{M|w}}, respectively, giving a composite magnitude of 6.1{{M|w}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Decriem|Árnadóttir|Hooper|Geirsson|2010|p=1128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no human fatalities, but 30 injuries were reported and a number of sheep were killed. The epicenter of the earthquake was between the towns of [[Hveragerði]] and [[Selfoss (town)|Selfoss]], about {{convert|45|km|mi|sp=us}} east-southeast of the capital, [[Reykjavík]]. It was the strongest earthquake to hit Iceland since the [[2000 Iceland earthquakes|summer of 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BBC News|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Iceland straddles the [[mid-Atlantic ridge]] where the Eurasian and North-American [[tectonic plate]]s move away from each other. [[Volcano|Volcanic]] activity is common along such [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]] but strong earthquakes are rare. In Iceland the ridge is somewhat off-set, creating two [[transform fault]]s where plates move horizontally along each other. One is in the north of the country and one in the south; the strongest Icelandic earthquakes happen along those transform faults. The 29 May quake is classified by geologists as typical ''Suðurlandsskjálftar'' (literally: Southern Iceland quakes), which happen on the southern fault.

==Damage==
Unlike the quakes in the summer of 2000, the 29 May quake happened in the most densely populated part of the South Iceland district. The population of the affected area is about 12,000 and it includes the towns of Selfoss and [[Hveragerði]] as well as [[Eyrarbakki]], [[Stokkseyri]] and [[Þorlákshöfn]]. Many farms were also affected.

'''Asiamerica''' was a large island formed from the [[Laurasia]]n landmass and separated by shallow continental seas from [[Eurasia]] to the West and eastern [[North America]] to the East. This region incorporated what is now politically [[China]], [[Mongolia]], western [[United States]] and western [[Canada]]. Fossil evidence tells us that it was home to many [[dinosaur]]s and archaic [[mammal]]s. It existed during the Late [[Cretaceous]] to [[Eocene]] periods, and existed again during [[Quaternary]] [[Pleistocene]] epoch. It will exist again for the third time within 50 million years.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Austria–Bangladesh relations''' refer to the bilateral relations between [[Bangladesh]] and [[Austria]]. Relations between the two countries have been considered cordial with both the countries working towards further strengthen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dipu Moni invited to Austria to embolden relations |url=http://www1.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=264812$date=2012-07-15&amp;dateCurrent=2012-07-19 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |newspaper=Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222014715/http://www1.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=264812%24date%3D2012-07-15&amp;dateCurrent=2012-07-19 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Because of the long distance (The two capital cities [[Vienna]] and [[Dhaka]] are nearly 7000 kilometres apart&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) between the two countries, the historical contacts between the two peoples have been rather small, as Bangladesh never took a domineering role in Asia and Austria, even though very powerful inside Europe under the Habsburg dynasty, focussed on continental affairs and never became a colonial empire.

The two countries, however, fought the two World Wars against each other, with Austria (as [[Austria-Hungary]]) being one of the dominant [[Central Powers]] in [[World War One]] and part of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s national socialist [[Third Reich]] in [[World War Two]] and Bangladesh being a part of the [[British Raj]], a colony of the [[United Kingdom]], which fought Austria (respectively Germany, which Austria was a part of from 1938 to 1945) on both occasions.

== High level visits ==
Former foreign minister of Bangladesh [[Dipu Moni]] paid a visit to Vienna in 2013.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh, Austria identify common fields of cooperation|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=270791|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas for cooperation ==
Bangladesh and Austria have identified power and energy, health, education, tourism, human resource development and waste management as promising sectors for bilateral cooperation between the two countries.&lt;ref name="star" /&gt;

=== Educational cooperation ===
The education sector have been seen as a potential area for bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Bangladesh and Austria have put emphasis on educational exchange programs between the two countries. Bangladesh has sought Austria's cooperation to increase the number of Austrian scholarship for Bangladeshi students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iajuddin for boosting trade relations between Dhaka and Vienna|url=http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/arc_vienna.html|publisher=The Bangabhaban|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic cooperation ===
Bangladesh and Austria have shown their deep interest to expand the bilateral economic activities between the two countries and have been taking necessary steps in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dhaka keen to develop closer economic ties with Vienna|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/print_news.php?nid=35259|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austrian govt invites Dipu Moni |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_16-07-2012_Austrian-govt-invites-Dipu-Moni_205_1_0_3_8.html |accessdate=4 February 2014 |newspaper=Daily Sun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062528/http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_16-07-2012_Austrian-govt-invites-Dipu-Moni_205_1_0_3_8.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the volume of bilateral trade between the two countries stands at €400 million.

Tepa (a town with a population of about 2,000 people) is the administrative center of the Babar Islands municipality ("Kecamatan Kepulauan Babar") now reduced to encompass only the western half of Babar Island, Wetang Island (lying to the west of Babar) and Dai Island (to the north). The town of Letwurung on the east side of Babar island is the capital of the new municipality called "East Babar" ("Kecamatan Babar Timor") in the east half of the Babar Islands, consisting of the East half of Babar Island, Masela Island (to the south-east of Babar), and Dawera Island and Dawelor Island (to the east).

==Central island==
The islands take their name from the large central island of Babar which is roughly {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} across and a circumference of {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. Babar Island has a maximum elevation of approximately 750 meters and is lightly covered with sub-tropical montane forest, although the 5 rivers and 2 large year-round springs afford tropical forest in their narrow ravine courses.

===Topography===
The topography of all the Babar islands is distinctive for their marked stepped appearance, the result of a combination of periodic uplifting of the [[tectonic]] plate interacting with the erosive action of the constant ocean waves. Water action on the coral base over the millennia has created many caves and shafts.

===Agriculture and fisheries===
Rain is plentiful from December to July so corn, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], bananas, [[cassava]], various tubers and red rice (unirrigated) grow plentifully. Fish is the main source of protein. Sufficient potable water on Babar Island is provided by year round springs and shallow wells. [[Coconut oil]] is important for consumption while the oily meat called copra, is sold. Other items harvested and sold for export are sea shells, sea weed, [[sea cucumbers]], shark fins, live lizards and birds, cattle, cashews, nutmeg, cloves and [[eucalyptus oil]].

==Smaller islands==
This situation contrasts markedly with the much smaller islands ringing Babar Island. These are low-lying, uplifted [[reef]] and [[limestone]] (with the exception of Dai Island, which is largely [[granite]]), infertile, not heavily forested and lacking in fresh water sources. The more difficult environment leads the indigenous inhabitants to focus more of their energies on fishing and hand-crafts which are then traded for garden produce from Babar Island. The people collect rain water in large above ground [[cisterns]] which can last them through the driest time of the year (September to December). When the [[drought]] is longer than usual the water in these tanks is exhausted and the people have to walk miles to the few villages with springs or wells, and queue up for a turn to draw a few liters of water. People camp overnight beside the well waiting their turn. The Indonesian government has provided funds for many more collection tanks for rain water, so the situation has improved markedly in the last few years.

==Transport==
There is no airport or landing strip in the Babar Islands. Small freighters that have contracts to carry passengers service the islands. It is a minimum twelve-hour ride to the nearest city with an airport where one can catch a commercial flight to other towns in Maluku being Tual, Larat, Wonreli (Kisar) and Ambon.

==People==
In comparison to the majority of Indonesians living nearer the political centre of the country, the indigenous Babar Islanders tend to darker [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[pigmentation]], have kinky hair and generally lack the [[epicanthic eyefold]] of East Asians.

==Religion==
Most indigenous Babar Islanders are [[baptised]] into the [[Protestant Church]] of Maluku (Gereja Protestan Maluku, GPM). The GPM's roots are in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] started by the Dutch colonists. Due undoubtedly to the aridity of the islands and the lack of natural resources, there has been no mass [[Transmigration program|transmigration]] from more populous Indonesian areas.  In Tepa, there are 3 other denominations with church buildings: a [[Catholic]] church, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church, and a [[Pentecostal]] church. There is also a [[mosque]] in Tepa that serves the small community of [[Muslims]]. All the other towns have one GPM church each, totaling 56 GPM churches in the entire GPM diocese of Babar islands ("Klasis GPM Pulau-pulau Babar"). While these world faiths are represented, there is much hybridization with the preexisting [[animist]] beliefs and practices. The traditional dance of Babar  is "Seka".

'''Djibouti–France relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[Djibouti]] and [[France]]. Djibouti was obtained as a colony by France in 1862 and officially controlled Djibouti until it received independence in 1977. Djibouti maintains military and economic agreements with France which provide continued security and economic assistance. The largest [[Military of France|French military base]] in [[Africa]] is located in Djibouti's territorial waters in the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/12578/french_military_in_africa.html French military in Africa] Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Echt fett''''' is an Austrian [[hidden camera shows|hidden camera]] television series. Like in e.g. [[Just for Laughs: Gags]] and [[Trigger Happy TV]], it exclusively shows clips of how unsuspecting subjects are brought into unusual situations by actors while being filmed with a hidden camera. A typical clip is filmed on the streets, or in a shopping mall. The comedic situations produced by the actors and the reactions of the unknowinlgy fooled are to entertain viewers. It was broadcast between 2003 and 2007.

'''Gene Fornby''' is a reconstructed [[Iron Age]] settlement just outside [[Örnsköldsvik]], in [[Västernorrland]] County, [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeway.org/issue4/culture/gene.htm ''Iron Age Farm Gene Fornby'' (Helena Byström, Carola Nordin and Anna Edin)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest traces of human activity found in the area date back to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], but the settlement itself dated back to the [[Roman Iron Age]], from around the years 400-600 AD. The settlement was located just by the waterline of that time, but due to the [[post-glacial rebound]] in the area, the waterline is now about 500 meters away from the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.openthesis.org/documents/Gene-teori-och-praktik-rekonstruktion-414549.html ''Långhus i Gene'' (Lena Edblom)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically it was known that there were burial mounds on top of Genesmon, but it was not until the 1960s that they were investigated for the first time by the archaeologist [[:sv:Evert Baudou|Evert Baudou]]. Graves believed to be those of chieftains from the years 100-600 AD have been found. Gene Fornby was laid bare during archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] conducted by the [[University of Umeå]]  from 1977 and 1988. The excavation revealed various buildings including a [[forge]], believed to have been one of the largest forge in prehistoric [[Scandinavia]]. Traces of iron production and processing were uncovered as well as bronze casting and a textile works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicarchaeology.eu/Gene-Fornby-SE ''Gene Fornby'' (Archeo Interface)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171510/http://www.publicarchaeology.eu/Gene-Fornby-SE |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, work began on reconstructing the farm on Genesmon. A principal feature is the reconstructed longhouse. The facility opened in 1991 and became a popular tourist attraction during the summer months. All the houses are open to the public. The facility is operated by the [[:sv:Örnsköldsviks museum och konsthall|Örnsköldsvik Museum &amp; Art Gallery]].

The '''Indonesian Workers Welfare Union''' (SBSI) is a [[national trade union centre]] in [[Indonesia]]. It was founded in 1992 and claims a membership of 2.1 million. SBSI was the first independent national federation to form during the [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto dictatorship]], suffering considerable state repression during this period. In 1993 its national congress was broken up by soldiers just 40 minutes into the proceedings. As well, three activists were murdered, 250 arrested, and 2,500 dismissed from employment in the first two years of its establishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="700">'''Life imprisonment in Iceland''' is legal and the most severe punishment available under the Icelandic penal code. It may be imposed for murder, genocide, qualified hostage-taking and the act of arranging a war against Iceland with foreign powers. Under the military penal code, it can also be imposed in times of war for mutiny, disobedience, cowardice, treason and espionage.

Inmates sentenced to life imprisonment are eligible for parole after serving 16 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="835">MIX, the '''Malta Internet eXchange''', is a common national Internet backbone for [[Malta]] that was launched by NIC (Malta) on 7 September 1999. This was a result of working in partnership with the major ISPs operating in Malta to develop an operationally sound infrastructure.

The Internet exchange facility is located at the [[University of Malta]] Computing Services Centre (CSC). A close partnership with the CSC, enables NIC to provide reliable operations and technical support.

The initial MIX set-up made use of Frame-Relay infrastructure to connect the ISPs to the Exchange. ISPs now connect to the MIX facility on campus using ATM PVCs or leased circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">In [[anthropology]], the '''matrilineal belt''' is an area in Africa south of the equator where [[matrilineality]] is predominant. The matrilineal belt runs diagonally from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans, crossing [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]]. The belt is linked to [[horticulture|horticultural]] household economics, and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups that have embraced [[pastoralism]] have tended to lose matrilinearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=Clare–Janaki |last2=Ruth |first2=Mace |date=2003 |title=Spread of cattle led to the loss of matrilineal descent in Africa: a coevolutionary analysis |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=270 |issue= |pages=2425–2433 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2535 |pmc=1691535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region stands out for its high degree of [[Paternity fraud|paternity uncertainty]] and adolescent [[promiscuity]] both of which are alleged to be linked to matrilinearity. As inheritance is mainly through the descent of women, there is little incentive to know the identity of the father of a child. Men's inheritance therefore seldom passes to his wife's children but stays within what is for sure his biological family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hrdy |first1=Daniel B. |last2= |first2= |date=1987 |title=Cultural Practices Contributing to the Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Africa |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=1109–1119 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ideas linking the matrilineal belt to a supposed matrilineal [[Bantu expansion]] have been rejected as lacking evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuper |first1=Adam |last2=Van Leynseele |first2=Pierre |date=1978 |title=Social Anthropology and the 'Bantu expansion' |journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=335–352 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monowai''' is a [[Volcano|volcanic]] [[seamount]] to the north of [[New Zealand]]. It is one of the most active volcanoes in the [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec volcanic arc]] and has erupted many times since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0402-05-&amp;volpage=erupt Global Volcanism Program: Monowai Seamount, eruptive history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rise and fall of underwater volcano revealed |author=[[David Shukman]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18040658 |newspaper=BBC News |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{coord|25.887|S|177.188|W|display=title}}

==Description==
The summit of Monowai is approximately {{Convert|132|m|ft|0}}&lt;ref name="volcano" /&gt; below sea level, considerably above the level of the nearby [[Tonga Trench|Tonga]] and [[Kermadec Trench]]es. The summit's position and depth changed between 1998 and 2004, due to a landslide and eruptive regrowth. A {{Convert|1500|m}} deep [[caldera]], {{Convert|13|by|8|km|abbr=on}}, lies {{convert|5|to(-)|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} NNE of the seamount's main cone.

Monowai was discovered by an aerial survey in 1944. Subsequent surveys showed evidence of significant change - sea discolouration and seismic activity. Studies between 1978 and 2007 showed the summit repeatedly rising and falling.&lt;ref name="BBC 13 May 2012"/&gt;

==2010s==
Sonar data from the research ship ''R/V Sonne'' showed that between May 14 and June 1–2, 2011 the summit collapsed by as much as {{Convert|18.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and lava flows had raised another area by {{Convert|79.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Additionally a new volcanic cone was created. The ''R/V Sonne'' also observed the sea to be a yellowy-green with gas bubbles. Researchers believe that only [[Vesuvius]] and [[Mount St Helens]] have recorded larger growth rates.&lt;ref name="BBC 13 May 2012"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18040658 BBC, News, Science - Environment, Rise and fall of underwater volcano revealed. by David Shukman]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, a {{Convert|25000|km2|abbr=on}} [[2012 Kermadec Islands eruption and pumice raft|floating raft of pumice]] was found offshore from New Zealand. It was initially believed to be from Monowai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=Field, Michael |author2=Kirk, Stacey |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/7455060/25-000-sq-km-sea-of-pumice-floats-off-New-Zealand |title=25,000 sq km sea of pumice floats off New Zealand |date=8 August 2012 |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20120810"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vast volcanic 'raft' found in Pacific, near New Zealand |date=10 August 2012 |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19207810 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Monowai was later ruled out as a possible source.&lt;ref name=Stuff.co.nz&gt;{{cite news| last =Cooke| first =Michelle| title =Scientists rock theory on pumice raft| newspaper =Stuff.co.nz| location =| pages = | publisher =| date =11 August 2012| url =http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/7461485/Scientists-rock-theory-on-pumice-raft| accessdate =13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the generic foreign affairs term|the political journal|The National Interest}}

The '''national interest''', often referred to by the [[French language|French]] expression '''''raison d'État''''' ("reason of State"), is a [[country]]'s goals and ambitions, whether [[economic]], [[military]], cultural or otherwise.  The concept is an important one in [[international relations]], where pursuit of the national interest is the foundation of the [[realism (international relations)|realist]] school.

== History of the concept ==
In early human history the national interest was usually viewed as secondary to that of [[religion]] or morality.  To engage in a war rulers needed to justify the action in these contexts. The first thinker to advocate for the primacy of the national interest is usually considered to be [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].

The practice is first seen as being employed by [[France]] under the direction of its Chief Minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]] when it intervened on the [[Protestant]] side, despite its own [[Catholicism]], to block the increasing power of the Catholic [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  At Richelieu's prompting, [[Jean de Silhon]] defended the concept of reason of state as "a mean between what conscience permits and affairs require."&lt;ref name="Thuau"&gt;"E. Thuau": "Raison d'État et Pensée Politique a l'époque de Richelieu; Paris, Armand Colin, s. d. [1966], "W.F. Church, ''Richelieu and Reason of State'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 168; J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the national interest soon came to dominate [[Politics of Europe|European politics]] that became fiercely competitive over the next centuries. It is a form of reason "born of the calculation and the ruse of men" and makes of the state "a knowing machine, a work of reason"; the state ceases to be derived from the divine order and is henceforth subject to its own particular necessities.&lt;ref name="Thuau"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

States could now openly embark on wars purely out of self-interest. [[Mercantilism]] can be seen as the economic justification of the aggressive pursuit of the national interest.

A foreign policy geared towards pursuing the national interest is the foundation of the realist school of international relations. The realist school reached its greatest heights at the [[Congress of Vienna]] with the practice of the balance of powers, which amounted to balancing the national interest of several great and lesser powers.

[[Metternich]] was celebrated as the principal artist and theoretician of this balancing but he was simply doing a more or less clean copy of what his predecessor [[Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz|Kaunitz]] had already done by reversing so many of the traditional [[Habsburg]] alliances and building international relations anew on the basis of national interest instead of religion or tradition.

These notions became much criticized after the bloody debacle of the [[World War I|First World War]], and some sought to replace the concept of the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] with the idea of [[collective security]], whereby all members of the [[League of Nations]] would "consider an attack upon one as an attack upon all," thus deterring the use of violence for ever more. The [[League of Nations]] did not work, partially because the United States refused to join and partially because, in practice, nations did not always find it "in the national interest" to deter each other from the use of force.

The events of [[World War II]] along with [[World War I]], led to a rebirth of [[realism (international relations)|Realist]] and then [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neo-realist]] thought, as international relations theorists re-emphasized the role of power in global governance. Many [[International relations theory|IR]] theorists blamed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] for its [[idealism]] (contrasted with [[realism (international relations)|Realism]]) and ineffectiveness at preventing war, even as they blamed [[mercantilist]] [[beggar thy neighbor]] policies for the creation of [[fascist]] states in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. With [[hegemonic stability theory]], the concept of the U.S. national interest was expanded to include the maintenance of open sea lanes and the maintenance and expansion of free trade.

== Relationship with the rule of law ==
The majority of the [[jurists]] consider that the national interest is incompatible with the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;The prevalence of State-person on the rule of the law ...., in international relations, has a very specific meaning (stated precisely by the Constitutional Court, in the repeated rulings on the case of Abu Omar), but within democratic systems, by time of the Dreyfus Affair, much of the doctrine did argue against Reason of State as an obstacle to criminal investigations:  {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = La sala del Bronzino e il Diritto Costituzionale |journal= L’ago e il filo|date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89424007}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2018}} Regarding this, Antonino Troianiello has said that national interest and a state subject to the rule of law are not absolutely incompatible:&lt;ref&gt;Troianiello, p.&amp;nbsp;690&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While the notion of state reason comes first as a theme of study in political science, it is a very vague concept in law and has never been an object of systematic study. This obvious lack of interest is due to a deliberate epistemological choice - a form of [[positivism]] applied to legal science; and as a result legal science affirms its autonomy regarding other social sciences while constituting with exactness its own object - law - in order to describe it. In doing so it implies deterministic causes which have an influence on its descriptive function. This method which puts aside state reason is not without any consequence: the fact that state reason is not taken into account by legal science is to be integrated within a global rejection of a description of law as presented in political science. A fundamental dynamic in modern constitutionalism, "the seizure of the political phenomenon by law" is all the more remarkable when it claims a scientific value, thus a neutrality aiming at preventing all objection. This convergence of legal science and constitutionalism has the tautological character of a rhetorical discourse in which law is simultaneously the subject and the object of the discourse on law. Having as a basis state reason, it allows a reflexion on the legitimacy of power and authority of modern Western societies; this in connexion with the representations which make it and which it makes "state reason and public law."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a euphemism==
Today, the concept of "the national interest" is often associated with political realists who fail to differentiate their policies from "idealistic" policies to seek to inject morality into foreign policy or promote solutions that rely on [[multilateralism|multilateral institutions]] which might weaken the independence of the state.

As considerable disagreement exists in every country over what is or is not in "the national interest," the term is as often invoked to justify isolationist and pacifistic policies as to justify interventionist or warlike policies. It has been posited that the term is a euphemism used by powerful countries for geopolitical aims such as nonrenewable [[natural resources]] for energy [[energy independence|independency]], territorial [[expansionism]] and precious metals in smaller countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa &amp; U.S. National Interests - Page 182, Anthony D. Marley - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, euphemism usage is necessary to stifle voices opposed to an interventionistic or warhawk foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;L'ecrivain Caribéen, Guerrier de L'imaginaire - Page 42, Bénédicte Ledent - 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, MEPC 54 emphasized the value of reception facilities that would exceed expectations in the implementation of [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]], and introduced a policy of "zero tolerance of illegal discharges from ships" that could only be enforced when there were adequate reception facilities in ports. Therefore, the Committee urged all Parties to [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]], particularly port States, to fulfill their treaty obligations to provide reception facilities for wastes generated during the normal operation of ships.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMO {{!}}   Port Reception Facilities|url = http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/PortReceptionFacilities/Pages/Default.aspx|website = www.imo.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, MEPC 55 approved an Action Plan to help the problems faced by '''port reception facilities'''.  This was seen as a major challenge to overcome in order to achieve full compliance with [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]]. The Plan was introduced by the Sub-Committee on Flag State Implementation (FSI) in order to better implement [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] and to increase environmental consciousness among shipping.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A new plan to manage the waste must be found and ships must be encouraged to use the port reception facilities rather than to discharge waste anywhere in the ocean.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Port Reception Facilities – Port Reception Facilities – EMSA – European Maritime Safety Agency|url = http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation-tasks/visits-and-inspections/port-reception-facilities.html|website = www.emsa.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-08|first = Communications|last =. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the European Community adopted the Directive 2000/59/EC on '''port reception facilities''' with the goal of eliminating discharges of ship-generated residues into the ocean.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Directive is especially aimed at increasing the prevalence and use of '''port reception facilities''', thereby securing a cleaner and more sustainable marine [[Natural environment|environment]]. These ideologies were previously addressed by the [[MARPOL 73/78]] Convention in 1973, however Member States are still encountering difficulties in fully implementing the requirements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Port Reception Facility Database (PRFD) went online 1 March 2006, as a module of the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS).  The database logs data on reception facilities detailing each category of ship-generated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cruising.org/sites/default/files/leadershipforum2012/Em%20Env%20Randy-PRF.pdf|title = CLIA 2012 Leadership Form|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-06-08|website = Emerging Environmental Issues Port Reception Facilities|publisher = Norwegian Cruise Line|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Annexes of [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] contain detailed regulations with respect to the six main groups of harmful materials: Petroleum in any form ([[Marpol Annex I|Annex I]]); Noxious Liquid Substances (NLS) carried in bulk (Annex II); Harmful substances carried in packaged form (Annex III); [[Sewage sludge|Sewage]] (Annex IV); [[Municipal solid waste|Garbage]] (Annex V); and Air emissions (Annex VI).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oas.org/cip/docs%5Ccursos%5CPRESENTACIONES%20URUGUAY%20MAYO2012%5C6%20Nikos%20%20Mikelis,%20OMI.pdf|title = MARPOL requirements for port reception facilities|date = 22 May 2012|accessdate = 8 June 2015|website = |publisher = IMO|last = Mikelis|first = Nikos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] states that contaminants cannot be discharged into the ocean in line with the requirements stated in its annexes should be dropped of at port reception facilities.  It also says that port States need to ensure that there are enough port reception facilities throughout the area to help with convenience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2009, [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] created Guide to the Good Practice for Port Reception Facilities Providers and Users. MEPC.1/Circ.671.  This document describes the steps that need to be taken in order to effectively dispose of waste by ships at port reception facilities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chronology &amp; Search|url = http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|website = MAX1 Studies|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next in 2012, [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] released the MARPOL Requirements for Port Reception Facilities.  This lists the requirements for port reception facilities to ensure that waste can be discharged without undue delay. It also discusses long standing lack of PRFs and under reporting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another important step was when IMO published their Standard Format for the Advanced Notification Form for Waste Delivery to Port Reception Facilities.  This document details the standard format for notification by the ship to a port facility for acceptance of shipboard waste. This form should be submitted 24 hours prior to arrival.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Postavy''' is a former air base in [[Belarus]] located 5&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Pastavy]].  It is a medium-sized air base.  There are three loop areas with 15 revetments each, and central tarmac area.

It was home to 305th Bomber Aviation Regiment (305 BAP), [[1st Guards Bomber Aviation Division]], flying the [[Su-24]]. The regiment was activated in 1976, withdrawn to [[Krasnodar]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], and disbanded in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ww2.dk/new/air%20force/regiment/bap/305bap.htm|title = 305th Bomber Aviation Regiment|date = |access-date = 19 Jan 2016|website = ww2.dk|publisher = |last = Holm|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1960 to 1988, the base was also home to the [[940th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment]] of the same aviation division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ww2.dk/new/air%20force/division/bad/1gvbad.htm|title = 1st Guards Bomber Aviation Division|date = |access-date = 19 Jan 2016|website = ww2.dk|publisher = |last = Holm|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tarentola raziana''''' (English name: '''Razean''' or '''Raso wall gecko''') is a [[species]] of [[gecko]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Phyllodactylidae]]. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, they are founded in the island of [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]] and the islets of [[Ilhéu Branco|Branco]] and [[Ilhéu Raso|Raso]]&lt;ref name="RDB"&gt;{{NRDB species|genus=Tarentola |species=raziana|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species was named in by [[Hans Hermann Schleich]] in 1984.

==Etymology==
The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is named after the islet Raso where it is founded.&lt;ref name="RDB"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The subspecies were elevated from ''Tarentola caboverdiana raziana'' by Vasconcelos, Perera, Geniez, Harris &amp; Carranza en 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Vasconcelos, Perera, Geniez, Harris &amp; Carranza, ''An integrative taxonomic revision of the Tarentola geckos (Squamata, Phyllodactylidae) of the Cape Verde Islands.''

[[Geology|Geologically]], the '''Sunda Shelf''' is a southeast extension of the [[continental shelf]] of [[Southeast Asia]].

==Definition==
[[Biogeography|Biogeographically]], [[Sundaland]] is a term for the region of [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern Asia]] which encompasses these areas of the [[Asia]]n continental shelf that were [[last glacial maximum|exposed during the last ice age]]. Sundaland included the [[Malay Peninsula]] on the Asian mainland, as well as the large islands of [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], and [[Sumatra]] and their surrounding islands. The same steep undersea gradients that mark the eastern boundary of Sundaland are identified biogeographically by the [[Wallace Line]], identified by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], which marks the eastern boundary of Asia's land [[mammal]] fauna, and is the boundary of the [[Indomalaya]] and [[Australasia ecozone]]s.

The shelf has resulted from millennia of volcanic activity and erosion of the Asian continental mass, and the build up and consolidation of debris along the margins as sea levels rose and fell.&lt;ref name="Monk 1996 10"&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |pages=10|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seas between the islands cover relatively stable ancient [[pene-plain]]s that are characterised by low seismicity, low isostatic gravity anomalies and no active volcanoes with the exception of Sumatra, Java, and Bali, which while connected to the Sunda Shelf, belong geologically to the young [[Sunda Arc]] [[orogenic]] system (i.e., the Sunda Mountain System).&lt;ref name="Bemmelen, R.W. 1949"/&gt; During [[glacial period]]s, the [[sea level]] falls, and great expanses of the Sunda Shelf are exposed as a marshy plain. The rise of sea level during a meltwater pulse 14,600 to 14,300 years [[Before Present]] was as much as 16 meters within 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;Till Hanebuth, Karl Stattegger and Pieter M. Grootes, "Rapid Flooding of the Sunda Shelf: A Late-Glacial Sea-Level Record", ''Science'' ''288'' 12 May 2000:1033-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Present sea levels submerge a number of [[Pleistocene era|Pleistocene]] paleo river systems that drained much of [[Sundaland]] during the last glacial maximum 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tomascik |first=T |author2=Mah, J.A. |author3=Nontji, A. |author4=Moosa, M.K.  |title=The Ecology of the Indonesian Seas – Part One |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |location=Hong Kong |pages=580–581|isbn=962-593-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east of the Sunda Shelf is the [[Sahul Shelf]]. Separating these two regions of shallow seas is [[Wallacea]], which encompasses [[Sulawesi]] and the thousands of smaller islands making up [[Nusa Tenggara]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Within Wallacea lie some of the deepest seas in the world, with depths of up to 7,000 metres. Passing between [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], and [[Borneo]] and Sulawesi, Wallacea is marked by a transition zone of flora and fauna first described by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name="Monk 1996 10"/&gt; The complicated history of island formation on the Sunda Shelf and changing landbridge connections with mainland Southeast Asia have resulted in a high degree of [[endemism]] and local distribution discontinuities, discussed at [[Sundaland]], the [[biogeography|biogeographical province]] that has resulted from these changes.

The exposure of the Sunda Shelf during [[eustatic]] sea level changes has effects on the [[El Niño]] oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew B. G. Bush and Richard G. Fairbanks, "Exposing the Sunda shelf: Tropical responses to eustatic sea level change", ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' '''108''' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Earle in 1845 was the first to describe the general features of the Sunda and Sahul Shelves, which he termed the "Great Asiatic Bank" and the "Great Australian Bank" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, W. (1845). On the physical structure and arrangement of the Indonesian Archipelago. ''Journal of the Geographical Society of London'' 15: 358:365&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submerged river systems==
[[File:SEA submerged River Systems.svg|thumb|Drawing of the presumed coast lines in South-East Asia and now submerged river systems, This drawing presumes a sea level of -120m compared to present day. This level was reached about 17000 years before present day. The assumed river beds are based on the surface contours of the sea bed in the area.]]
The paleo river systems of the Sunda Shelf are vast submerged river systems that extend present-day river systems and may be interpreted to follow topographic lows in a down-slope direction. During the driest period of the Pleistocene era (about 17,000 years BP) some four distinct catchment areas form the ''Malacca'', ''Siam'' and ''Sunda'' river systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Voris |first=Harold K. |last2= |first2= |date=September 2000 |title=Maps of Pleistocene sea levels in Southeast Asia shorelines, river systems and time durations. |url= |journal=Journal of Biogeography |publisher=Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois, USA |volume=27 |issue= |pages=1153–1167 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00489.x |access-date=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Siam river''' system'' consists of a northern and a western arm. The northern arm extends the Chao Phraya River to drain the Gulf of Thailand. The western arm forming out of some rivers in central Sumatra flows through the Singapore Straits before joining up with the northern arm to empty into an estuary and the South China Sea to the north of North Natuna Island.

The '''''Malacca Straits''' river system'' is formed by a joining of waters from northeastern Sumatra and the western Malayan Peninsula, draining into the Andeman Sea.

The '''''Northern Sunda''' river system'', also known as the Great Sunda river system, or [[Gustaaf Adolf Frederik Molengraaff|Molengraaff]] river system, was named after a Dutch biologist and geologist who traveled the region extensively in the late 19th century and first proposed the existence of this river system based on his observations in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Molengraaff |first1=G.

Brill }}&lt;/ref&gt; The river, arising between [[Belitung Island]] and Borneo, flowed in a northeasterly direction, where it collected waters from some rivers in Central Sumatra and the rivers in Western and Northern Borneo, before flowing into the South China Sea between the North and [[South Natuna]] Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanebuth |first=Till |last2=Stattegger |first2=Karl |last3=Grootes |first3=Pieter M. |date=11 October 1999 |title=Rapid Flooding of the Sunda Shelf: A Late-Glacial Sea-Level Record |url=http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/geodyn/tutorials/Physik_der_ErdeII/pdf/Hanebuth-etal2000_science.pdf |journal=Science |publisher=www.sciencemag.org |volume=288 |issue=12 MAY 20 |pages=1034 |doi= |access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally the '''''Eastern Sunda''' river system'' emptied northern Java and southern Borneo, flowing in an easterly direction between Borneo and Java into the Java Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitten |first=T |author2=Soeriaatmadja, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17451">The criteria for '''residence for tax purposes''' vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and "residence" can be different for other, non-tax purposes. For individuals, [[Physical presence test|physical presence]] in a jurisdiction is the main test. Some jurisdictions also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety of other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of accommodation, family, and financial interests. For companies, some jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation based on its place of incorporation. Other jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation by reference to its place of management. Some jurisdictions use both a place-of-incorporation test and a place-of-management test.

[[Domicile (law)|Domicile]] is, in common law jurisdictions, a different legal concept to residence, though the two may lead to the same result.

The criteria for residence in [[Tax treaty|double taxation treaties]] may be different from those of domestic law. Residency in domestic law allows a country to create a tax claim based on the residence over a person, whereas in a double taxation treaty it has the effect of restricting such tax claim in order to avoid [[double taxation]]. Residency or citizenship [[International taxation|taxation systems]] are typically linked with worldwide taxation, as opposed to [[territorial taxation]]. Therefore, it is particularly relevant when two countries simultaneously claim a person to be resident within their jurisdiction.

==In international tax law==
Double taxation treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/treaties/2014-model-tax-convention-articles.pdf|title=OECD Model Tax Convention (2014 version)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other relevant models are the UN Model Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/UN_Model_2011_Update.pdf|title=UN Model Convention (2011 version)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of treaties with developing countries and the US Model Convention,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/Treaty-US%20Model-2016.pdf|title=US Model Convention (2016 version)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of treaties negotiated by the United States.

=== OECD and UN Model Convention ===
The OECD Model Convention and the UN Model Convention are identical. They first provide for a definition of "resident of a Contracting State":
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition is followed by "tie-breaker" rules for individuals and non-individuals, which result in the person being considered resident in only one of the countries:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
   2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:
:a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a '''permanent home''' available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer ('''centre of vital interests''');
:b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an '''habitual abode''';
:c) if he has a habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a '''national''';
:d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by '''mutual agreement'''.{{paragraph break}}
      3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its '''place of effective management''' is situated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== US Model Convention ===
The US Model Convention is similar to the OECD and UN Model Convention with respect to residency of individuals. However, if non-individuals are considered to be residents of two countries, the default result is that they shall be considered resident of none for the purposes of claiming the benefits of the tax treaty. The countries will engage in mutual agreement procedures to reach a decision. Therefore, domestic taxation will continue as normal until an agreement is reached.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== BEPS ===

==== Action 6 ====
The [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project developed by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and endorsed by the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-about.htm|title = About Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; reached a critical milestone in October 2015, where final deliverables for 15 Actions were presented. Paragraph 48 of Action 6's final deliverable indicated a new wording for the "tie-breaker" relating to non-individuals, whereas it will no longer be automatically determined in the forthcoming revision of the model.&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1787/9789264241695-en|Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances, Action 6 - 2015 Final Report]]
&lt;/ref&gt; According to the new wording, the "tie-breaker" will depend entirely on mutual agreement between both countries:&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting State, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by '''mutual agreement''' the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption form tax provided by this Convention except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Action 15 ====
Pending work on BEPS Action 15, concerning the development of a 'Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties' may result on the amendment of a large number of existing treaties to reflect, particularly, the new wording in Action 6. There are currently a considerable number of counties involved in this instrument's negotiation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-for-beps-tax-treaty-measures-the-ad-hoc-group.htm|title=Multilateral instrument for BEPS tax treaty measures: the Ad hoc Group - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still unclear what changes and what countries will agree to the changes. The work on the multilateral instrument will be concluded and open of signature in December 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-frequentlyaskedquestions.htm#Action15|title=BEPS - Frequently Asked Questions - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==
{{see also|Taxation in the United Kingdom#Residence and domicile}}

===In the United Kingdom for companies===
A company is generally treated as resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes if it is incorporated in the United Kingdom or, if the company is not incorporated in the United Kingdom, if its central management and control are exercised in the United Kingdom. "Central management and control" refers to the highest level of oversight, usually as exercised by the board, rather than day-to-day management.&lt;ref&gt;For HMRC views see SP 1/90 and the International Tax Handbook chapters 3 and 4. For a statement of judicial views, see “Control of Special Purpose Vehicles” (John Chadwick) [2007] Jersey &amp; Guernsey Law Review 153.{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811062039/http://www.jerseylaw.je/publications/jerseylawreview/ |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }} For general studies, see Corporate Residence and International Taxation (Robert Couzin, IBFD 2002); Stephen Brandon QC’s Taxation of Non-UK Companies and their Shareholders (Key Haven Publications, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom for individuals===
An individual who spends more than 183 days in the UK in a tax year is UK resident.&lt;ref&gt;Section 831(1) Income Tax Act 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, there are no clear statutory guidelines. The question of whether someone is UK resident is a question of fact and degree, to be determined "on all the circumstances of the case."&lt;ref&gt;Gaines-Cooper v HMRC [2007] STC (SCD) 23 at [165].&lt;/ref&gt;  The vagueness of this test has often been criticised. Viscount Sumner said in Levene v IRC:

:The words "resident in the United Kingdom", "... guide the subject remarkably little as to the limits within which he must pay and beyond which he is free. .. The Legislature has, however, left the language of the Acts substantially as it was in [1801], nor can I confidently say that the decided cases have always illuminated matters. In substance persons are chargeable or exempt, as the case may be, according as they are deemed by this body of Commissioners or that to be resident or the reverse, whatever resident may mean in the particular circumstances of each case. The tribunal thus provided is neither bound by the findings of other similar tribunals in other cases nor is it open to review, so long as it commits no palpable error of law, and the Legislature practically transfers to it the function of imposing taxes on individuals, since it empowers them in terms so general that no one can be certainly advised in advance whether he must pay or can escape payment.&lt;ref&gt;Levene v IRC 13 TC 486 at p.502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Codification Committee concluded:

:an enquirer can only be told that the question whether he is resident or not is a question of fact for the Commissioners but that by the study of the effect of a large body of case law he ''may'' [emphasis added] be able to make an intelligent forecast of their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Income Tax Codification Committee Report 1936 Cmd.5131 pp.34–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Chartered Institute of Taxation concluded:

:the law determining whether an individual is resident in the UK is a mess.&lt;ref&gt;“Residence for tax purposes” 14 November 2007 accessible www.kessler.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of days present in the UK is not a decisive factor (unless the number of days exceeds 183 in a tax year).  In one case a foreigner who spent 5 months in the UK was held not UK resident.&lt;ref&gt;IRC v Zorab 11 TC 289.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] someone who exceeds 90 days on a four-year average is UK resident, but considerable emphasis is given to the fact that someone who averages less than 90 days may also be UK resident.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC 6 para 1.2, 1.5.13, 1.5.22, 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2009/10, the vagueness of the law did not seem to matter because HMRC published relatively clear guidelines in document IR20. That document has been withdrawn from 2009/10 and replaced with the much vaguer guidance in HMRC 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/hmrc6.pdf|title=Tax on foreign income: rules for the tax year ending 5 April 2013 - GOV.UK|website=www.hmrc.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HMRC currently argue that they are not bound by the terms of IR20 for years prior to 2009/10.  Whether that is correct is currently the subject of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines-Cooper v HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;  It is clear that HMRC are not in any way bound by the terms of HMRC 6, which contains a very full disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC6 section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Germany==
All tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. This would include [[salary]], [[dividend]]s, etc. earned from one's [[limited company]]. Generally, individuals are deemed to be tax resident if they are physically present in Germany for more than six months in any one [[calendar year]] or for a consecutive period of six months over a calendar year-end. This ruling is applied retrospectively so presence in Germany from 1 March to 30 November, for example, would make one a German tax resident and therefore subject to German tax on the worldwide income for the entire period rather than just from the beginning of the seventh month.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An individual can also be deemed tax resident if they acquire an abode in Germany. This can include renting, as opposed to purchasing, a property but only if the duration of the lease is deemed to be more than temporary. For this reason, to avoid German tax residency, short-term (such as three months) should be taken out wherever possible.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Non-resident individuals are taxed on German-source income only. In the case of salary and benefits from your limited company, the source is German since the duties of the employment are being performed in Germany. However, dividends from your limited company (assuming this is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in Germany: see below) would be from a non-German source regardless of where the dividends are received. There is, therefore, scope for tax mitigation here if one does not become a German tax resident (although non-German taxes may also need to be considered).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==In France==

In France, taxpayers are either "domiciled" in France or are "non-resident". Domiciled individuals are subject to French tax on worldwide income, but non-residents are not taxed on foreign-source income. Many treaty exemptions may apply, however (e.g. foreign-source trading or rental income). Under Article 4B of the French Tax Code (''Code Général des Impôts''), an individual is resident in France for tax purposes if:
* they have a home (''foyer'') or their principal place of physical presence in France,
* they have their professional activity in France, unless such activity is only ancillary, or
* they have the centre of their economic interests in France.

French courts have ruled that the principal place of physical presence test is only applicable where the "home" test cannot be applied. A "home" is to be construed as the place where the taxpayer normally lives, without any regard being given to the taxpayer's temporary stays in another country. As the "home" test is concerned with where the taxpayer's family ties are (i.e. where the spouse and children live), this test is highly unlikely to apply to single individuals. Consequently, the principal place of physical presence test should be viewed as primarily applicable to single individuals only.

"Principal place of physical presence" covers a wider range of situations that a basic 183-day rule would have. This is because the taxpayer's physical presence in France in a given calendar year will be tested against his presence in another country. Perpetual travelers must therefore be able to demonstrate that they have resided in a foreign country for a longer period in the relevant calendar year.

==In the Russian Federation==
In [[Russia|Russian Federation]] all tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. Individuals are deemed to be tax residents if they are physically present in Russia for more than 183 days during consecutive period of 12 months. The period of presence in Russia is not interrupted in case individual is out of the country for less than six months for educational purposes or for medical treatment. Foreign servants and civil servants that were sent abroad for work purposes are deemed tax residents no matter how long they really are present in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;IRC of Russian Federation, part 2, section 8, chapter 23, clause 207&lt;/ref&gt;
