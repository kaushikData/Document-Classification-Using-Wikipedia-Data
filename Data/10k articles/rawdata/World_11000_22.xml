'''2moro''' is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[boyband]], whose members are identical twins Anthony Guo (郭彥均) and Angus Guo (郭彥甫). The twins are graduates from [[Taipei Physical Education College]].

The twins got their first taste of stardom in their third year of school, when an advertising company was seeking two similar-looking persons for the filming of a sportswear commercial, and found them a good choice. Before recording their first album, they had worked with female group [[S.H.E]] in the film ''[[Reaching for the Stars (TV series)|Reaching For The Stars]]'' (真命天女) and with [[Singapore]]an actors in the [[Mediacorp]] drama production ''Rainbow Connections'' (舞出彩虹).

They released their first album, ''Twins' First Disc'' (雙胞胎的初回盤), on 6 January 2006. The album features 11 songs, and the hit song ''Exciting 2006'' (刺激2006) is composed from excerpts of 23 songs by other singers such as [[Stefanie Sun]], [[Leehom Wang]] and [[F4 (band)|F4]], with each line an excerpt from a different song. A second song from their album, ''Holding Your Hand'' (牵着你) enjoyed a stay of two weeks on Singapore's [[Y.E.S. 93.3 FM]] music charts, reaching the 19th spot for the week of 26 February 2006. A third song, ''Shabu Shabu'', is a Chinese cover of ''[[Dragostea din Tei]]'' by [[O-Zone]].

Both brothers currently co-host a variety show 食尚玩家(Super Taste) on TVBS Entertainment Channel and TVBS-Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://www.supertaste.com.tw/ 食尚玩家 官网.

'''"Aava"''' ("Open landscape") is a song by [[Edea (musical group)|Edea]], which was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]].

The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following [[Belgium]]'s [[Mélanie Cohl]] with "[[Dis oui]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Lars A. Fredriksen|Lars Fredriksen]] with "[[Alltid sommer]]". At the close of voting, it had received 22 points, placing 15th in a field of 25, thus relegating Finland from participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]].

The song consists largely of the repetition of the phrase "open landscape wide", taking advantage of the sounds of the Finnish language (in which the phrase is rendered ''"avaa maa avara"''. It thus stands as something of a one-off in Contest history, and is regarded with interest by many fans of the Contest. It is not the song with the briefest lyric in contest history, that distinction being held by [[Norway]]'s [[Secret Garden (duo)|Secret Garden]] with "[[Nocturne (Secret Garden song)|Nocturne]]", but it does hold the record for the fewest different words, a total of 6.

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]] by [[Nina Åström]] with "[[A Little Bit (Nina Åström song)|A Little Bit]]".

== Biography ==
In 1897 Alfred Ritscher made his first trip as a cabin boy on the Bremen ship "Emily". In 1903 he passed his helmsman exams and earned his master's certificate in 1907. At the beginning of 1912, Ritscher gained a place in the newly created Seehandbuchwerk of the Navy Office.

Alfred Ritscher was skipper of the "German Arctic Expedition" of 1912-1913, under the command of [[Herbert Schröder-Stranz]], which departed from [[Tromsø]] in the motor vessel "Herzog Ernst" for a preliminary reconnaissance  of a planned navigation of the [[Northeast Passage]]. He also took over the leadership of the airborne survey of the expedition and obtained a pilot licence. The expedition failed whilst attempting the crossing of the [[Nordaustlandet]] island in northeastern [[Spitsbergen]] archipelago, because of poor equipment, misjudged weather, and starting too late in the year. Ritscher marched over {{convert|210|km}} in seven and a half days, to the settlement of [[Longyearbyen]]. Search expeditions were sent after his message about the fate of the Schroeder-Stranz expedition and saved six of the fourteen missing expedition members.

During the [[First World War]], Ritscher made reconnaissance flights in support of Marine units in Flanders. After the war he worked as an independent businessman and in 1925 worked as a specialist in aerial navigation with Lufthansa.

In 1934, Ritscher divorced his Jewish wife Susan ''née'' Loewenthal, in order not to endanger his career in the War Department.

Also in 1934, Ritscher became an officer in command of the Navy. In 1938, he became head of the German Antarctic Expedition 1938/39, with a mandate to set up a base for the German whaling fleet, carry out air exploration and claim territory. During this expedition he flew over an area of about {{convert|600,000|km2}} with two  [[Dornier Do J II]] flying boats, launched from a steam catapult on the expedition ship. Around 11,000 aerial photographs were taken.

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Ritscher was preparing another expedition with improved ski-planes, which was cancelled. After the Second World War Ritscher continued as chairman of the "Association for the promotion of the Archive for Polar Research Inc.," which was renamed in 1959 to the West German Society of Polar Research Association.

== Awards ==
* 1959: Grand [[Federal Cross of Merit]]
* 1959: Silver Kirchenpauer Medal of the Geographical Society in Hamburg
* The Ritschergipfel and the Ritscher Highlands in East Antarctica have been named after him.

===Anglophone Africa and Caribbean===
{{Further|Asian South Africans|Indo-Caribbean|Chinese Caribbean|Indo-African|Afro-Asians}}

In parts of [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] [[Africa]], especially [[East Africa]] and in parts of the [[Caribbean]], the term "Asian" is more commonly associated with people of [[South Asia]]n origin, particularly [[India]]ns, [[Pakistan]]is, [[Bangladesh]]is and [[Sri Lanka]]ns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In South Africa the term Asian is used in the pan-continental sense. Due to the high number of Indians in South Africa, in official documentation the designation "Indian" is used to refer to both South- and East-Asians. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race, Ethnicity and Language in South Africa|url=https://welections.wordpress.com/guide-to-the-2014-south-african-election/race-ethnicity-and-language-in-south-africa/|website=World Elections|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}}

The [[Australian Census]] includes [[Central Asia]]. The [[Census in Australia|Australian Census]] includes four regions of Asia in its official definition. Defined by the 2006–2011 Australian Census, three ''broad groups'' have the word Asian included in their name: [[Central Asia|''Central'']] and [[South Asia|''Southern Asian'']], [[Southeast Asia|''South-East Asian'']] and [[East Asia|''North-East Asian'']].  Russians are classified as ''Southern and Eastern Europeans'' while Middle Easterners are classified as ''North African and Middle Easterners''.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics.

In 1968, an Asian activist conference decided on favoring the name "[[Asian American]]" over the competing terms: "[[yellow people|yellow]]", "[[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]", "Asiatic" and "[[Orient]]al", since the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] at the meeting thought they were "[[brown people|brown]]" rather than "yellow" and the conference thought the term "Oriental" was [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], since they originate from lands "east" only from Europe's standpoint and, since the term "Oriental" suggested to them "passivity".&lt;ref&gt;Yen Le Espiritu.

Earlier Census forms from 1980 and prior listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups along with ''White'' and ''Black or Negro''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.ipums.org/usa/voliii/items1980.shtml 1980 Census: Instructions to Respondents], republished by [[IPUMS|Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]], Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota at www.ipums.org Accessed 19 Nov 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Asian Americans were classified as "other".&lt;ref name=GordonLee&gt;Lee, Gordon.

By the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], ''[[Asian Pacific American|Asian or Pacific Islander]] (API)'' was included as an explicit category, although respondents had to select one particular ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.ipums.org/usa/voliii/items1990.shtml 1990 Census: Instructions to Respondents], republished by [[IPUMS|Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]], Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota at www.ipums.org Accessed 19 Nov 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Terrance Claudett, Bennett.

The 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census Bureau definition of the Asian [[Race (human classification)|race]] is: "people having origins in any of the original peoples of the [[Far East]], [[Southeast Asia]], or the [[Indian subcontinent]] (for example, [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippine Islands]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]])".&lt;ref name="USCensus2000Asian"&gt;Barnes, Jessica S. and Bennett, Claudett E.

In 1930 and 1940, ''[[Indian American]]s'' were identified as a separate race, ''[[Hindu]]'', and in 1950 and 1960 they were racially classified as ''Other Race'', and then in 1970 they were classified as ''White''. Since 1980, Indians and all other South Asians have been classified as part of the [[Race (United States Census)|Asian ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Gibson and Kay Jung.

See footnote 6 in paper&lt;/ref&gt;  Sociologist Madhulika Khandelwal described how "''....as a result of [[activism]], South Asians came to be included as 'Asians' in the census only in the 80's. Prior to that many South Asians had been checking 'Caucasian' or 'Other'.''"&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, Sunu P.

Accessed August 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Respondents can also report their specific ancestry, e.g.: [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawan]], etc.  Someone reporting these ancestries but no race would be classified as "Asian". Unlike South Asians, [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]], [[Israeli Americans]], [[Arab American]]s, [[Armenian American]]s, [[Assyrian American]]s, [[Kurdish American]]s, [[Georgian American]]s, [[Chechen American]]s, [[Turkish American]]s, [[Azerbaijani Americans]], [[Iranian American]]s and Central Asian Americans have not lobbied to be included as Asians by the [[Race (United States Census)|U.S. Census Board]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.aaiusa.org/foundation/355/not-quite-white Not Quite White: Race Classification and the Arab American Experience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927220911/http://www.aaiusa.org/foundation/355/not-quite-white |date=September 27, 2006 }},  Arab American Institute, 1997, September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian and Pacific Islanders in the United States. 1990. September 1, 2006.

&lt;!-- Misinterpretation of source
As late as 2001, they were considered by most Americans to be the same racial group as Asians due to a perception of their implicit contrast to "whiteness".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
--&gt;
However, in the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 US Census]],  the Asian or Pacific Islander category was separated into two categories, "Asian" and "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1997|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html|work=Whitehouse.gov|publisher=Office of Management and Budget|title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity|quote=The Native Hawaiians presented compelling arguments that the standards must facilitate the production of data to describe their social and economic situation and to monitor discrimination against Native Hawaiians in housing, education, employment, and other areas. Under the current standards for data on race and ethnicity, Native Hawaiians comprise about three percent of the Asian and Pacific Islander population. By creating separate categories, the data on the Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander groups will no longer be overwhelmed by the aggregate data of the much larger Asian groups. Native Hawaiians will comprise about 60 percent of the new category. The Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population groups are well defined; moreover, there has been experience with reporting in separate categories for the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population groups. The 1990 census included "Hawaiian," "Samoan," and "Guamanian" as response categories to the race question. In addition, two of the major tests conducted as part of the current review (the NCS and the RAETT) used "Hawaiian" and/or "Native Hawaiian," "Samoan," "Guamanian," and "Guamanian or Chamorro" as response options to the race question. These factors facilitate breaking apart the current category.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab States of the Persian Gulf===
In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], the term "Asian" generally refers to people of [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n descent due to the large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]], [[Overseas Pakistani|Pakistani]] and [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipino]] expatriate population in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/emiratis-vs-asians-which-drivers-crash-most-2015-02-15-1.580758 The source discusses car accidents amongst Asians, Emiratis and other Arabs in the UAE.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuwaitasians.com/ "Kuwait Asians" is a community website for the Indian, Sri Lankan, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Filipino expatriate population in Kuwait.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatar-tribune.com/viewnews.aspx?n=006E99B7-6F47-4B4A-BFDC-7D50DE7F3401&amp;d=20150604 The source discusses the Asian Town complex in Qatar that was created for the Asian expatriate community from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are instances where the term is used solely to refer to those of South Asian descent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x-75n5Iaz5wC&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=asians+in+the+uae+indian+pakistani+filipino&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tWHs9xarfx&amp;sig=ZH_dmWYSCuBfNQKBCdasWBrJ-KA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix5K3ItKjKAhWBJpQKHRzaCAk4ChDoAQgoMAM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Time Out Dubai'' is a book written by local experts on travel in the UAE and the authors use the words "Asian" and "Filipino" separately.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 book about [[forensic anthropology]] said that the "''leading handbook in human [[osteology]]''" has kept on using the "''traditional terms''"' of "''caucasoid, mongoloid, negroid''", but "''one of the most popular recent forensic anthropology textbooks''" has changed to the "''more current, politically correct terminology of Asian, white, black, Native American''".&lt;!--This information is in the first paragraph of page 105 and the last paragraph of page 104 which starts with "Many forensic anthropologists recognize six".--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, R. &amp; Bachman, D. (2009). The Use of Forensic Anthropology (2nd ed.). USA: CRC Press. Pages 104 &amp; 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugénia Maria Guedes Pinto Antunes da Cunha of the Department of Anthropology, [[University of Coimbra]], [[Portugal]], said there has been a modern trend in "most of the [[forensic anthropology]] literature" to "rename" the term "[[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]", a term in which she includes the "North American Indian", with the term "Asian" or "Asiatic".&lt;ref name="Cunha" /&gt; Antunes da Cunha said that, even though the "terminology" has changed, the "underlying assumptions are the same".&lt;ref name="Cunha"&gt;Aurore Schmitt, Eugénia Maria Guedes Pinto Antunes da Cunha, and João Pinheiro. (2006). Forensic Anthropology and Medicine: Complementary Sciences from Recovery to Cause of Death. Humana Press. {{ISBN|1-59745-099-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen T. Taylor]] [[Forensic arts|forensic art]] professor at the [[FBI Academy]], [[Quantico, Virginia]], said that the term "Asian-derived" is a modern-day [[euphemism]] for the "[[Mongoloid race]]" and it includes "Native Americans" and "various Asian groups".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, K.T. (2001). Forensic Art and Illustration. CRC Press LLC. pp. 60 {{ISBN|0-8493-8118-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Kyung-Ran Jung et al. ([[Korean language|Korean]]:전경란) of the Department of Laboratory Medicine, [[University of Ulsan]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] used the term "Asian populations" for the group he also referred to as the "Asian-[[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]" in which he included [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]] for a [[meta-analysis]] of [[allele]]s in relation to [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kyung Ran Jun, Sung-Eun Choi, Choong-Hwan Cha, Heung-Bum Oh, corresponding author Yong-Seok Heo, Hong-Yup Ahn, and Kwan-Jeh Lee. J Korean Med Sci. Meta-analysis of the Association between HLA-DRB1 Allele and Rheumatoid Arthritis Susceptibility in Asian Populations. 2007 December; 22(6): 973–980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Marta Mirazón Lahr]] of the Department of Biological Anthropology at [[Cambridge University]] said "all" "Asian populations" are "grouped under the name [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lahr M.

Masniari Novita of the Biomedical Department of [[List of universities in Indonesia|Jember University]], [[Jember Regency|Jember]], [[Indonesia]], said "Asiatics" are part of the "[[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]]" race while "[[South Asian ethnic groups|Asians from the Indian Subcontinent]]" are part of the "[[Caucasoid race|Caucasian]]" race.&lt;ref&gt;Novita, Masniari.

Matt Cartmill of the Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, [[Duke University]], [[United States]], said "geography has little to do with the race concept in its actual application", since "Asian individuals [can be] born in the same geographical region" as other races.&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bamshad et al. of the Department of Human Genetics, [[University of Utah]], found that "107 [[sub-Saharan African]], 67 [[East Asian]] and 81 [[Western European]]" individuals genetically clustered with "ancestry from a single population" at levels of "almost 100%", but among "263 individuals from [[South India]]" the "proportion of ancestry shared with Europeans and Asians varies widely".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bamshad, Stephen Wooding, Benjamin A. Salisbury and J. Claiborne Stephens. (2004). DECONSTRUCTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENETICS AND RACE. Nature Publishing Group. (5) pp. 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra Soo-Jin Lee ([[Korean language|Korean]]:이수진) of the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology at [[Stanford University]], [[United States of America]], said that the reasoning behind "Asian" being a "race" as defined by the US Census is "difficult to determine" because it includes "[[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asians]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Lee, Sandra S.

Willett Enos Rotzell professor of Botany and Zoology at the [[Drexel University College of Medicine#History|Hahnemann Medical College]] used the term "Asian" "race" to refer to the race he alternatively called the "[[Yellow people|Yellow]] or [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] race".&lt;ref name="Rotzell"&gt;Willett Enos Rotzell.

(2011). Writing: A Manual for the Digital Age, Brief (2nd ed.). Wadsworth Publishing. pp. 431. {{ISBN|978-0495833376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 article about Asian [[rhinoplasty]], in an [[academic journal]] about [[plastic surgery]], Clyde H. Ishii, the article's author, said, "''Although many countries use the term 'Asian' referring to people living on that continent, in reality, Asian usually refers to peoples of [[East Asia|East]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]], and [[South Asia]]. Inhabitants of [[Western Asia|Southwest Asia]], such as [[Arabs]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], are more commonly designated [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle Easterners]].&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The term Asian as used in this article refers to people from Asia who have a [[Mongoloid]] background ([[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Filipinos]], [[Indonesians]], and others).''"&lt;!--The preceding information is in the first paragraph of the right column of page 1/8 of the PDF document.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1097/GOX.0000000000000081 |pmid=25289326|pmc=4174207|year=2014|last1=Ishii|first1=Clyde H.|title=Current Update in Asian Rhinoplasty|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

'''Candidatus philologiae''' (male) or '''Candidata philologiae''' (female), often abbreviated '''cand.philol.''' is an [[academic degree]] in Arts and Letters at [[Education in Denmark|Danish]] and [[Higher education in Norway|Norwegian]] universities.

In Norway, the degree usually required six years of study at the time it was abolished (2007). It is considered an entry-level scientific degree for careers in academia (qualifying for positions as assistant professor or universitetslektor), as doctorates traditionally are awarded at a later stage in the career to senior academics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4813">A '''Cigarette Camp''' was one of a number of temporary U.S. Army "[[tent city|tent cities]]" situated principally around the French ports of [[Le Havre]]&lt;ref&gt;103rd Infantry Division: [http://www.103didww2assn.org/Albums_Remember/VOL%20VI/Toohig,%20Michael%20F.pdf Albums] "The major ports had camps for embarkation both ways. They were
called Cigarette Camps from their names. When the ports opened up that is where they would keep people and then send them to the front. Then when the war ended that is how they sent people out through the Cigarette Camps. Famous Cigarette Camps were in Marseilles and Le Havre."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marseilles]]&lt;ref&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cigintro.html Cigarette Camps] "And there were additional embarkation camps in Southern France, north of Marseilles, and, of course, Camp Tophat near Antwerp, Belgium."&lt;/ref&gt; following their respective captures in the wake of the Allied [[D-Day]] invasion in June 1944, and [[Operation Dragoon]] in July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer and Mitchell, Victory Ships and Tankers: [http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/Private_Frederick_C_Murphy_HAER_Report.pdf HAER Report]. "The ship made crossings in 1946 carrying troops between the European Theater of Operations, especially Le Havre, France, and New York City, New York. From Le Havre, the ship often left from the area known as the 'Cigarette Camps'.", p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  

Le Havre camps were located in what the Army designated the "Red Horse" staging area and named after popular brands, including Camps [[Lucky Strike]], [[Old Gold (cigarette)|Old Gold]], and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]].&lt;ref name=sky&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cigintro.html The Cigarette Camps: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Another series of temporary camps set up at the same time in France was named after United States cities, referred to as "'''City Camps'''".&lt;ref&gt;Sklyighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/citycamps/Skylighters.org City Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; A single Cigarette Camp, [[Tophat]], was located in Antwerp, Belgium.

The Cigarette Camps were administered by the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Infantry Division]], headquartered at [[Bois-Guillaume]], near Rouen.&lt;ref&gt;89th Infantry Division: [http://www.89infdivww2.org/combat/vevj3.htm Cigarette Camps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of names==
The names of cigarettes and cities were chosen for two reasons: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, and primarily, for security. Referring to the camps without an indication of their geographical location went a long way to ensuring that the enemy would not know precisely where they were. Anybody eavesdropping or listening to radio traffic would think that cigarettes were being discussed or the camp was stateside, especially regarding the city camps. 

Secondly, there was a subtle psychological reason, the premise being that troops heading into battle wouldn't mind staying at a place where cigarettes must be plentiful and troops about to depart for combat would be somehow comforted in places with familiar names of cities back home (Camp Atlanta, Camp Baltimore, Camp New York, and Camp Pittsburgh, among others).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The camps varied widely in size, from around 2,000 in capacity to nearly 60,000 at the largest of the "Big Three", Camps Philip Morris, Old Gold, and Lucky Strike.

==French camps==
The nine Cigarette Camps included:

*Camp Home Run, Sanvic: 2,000
*Camp Wings, on the grounds of the Blaville Aerodrome: 2,250
*Camp Pall Mall, at Etretat: 7,700
*Camp Herbert Tareyton, located in the Forest of Montgeon: 16,400
*Camp Twenty Grand, at [[Duclair]]: 20,000
*Camp Philip Morris, [[Gainneville]]: 35,000
*Camp Old Gold, at [[Ourville-en-Caux|Ourville]]: 35,000
*Camp Lucky Strike, located between [[Cany-Barville|Cany]] and [[Saint-Valery]]: 58,000
*Camp Chesterfield: (unknown)

==Belgian camp==
* Camp Tophat was a "Cigarette Camp" located near [[Antwerp]], Belgium, named after a popular American brand.&lt;ref name=top&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/camptophat.html Camp Tophat]&lt;/ref&gt; Exact capacity is unknown, but the single camp fielded "thousands of black 20-man tents".&lt;ref name=top/&gt;

==Role shift==
By war's end, both Cigarette and City camps' roles had shifted from gateways to combat staging GIs for repatriation to the U.S., processing liberated American [[POW]]s, and temporarily confining German POWs.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Post-war, many of the camps survived with yet new roles, including housing for [[displaced person]]s at least into the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cmptareyton.html Camp Herbert Tareyton]. Displaced persons were living in former American Nissen huts in 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

South America is home to 400 million people, of which 180 million is composed of [[White Latin American|Whites]] with several different European extractions and other lineages, including 17 million [[Arab diaspora|Levantine Arabs]], mostly Christians from the [[Levant]] region, (found in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Chile), 440 thousand [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] Jews (mostly Argentina and Brazil, with both figuring among the top 10 largest [[Jewish diaspora]]s) and 1.3 million [[Crypto-Jews]] or [[Anusim]]. 

According to genetic tests, the most prevalent DNA marker in the continent considering Whites and all the mixed peoples are Iberian genes (Portuguese and Spaniard). After [[Iberians|Iberian]] (i.e.[[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], [[Castilian people|Castilian]] and [[Catalans|Catalan]]), the main European ethnicities are [[Italian diaspora|Italian]], [[German diaspora|German]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic]], followed by [[French people|French]] and [[Dutch diaspora|Dutch]]. 

Brazil has 31 million Italians and Argentina 20, Uruguay, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador also have considerable Italian diasporas. Brazil has 15.7 million Germans, Austrians, Luxembourgers and Swiss (second largest German diaspora after US) and Argentina 3.5 million consisting mostly of Russian Volga Germans. Other German groups can be found in Chile, Bolivia (mostly [[Mennonites in Bolivia|Mennonites]]), Paraguay (mostly German-Brazilians but including [[Mennonites in Paraguay|Mennonites]]), Peru, Uruguay and colonies in Venezuela. 

Brazil has the largest Slavic population with the number of [[Poles]] &lt;ref&gt; http://brasilescola.uol.com.br/geografia/composicao-etnica-brasileira.htm &lt;/ref&gt; reaching 3 million people, followed by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Russians]] but comprising many other nationalities. Argentina following with the second largest number of Slavs, comprises a sizeable [[Croats|Croatian]] population, although Chile’s Croatian community is the largest outside Croatia. 

Brazil has the largest Dutch and Scandinavian (mostly [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]) populations as well as the largest [[Lithuanian diaspora]] outside [[Baltic states]]. A small number of [[Boer]]s or White [[Afrikaners]] migrated to South America during the 20th century, heading especially to Argentina and Brazil. And Lithuanian refugees fleeing the Nazi invasion and Soviet annexation in WW2 also formed communities in Colombia and Venezuela.
Brazil also comprises the largest [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], Estonian and [[Finnish people|Finnish]] diasporas, being followed by Argentina in terms of nationalities of [[Uralic languages]]. Argentina has the largest [[French people|French]] and Irish populations, respectively 6 million and 1 million, while [[Argentine Patagonia]] is home to [[Patagonian Welsh|Welsh]] and [[Swedish Argentine|Swedish]] colonies. Brazil and Chile are also home to considerable [[French people|French]] ancestry populations. A great part of the French immigrants in Chile were of [[Basque Chileans|Basque]] descent, with the number of Basques estimated at around 4 million. Chile has 800 thousand [[British Chilean|British]] and Irish people. Brazil and Argentina also have sizable [[British Latin American]] populations, being the responsible for the introduction of football in the 19th century. 

The number of [[Gypsies]] or Romani people revolves around 1.120 million, with a possibility of being much higher, being spread all over the continent. Most of the Romanis in Brazil are of Eastern European and Baltic background, while most of the Gypsies in Argentina, Chile and Colombia came from Spain. 

South America is also home to 124 million [[Castizo]], Mestizo or [[Caboclo]] people (citizens whose DNA is mostly European spanning from 65 to 90% European genes with considerable Indigenous admixture) and 27 million people with pure Indigenous extraction, mostly found in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and parts of Argentina. Mestizos make the majority in Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. 


[[Black Latin American|Black]] phenotype and Mulatto population are respectively 18 and 48 million, when combined 66 million. Mulattos have a range of 60 to 80% European genes and are mostly found in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana where French ancestry Mulattos are the majority. To a much smaller percentage degree they can be found in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. [[The Guianas]] region where today are the independent states of Guyana and Suriname as well as France overseas department of French Guiana is home to the [[Maroon]]s (formerly called "Bush Negroes") who are of African descent, with some Amerindian admixture. The Maroons, descendants of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the Maroni River. 

Most East Indian ([[Tamil people|Tamil]]) Hindus and Muslims live in Guyana and Suriname which is also home to a large Muslim [[Javanese people|Javanese]] community. East Indians are the vast majority in Guyana, followed by Blacks and also the majority in Suriname where they are followed by Maroons and Creoles. 

Indonesians from the island of Java make 13.7% of Suriname's population which figures as 275 thousand [[Javanese people]]. [[Dutch Surinamese]] or [[Boeroes]] make the minority of the country due to the fact that most of the Dutch emigrated to Brazil or returned to the Netherlands after Suriname's independence. 

South America is home to over 5 million [[Asians]], mostly [[East Asians]], with Brazil and Peru having the largest [[Asian Latin American]] populations. Peru and Venezuela have greatly numerous 19th century Chinese [[coolie]] populations with almost 1.9 million Chinese people combined. Peru itself is home to over 1.4 million [[Chinese Peruvian]]s, mostly arriving as [[indentured servant]]s. The Asian-Brazilian population is mostly composed of Japanese descendants and Japanese nationals, but it also comprises over 250 thousand Chinese and 50 thousand [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] recent immigrants. Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador also follow in numbers of Chinese immigrants. 

Brazil is home to the largest [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] and Korean populations in the continent with respectively 1.8 million and 140 thousand people. The Nipponic or Nipponese population in Brazil is the largest [[Japanese diaspora]] outside Japan. Koreans can also be found in Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay and Chile. Peru is home to 160 thousand Japanese descendants, and Nipponese populations are also found in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and Venezuela. Argentina is home to the largest [[Filipino people|Filipino]] population with 15 thousand people.

Other Asian nationalities can be found in smaller numbers, such as South Asians or East Indians, Southeast Asians and Central Asians. Brazil has 5 thousand Vietnamese people, 10 thousand East Indians, as well as 5 thousand Afghans, and a small number of Iranians. Chile and Argentina also have small numbers of Southern Asians or East Indians, while being home to most Southeast Asians, mostly Filipino. 

Brazil is home to the largest [[White Latin American]] population in absolute numbers constituting 98 million people. Uruguay has the largest percentage with 90.7% being Caucasian or over 3 million people. Argentina equally corresponds to the second largest population and percentage with 39 million people, followed by Colombia with 18m, Venezuela 13.1m, Chile 9.5m, Peru 5.8m, Bolivia 2m, Paraguay 1.3m and Ecuador with 980 thousand. 

Roughly 14% of the population in French Guiana is of European ancestry, numbering at 35 thousand people. The vast majority of these are of French heritage, though there are also people of Dutch, British, Spanish and Portuguese ancestry. Countries that make part of South America but do not have Romance languages as their official national languages are [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and the [[Falkland Islands]]. 

Suriname has 2% of Caucasians or 12 thousand people, including Lebanese and Jews. Most Boeroes or Dutch Surinamese left after independence in 1975. There are less than 3 thousand Whites in Guyana where 0.5% of the population is counted as "others". The [[Falkland Islands]] have a low population density. 

According to the 2012 census, the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932, excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents. 
The Falklands are a homogeneous society, with the majority of inhabitants descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833. Other groups are English, French, Gibraltarian, Scandinavian, Saint Helenian, Chilean and Argentine.

===Indigenous peoples===

==== Colombia ====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Colombia}}
Colombia's indigenous peoples nonetheless encompass at least 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people.&lt;ref&gt;DANE 2005 national census&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/isa_etnic_minorities_col.pdf "Health equity and ethnic minorities in emergency situations"], Pier Paolo Balladelli, José Milton Guzmán, Marcelo Korc, Paula Moreno, Gabriel Rivera, The Commission on Social Health Determinants, [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Bogotá|Bogotá, Colombia]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of [[collective rights]] for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution. One of these is the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] culture, a subset of the larger [[Chibcha]] [[ethnic group]], famous for their use of [[gold]], which led to the legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''.

==== Ecuador ====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}
At the present the 25% of Ecuador's population is of indigenous heritage. Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the Caranqui, the [[Otavaleño]]s, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the [[Cañari]], and the Saraguro.

==== Peru ====
{{See also|Indigenous Peoples in Peru}}
Indigenous population in Peru make up around 34%. Native Peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, "the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}}, [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 UPF.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Embassy of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in Turkey''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti'nin Ankara Büyükelçiliği)
is the TRNC's only official [[embassy]] abroad as Turkey is the only nation thus far to recognize the [[TRNC]] as an independent state. TRNC has representative offices in other countries with semi-diplomatic status. 

This embassy was established in late 1983 shortly after Turkey signed a treaty with the TRNC recognizing the November 15 1983 [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].  The embassy itself is located in the [[Ankara]] suburb of [[Gaziosmanpaşa, Ankara|Gaziosmanpaşa]] (not to be confused by the [[Istanbul]] suburb of the same name).

The internationally recognized government of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] (''de facto'' the [[Greek Cypriot]] south of the island) has no diplomatic relations with Turkey as the government of Turkey does not recognize the legitimacy of the Republic of Cyprus.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Fazıl Can Korkut|tr}} was appointed as the TRNC's [[ambassador]] to Turkey in November 2014.

'''''Fair Stood the Wind for France''''' is a novel written by English author [[H. E. Bates]]. The novel was first published in 1944 and was Bates's first financial success. The title comes from the first line of "[[Agincourt (poem)|Agincourt]]", a poem by [[Michael Drayton]] (1563–1631).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/42557.html Fair Stood the Wind for France Book Review essays&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
The story concerns John Franklin, the pilot of a [[Wellington bomber]], who badly injures his arm when he crash-lands the aircraft in German-[[occupied France]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He and his crew make their way to an isolated farmhouse and are taken in by the family of a French farmer. Plans are made to smuggle them all back to Britain via [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled [[Marseille]] but Franklin's conditions worsens and he remains at the farm during the hot summer weeks that follow and falls in love with the farmer's daughter Françoise. Eventually they make the hazardous journey together by rowing boat, bicycle and train.

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into a 4-part television mini-series in 1980 for the [[BBC]], starring [[David Beames]] as Franklin and [[Cécile Paoli]] as Françoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Events ===
Taoiseach Brian Cowen gave the opening address,&lt;ref name="Farmleigh event to seek diaspora ideas"/&gt; talking about the concept of a smart economy.&lt;ref name="Diaspora gathering details unveiled"/&gt; A panel discussion then took place on the topic of "the global economy: positioning Ireland for the upturn" and this was followed by further panel discussions on "Ireland&amp;mdash;the innovation island", "promoting brand Ireland through our global cultural profile", "Ireland’s image abroad: what is it now, how can it be improved and what role can new media play" and "Ireland and its Diaspora: harnessing unique resource".&lt;ref name="Diaspora gathering details unveiled"/&gt;

Those attending also visited [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] for a meeting with [[President of Ireland]] [[Mary McAleese]] and Mary Coughlan presented a meal at [[Dublin Castle]].&lt;ref name="Martin sparks turf war with Coughlan over economy forum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaspora gathering details unveiled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="President praises delegates' efforts"/&gt;

Guests will also attend the [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] at [[Croke Park]] on 20 September.&lt;ref name="Diaspora gathering details unveiled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Government rallies Irish diaspora to help deliver the 'smart economy'"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Mulligan|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/government-rallies-irish-diaspora-to-help-deliver-the-smart-economy-1870835.html|title=Government rallies Irish diaspora to help deliver the 'smart economy'|date=2009-08-26|accessdate=2009-09-18|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheál Martin, whose constituency is [[Cork South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-Central]], described it as "a piece of opportunistic planning by yours truly in anticipation that [[Cork GAA|Cork]] would reach the final".&lt;ref name="Diaspora gathering details unveiled"&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Slattery|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0901/breaking56.htm|title=Diaspora gathering details unveiled|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-18|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote=The Taoiseach will be the only keynote speaker at the event, which opens on Friday the 18th with his address on the so-called smart economy.

The programme also includes a reception hosted by President McAleese at Áras an Uachtaráin, a dinner at Dublin Castle hosted by the Tánaiste, Mary Coughlan, and attendance at the All-Ireland football final at Croke Park. “That was a piece of opportunistic planning by yours truly in anticipation that Cork would reach the final,” Mr Martin said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan was ridiculed in the Irish media after crediting [[Albert Einstein]] for [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref name="Coughlan's no Einstein after gaffe at 'smart economy' launch"/&gt; At the launch on 17 September, she made the comparison "like Einstein explaining his theory of evolution".&lt;ref name="Coughlan's no Einstein after gaffe at 'smart economy' launch"&gt;{{cite web|author=Senan Molony|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/coughlans-no-einstein-after-gaffe-at-smart-economy-launch-1890227.html|title=Coughlan's no Einstein after gaffe at 'smart economy' launch|date=2009-09-18|accessdate=2009-09-18|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted comparisons with American politicians such as [[Dan Quayle]] and [[Sarah Palin]], with the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' referring to Coughlan in a derogatory manner as a "lovely girl" and saying she was "Ireland's own version" of Palin.&lt;ref name="Coughlan reveals she's no Einstein"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Doyle, POLITICAL REPORTER |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/coughlan--reveals-shes-no-einstein-1890624.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218052244/http://www.herald.ie/national-news/coughlan--reveals-shes-no-einstein-1890624.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-18 |title=Coughlan reveals she's no Einstein |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2009-09-18 |publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="After mixing up Darwin and Einstein, how long can we carry on with our laughing stock Tanaiste?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/calamity-coughlan-1890592.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217200631/http://www.herald.ie/opinion/calamity-coughlan-1890592.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-17 |title=After mixing up Darwin and Einstein, how long can we carry on with our laughing stock Tanaiste? |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2009-09-18 |publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The error came in the same week as she referred to her [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] coalition partners as "the vegetables" during an [[Irish language]] radio interview.&lt;ref name="Coughlan's no Einstein after gaffe at 'smart economy' launch"/&gt;

In an interview with [[Bloomberg Television]] at the Forum, shareholder [[Denis O'Brien]] said [[Independent News &amp; Media]] might shut down its flagship [[London]] newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' by the end of 2009,&lt;ref name="O'Brien sees London's Independent closed by Dec"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSLI32052720090918|title=O'Brien sees London's Independent closed by Dec|date=2009-09-18|accessdate=2009-09-18|publisher=[[Reuters]] | first=Andras | last=Gergely}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying it was "irrelevant" and that nobody wanted to read it.&lt;ref name="O'Brien claims 'irrelevant' Independent to fold by Christmas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Thomson|url=http://business.scotsman.com/medialeisure/O39Brien-claims-39irrelevant39-Independent-.5661729.jp|title=O'Brien claims 'irrelevant' Independent to fold by Christmas|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also advocated a Yes vote during the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|second Irish referendum]] on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], claiming it was "essential for setting Ireland on the path to growth".&lt;ref name="Schools bigger problem than banking’"/&gt;

Craig Barrett, former CEO and chairman of [[Intel Corporation]], warned delegates that Ireland was spending "far too little" on education and that "schools are a bigger problem than banking".&lt;ref name="Schools bigger problem than banking’"/&gt; Taoiseach Brian Cowen seemed to agree with Barrett.&lt;ref name="Schools bigger problem than banking’"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian O’Mahony and Stephen Rogers|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/home/schools-bigger-problem-than-banking-101323.html|title=Schools bigger problem than banking’|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Geldof said countries of a similar size to Ireland, some impoverished, were spending as much as 6 per cent on [[research and development]] but that Ireland spends just 2 per cent.&lt;ref name="Schools bigger problem than banking’"/&gt; He also said Mary Coughlan had "a lovely pair of legs" which caused her to blush.&lt;ref name="When Geldof told Mary that she had lovely legs, she should have used them to run a mile"&gt;{{cite web|author=Colette Fitzpatrick |url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/when-geldof-told-mary-that-she-had-lovely-legs-she-should-have-used-them-to-run-a-mile-1896792.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130220223315/http://www.herald.ie/opinion/when-geldof-told-mary-that-she-had-lovely-legs-she-should-have-used-them-to-run-a-mile-1896792.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-20 |title=When Geldof told Mary that she had lovely legs, she should have used them to run a mile |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2009-09-25 |publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day of the forum, Irish [[Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism]] [[Martin Cullen]] expressed his disagreement with proposed cuts in public sending which were suggested by the McCarthy Report.&lt;ref name="Forum: 'good ideas on the table'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0919/forum-business.html|title=Forum: 'good ideas on the table'|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullen criticises cuts proposals"/&gt; [[Neil Jordan]] said Ireland's culture had not disappointed the country in the same way as institutions such as the banks and the Church had done so.&lt;ref name="Forum: 'good ideas on the table'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullen criticises cuts proposals"/&gt; [[Denis O'Brien]] said Ireland's culture was the key to success, saying his [[Digicell]] group obtained a [[Samoa]]n licence because the [[Prime Minister of Samoa|Prime Minister]]'s education had come from Irish priests: "We are famous for our writers, our artists, our poets and we are not famous for much else".&lt;ref name="Cullen criticises cuts proposals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0919/breaking36.htm|title=Cullen criticises cuts proposals|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote=Businessman Denis O'Brien told the forum today Ireland's literary and musical heritage can be used to open business doors around the world and help seal deals in the face of economic crisis. "The fact that we have such a strong culture as a country really gives us one of the big advantages of any nation in the world," he said. "We are famous for our writers, our artists, our poets and we are not famous for much else," said the chairman of Digicel, adding that his cell phone group had got a licence to operate in Samoa because the country's prime minister had been educated by an Irish religious order.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singing &amp; dancing seen helping Ireland out of crisis"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carmel Crimmins|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSLJ46784220090919|title=Singing &amp; dancing seen helping Ireland out of crisis|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a consensus amongst those attending that Ireland's banks needed to be reformed.&lt;ref name="Experts agree banks must be stabilised before the recovery"&gt;{{cite web|author=JOE BRENNAN and JOHN MULLIGAN|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/experts-agree-banks-must-be-stabilised-before-the-recovery-1891232.html|title=Experts agree banks must be stabilised before the recovery|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheál Martin, in his closing remarks to the Forum, said the contributions of the delegates "will be taken forward and action will be taken", spoke of his hopes to establish an "online portal for a virtual community of people of Irish descent to stay in touch" and stated he would also focus on non-traditional countries of the Irish diaspora such as [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Martin hails ideas forum input"&gt;{{cite web|author=IRISH TIMES REPORTERS|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0919/breaking6.htm|title=Martin hails ideas forum input|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote="Your work this week will be taken forward and action will be taken," Mr Martin told participants at a press conference this evening. "We are going through a crisis at the moment which does require ... a very significant (cut to) budget. They are the overarching priorities that the Government has at the moment and we have to try and work within that." Mr Martin said the Government would look at creating an online portal for a virtual community of people of Irish descent to stay in touch, as well as more educational exchanges and diaspora-linked tourism. He also said he wanted to boost Ireland’s presence around the world to harness the Irish diaspora in countries not traditionally focused on before, such as Russia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
President Mary McAleese praised the "“interest in and commitment to" of those who attended, saying the event showed that Ireland is "considerably more than an island on the edge of Europe, but the centre of a vast networked community".&lt;ref name="President praises delegates' efforts"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Carroll|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0919/1224254861498.html|title=President praises delegates' efforts|date=2009-09-19|accessdate=2009-09-19|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote=Ms McAleese said the forum highlighted that Ireland was “considerably more than an island on the edge of Europe, but the centre of a vast networked community”.

The '''Holy League''' of 1538 was a short-lived alliance of Christian states arranged by [[Pope Paul III]] at the urging of the [[Republic of Venice]].

In 1537 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], Pasha of [[Algiers]], had nearly captured the Venetian stronghold of [[Corfu]] and ravaged the coasts of [[Calabria]].  In the face of this threat Pope Paul succeeded in February 1538 in organizing the ''Holy League'' which consisted of the [[Papal States]], the Republic of Venice, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Maltese Knights]] and Spain with her vassal states of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]].
 
To confront Barbarossa and his roughly 120 [[galley]]s and [[fusta]]s, the League assembled a fleet of about 300 ships (162 galleys and 140 sailing ships) in September 1538 near Corfu.  Its supreme commander was the [[Genoa|Genoese]] admiral [[Andrea Doria]], who was then in the service of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].

The two fleets met on 28 September 1538 in the [[Battle of Preveza]], and Barbarossa decisively defeated the numerically superior Christian alliance.  Doria's leadership in the battle was less than vigorous and is widely believed to have been a major contributing cause to the League's defeat.  His hesitation to bring his own ships into full action (he personally owned a number of them) and to sacrifice them for the good of Venice, the traditional rival of his home town of Genoa, are generally considered to explain his actions at Preveza.

'''INSAT-3C''' is a multipurpose [[satellite]] built by [[ISRO]] and launched by [[Arianespace]] in Jan 2002. INSAT-3C is the second satellite of the [[INSAT]]-3 series. All the transponders provide coverage over India. Insat-3C is controlled from the [[Master Control Facility]] at [[Hassan, India|Hassan]] in [[Karnataka]]. It will provide voice, video and digital data services to India and neighboring countries.

== Launch ==
INSAT 3C was launched by the [[Ariane 4]] launch vehicle of [[Arianespace]] at 5:17 am IST from [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] in [[South America]]. INSAT-3C was placed into a Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), 21 minutes after the lift-off, in a 3-axis stabilised mode, with a perigee of 570&amp;nbsp;km and an apogee of 35,920&amp;nbsp;km and an inclination of 4° with respect to the equator. After 4 maneuvers INSAT-3C has been put in its final three axis stabilised mode on February 1, 2002.The orbit rising maneuvers were carried out in phases by firing the 440 Newton [[Apogee kick motor|Liquid Apogee Motor(LAM)]]. The satellite carried about 1.5 tonne of propellant ([[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH (MonoMethylHydrazine)]] and [[Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen|MON-3 (Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen)]]) for orbit raising operations as well as for station keeping and in-orbit attitude control.INSAT-3C like all of its predecessors in the [[INSAT]] series has a 3-axis body stabilized spacecraft using momentum/reaction wheels earth sensors, sun sensors, inertial reference unit and [[Magnetorquer|magnetic torquers]].It is equipped with unified bi-propellant thrusters.

== Payload ==
INSAT-3C, carrying Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) transponders, Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) transponders &amp; Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) transponders is intended to continue the service of INSAT-2DT and INSAT-2C which were nearing their end to life besides enhancing and augmenting the INSAT system capacity.
* 24 Normal [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders providing an EIRP of 37 dBW
* 6 Extended C-band transponders with EIRP of 37 dBW
* 2 [[S-band]] transponders to provide BSS services with 42 dBW EIRP
* 1 MSS transponder operating in S-band up-link and C-band downlink

The '''Kabul Military Training Centre''' (KMTC) is a basic training centre for the [[Afghan Armed Forces]]. Located about 8 miles to the east on the outskirts of [[Kabul]], it offers basic courses including 16-week basic infantry training.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity1"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/kabul_kmtc.htm |title=Kabul Military Training Center |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhandari |first=Subel |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/are-afghan-security-forces-up-to-the-post-2014-job-1.177284 |title=Are Afghan security forces up to the post-2014 job? - News |publisher=Stripes |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabul Military Training Center is one of the biggest basic training centers in [[Afghanistan]]. As of April 2008, of the 70,000 Afghans which had entered the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA), a third had been trained at the KMTC between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity1"/&gt;

==Basic training==
The KMTC undertakes basic combat training of new recruits with a 16-week basic training course. Capable of graduating a 615-person battalion every four weeks there are roughly 2,500 soldiers and airmen undertaking training at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kabul's+Military+training+centre%3A+Canadian+mentors+help+build+the...-a0163738510 |title=Kabul's Military training centre: Canadian mentors help build the Afghan army ... on the double. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy training===
A major focus of the development of the Afghan Armed Forces is on raising the levels of literacy among the troops. In 2009 less than 35% of recruits could pass basic weapon qualification due to low literacy levels. Recruits were unable to properly read instructions in order to maintain or operate complex western supplied rifles and additional components such as optics. As a result, recruits had to undertake at least 64 hours of lessons in basic reading, writing and arithmetic in order to pass Grade 1 and move to their units.

Recruits were also given the option of a further 128 hours to advance to grade 2 to bring their total to 192 hours. To achieve Grade 3 they had to undertake a further 120 hours which gave them 312 hours of literacy training in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rajat Kumar Mohindru |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/as-afghanistan-raises-an-army-first-lessons-are-on-how-to-read-write/944600/ |title=As Afghanistan raises an army, first lessons are on how to read, write |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanakanavu''' ({{zh|c=卡那卡那富|p=|w=Kanakanavu}}) are an indigenous people of central southern [[Taiwan]]. They live in the two villages of Manga and Takanua in [[Namasia District]], [[Kaohsiung]] City, Taiwan (Zeitoun &amp; Teng 2014).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iscll-14.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files-pdf/Papers/Session6/ZeitounTeng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606223817/http://iscll-14.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files-pdf/Papers/Session6/ZeitounTeng.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The native Kanakanavu speakers were [[Taiwanese aboriginals]] living on the islands. Following the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch Colonial Period]] in the 17th century, [[Han-Chinese]] immigration began to dominate the islands population. The village of [[Takanua]] is a village assembled by [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rulers]] to relocate various aboriginal groups in order to establish easier dominion over these groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/ethnographic-situation.html https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/ethnographic-situation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2014, the government recognized Kanakanavu as the 16th group of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese indigenous]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/06/27/411066/Govt-officially.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livelihood ===
Japanese occupation left evidence of how the culture functioned. Forest clearance allowed agriculture to be the main facet of society, followed by hunting and fishing. [[Maize]], Rice, [[Millet]], [[Taro]], Sweet Potatoes, beans, and soybeans were the staple crops.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/cultural-situation.html https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/cultural-situation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirituality ===
Kanakanavu practiced a [[polytheistic]] nature religion involving offerings, fertility rituals, and [[shamanism]]. [[Headhunting]] was a common practice until Christianization took over.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/social-situation.html https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/social-situation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4832">[[Image:Bakunin Membership Card.jpg|thumb|right|Bakunin's membership card of the ''League of Peace and Freedom'']]

The '''Ligue internationale de la paix''' ('''League of Peace and Freedom''') was created after a public opinion campaign against a war between the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] over [[Luxembourg]]. The [[Luxembourg crisis]] was peacefully resolved in 1867 by the [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]] but in 1870 the [[Franco-Prussian War]] could not be prevented so the league dissolved and refounded as the 'Société française pour l'arbitrage entre nations' (League of arbitration between the Nations) in the same year.

The '''Société française pour l'arbitrage entre nations''' can be seen as a precursor of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], founded with the first [[Hague Peace Conference]] in 1899, and a precursor of the [[League of Nations]], founded with the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919 and followed by the [[United Nations]]. The establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration was also set up by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] that Frédéric Passy founded together with [[William Randal Cremer]] in 1889.

==Inaugural Congress==
The Inaugural Congress of the '''League of Peace and Freedom''' (French: Ligue internationale de la paix et de la liberte) was originally planned for September 5, 1867 in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pacifism in France, 1889-1914: International Peace as a Human Right |author= Sandi E. Cooper |journal=French Historical Studies |volume= 17 |year= 1991 |jstor=286462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Acollas]] set up the League's Organising Committee, which enlisted the support of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Élisée Reclus]], and his brother [[Élie Reclus]]. 

Other notable supporters included contemporary activists, revolutionaries, and intellectuals such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Edgar Quinet]], [[Jules Favre]], and [[Alexander Herzen]]. Ten thousand people from across Europe signed petitions in support of the congress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Leier]]. ''Bakunin: The Creative Passion''. St. Martin's Press: New York, 2006. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also counted on the participation of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWMA), inviting the sections of the IWMA and its leaders, including [[Karl Marx]], to attend the Congress. They decided to postpone the opening of the Congress until September 9, so as to enable delegates of the Lausanne Congress of the IWMA (to be held on September 2–8) to take part.

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the balloting was going on, Citizen Marx called attention to the Peace Congress to be held in Geneva. He said: It was desirable that as many delegates as could make it convenient should attend the Peace Congress in their individual capacity; but that it would be injudicious to take part officially as representatives of the International Association. The International Working Men’s Congress was in itself a peace congress, as the union of the working classes of the different countries must ultimately make international wars impossible. If the promoters of the Geneva Peace Congress really understood the question at issue they ought to have joined the International Association.
[From ''[[The Bee-Hive (journal)|The Bee-Hive]] Newspaper'' August 17, 1867, reporting on a meeting of the IWMA Central Council.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] also played a prominent role in the Geneva Conference, and joined the Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=200-202|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding conference was attended by 6,000 people. As Bakunin rose to speak:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the cry passed from mouth to mouth: "Bakunin!" [[Garibaldi]], who was in the chair, stood up, advanced a few steps and embraced him. This solemn meeting of two old and tried warriors of the revolution produced an astonishing impression .... Everyone rose and there was a prolonged and enthusiastic clapping of hands&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020214212441/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/rbr/rbr6/bakunin.html Bakunin's idea of revolution &amp; revolutionary organisation] published by [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in ''Red and Black Revolution'' No.6, Winter 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2713">'''Mbaba Mwana Waresa''' is a [[fertility goddess]] of the [[Zulu religion]] of Southern Africa.  She rules over [[rainbows]], [[agriculture]], [[harvests]], [[rain]], and [[beer]] and has power over [[water]] and [[earth]].  She taught Her people how to sow and reap and also taught them the art of making beer. It is this act that has made Her one of the more revered goddesses of the Zulu people.

==Description==
Mbaba Mwana Waresa lived in the clouds, in a round hut made of rainbow arches. Her people loved this rain goddess, and whenever they heard the telltale sound of Her thunder drum, they knew that She would be pouring much-needed waters from Her heavenly home. She is the daughter of the sky god [[Umvelinqangi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuisinenoirmag.com/delicious-life/even-the-spirits-need-a-menu-as-a-zulu-goddess|title=Even the Spirits Need a Menu as a Zulu Goddess - Cuisine Noir Magazine|first=Wanda|last=Hennig|website=www.cuisinenoirmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is able to shapeshift Her appearance to that of an animal, hence Her other name, "'''Nomkhubulwane'''", which means "She who chooses the state of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriesbotha.net/artwork/2006-2010/nomkhubulwane/|title=Nomkhubulwane - Andries Botha - Artworks &amp; Sculpture|website=andriesbotha.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, She was unable to find a suitable husband in the heavens, so She scoured the lands of South Africa in search of a mortal husband, and then defied all of the other gods when She fell in love with a mortal man.  In order to make sure he loved Her, She tested him by sending a beautiful bride in Her place while She disguised herself as an ugly hag.  Her earthly lover was not fooled and recognized her immediately. They married and to this day, they live in her rainbow covered house in the sky.

==Worship==
The Zulu call on Her when they need guidance to make an important decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Magick of the Gods and Goddesses: Invoking the Power of the Ancient Gods |last=Conway |first=D.

'''[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]''' &amp;ndash; country located in Central Africa. The country is extremely rich in natural resources but political instability, a lack of infrastructure and a culture of corruption have historically limited development, extraction and exploitation efforts. Besides the capital, Kinshasa, the country's other largest cities are both mining communities (Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi) and the country's largest exports are raw minerals.

'''Péc''' or '''Pécz''' (also ''Peech'' or ''Pech'') was the name of a ''gens'' (Latin for "clan"; ''nemzetség'' in Hungarian) in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The powerful and illustrious [[Marcali family|Marcali]] and [[Apponyi family|Apponyi]] noble families descended from this kindred. The clan had large-scale possessions in several counties of [[Transdanubia]], in addition to [[Slavonia]] and other parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|Kingdom of Hungary]].

==History and family tree==
===Zala branch===
The clan originated from [[Sokoró Hills]], in the southern region of [[Győr County]], their ancient clan estates laid in present-day [[Felpéc]] and [[Kajárpéc]].{{sfn|Karácsonyi|1901|p=427}} The earliest known member of the kindred was [[Lucas I Péc|Lucas I]], who lived in the early 13th century. He is apparently the founder of the clan too.{{sfn|Kádár|2018|p=6}} Based on the clan's coat-of-arms (narrow silver stripe in blue shield), it is possible that Lucas was a knight from [[Western Europe]], who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of [[Andrew II of Hungary]]. For his military service, he was granted lands in Győr County and the surrounding regions.{{sfn|Vikár|1995}} Depending on his origin (German or French), Lucas might have come to the country as an accompanist of either [[Gertrude of Merania]] (1205) or [[Yolanda de Courtenay]] (1215), the first and second spouse of Andrew II, respectively. His career and life is difficult to outline: it is presumable that he is identical with that Lucas, who served as [[Master of the cupbearers]] in the royal court from 1229 to 1230.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=59}}

Lucas' eldest son was [[George Péc|George]], who owned [[Ludbreg]] sometimes before 1248. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson [[Nicholas Ludbregi]] in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban [[John Csúz]] and his descendants.{{sfn|Engel|1996|p=363}} The most powerful member of the kindred was George's another son [[Denis Péc|Denis]]. Initially, he was a confidant of ''[[junior king|rex iunior]]'' [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]], but later joined the partisans of the elderly [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. He actively participated in the military campaigns against Austria and Bohemia. He served as [[Palatine of Hungary]] and other high-ranking positions several times during the era of feudal anarchy.{{sfn|Kádár|2018|p=11}} His son, [[John Péc|John]] was ''ispán'' of [[Veszprém County (former)|Veszprém County]] as a confidant of Queen Mother [[Tomasina Morosini]] in 1295,{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=227}} while his unidentified daughter married [[Stephen Hahót]]. Through their only son [[Nicholas VII Hahót|Nicholas]], they were ancestors of the powerful Bánfi (Bánffy) de Alsólendva noble family.&lt;ref name=hahot&gt;Engel: ''Genealógia'' (Genus Hahót 1.)&lt;/ref&gt; George's third son was Serfesd, who owned Nevna (or Névna), present-day [[Levanjska Varoš]] in [[Croatia]]. His only son [[Ladislaus Nevnai]] held estates in Valkó and [[Požega County|Požega]] counties, including [[Orljavac|Orjava]] (today Orljavac, Croatia), and was considered one of the richest landowners of the region.{{sfn|Árvai|2013|p=105}} He fathered two daughters, Catherine and an unidentified girl. Their marriages to [[Nicholas I Treutel|Nicholas Treutel]] and Andrew Garai, respectively, have prompted the rise of the [[Treutel family|Treutel]] kinship and the Palatinal branch of the [[Garai family]]. Ladislaus Nevnai handed over his estate of Nevna to his son-in-law Nicholas Treutel in 1324.{{sfn|Engel|1996|p=376}} It is presumable, he died shortly thereafter without male descendants, ending the Nevnai family line after two generations.&lt;ref name="engel1"&gt;Engel: ''Genealógia'' (Genus Péc 1. Zala branch)&lt;/ref&gt;

George's younger brother was Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Alongside two other local nobles, he unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit for the ownership of some portions of Kajár (present-day Kajárpéc) in 1240; Béla IV ruled in favor of the [[Bakonybél Abbey]], referring to [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]]' royal charters from the late 11th century.{{sfn|Vikár|1995}} He had five sons; [[Gregory Péc|Gregory]] was one of the military leaders of the Bulgarian campaign in 1266.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2007|p=98}} He was Ban of [[Braničevo (region)|Barancs]] and [[Kučevo|Kucsó]] in 1272–73,{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=51–52}} then [[Judge royal]] in 1288.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=289}} It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgyörgy in order to protect his landholdings against the [[Kőszegi family]]. However they besieged and captured the fort from Gregory's only son Joachim around 1315.{{sfn|Engel|1996|p=426}} Through his only son Stephen, Joachim was the forefather of the illustrious [[Marcali family]], which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487.&lt;ref name="engel3"&gt;Engel: ''Genealógia'' (Genus Péc 2. Marcali branch)&lt;/ref&gt; Mark I's second son Mark II (fl. 1275) remained insignificant member of the clan. His granddaughters' [[Daughters' quarter|filial quarter]] was divided between his brothers' surviving branches in 1349.&lt;ref name="engel1"/&gt; The third son, [[Apor Péc|Apor]] was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, during the era of Interregnum. He had no descendants.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=247}} Stephen I was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lorántfis and Sándorfis.&lt;ref name="engel2"&gt;Engel: ''Genealógia'' (Genus Péc 3. Berzencei [Musinai] branch)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucas III Péc|Lucas III]] served as ''[[ispán]]'' of [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]] from 1289 to 1291 and in 1298. He and his brother Apor besieged and captured Tátika Castle (located near [[Zalaszántó]]), which belonged to the property of the [[Diocese of Veszprém]].{{sfn|Engel|1996|p=441}} Thereafter, Lucas and his offspring were sometimes called with the title "of Tátika".&lt;ref name="engel4"&gt;Engel: ''Genealógia'' (Genus Péc 4. Szentgyörgyi branch)&lt;/ref&gt; However the castle was lost to the [[Kőszegi family]] by 1314, when [[Andrew Kőszegi]] owned the fort.{{sfn|Engel|1996|p=441}} Lucas had five sons; one of them [[Apor Szentgyörgyi|Apor]] took the Szentgyörgyi surname, and became the first member of that short-lived family.&lt;ref name="engel4"/&gt;

|}}'''Radio Dabanga''' ([[Arabic]]: راديو دبنقا) is a shortwave [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] which serves [[Sudan]] with daily reports on the latest political, economic and social information, including health issues and social programs such as ''[https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/radio-program-highlight-reuniting-loved-ones Lost and Found]''. The shortwave radio has been broadcasting since December 1, 2008. Current broadcasts last for a total of one hour each day.

While Radio Dabanga only broadcast on shortwave radio for the first few years, the station now has several channels. The editors have innovated and experimented in the sphere of new media, often at the request of their listeners. These include Satellite TV, Facebook, WhatsApp, and SoundCloud. Depending on the medium, Radio Dabanga produces news in [[Sudanese Arabic]] and/or [[English language|English]].

Shortwave radio remains the mainstay of the radio station; one quarter of all Sudanese people are illiterate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uis.unesco.org/country/SD|title=Sudan|website=uis.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a number that is relatively higher in Sudan’s remote areas and camps for displaced people. Many people here have no lifeline to the outside world other than telephone and radio, so it is Radio Dabanga’s mission to provide this.

==Broadcasting media==

=== Radio ===

Radio broadcasting is split into the [https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/broadcasts/broadcast/morning-news-21-august Morning News] and [https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/broadcasts/broadcast/evening-news-20-august-8 Evening News]. The morning news is broadcast from 0430 to 0500 UTC, at a frequency of 7315 and 15550 kHz and evening news is broadcast from 1530 to 1600 UTC, at a frequency of 13800 and 15550 kHz. This means that broadcasts reach Sudan between 07.30 and 08.00 in the morning and between 18:30 and 19:00 in the evening.

Besides the news bulletin, one program is broadcast every day. Editors pick which program is most suitable depending on the news of the day.

Current programs:

* ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/22-8-2018a-2 Talk of the Day]''
* ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/9-8-2018a-1 From the Camps]''

* ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/3-7-2018a-2 Health Advice]''
* ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/27-4-2018a-1 Plain Speaking]''

Other programs include ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/12-9-2019a-3 Lost and Found], Hababkum Darfur'' ("We Greet Darfur"), ''[https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/26-6-2018a-1 Melodies from Darfur], [https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga/22-8-2018a Sudan Files],'' and ''Press Review. Lost and Found'' is a program which aims to reunite loved ones who have lost contact with each other when fleeing conflict, while ''Hababkum Darfur'' allows callers to send greetings across the airwaves to listeners in other places. Occasionally, drama programs are also broadcast over Radio Dabanga. 

''[https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/radio-programme-highlight-we-empowered-people-to-claim-their-rights Fi Al Mizan]'' ("On the Scale") was a justice program co-produced by Radio Dabanga and the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]. It focused on local and international justice issues.

Initially, in 2008 Radio Dabanga was broadcast for one hour per day. This increased to three hours per day, but because of the high cost of shortwave Dabanga went back to the original one hour per day; half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon.

Broadcasts are made in Sudanese Arabic. In the past, broadcasts also featured news in Darfuri Arabic, [[Fur language|Fur]], [[Masalit language|Masalit]] and [[Zaghawa language|Zaghawa]].

=== Television ===

Radio Dabanga has been broadcasting its TV satellite channel on Eutelsat since the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201802190646.html|title=Sudan: Announcement - Dabanga Sudan Satellite Frequency Change|date=2018-02-19|work=Radio Dabanga (Amsterdam)|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on frequency 11354 GHz. The TV Satellite broadcasts the latest radio programs 24 hours per day, showing the latest headlines of Radio Dabanga in text on-screen.

=== Online ===

Radio programs which are broadcast via shortwave radio and satellite TV are also [https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/broadcasts uploaded on Radio Dabanga’s website] and [https://www.facebook.com/راديو-دبنقا-السودان-1408025102826509/?ref=hl Facebook page]. On 21 August 2018, Radio Dabanga had uploaded a total of 1,848 broadcasts to its [https://soundcloud.com/radio-dabanga SoundCloud channel].

Radio Dabanga also produces news articles in Arabic which are published on the [https://www.dabangasudan.org/ar Arabic website], social media and WhatsApp groups.

Arabic news is often translated and reworked to suit an international audience on the English language part of the website and social media platforms.

==Reporting==
Radio Dabanga reports in exile from Amsterdam. Until 2012 the editorial team operated out of facilities at [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]], a public radio and television network based in the city of [[Hilversum]]. Since then the radio station has operated from the offices of Free Press Unlimited in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freepressunlimited.org/en/projects/radio-dabanga-radio-for-life|title=Radio Dabanga: Radio for Life|website=www.freepressunlimited.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Before 2013, Radio Dabanga's main focus was conflict areas such as Darfur and the Blue Nile, producing independent news and relevant information for people of Darfur, including [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced persons]] and [[refugees]]. Since then the station increasingly shifted to being a reliable source of information for people in all parts of Sudan, covering a wide range of events and issues.

The [[editor-in-chief]] is [https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/makers-of-dabanga-the-story-of-kamal-elsadig Kamal Elsadig], overseeing a small group of reporters who work at the central desk in Amsterdam. The radio station receives news from people in the field. These stringers get in contact with the team with information about specific events, which the team then uses to verify and compile news.

Audience participation is a significant source of information as listeners call the radio studios with their own stories and tips. Increasingly, the editors use WhatsApp as a tool to receive, verify and publish news from interested individuals and specialist groups such as medics and civil servants in Sudan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.humanityx.nl/projects/chatbot-radio-dabanga-free-press-unlimited/|title=Chatbot : Radio Dabanga (Free Press Unlimited) — HumanityX|date=2018-05-15|work=HumanityX|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Audience ==
Radio Dabanga radio broadcasts reach 2.3 individual listeners per day (the population of Sudan is around 40 million) according to a listener survey conducted in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/broadcast-en/15262/sudan-short-wave-radio-still-going-strong-in-darfur-says-listeners-survey|title=Sudan: Short-wave radio still going strong in Darfur, says listeners survey {{!}} Balancing Act - Africa|last=dijit.net|website=www.balancingact-africa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the survey was held among 1,582 respondents over the age of 18 in cities, towns, and Darfur’s refugee camps. The Satellite TV channel is watched by an average of 1 million people per day in Greater Khartoum. Overall, the 2009 survey and spot checks in Khartoum revealed that Radio Dabanga reaches 6.5 million people per week via shortwave radio and satellite TV.

More information about the online audience of Radio Dabanga is presented in an [https://www.dabangasudan.org/factsheet/ infographic] on their website.

==Supporters==
Radio Dabanga is conceived, operated and facilitated by the Dutch NGO Free Press Unlimited in the [[Netherlands]].

Radio Dabanga was founded 2008 by a coalition of Sudanese journalists, a number of international NGOs and the movers behind the Dutch campaign ‘Tot Zover Darfur’, including [https://www.vluchteling.nl Stichting Vluchteling], [https://www.paxforpeace.nl Pax for Peace] and [https://www.doen.nl Stichting Doen].

== Controversies associated with Radio Dabanga ==
While Radio Dabanga has a large audience in Sudan, the organization has been criticized by the Sudanese government in the past. The station has survived a number of government efforts to take TV Satellite and shortwave radio broadcasts off-air, including attempts at jamming and prosecution of reporters.

=== Television blocking ===

Radio Dabanga’s TV satellite channel was first set up in 2013 with Arabsat. After being taken down by the company in 2015 due to requests by the Sudanese government, Radio Dabanga began broadcasting with Nilesat instead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freepressunlimited.org/en/blog/radio-dabanga-censored-by-sudan-even-in-outer-space|title=Radio Dabanga censored by Sudan even in outer space|website=www.freepressunlimited.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, Arabsat stated that “Radio Dabanga is considered an enemy of the Sudanese government, it’s not about a few controversial news items but about the whole station.”

Radio Dabanga’s channel was taken down from Nilesat in February 2018 due to a new request from the Sudanese government&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article64768|title=Egypt's Nilesat stops Radio Dabanga satellite broadcasts - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website=www.sudantribune.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Faisal El Bagir of the network of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Journalists for Human Rights]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; stated at the time: “This measure illustrates that the regime does not tolerate independent opinions and voices, especially when it comes to the voices of those who would otherwise never be heard.”

Radio Dabanga now broadcasts via Eutelsat, a Paris-based broadcasting company.

'''''The Bishop of Lovech''''' ({{lang-bg|Ловчанският владика}}) is a Bulgarian comedy play by [[Teodosiy Ikonomov]], considered the first Bulgarian play. Ikonomov wrote it in 1857 as a student in Constantinople,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapni.bg/offer/7933|title=Постановка  –  Васил Василев|publisher=Lapni.bg|accessdate=15 May 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the lack of Bulgarian works being available, but it was not published until 1863 in [[Bolgrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsvishtov.com/landmarks.php?id=4&amp;info=10&amp;lg=en|title=Dates and facts|publisher=The official website for tourism of the town of Svishtov|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to poor finances. The play is narrated from the viewpoint of Petko Slaveykov, who relates the struggle for independence of the Bulgarian church.

'''The Women's Peace Crusade''' was a grass-roots socialist movement that spread across Great Britain between 1916 and 1918. Its central aim was to spread a 'people's peace', which was defined as a negotiated end to the [[World War I|First World War]] without any annexations or indemnities. The movement was first established in [[Glasgow]] in July 1916, and officially launched on 10 June 1917. It later spread across Great Britain, with demonstrations taking place in Leeds, Bradford, Leicester, Birmingham and Lancashire. Although it gathered a substantial following, the Women's Peace Crusade faced opposition from both the government and police, with members being arrested and reportedly threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Long Road to Greenham|last=Liddington|first=Jill|publisher=Virago|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origins ==

The outbreak of war caused a schism within the pre-war efforts for women's suffrage as individuals within the [[Women's suffrage|Suffrage movement]] took various stances with regards to the necessary morality of Great Britain entering the ever widening war footing that developed among neighbouring European Nations after the assassination of the Arch Duke Ferdinand on 28th June 1914. In the early aftermath of the British Government's [[Declaration of war|Declaration of War]], [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Emmeline Parkhurst,]] Leader of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), and from her politically motivated decision to move to Paris, announced that, from this time, the WSPU should desist from its suffrage activities and concentrate their efforts in supporting the Government's War effort&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41090784|title=Sylvia Pankhurst : a life in radical politics|last=1947-|first=Davis, Mary,|date=1999|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=0745315186|location=Sterling, Va.|oclc=41090784}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other women fervently disagreed with this stance. Women around Europe mobilised - against their respective Government's wishes -  to convene the annual [[International Congress of Women]] in the Hague on 28th of April, 1915. One hundred and ninety women applied for permission to attend by the British Government. Of these one hundred and sixty-six had their passports either refused of cancelled. The remaining twenty-four were considered to be non-militant and allowed to attend. The conference culminated in the creation of various anti-war projects such as 'The International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891448835|title=The Woman Who Saved the Children : a Biography of Eglantyne Jebb: Founder of Save the Children.|last=Clare.|first=Mulley,|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=9781780740683|location=New York|oclc=891448835}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '[[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom|Women's International League]]' (WIL). [[Helen Crawfurd]] - an [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) representative and a lapsed member of WSPU - was the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the WIL.  Even within the Glasgow branch, class divisions became evident between the middle class and the working-class membership.  Helen Crawfurd consequently singled herself, [[Agnes Dollan]], [[Mary Barbour]] and, Mrs Ferguson out as the 'local propagandists' of the Glasgow ILP branch, and it was this coalition of women who went on to become founding members of the Women's Peace Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27348173|title=Out of bounds : women in Scottish society 1800-1945|date=1992|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Breitenbach, Esther., Gordon, Eleanor.|isbn=0748603727|location=Edinburgh|oclc=27348173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Peace Crusade, sometimes referred to as the Women's Peace Negotiation Crusade, originated in Glasgow at a demonstration on 23 July 1916, which drew a crowd of 5,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Times of a Respectable Rebel: Selina Cooper (1864 – 1946)|last=Liddington|first=Jill|publisher=Virago|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration had been organised by Helen Crawfurd, a working class [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] who had played a significant role in the [[Glasgow rent strikes 1915|Glasgow Rent Strike]] of 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Most Dangerous Women: Feminist Peace Campaigners of the Great War|last=Wiltshire|first=Anne|publisher=Pandora|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest came after a letter was published in the ''[[Labour Leader]]'' condemning the women of Britain for not organising any protests against the war. The first meetings took place in [[Maryhill]] and [[Springburn]], and subsequent activities included street meetings, marches, selling badges and distributing literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Aims ==
The central demand of the Women's Peace Crusade was to negotiate an immediate end to the First World War, but there were specific aims within this. Literature distributed by the movement stated that it aimed to allow all nations to choose their own form of government, to be fully developed, to access the world's markets and raw materials, and to travel freely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They set themselves against the idea of the right of conquest and forcible annexation, the attempt to retain or increase trade barriers, and any attempt to impose crushing indemnities on any one nation. As well as this, they supported the limitation of armaments and the international organisation of people, aiming to create a common understanding of common interests that they termed 'a people's peace'. 
[[File:Women's International League, 5. 1. 1922.png|thumb|The Women's International League]]

== Members ==

The Women's Peace Crusade was among the largest peace movements in Glasgow during the First World War, and it was also the one with the most [[working class]], [[grassroots]] support.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstworldwarglasgow.co.uk/index.aspx?articleid=12770|title=Glasgow's Peace Movement|last=Glasgow Young Scot|first=20 Trongate|date=2014-08-03|language=en|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen Crawfurd was one of the founders of the Women's Peace Crusade, and also founded the Glasgow branch of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], but later said that she was never a [[Pacifism|pacifist]]. Instead, she was 'an international socialist with a profound hatred of war with all its ghastly cruelty and waste'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scottish Suffragettes|last=Leneman|first=Leah|publisher=NMS Publishing Limited|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fractions within the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League led to divisions between the middle class and working class members, and subsequently Helen Crawfurd, along with other working class members, formed the Women's Peace Crusade. These other members included Agnes Dollan, Miss Walker, Mrs Barbour and Mrs Ferguson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out of Bounds: Women in Scottish Society 1800-1945|last=Breitenbach|first=Esther|last2=Gordon|first2=Eleanor|publisher=Edinburgh University press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Women's International League had focused on holding monthly meetings with speakers and discussions, the Women's Peace Crusade now took the anti-war message onto the streets and into working class communities.

== Opposition ==
The Women's Peace Crusade met with a great deal of opposition from both the government and the media. The right-wing ''[[The Morning Post|Morning Post]]'' described the movement as ‘one of the most active and pernicious propaganda organisations in the country'. On 11 August 1917, a march of 1,200 women in Lancashire was met with a great deal of hostility. Upon arriving at Nelson's recreation ground, a crowd of 50,000 counter-demonstrators began shouting 'Traitors! Murderers!' at the group, and only a police presence stopped them from being physically harmed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Turks in Montenegro''', also known as '''Montenegrin Turks''', ({{lang-tr|Karadağ Türkleri}}) are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] who form an [[Demographics of Montenegro|ethnic minority]] in [[Montenegro]]. 

== History ==
{{See also|History of Ottoman Montenegro}}
In 1496 the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered [[Montenegro]] which bequeathed a significant Turkish community due to the Ottoman colonisation process. However, in the early 20th century, after the Ottomans were defeated in the [[Balkan Wars]], the majority of Turks along with other Muslims living in the region left their homes and migrated to [[Turkey]].

== Demographics ==

According to the 2011 census, there were 104 Turks living in the country, forming a minority of some 0.02% of the total population.&lt;ref name=Monstat/&gt; However, the former vice president of the Parliament of Montenegro, [[Suljo Mustafić]], has stated that whilst there are only 50 families which still speak the [[Turkish language]], the population of Montenegrins of Turkish origin is significantly higher.&lt;ref name="Hurriyet"&gt;{{cite web |author=|year=2011|title=Adriyatik'te unutulan 104 Türk|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adriyatikte-unutulan-104-turk-18788512|publisher=[[Hurriyet]]|quote=Mustafiç, şöyle konuştu: “Osmanlının buradan ayrılmasının üzerinden 100 yıl geçti. Ancak burada o eski dili konuşan insanların yaşaması bizi çok mutlu ediyor. Burada cami, türbe, tekke gibi tarihi anıtların yanı sıra canlı anıtlarımız da bulunuyor. Burada Türkçe konuşan 50 aile bulunuyor, ancak Türk kökenli insanların sayısı daha yüksektir, fakat zamanla bu insanlar Türkçeyi unutmuşlar...” Sulyo Mustafiç, kendisinin de Türk kökenli olduğunu ve atalarının yüz yıllar önce Karaman'dan Bar'a gelerek yerleştiğini ifade ederek...|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">The average [[Iraq]]i soldier is equipped with an assortment of uniforms ranging from the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the 6 color "Chocolate Chip" [[Desert Battle Dress Uniform|DBDU]] and the woodland pattern [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] to the US [[MARPAT]] or Jordanian [[KA7]]. 

==Overview==
Nearly all [[Iraqi Army|Iraqi military personnel]] have a [[PASGT]] ballistic helmet, generation I OTV [[ballistic vest]] and radios. Their light weapons consist of stocks of [[AKM]] and the German [[Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1]] sniper rifles, [[Type 56]] assault rifles, American [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]], [[M16A4]] rifles and [[M4 carbine]]s. Soviet [[PK machine gun|PKM]] machineguns are still used by machine/support gunners and AT soldiers use [[RPG-7]]s.

==Other==
Weapons registration is poor. A 2006 report by the [[Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction]] (SIGIR) notes that out of the 370,000 weapons turned over to the US since the fall of Saddam's regime, only 12,000 serial numbers have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/default.aspx Reports to Congress] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222014506/http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/Default.aspx |date=2010-02-22 }} - Special Inspector General For Iraq Reconstruction&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of proper accounting for these weapons makes the acquisition of small arms by anti-governmental forces or sectarian militias much easier.

In 1963, the [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] and DCA invited UP to join the government. After two years, the party left the government. Its position as an opposition party had declined, though. In 1970, the party suffered a heavy blow as its leader joined the PPP.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s the party strongly opposed a union with [[Senegal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/GAMBIA_1977_E.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Sand''' ({{zh|c=西沙洲|p=Xīshā-zhōu}}; {{lang-vi|Cồn cát Tây}}) is a sand cay located in the northwest of the Amphitrite Group of the [[Paracel Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ GEOnet Names Server (GNS)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately {{convert|4|nmi|km}} west of [[Tree Island, South China Sea|Tree Island]]. 

West Sand is administered by the [[People's Republic of China]].

All first generation XM2go models have identical internal components designed by XM Satellite Radio and are manufactured by Flextronics. Each branded manufacturer has a chassis of their own design, along with marketing and distribution rights.

===2nd Generation Players===
*The [[Inno]], from Pioneer.
*The Helix, from Samsung.
*Audiovox plans on releasing a 2nd Generation XM2Go unit in 2007.

===Unit Specifications===
All first generation XM2go models have identical internal components manufactured by Giant International for XM. Each is assembled by secondary manufacturers, and housed in chassis of their own design.

Second generation XM2go models add a color screen with mp3 storage capability compatible with [[Napster]] using a click-to-buy feature.

===Technical Information===
The MyFi series has a "My XM" function that allows for scheduled recording similar to a [[TiVo]] manual recording for XM Radio programming. Manufacturers have complied with [[RIAA]] demands to not allow transfer of programming from the units to other mediums. Additionally, previously recorded programming is only accessible with a paid subscription to XM radio. Once service is canceled previously recorded music will be unplayable from the unit.

===Fixes===
Few issues have been reported, however some units have experienced playback issues when attempting to listen to "My XM" recordings. The problem can be remedied by powering off the unit, disconnecting any external power sources, and removing the battery for 10 seconds. If it does not remedy the problem a full hardware reset may have to be performed using the reset button found behind the battery on the top left of the unit.
