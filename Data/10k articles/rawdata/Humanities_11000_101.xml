      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8636">Founded in 1960,&lt;ref name="Matter"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4185148 "Back Matter"], ''Africa Today'' 18.1 (1971): 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; the African Studies Center (ASC) at [[Michigan State University]] (MSU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.isp.msu.edu/|website=Africa Studies Center at Michigan State University|title=About the African Studies Center|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major academic center for the [[African Studies|study of Africa]] and one of 11 "[National Resource Center|Title VI National Resource Center]]s on Africa designated by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. The Center’s strength is based on the more than 160 MSU faculty who provide research, teaching, and service on [[Africa]]. Center faculty have research, projects, and expertise in 32 African nations.
==African languages==
MSU offers instruction in up to 32 [[African languages]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.isp.msu.edu/undergraduate-studies/african-languages/ African Language Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and teaches 9-12 languages each year and intensive African languages in the summer.&lt;ref name="SCALI"&gt;[http://africa.msu.edu/scali SCALI]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is home to the national ''e-LCTL Initiative'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://elctl.msu.edu/ e-LCTL]&lt;/ref&gt; with a website that a) catalogs the 220+ "[[Less Commonly Taught Languages]]" (LCTLs) offered in the more than 120 Title VI National Resource Centers of Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, and Canada, b) offers essays on priorities among LCTL languages for instruction in the U.S., and c) provides a database of "web objects" for teaching some LCTLs. See also the Center's ''Webbook of the African Languages'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/hiermenu.html Webbook of African Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; a directory of description, texts, and experts for 82 important African languages.

==Library==
The MSU Africana Library collection is served by two PhD Africanist librarians, more than 237,000 items, and a large annual budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.msu.edu/services/africana MSU Africana Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819150404/http://www.lib.msu.edu/services/africana |date=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Library hosts the "[[African e-Journals Project]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://africa.msu.edu/AEJP/ |title=African e-Journals Project |access-date=2008-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513201501/http://africa.msu.edu/AEJP/ |archive-date=2008-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a directory of journals about Africa and full-text of 11 African journals online. It also houses the '''African Activist Archive''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanactivist.msu.edu African Activist Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; which preserves records and memories of activism in the U.S. to support the struggles of African peoples against colonialism, apartheid, and social injustice from the 1950s through the 1990s. The project holds the physical deposits at MSU of records of many activist organizations and individuals.  The online African Activist Archive includes a directory of other archives and more than 7,000 historical materials, including pamphlets, documents, newsletters, leaflets, buttons, posters, T-shirts, photographs, audio and video recordings, and personal remembrances and interviews with activists.

==Research and service foci==
In addition to African languages, [[social science]]s, and [[arts]] and [[humanities]], African Studies at MSU has been distinguished by its focus on Africa’s human needs - poverty alleviation, [[food security]], education for development, environment and development, tropical disease, ethics of development, and gender equity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.msu.edu/research.php Research interests of the MSU African Studies faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;  For almost two decades, MSU graduate students have produced circa. 15 Ph.D. dissertations annually on Africa, especially in history, social sciences, economics and agricultural economics, and education. The African Studies Center offers the ''Title VI Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships'' for academic year&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.msu.edu/flas.php MSU African Studies Center FLAS]&lt;/ref&gt; and summer intensive study&lt;ref name="SCALI" /&gt; of African languages and area studies.

==Outreach and service==
For more than 25 years, MSU’s African Studies [[Outreach]] Program has provided professional assistance on Africa to K-12 schools, colleges and universities, communities, state and federal government, businesses, and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.msu.edu/outreach.php MSU African Studies Center Outreach]&lt;/ref&gt;

For schools and colleges, the program offers ''Exploring Africa'' (online gratis materials for teaching Africa K-12)&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/ Exploring Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''South Africa: Overcoming Apartheid, Building Democracy'' (an online curricular resource).&lt;ref&gt;[http://overcomingapartheid.msu.edu/ South Africa: Overcoming Apartheid, Building Democracy.]&lt;/ref&gt; The center's African Activist Archive&lt;ref&gt;African Activist Archive&lt;/ref&gt; is an online platform aimed preserving and making available online the records of activism in the United States to support the struggles of African peoples against colonialism, apartheid, and social injustice from the 1950s through the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3758">'''Agnes Bolsø''' (born 4 June 1953) is a Norwegian sociologist and expert on [[gender studies]], particularly studies of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2006/juni/1149434186.61 Grensesprengende begjær], forskning.no&lt;/ref&gt; She is Associate Professor of Sociology at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU) and was director of its Centre for Gender Studies from 2005 to 2007. She was editor of [[Tidsskrift for kjønnsforskning]] (the Norwegian Journal of Gender Studies) from 2009 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kilden.forskningsradet.no/c16880/artikkel/vis.html?tid=77251 Ny redaktør til Tidsskrift for kjønnsforskning], [[Research Council of Norway]] Information Centre for Gender Research&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolsø holds a [[cand.mag.]] degree from the [[University of Trondheim]] (1976), a [[cand.polit.]] degree in sociology (1981) and a [[dr.polit.]] degree from 2002. She was researcher at the [[Centre for Rural Research]] from 1987 to 1994, and has been employed at NTNU since 1994, where she became Associate Professor in 2001. She has been a visiting scholar at the [[University of Minneapolis]], the [[University of York]], the [[University of London]] and the [[University of New South Wales]]. She is also a regular commentator on gender issues in Norwegian media, and has been an op-ed columnist for [[Klassekampen]] and other publications.

Bolsø gained international attention following her rather awkward appearance in the 2010 Norwegian documentary series [[Hjernevask]] ('Brainwash: Gay/Straight'), in which she struggled to defend her theories against biological research data.

'''Alibi''' is a [[language game]] spoken by children in Australia. It is not a true [[language]], instead an [[obfuscation]] of [[English language|English]]. It is a system of manipulating the [[syllable]]s of spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. The language can be easily mentally encoded and decoded by a skilled speaker at the rate of normal speech, while those who either don't know the key or aren't practiced in rapid speech are left hearing nothing but [[gibberish]].

== Etymology ==
The word 'Alibi' is most likely in itself a reference to the rules of the language, although not entirely correct. In this scenario the vowel/word 'I' would have been chosen, had the normal rules applied except for replacing the first 'I' with an 'A' to make the word easier to pronounce or sound better. but some children may say '''alibi''' is actually a correct language.

== Use ==
Language games are primarily used by children, to disguise their speech from others. Alibi is spoken most prominently in Australia, and may be used in other [[English-speaking world|English speaking countries]], such as [[New Zealand]], [[U.S|The United States]] and [[United Kingdom|The United Kingdom]]. (In the United Kingdom it is also known as 'Uvaguv' and uses 'v' and 'g in place of 'l' and 'b'.) However the rules are simple enough so they may be applied to many other languages.

== Rules ==
Alibi strays from its parent language only in pronunciation and spelling of actual words, it retains all the same grammatical rules and protocols. The language is encoded by breaking each word into syllables and manipulating each one by elongating them. This is done by multiplying the vowel sound of each syllable three times and placing the letters 'l' and 'b' in between the first and second, and the second and third repetition respectively.

For example: The word 'hello' is broken into two syllables; 'hel' and 'lo', each vowel sound is repeated three times; 'heeel' and 'looo', the letters 'l' and 'b' are placed in between the first and second vowel and the second and third vowel respectively; 'helebel' and 'lolobo'. Thus the word 'hello' becomes 'helebel-lolobo'. there is also an alphabet but won't work  if you are creating a word because alibi ( language game) also depends on syllables.

{{IPA notice}}

'''Athabaskan''' or '''Athabascan''' (also '''Dene''', '''Athapascan''', '''Athapaskan''') is a large family of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] of [[North America]], located in western North America in three groups of contiguous languages: Northern, Pacific Coast and Southern (or [[Apachean]]). Kari and Potter 2010:10 place the total territory of the 53 Athabaskan languages at 1,563,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 4,022,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]] is spoken over the largest area of any North American native language, while [[Navajo language|Navajo]] is spoken by the largest number of people of any native language north of Mexico.

Although the term ''Athabaskan'' is prevalent in linguistics and anthropology, there is an increasing trend among scholars to use the terms ''Dené'' and ''Dené languages'', which is how their native speakers identify it.{{fact|date=November 2018}} They are applying these terms to the entire language family.{{fact|date=November 2018}} For example, following a motion by attendees in 2012, the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference changed its name to the Dené Languages Conference.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Etymology==
The word ''Athabaskan'' is an [[Anglo|anglicized]] version of a [[Cree language]] name for [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{lang-crm|Aδapaska˙w}} "[where] there are reeds one after another") in [[Canada]]. Cree is one of the [[Algonquian languages]] and therefore not itself an Athabaskan language.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The name was assigned by [[Albert Gallatin]] in his 1836 (written 1826) classification of the languages of North America. He acknowledged that it was his choice to use this name for the language family and associated peoples, writing:

{{quote|I have designated them by the arbitrary denomination of Athabascas, which derived from the original name of the lake.|1836:116-7}}

The four spellings—"Athabaskan", "Athabascan", "Athapaskan", and "Athapascan"—are in approximately equal use. Particular communities may prefer one spelling over another (Krauss 1987). For example, the [[Tanana Chiefs Conference]] and [[Alaska Native Language Center]] prefer the spelling "Athabascan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc Alaska Native Language Center]: [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/athabascan.html "The Name Athabascan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625131149/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/athabascan.html |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ethnologue]]'' uses "Athapaskan" in naming the language family and individual languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com Ethnologue]: [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=611-16 Language Family Trees – Athapaskan]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages ==
Linguists conventionally divide the Athabaskan family into three groups, based on geographic distribution:

# [[Northern Athabaskan languages]]
# [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages]]
# [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] or "Apachean"

The 32 Northern Athabaskan languages are spoken throughout the interior of [[Alaska]] and the interior of northwestern [[Canada]] in the [[Yukon]] and [[Northwest Territories]], as well as in the provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. Several Athabaskan languages are [[official language]]s in the Northwest Territories, including [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]] (''Dënesųłıné''), [[Dogrib language|Dogrib]] or ''Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì'', [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]] (Kutchin, Loucheux), and [[Slavey language|Slavey]].

The seven or more Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. These include Applegate, Galice, several Rogue River area languages, Upper Coquille, Tolowa, and Upper Umpqua in [[Oregon]]; Eel River, Hupa, Mattole–Bear River, and Tolowa in northern [[California]]; and possibly Kwalhioqua-Clatskanie in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

The seven Southern Athabaskan languages are isolated by considerable distance from both the Pacific Coast languages and the Northern languages. Reflecting an ancient migration of peoples, they are spoken by Native Americans in the American Southwest and the northwestern part of [[Mexico]]. This group comprises the six Southern Athabaskan languages and Navajo.

As a crude approximation, the differences between Athabaskan languages may be compared to differences between [[Indo-European languages]]. Thus, Koyukon and Dena’ina are about as different as French and Spanish, while Koyukon and Gwich’in are as different as English and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Chad. ''Athabascan Languages and the Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list gives the Athabaskan languages organized by their geographic location in various North American states and provinces (including some languages that are now extinct). Speakers of several languages, such as Navajo and Gwich’in, span the boundaries between different states and provinces. These languages are repeated by location in this list. For alternative names for the languages, see the classifications given later in this article.

==External classification of the family==

[[Eyak language|Eyak]] and Athabaskan together form a genealogical linguistic grouping called ''Athabaskan–Eyak'' (AE) – well [[historical linguistics|demonstrated]] through consistent [[comparative method (linguistics)|sound correspondences]], extensive shared vocabulary, and cross-linguistically unique homologies in both verb and noun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

[[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] is distantly related to the Athabaskan–Eyak group to form the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene family]], also known as ''Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit'' (AET). With [[Jeff Leer]]'s 2010 advances, the reconstructions of Na-Dene (or Athabascan–Eyak–Tlingit) consonants, this latter grouping is considered by Alaskan linguists to be a well-demonstrated family. Because both Tlingit and Eyak are fairly remote from the Athabaskan languages in terms of their sound systems, comparison is usually done between them and the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] Proto-Athabaskan language. This resembles both Tlingit and Eyak much more than most of the daughter languages in the Athabaskan family.

Although ''[[Ethnologue]]'' still gives the Athabaskan family as a relative of [[Haida language|Haida]] in their definition of the Na-Dene family, linguists who work actively on Athabaskan languages discount this position. The [[Alaska Native Language Center]], for example, takes the position that recent improved data on Haida have served to conclusively disprove the Haida-inclusion hypothesis. Haida has been determined to be unrelated to Athabaskan languages.

A symposium in Alaska in February 2008 included papers on the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] and Na-Dené families. [[Edward Vajda]] of Western Washington University summarized ten years of research, based on verbal morphology and reconstructions of the proto-languages, indicating that these languages might be related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kari|first1=James M.|last2=Potter|first2=Ben Austin|title=The Dene-Yeniseian Connection: Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaI-YgEACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|isbn=978-1-55500-112-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal classification of the family==
The internal structure of the Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan peoples rather than sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way geographic grouping rather than any of the proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation and analysis of the languages improves.

===Overview===
Besides the traditional geographic grouping described previously, there are a few comparatively based subgroupings of the Athabaskan languages. Below the two most current viewpoints are presented.

The following is an outline of the classification according to [[Keren Rice]], based on those published in [[Ives Goddard|Goddard]] (1996) and [[Marianne Mithun|Mithun]] (1999). It represents what is generously called the "Rice–Goddard–Mithun" classification (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:73), although it is almost entirely due to Keren Rice.

# Southern Alaska &lt;small&gt;(Dena’ina, Ahtna)&lt;/small&gt;
# Central Alaska–Yukon &lt;small&gt;(Deg Hit’an, Holikachuk/Kolchan, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Lower Tanana, Tanacross, Upper Tanana, N. Tutchone, S. Tutchone, Gwich’in, Hän)&lt;/small&gt;
# Northwestern Canada &lt;small&gt;(Tagish, Tahltan, Kaska, Sekani, Dunneza/Beaver, Slavey, Mountain, Bearlake, Hare, Tłįchǫ Yat’iì/Dogrib, Dëne Sųłiné/Chipewyan)&lt;/small&gt;
# Tsetsaut
# Central British Columbia &lt;small&gt;(Babine–Witsuwit’en, Dakelh/Carrier, Chilcotin, Nicola, skenkeni?)&lt;/small&gt;
# Tsuut’ina/Sarsi
# Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai
# Pacific Coast Athabaskan &lt;small&gt;(Upper Umpqua, Tututni, Galice–Applegate, Tolowa, Hupa, Mattole, Eel River, Kato)&lt;/small&gt;
# Apachean &lt;small&gt;([[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[White Mountain Apache]], [[Tonto Apache]], [[San Carlos Apache]], Mescalero–Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Plains)&lt;/small&gt;

Branches 1–7 are the Northern Athabaskan (areal) grouping. Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai (#7) was normally placed inside the Pacific Coast grouping, but a recent consideration by Krauss (2005) does not find it very similar to these languages.

A different classification by Jeff Leer is the following, usually called the "Leer classification" (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:72–74):

# Alaskan &lt;small&gt;(Ahtna, Dena’ina, Deg Hit’an, Koyukon, Holikachuk/Kolchan, Lower Tanana, Tanacross, Upper Tanana, Gwich’in, Hän)&lt;/small&gt;
# Yukon &lt;small&gt;(Tsetsaut, N. Tutchone, S. Tutchone, Tagish, Tahltan, Kaska, Sekani, Dunneza/Beaver)&lt;/small&gt;
# British Columbia &lt;small&gt;(Babine–Witsuwit’en, Dakelh/Carrier, Chilcotin)&lt;/small&gt;
# Eastern &lt;small&gt;(Dëne Sųłiné/Chipewyan, Slavey, Mountain, Bearlake, Hare, Tłįchǫ Yat’iì/Dogrib)&lt;/small&gt;
# Southerly Outlying &lt;small&gt;(Tsuut’ina/Sarsi, Apachean, Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Kwalhioqua–Tlatskanai)&lt;/small&gt;

Neither subgrouping has found any significant support among other Athabaskanists. Details of the Athabaskan family tree should be regarded as tentative. As Tuttle and Hargus put it, "we do not consider the points of difference between the two models ... to be decisively settled and in fact expect them to be debated for some time to come." (Tuttle &amp; Hargus 2004:74)

The Northern group is particularly problematic in its internal organization. Due to the failure of the usual criteria of shared innovation and systematic phonetic correspondences to provide well-defined subgroupings, the Athabaskan family – especially the Northern group – has been called a "cohesive complex" by [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]] (1973, 1982). Therefore, the ''Stammbaumtheorie'' or family tree model of genetic classification may be inappropriate. The languages of the Southern branch are much more homogeneous and are the only clearly genealogical subgrouping.

Debate continues as to whether the Pacific Coast languages form a valid genealogical grouping, or whether this group may instead have internal branches that are tied to different subgroups in Northern Athabaskan. The position of [[Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai]] is also debated, since it may fall in either the Pacific Coast group – if that exists – or into the Northern group. The records of [[Nicola Athapaskans|Nicola]] are so poor – Krauss describes them as "too few and too wretched" (Krauss 2005) – that it is difficult to make any reliable conclusions about it. Nicola may be intermediate between Kwalhioqua–Tlatskanai and [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]].

Similarly to Nicola, there is very limited documentation on [[Tsetsaut language|Tsetsaut]]. Consequently, it is difficult to place it in the family with much certainty. Athabaskanists have concluded that it is a Northern Athabaskan language consistent with its geographical occurrence, and that it might have some relation to its distant neighbor Tahltan. Tsetsaut, however, shares its primary hydronymic suffix ("river, stream") with Sekani, Beaver, and Tsuut’ina – PA *-ɢah – rather than with that of Tahltan, Tagish, Kaska, and North and South Tutchone – PA *-tuʼ (Kari 1996; Kari, Fall, &amp; Pete 2003:39). The ambiguity surrounding Tsetsaut is why it is placed in its own subgroup in the Rice–Goddard–Mithun classification.

For detailed lists including languages, dialects, and subdialects, see the respective articles on the three major groups: [[Northern Athabaskan]], [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan]], [[Southern Athabaskan]]. For the remainder of this article, the conventional three-way geographic grouping will be followed except as noted.

===Northern Athabaskan===
The Northern Athabaskan languages are the largest group in the Athabaskan family, although this group varies internally about as much as do languages in the entire family. The [[urheimat]] of the Athabaskan family is most likely in the [[Tanana Valley]] of east-central Alaska. There are many homologies between Proto-Athabaskan vocabulary and patterns reflected in archaeological sites such as Upward Sun, Swan Point and Broken Mammoth (Kari 2010). The Northern Athabaskan group also contains the most linguistically conservative languages, particularly Koyukon, Ahtna, Dena’ina, and Dakelh/Carrier (Leer 2008).

Very little is known about Tsetsaut, and for this reason it is routinely placed in its own tentative subgroup.

: 27. '''[[Carrier language|Dakelh]]''' (also known as Carrier)
: 28. '''[[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]]''' (also known as Tsilhqot’in)

The Nicola language is so poorly attested that it is impossible to determine its position within the family. It has been proposed by some to be an isolated branch of Chilcotin.

* ''Sarsi subgroup''
: 30. '''[[Tsuut’ina language|Tsuut’ina]]''' (also known as Sarcee, Sarsi, Tsuu T’ina)

The Kwalhioqua–Clatskanie language is debatably part of the Pacific Coast subgroup, but has marginally more in common with the Northern Athabaskan languages than it does with the Pacific Coast languages (Leer 2005). It thus forms a notional sort of bridge between the Northern Athabaskan languages and the Pacific Coast languages, along with Nicola (Krauss 1979/2004).

==Proto-Athabaskan==

===Phonology===

The reconstruction of Proto-Athabaskan phonology is still under active debate. This section attempts to summarize the less controversial parts of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system.

====Symbols====

As with many linguists working on [[Native American languages]], Athabaskanists tend to use an [[Americanist phonetic notation]] system rather than IPA. Although some Athabaskanists prefer IPA symbols today, the weight of tradition is particularly heavy in historical and comparative linguistics, hence the Americanist symbols are still in common use for descriptions of Proto-Athabaskan and in comparisons between members of the family. In the tables in this section, the proto-phonemes are given in their conventional Athabaskanist forms with IPA equivalents following in square brackets.

Since [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] practices in Americanist phonetic notation are not formally standardized, there are different symbols in use for the same sounds, a proliferation partly due to changes in typefaces and computing technology. In the following tables, the older symbols are given first with newer symbols following. Not all linguists adopt the newer symbols at once, although there are obvious trends, such as the adoption of belted ɬ instead of barred ł, and the use of digraphs for affricates which is standard today for the laterals but not fully adopted for the dorsals. In particular, the symbols c, λ, and ƛ are rare in most publications today. The use of the combining comma above as in c̓ has also been completely abandoned in the last few decades in favor of the modifier letter apostrophe as in cʼ. Republication of older materials may preserve older symbols for accuracy, although they are no longer used, e.g. Krauss 2005, which was previously an unpublished manuscript dating from 1979.

It is crucial to recognize that the symbols conventionally used to represent voiced stops and affricates are actually used in the Athabaskan literature to represent ''unaspirated'' stops and affricates in contrast to the aspirated ones. This convention is also found in all Athabaskan orthographies since true voiced stops and affricates are rare in the family, and unknown in the [[proto-language]].

====Consonant reconstruction====

The traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system consists of 45 consonants (Cook 1981; Krauss &amp; Golla 1981; Krauss &amp; Leer 1981; Cook &amp; Rice 1989), as detailed in the following table.

=====First person singular fricative=====

A peculiar proto-phoneme in Proto-Athabaskan is the sound that Krauss (1976b) represents as *$, and which Leer (2005:284) has represented as *šʸ though lately he has since returned to *$ (e.g. Leer 2008). This is the phoneme found in Proto-Athabaskan, Proto-Athabaskan–Eyak, and Proto-Na-Dene that occurs in various reflexes of the first person singular pronoun. In Athabaskan languages, it usually has a reflex of /š/, the alveolar fricative, but in Eyak it appears as /x/ and in Tlingit as /χ/. Peculiarly, in Kwalhioqua-Tlatskanai, it seems to have been /x/ in at least some forms of the first-person-subject verb prefix (Krauss 1976b). It does not correspond well with other fricatives, a situation that led Krauss to considering it as unique. This proto-phoneme is not given in the table above, but is always assumed to be somehow a part of the Proto-Athabaskan inventory.

=====New consonant reconstruction=====

A newer reconstruction by Leer (2005:284) constitutes a significant reorganization of the system. Velars are reinterpreted as [[palatal]]s, labialized postalveolar affricates are reinterpreted as [[retroflex]] consonants, and other labialized consonants are removed. In addition, the clear assertion is made that stops and affricates are phonologically the same class, although they may be articulated somewhat differently. Leer also adopted the argument advanced by Keren Rice (1997) that there was no need to distinguish between *y and *žʸ. The resulting system is somewhat simpler than the traditional one, with 8 fewer phonemes.

The asymmetric lack of retroflex fricatives in the Proto-Athabaskan inventory appears as a surprising gap, but Leer argued against them being distinguished from *š and *ž: "In my reconstruction, PA lacked distinctively reflexed *šʳ and *žʳ as opposed to plain *š and *ž". Although Leer (2005) did not include *ʔ and *h in his list of reconstructed consonants, those two proto-phonemes nevertheless appear in a variety of reconstructions in the same article and hence it can be assumed that they are indeed part of his proto-phoneme inventory.

====Vowel reconstruction====

{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

Leer (2005:284) also offered a vowel system consisting of four long or full vowels and three short or reduced vowels which are more centralized.

=====Tone=====
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

The reconstruction of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] is an issue of major importance in Athabaskan language studies, as well as for the wider historical linguistics field. The possibility of a reconstructable tone system was first proposed by Edward Sapir, although it took around a half-century for his ideas to be realized into a coherent system. Michael Krauss's unpublished manuscript on Athabaskan tone (1979) circulated for decades before being published (2005), and has become the basis for all discussion of Athabaskan tonology. Krauss gives a detailed history of the work on Athabaskan tonology which is briefly summarized here.

The early work on Athabaskan languages ignored the existence of phonemic tone. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice was the first linguist to describe tone for an Athabaskan language, specifically for Carrier, in 1891. Sapir’s first fieldwork on Athabaskan languages was with Chasta Costa and Kato, both Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages that lack tone. He encountered tone in Tlingit in 1914 when working with [[Louis Shotridge]], a student and consultant of [[Franz Boas]], with whom Sapir described the minimal pair /qáːt/ "crippled" and /qaːt/ "[[sockeye salmon]]". He then encountered tone in Tsuut’ina (Sarcee) and gradually became convinced that Proto-Athabaskan must be reconstructed as a tonal language, although he was concerned by apparently contradictory findings in Gwich’in, Deg Hit’an, and Navajo. His student [[Li Fang-Kuei|Fang-Kuei Li]], whom Sapir described as "a very able Chinaman", had the benefit of speaking [[Mandarin Chinese]] and hence being well aware of tone. Sapir and Fang-Kuei Li investigated tone in several other Athabaskan languages, including Mattole, Wailaki, Hupa, Dëne Sųłiné (Chipewyan), and Hare. The problem that disturbed Sapir and others was that tone in Athabaskan languages does correspond, but in an unexpected and difficult to explain way.

It can be seen in the table above that the languages differ in how their tones correspond: the first three have low tone where the next three have high tone, and vice versa, with the last three lacking tone entirely. This issue puzzled linguists for some time. Both Li and [[Harry Hoijer]] both harbored suspicions that Proto-Athabaskan lacked tone entirely, but it took until 1964 when Michael Krauss published a paper in the ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' where he argued that Proto-Athabaskan instead had glottalization contrasts which developed independently into tones in the daughter languages or in some cases were lost. This argument was strengthened by data from [[Eyak language|Eyak]] which had a system of glottal modifications on vowels that corresponded well to Athabaskan tones, and furthermore by [[Jeff Leer]]'s discovery of the Tongass dialect of [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]], which had a system closely corresponding that of Eyak.

The oppositions in tonal distribution are explained as an ahistorical division in Athabaskan languages whereby each language becomes either "high-marked", "low-marked", or "unmarked" for tone based on the Proto-Athabaskan reconstruction. The following table adapted from Rice &amp; Hargus (2005:9) shows how the syllable codas of Proto-Athabaskan (PA) and the internal reconstruction of Pre-Proto-Athabaskan (PPA) correspond with those of the high-marked and low-marked languages.

In the above table, the symbol v represents a [[mora (linguistics)|monomoraic]] reduced vowel, the VV represents a bimoraic full vowel, and the V a monomoraic full vowel in a syllable nucleus whose second mora is ’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingston |first=John |title=The phonetics of Athabaskan tonogenesis |journal=Amsterdam studies in the theory and history of linguistic science, series 4 |volume=269 |pages=136 |url=http://people.umass.edu/jkingstn/web%20page/research/athabaskan%20tonogenesis%20camera%20ready%20final%2021%20october%2004.pdf |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501025451/http://people.umass.edu/jkingstn/web%20page/research/athabaskan%20tonogenesis%20camera%20ready%20final%2021%20october%2004.pdf |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The R represents a sonorant, the S a fricative, the T a stop or affricate, and the ’ a glottalization of the preceding segment. Note that nearly all languages that developed tone have also lost syllable-final ejectivity, retaining only the glottalized sonorants and bare glottal stops in that position. (Syllable initial ejective stops and affricates are of course retained.)

===Morphology===

Because obvious similarities in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] are prevalent throughout all of the languages in the Athabaskan family, Proto-Athabaskan rejoices in an extensive reconstructed proto-morphology. All Athabaskan languages are morphologically complex and are commonly described as [[polysynthetic]], thus it comes as no surprise that the proto-language is also morphologically complex.

====Verb template====

Keren Rice (2000) offers a "Pan-Athabaskan" verb template that characterizes the complexity of verb morphology in the proto-language and the daughter languages.

&lt;/div&gt;

The actual verb template of Proto-Athabaskan has not been reconstructed yet, as noted by Vajda (2010:38). Nonetheless, Rice's generalization of the verb template based on various languages in the family is a reasonable approximation of what the structure of the Proto-Athabaskan verb might look like.

Rice's is probably the newest attempt at a Pan-Athabaskan template, but it is not the only one. Kibrik (1995) and Hoijer (1971) also proposed templates which generalized across a number of Athabaskan languages. Hoijer's proposal is missing several elements which were described in detail later, but Kibrik's is not terribly different from Rice's.

&lt;/div&gt;

Kibrik only gives the zones rather than individual positions where the distinction matters. In addition, Kibrik did not give the domains and boundaries which have been added here for comparison.

A major distinction between the Kibrik and Rice versions is in the terminology, with Kibrik's "Standard Average Athabaskan" maintaining much of the traditional Athabaskanist terminology – still widely used – but Rice changing in favor of aspectual descriptions found in wider semantic and typological literature. The terminology in comparison:

* Rice (2000) "viewpoint aspect" = conventional "mode"
* Rice (2000) "situation aspect" = conventional "conjugation"
* Rice (2000) "subsituation aspect" ≈ Kibrik's "inceptive"

Kari (1989) offers a rigorous foundation for the position class system that makes up the verb template in Athabaskan languages. He defines a few terms and resurrects others which have since become standard in Athabaskanist literature.

* '''Position''': a point or slot the verb template which hosts some number of morphemes which never cooccur. Some affixes may occur in multiple positions which are usually adjacent, but most morphemes are found in a single position. Kari (1989:435) gives the Ahtna ''ɣo-'' mode prefix and the ''s-'' qualifier as examples of multipositional morphemes.
** '''Floating position''': a position which seems to move around depending on the appearance or lack of other morphemes in the verb. Kari cites the Ahtna third person plural subject pronominal ''q-'' as occurring in three different locations "under highly constrained conditions" (Kari 1989:435).
* '''Zone''': a group of positions which are adjacent and semantically similar. Some previous descriptions of "position-subposition" are zones with positions within them (Kari 1989:435). The qualifiers are a type of zone, being made of at least two positions. The description by Krauss (1969) and Leer (2008) of the classifier as a three-morpheme sequence in Proto-Athabaskan technically makes the classifier a zone, but it is monomorphemic and often treated like a single position in the analysis of documented languages. Tlingit has a classifier approaching a zone although it is morphologically a single unit, and Eyak has a true classifier zone with two phonologically separate prefixes.
* '''Domain''': an area of zones and positions which is grouped together as a phonological unit.
** '''Stem domain''': a domain including the verb root and suffixes, and usually including the classifier.
** '''Conjunct domain''': a domain spanning from the classifier (may or may not be included) leftward to the object prefixes.
** '''Disjunct domain''': a domain spanning from the incorporated nouns to the preverbs, and not including any bound phrases that are considered to be word-external.
* '''Boundary''': a morphological division between zones or domains. Each boundary has an associated conventional symbol. Not all researchers describe all the boundaries for every language, and it is not clear that there is total agreement on the existence of all boundaries.
** '''Disjunct boundary''' ('''#'''): the boundary between the disjunct and conjunct domains. Found in most Athabaskan descriptions.
** '''Qualifier-pronominal boundary''' ('''='''/'''%'''): the boundary between the qualifiers and the outer pronominals (3 subjects, objects, etc.). Kari proposed using = but since that symbol is often used for clitics, many authors (e.g. Rice 2000) have used % instead.
** '''Conjugation-qualifier boundary''' ('''%'''): the boundary between the qualifiers and the conjugation prefixes. Not commonly used, especially with the loss of the % symbol to the qualifier-pronominal boundary.
** '''Stem boundary''' ('''['''): the boundary between the inner pronominals (1 and 2 subject) and the classifier.

Kari (1989) and elsewhere uses + to indicate morpheme boundaries. This convention has been adopted by some Athabaskanists, but many others use the more common – instead. Another innovation from Kari is the use of angle brackets to mark epenthetic segments, a convention which is not often used even by Kari himself.

====Classifier====

The "classifier" is a verb prefix that occurs in all Athabaskan languages as well as the Tlingit and Eyak languages. It is, as Leer (1990:77) puts it, "the hallmark of Na-Dene languages". The classifier is found in no other language family, although may be present in the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] family per Vajda (2010). It is an obligatory prefix such that verbs do not exist without the classifier. Its function varies little from language to language, essentially serving as an indicator of (middle) voice and valence for the verb.

=====The name=====

The name "classifier" is confusing to non-Athabaskanists since it implies a classificatory function that is not obvious. [[Franz Boas]] first described it for Tlingit, saying "it is fairly clear that the primary function of these elements is a classificatory one" (Boas 1917:28), a not inaccurate statement given that it does enter into the classificatory verb system. Previously [[Edward Sapir]] had noted it in his seminal essay on the Na-Dene family, calling it a "'third modal element'" (Sapir 1915:540). He described it as indicating "such notions as transitive, intransitive, and passive" (id.), thus having voice and valency related functions. Once it was realized that the Tlingit and Athabaskan morphemes were functionally similar Boas's name for the Tlingit form was extended to the Athabaskan family. Unfortunately the classifier has only the vague remains of classificatory function in most Athabaskan languages, so in this family the name is opaque.

Because of the confusion that occurs from the use of the term "classifier", there have been a number of proposals for replacement terms. [[Andrej Kibrik]] (1993, 1996, 2001) has used the term "transitivity indicator" with the gloss abbreviation &lt;small&gt;TI&lt;/small&gt;, Keren Rice (2000, 2009){{citation needed|date=November 2010}} has used "voice/valence prefix" abbreviated &lt;small&gt;V/V&lt;/small&gt;, and for Tlingit Constance Naish and Gillian Story (1973:368–378) used "extensor". None of these alternatives has gained acceptance in the Athabaskan community, and Jeff Leer describes this situation:

{{quote|text=A better term would be something like "valentizers", since their principal function is to indicate the valence of the verb ... However, since the name classifier is one of the few grammatical labels sanctioned by common use among Athabaskanists, it is probably not worth the trouble to try to change it.|sign=Jeff Leer|source=1990, p. 93, fn. 12}}

=====Reconstruction=====

Jeff Leer (1990:93) offers an early reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan classifier. It is a portmanteau morpheme with two dimensions that are both phonological and functional. The one dimension is the "series", which surfaces as the presence or absence of a lateral fricative. The other dimension is the "D-effect", surfacing as the presence or absence of either vocalization or an alveolar stop.

Leer (2008:22) gives a newer, more complex reconstruction, which takes into account some rare correspondences with the Eyak ''yi-'' prefix. This Eyak form corresponds to a Proto-Athabaskan ''*nʸə-'' that is mostly lost.

'''British Railway Standard Locomotive Owners' Group''' (BRSLOG) is a [[consortium]] of individuals and organisations concerned with the surviving and new "under-construction" [[Steam locomotives of British Railways#BR standard classes|British Railway Standard Class]] [[locomotive]]s engineered by [[Robert Riddles]]. This group meets twice a year at various venues and is a valuable forum for cooperation as well as providing an interesting overview of the status quo of all these locomotives.

The consortium has made arrangements with the [[National Railway Museum]] for the supply of surviving British Railways drawings to members. From time to time, members recreate 'lost' drawings by reverse-engineering from existing components. Many of those lost drawings are for LMS-designed components that were adopted without alteration, examples being certain Brake Hanger Brackets and Flexible Stretcher Brackets.

Comprehensive arrangements exist within the BRSLOG for sharing knowledge of parts and patterns.

[[Image:Bauakademie Schinkel (Eduard Gaertner).jpg|thumb|right|220px|"Bauakademie", Painting by [[Eduard Gaertner]], 1868]]
[[Image:Bauakademie.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Reconstructed corner and simulated canvas facade in 2005]]

The '''Bauakademie''' (''Building Academy'') in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], was a [[higher education]] school for art of building to train [[wikt:Master builder|master builder]]s.  It originated from the construction department of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts#Name_changes|Academy of Fine Arts and Mechanical Sciences]] (from 1704), which emphasized the aesthetic elements of art of building while ignoring the technical.  Thus, the governmental Upper Building Department ("UBD") decided to establish an entirely new building educational institution named "Bauakademie".  It was founded on 18 March 1799 by King [[Frederick William III]] and, in 1801, incorporated into the UBD, as its section. 

The building of the ''Building Academy'' (''Bauakademie'') built between 1832 and 1836 (later known as '''''Schinkel's Bauakademie'''''), is considered one of the forerunners of modern architecture due to its theretofore uncommon use of red brick and the relatively streamlined facade of the building. Designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], it was built near the [[Berliner Stadtschloss|Berlin City Palace]] and accommodated two [[Kingdom of Prussia|royal Prussian]] institutions: the State Construction Commission (''Oberbaudeputation''), which Schinkel was director of, and - first of all - the ''Building Academy'' (institution), which in 1879 gave birth to the ''Royal Technical [[Higher Education|Higher]] School'' (''Königlich [[Technische Hochschule]] Charlottenburg'') - the forerunner of the [[Technical University of Berlin#History|Technical University of Berlin]]. 

For nearly 50 years (1885-1933), the Bauakademie became the home of the „Königlich Preussische Messbild-Anstalt“ renamed to „Staatliche Bildstelle“ in 1921. This institution, under its director Albrecht Meydenbauer, became the first world-wide office professionally working with photogrammetry and establishing an archive of historical buildings based on photography. By 1920, approximately 20.000 glass-negatives of the format 30x30 cm and 40x40 cm had been collected in Germany and abroad.

During the [[Weimar period]], the Bauakademie was the home of the famous [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] as well as other institutions supported by the [[State of Prussia]].

Damaged during [[World War II]], the Bauakademie was then partially restored, but in 1962 the building was demolished to make room for the future Ministry of Foreign Affairs of [[East Germany]].

In 1995, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of East Germany was demolished in order to recreate the Werderscher Markt area. Since then, proposals to rebuild Schinkel's Bauakademie have been discussed with city and Federal authorities. The Werderscher Markt area has already been partially recreated by the [[Bertelsmann]]-funded reconstruction of the [[Alte Kommandantur]]. As for the Bauakademie, between 2000 and 2001 students erected a [[temporary structure]] to give an impression of the volume and form of the building. Current proposals under consideration intend to use a reconstructed Bauakademie to accommodate an architecture museum as well as a Mercedes-Benz research institute about the future of automobile.

The cost of the project is estimated at 51 million euros.

A '''bone folder''', '''bonefolder''', or '''folding bone''' is a dull-edged [[hand tool]] used to fold and crease material in crafts such as [[bookbinding]],&lt;ref name="BBandP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KSmithvol1"/&gt; [[cardmaking]],&lt;ref name="greetcardencl"/&gt; [[origami]],&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt; and other paper crafts &lt;!-- PLEASE do not link [[papercraft]]; it has a specialized, more limited meaning --&gt; that require a sharp crease or fold. The tool was also used when correspondence by letter writing was more formal and an art.

Often made from the [[leg bone]] of a cow, deer, or similar animal and ivory.&lt;ref name="RandEManual"/&gt; Alternatives made from [[plastic]] now exist; however, those made from bone may be less likely to leave residue on the workpiece.&lt;ref name="inhousebookbinding"/&gt;

In Japan, the equivalent folding tool is traditionally made from [[bamboo]], although alternatives include a Japanese fabric marking tool (''hera'') and a Western bone folder.&lt;ref name="Japanesebookbinding"/&gt;

A timeline is provided at the beginning of the book; and various maps, photographs, and images are used throughout the book. ''Born in Blood and Fire'' was originally published by [[W. W. Norton and Company]] in 2001. Three other editions have been published since, the most recent in 2016. Later editions include updates and expansion of colonialism, nationalism, the [[Cuban Revolution]], and current political and economic issues. W. W. Norton and Company published Chasteen’s companion reader entitled ''Born in Blood and Fire: Latin American Voices'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Born in Blood and Fire: Latin American Voices|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-93558-5/|work=W.

==Overview==
This an early case of authors attempting to exercise their moral rights under the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] (VARA). VARA was passed in 1990 and added several [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.

==Facts==
The Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in [[New York City]] under the name "Jx3". 474431 Associates was the owner of a former [[Macy's]] warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the [[Long Island City]] section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company ["SIG"] managed the property as "The Factory Building" and marketed it as a mall.

On December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG "to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations" in the building. The artists had "full authority in design, color, and style" of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.

On March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear's representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.

==District Court==

The District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. |vol=861 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=303 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1994 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/861/303/2261919/ |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That decision was appealed to the [[Second Circuit]] Court of Appeals.

==Circuit Court==
The Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a [[work for hire|work made for hire]] and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from ''[[Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid]]'', 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a "work made for hire" or if the artist was working as "independent contractor".

The '''Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies''' (CUCS) was founded in 1981, as a joint creation between the [[University of Manitoba]] and [[St. Andrew's College (Winnipeg)|St. Andrew's College]].  The mission of the Centre is to create, preserve and communicate knowledge dealing with [[Ukrainian Canadian]] culture and scholarship.  It is located in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

The Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies, provides undergraduate courses and interdisciplinary programs of study in areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian culture. The Centre also encourages and promotes research and scholarship in all areas relating to Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers nineteen courses in such areas as [[Ukrainian language]], Ukrainian Canadian literature and folklore, the history of [[Ukraine]] and of the Ukrainians in [[Canada]], the geography of Ukraine, the government and politics of Ukraine, [[Eastern Christianity]], [[Byzantine art]], and the Ukrainian arts in Canada. These courses can be taken singly, for general interest, as options, or as components of programs in various departments in the Faculty of Arts or in the School of Art.

For students interested in specializing in the area, the Centre offers interdisciplinary programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies leading to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with a general major, an advanced major, or a minor in this field. The University of Manitoba is the only university in Canada which offers undergraduate degree programs in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies.

The Centre offers courses on the University of Manitoba campus, and at off-campus locations in Winnipeg. From time to time, the Centre is also able to offer courses at other locations in Manitoba and through teleconference, as well as specialized programs during the summer.

Although the Centre does not offer graduate courses, it is possible to pursue graduate work in Ukrainian Canadian Heritage Studies at the M.A. and Ph.D. levels through Interdisciplinary Programs in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the University of Manitoba. Several fellowships are available.

Individual scholars are encouraged to pursue their own research agenda within a Ukrainian Canadian context. Topics of current interest include an exploration of Ukrainian Canadian history, the occurrence of Ukrainian Canadiana within North American popular culture, explorations of Ukrainian Canadian arts including folklore, fine arts, and literature, issues in genealogy, and the study of music both popular and classical) with a Ukrainian Canadian focus.

An additional new direction is the development of an online courses on Ukrainian Canadian folklore.

The Centre, since 2002, has held a bi-annual Tarnawecky Distinguished Lecture program at the University of Manitoba. This program is intended to bring academics and experts as speakers to the University.

The acting director, since 2016, is Dr. Orest Cap.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9932">In [[linguistics]], '''clitic doubling''', or '''pronominal reduplication''' is a phenomenon by which [[clitic]] [[pronoun]]s appear in [[verb]] phrases together with the full [[noun phrase]]s that they refer to (as opposed to the cases where such pronouns and full noun phrases are in [[complementary distribution]]).

Clitic doubling is found in many languages, including [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Degema language|Degema]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The conditions on clitic doubling vary from language to language, generally depending on well-known properties of the objects along the [[Animacy#Animacy hierarchy and morphosyntactic alignment|animacy hierarchy]] (allowing, requiring, or forbidding clitic-doubling for different kinds of objects). In this regard, clitic doubling for objects can be viewed as a species of [[differential object marking]].

== Spanish ==
Spanish is one well-known example of a clitic-doubling language, having clitic doubling for both direct and indirect objects. Because standard Spanish grammatical structure does not draw a clear distinction between an indirect object and a direct object referring to a person or another animate entity (see [[Spanish prepositions#a|Spanish prepositions]]), it is common but not compulsory to use clitic doubling to clarify. Compare:

:''Conoc&amp;iacute; a Juan''. "I met Juan." (Direct object: ''a Juan'')
:''Di un regalo a Juan''. "I gave a gift to Juan." (Direct object: ''un regalo''; indirect object: ''a Juan'')

In such constructions, the indirect object can be expressed both as a full noun phrase and as a clitic in order to note that the noun phrase beginning with ''a'' (to) should be understood as an indirect object:

:''Le di un regalo a mi madre.'' "I gave my mother a gift."
:''A mis invitados siempre les ofrezco café.'' "I always offer coffee to my guests."
:''No les des comida a los animales.'' "Do not give food to the animals."

The above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:

{| class="wikitable"
|''Le''
|''di''
|''un''
|''regalo''
|''a''
|''mi''
|''madre''
|-
|To her
|I gave
|a
|gift
|to
|my
|mother
|}
 
{| class="wikitable"
|''A''
|''mis''
|''invitados''
|''siempre''
|''les''
|''ofrezco''
|''café''
|-
|to
|my
|guests
|always
|to them
|I offer
|coffee
|}
 
{| class="wikitable"
|''No''
|''les''
|''des''
|''comida''
|''a''
|''los''
|''animales''
|-
|not
|to them
|give
|food
|to
|the
|animals
|}

This usage is highly preferred for many verbs, but for some verbs it is not compulsory, and it would also be valid to say: "''Siempre ofrezco café a mis invitados''", without clitic doubling.

Similarly, the direct object may also be doubled, with both the direct object pronoun and the full noun phrase, but this is not as common as indirect clitic doubling and is usually influenced by definiteness, animacy, and specificity.

:''(Lo) vi a tu papá en la tienda.'' "I saw your dad at the store."
:''El otro día (la) conocí a su esposa.'' "The other day I met his wife."

One particular use is to clarify emphatic structures:

:''Ese regalo se lo di a él.'' "I gave '''him''' that gift."

==Italian==
In [[Italian language|Italian]], clitic doubling is used as [[colloquial]] [[pleonasm]], although it is considered incorrect by some.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4096&amp;ctg_id=93 Accademia della Crusca, ''A me mi: è una forma corretta?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: ''a me mi pare di sì'' ("I [personally, for what I am concerned] think so")

==Iloko==
In [[Ilokano language|Iloko]], a [[Grammatical person|third person]] pronoun must co-occur with the full noun phrase to which it refers when 1) the noun phrase is the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]] and a pronoun is the [[Patient (grammar)|patient]], or when 2) the noun phrase is the possessor and a pronoun is the thing possessed. The appropriate [[Ilokano grammar#Enclitic personal-pronoun sequences|fused personal pronoun]] is used and the number of its third person component must agree with the noun phrase.

Examples:
 Nakita ni Maria ni Juan.
 ''Maria saw Juan.''
 
 Nakitana ni Juan.
 ''She saw Juan.''
 
 BUT...
 Nakitanaka ni Maria.
 ''Maria saw you.''
 NOT ''*Nakitaka ni Maria.''

== Lombard ==
In [[Lombard language|Lombard]], clitics are widely used with both nouns and pronouns.

Te gh'el diset ti a la Rina che l'è staa luu?
Will you tell OR Would you mind telling Rina it was him [who did it]?

{| class="wikitable"
|''Te''
|''gh'''
|''el''
|''diset''
|''ti''
|''a la Rina''
|''che''
|''l'''
|''è''
|''staa''
|''luu?''
|-
|You
|to her
|it
|(you) tell
|you
|to Rina
|that
|it
|has
|been
|he?
|
|}

== Venetian ==
In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], clitics usually double the second singular person subject and third singular and plural subject.

The above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:

{| class="wikitable"
|''I''
|''mii''
|''i''
|''vien''
|''doman''
|-
|The (parents)
|mine
|they
|come
|tomorrow
|}
'My parents come tomorrow'

{| class="wikitable"
|''Marco''
|''el''
|''Vien''
|''doman''
|-
|Marco
|he
|comes
|tomorrow
|}
'Marco comes tomorrow'

{| class="wikitable"
|''Ti''
|''te/ti/tu''
|''vien''
|''doman''
|-
|You
|you
|come
|tomorrow
|}
'You come tomorrow'

Interrogative subjects clitics double also other subjects. They attach to the verb:

{| class="wikitable"
|''Cantè-o''
|''anca''
|''voaltri/e ?''
|-
|Sing-you
|also
|you (pl.m/f)
|}
'Do you (pl.) sing as well?'

Accusative clitics double first and second singular/plural direct object
{| class="wikitable"
|''Te''
|''go''
|''visto''
|''ti''
|-
|you
|(I) have
|seen
|you
|}

In some varieties of the language, also dative clitics may double and indirect object, even of third person:
{| class="wikitable"
|''Marco''
|''el''
|''ghe''
|''ga''
|''dà''
|''un libro''
|''a Toni''
|-
|Mark
|he
|to him
|has
|given
|a book
|to Tony
|}

==Macedonian and Bulgarian==
In the standard [[Macedonian language]], clitic doubling is obligatory with [[definiteness|definite]] [[direct object|direct]] and [[indirect object]]s, which contrasts with standard Bulgarian where clitic doubling is optional. Non-standard dialects of Macedonian and Bulgarian have differing rules regarding clitic doubling.{{ref|friedman1994}}

== Degema ==
Clitic doubling occurs in [[Degema language|Degema]], as it does in Romance and Slavic languages. However, clitic doubling in Degema is not associated with the presence of a preposition as in Romance languages like Spanish nor is it associated with topicality or specificity as in Slavic languages like Bulgarian. Rather, what make clitic doubling in Degema possible are syntactic (movement and anaphoricity) and discourse (emphasis and/or familiarity) factors (Kari 2003){{ref|kari2003}} Consider (1) below:

(1) Eni      mo=sire
    elephant cl=run
   'An elephant is running'

In (1) the subject noun phrase (NP) 'Eni' is doubled by the clitic 'mo='. The clitic agrees in person, number and case with the doubled subject NP.

Example (2) shows that specific and non-specific subjects in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:

(2) Eni      mo=rere                  (non-specific)
    elephant cl=walk
   'An elephant is walking'

    Eni      mee mo=rere              (specific)
    elephant my  cl=walk
   'My elephant is walking'

Example (3) shows that both topicalized and non-topicalized NPs in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:

(3) Okper o=kun              esen                (non-topicalized)
    Otter cl=catch.factative fish
   'An Otter caught a fish'

    Okper nu           o=kun              esen   (topicalized)
    Otter Focus marker cl=catch.factative fish
   'It was an Otter that caught a fish'

In Degema, the preposition does not feature in clitic doubling constructions in particular and in cliticization in general. Although there are object NPs such as indirect object NPs that can cooccur with a preposition, there are no corresponding object clitics to double them, unlike subject NPs.

Kari (2003: 135f) adds that "syntactic factors are stronger than discourse factors in the licensing of clitic doubling in Degema.  Discourse factors only ensure the expression or suppression of the doubled NP after syntactic operations have taken place".

'''Critical data studies''' is the systematic study of data and its criticisms. The field was named by scholars [[Craig Dalton]] and [[Jim Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Craig|last2=Thatcher|first2=Jim|title=What does a Critical Data Studies look like and why do we care?|url=http://societyandspace.org/2014/05/12/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care-craig-dalton-and-jim-thatcher/#|website=Society + Space|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its naming, significant interest in critical data studies was generated by [[danah boyd]] and [[Kate Crawford]], who posed a set of research questions for the critical study of [[big data]] and its impacts on society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=boyd|first1=danah|last2=Crawford|first2=Kate|title=Critical questions for Big Data|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=10 May 2012|volume=15|issue=5|pages=662–679|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name implies, critical data studies draws heavily on the influence of [[critical theory]] which it applies to the study of [[data]]. Subsequently, others have worked to further solidify a field called critical data studies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iliadis|first=Andrew|last2=Russo|first2=Federica|date=2016-10-17|title=Critical data studies: An introduction|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=205395171667423|doi=10.1177/2053951716674238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other key scholars in this discipline include [[Rob Kitchin]] and [[Tracey P. Lauriault]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitchin, Rob, and Tracey P. Lauriault, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kitchin, Rob, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have attempted to make sense of data through different theoretical frameworks, some of which include analyzing data technically, ethically, politically/economically, temporally/spatially, and philosophically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the key academic journals related to critical data studies include the ''[[Journal of Big Data]]'' and ''[[Big Data and Society]]''.

==Motivation==

In their article in which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several justifications as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Craig, and Jim Thatcher, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, 'big data' is an important aspect of twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of [[technological determinism]], but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Rather, data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and during the data collection process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Mike|last2=Lupton|first2=Deborah|date=2015-10-13|title=Toward a manifesto for the 'public understanding of big data'|journal=Public Understanding of Science|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=104–116|doi=10.1177/0963662515609005|pmid=26468128|url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/researchrepository/items/0649f4e2-e43e-4e60-b8f7-a5f12801ebcd/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented. Moreover, data alone cannot speak for itself; in order to possess any concrete meaning, data must be accompanied by theoretical insight or alternative quantitative or qualitative research measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Yam|first=Yaneer|date=2016-11-01|title=From big data to important information|journal=Complexity|language=en|volume=21|issue=S2|pages=73–98|doi=10.1002/cplx.21785|issn=1099-0526|arxiv=1604.00976|bibcode=2016Cmplx..21S..73B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton and Thatcher argue that if one were to only think of data in terms of its exploitative power, there is no possibility of using data for revolutionary, liberatory purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, Dalton and Thatcher propose that a critical approach in studying data allows for 'big data' to be combined with older, 'small data,' and thus create more thorough research, opening up more opportunities, questions and topics to be explored.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abreu|first1=Amelia|last2=Acker|first2=Amelia|title=Context and collection: A research agenda for small data|journal=IConference 2013 Proceedings|date=2013|pages=549–554|doi=10.9776/13275|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/39750|accessdate=17 January 2018|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and concerns for critical data scholars==

The use of data in modern society brings about new ways of understanding and measuring the world, but also brings with it certain concerns or issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Data scholars attempt to bring some of these issues to light in their quest to be critical of data. Rob Kitchin identifies both technical and organizational issues of data, as well as some normative and ethical questions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Technical and organization issues concerning data range from the scope of datasets, access to the data, the quality of the data, the integration of the data, the application of analytics and ecological fallacies, as well as the skills and organizational capabilities of the research team.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the normative and ethical concerns addressed by Kitchin include surveillance through one's data ([[dataveillance]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the privacy of one's data, the ownership of one's data, the security of one's data, anticipatory or corporate governance, and profiling individuals by their data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of these concerns must be taken into account by scholars of data in their objective to be critical.

Following in the tradition of critical urban studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brenner | first1 = Neil| title = What is critical urban theory? | journal = City | volume = 13| issue = 2–3| pages = 198–207| doi = 10.1080/13604810902996466 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have raised similar concerns around data and digital information technologies in the urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Kate|last2=Finn|first2=Megan|date=2015-08-01|title=The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters|journal=GeoJournal|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=491–502|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z|issn=0343-2521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickren|first=Graham|date=2016-10-12|title=The global assemblage of digital flow|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=42|issue=2|pages=225–243|language=en|doi=10.1177/0309132516673241}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Joe Shaw and Mark Graham have examined these in light of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s '[[right to the city]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Joe|last2=Graham|first2=Mark|date=February 2017|title=An Informational Right to the City?

[[File:Statua di Amore e Psiche.jpg|thumb|''Cupid and Psyche'', Roman marble sculpture after a [[Hellenistic]] original, h. 1.25m ([[Capitoline Museums]])]]
The marble '''''[[Cupid and Psyche]]''''' conserved in the [[Capitoline Museums]],&lt;ref&gt;Musei Capitolini, inv. MC0408.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rome]], is a 1st or 2nd century CE&lt;!--this article uses the BCE/CE convention--&gt; Roman copy of a late [[Hellenistic]] original.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Helbig, ''et al.'' ''Führer durch die öffentichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom'', 1963-72, vol. ii:238f.&lt;/ref&gt; It was given to the nascent Capitoline Museums by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1749, shortly after its discovery. Its graceful balance and sentimental appearance made it a favourite among the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] generations of artists and visitors, and it was copied in many materials from bronze to [[biscuit porcelain]].&lt;ref&gt;Various copies in a range of materials are noted by Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture 1500-1900'' 1981: cat. no. 26, pp189-91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Canova]] consciously set out to outdo the Antique original with his own ''Cupid and Psyche'' of 1808 (''illustration, below left'')

The sculpture was discovered in the garden of the ''vigna'' of the canonico Panicale on the [[Aventine Hill]] in February 1749.&lt;ref&gt;(Giovanni Pietro Lucatelli),  ''Museo Capitolino, o sia descrizione delle statue'', Rome, 1750:30, described as "a graceful group of a man and woman tenderly embracing", noted by Haskell and Penny 1981; the description and discovery in the ''vigna del canonico Panicale'' are repeated in Filippo Titi, ''Descrizione delle pitture, sculture e architetture esposte al pubblico in Roma'', Rome, 1763:vol. II:22, and every guidebook since.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture quite eclipsed a Roman marble of a winged Cupid and Psyche that had been discovered in the 17th century and removed to the [[Uffizi|Medici collection]] in [[Florence]]. The Capitoline ''Cupid and Psyche'' was among the cream of the Roman collections sequestered by the French under the terms of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) and transferred to [[Paris]] amid grand theatrics. It was returned to Rome after the fall of Napoleon. 

Not all viewers were satisfied by its mediocre execution, and [[Francis Haskell]] and [[Nicholas Penny]] noted that Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Victor&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Victor, ''Musée des Antiques. Dessiné et gravé par [[Pierre Bouillon|P. Bouillon]] peintre, avec des notices explicatives'', Paris, 1818:vol. I.&lt;/ref&gt; thought it was a reflection of some earlier, better work, and that, earlier, Joseph-Jerome Le Français de Lalande hoped in print&lt;ref&gt;Lalande, ''Voyage d'un François en Italie'', Paris, 1769, reflecting his voyage of 1765-66; an expanded edition was issued in 1787-88; noted by Haskell and Penny.&lt;/ref&gt; that it might inspire some modern sculptor to come up with a superior work on the same subject. Antonio Canova took up the challenge quite consciously, in his ''Cupid and Psyche'' of 1808.
[[File:Canova-Cupd and Psyche 300degree view.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Cupid and Psyche'' by [[Antonio Canova]], 1808 ([[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg)]] 
Another version of the ''Cupid and Psyche'' was discovered by conte [[Giuseppe Fede]] in his early excavations at [[Hadrian's Villa]], [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]. It has disappeared now, but it was drawn, in its completed and restored condition, by [[Pompeo Batoni]], who was assembling a "paper museum"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the "paper museum" compiled by [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]].&lt;/ref&gt; of antiquities in 1727-30 for the English antiquary Richard Topham.&lt;ref&gt;The Topham Batoni drawing, with the rest of his collection, has passed to the library of [[Eton College]]; the drawing is illustrated in Haskell and Penny 1981:93, fig. 52&lt;/ref&gt; As it was restored, Cupid turns his head away coyly.

'''''Dark Star Safari''''' (2002) is a written account of a trip taken by author [[Paul Theroux]] from [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]] to [[Cape Town]] via trains, buses, cars, and armed convoy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview9 Guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  Theroux had lived in Africa as a young and idealistic early member of the [[Peace Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/books/get-me-out-of-africa.html?pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the reason for this trip was to assess the impact on Africa of the many years of aid from Western countries.  His assessment is generally critical of the long-term impact of aid programs.

Throughout the duration of the trip Theroux describes the writing of an erotic novella. This novella was eventually published in 2003, amongst a collection of short stories, as "The Stranger at the Palazzo D'Oro".

As of 2006, California had an estimated population of 37,172,015, more than 12 percent of the U.S. population.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 1,557,112 people ( i.e.  2,781,539 births minus 1,224,427 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 751,419 people. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 1,415,879 people, and migration from within the U.S. resulted in a net decrease of 564,100 people.  California is the 13th fastest-growing state.

The following ethnic groups that made up the statewide public school student body were Asians (11%), African Americans (7%), Native Americans (0.7%), and Pacific Islanders (0.6%). Students of mixed race made up about 2% of the public schools. Hispanics made up the majority of the state's public schools since 2010.

Since the 2000 [[United States Census|U.S. Census]], California has been known as the second state in US history (after Hawaii since its statehood in 1959) to have a non-white majority, and since 2014, the first state to have a Latino plurality surpass other racial/ethnic groups. The media discussed the possibility of Latinos becoming a majority in the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article25940218.html|title=Census: Hispanics overtake whites to become California’s largest ethnic group|first1=Phillip|last1=Reese|first2=Stephen|last2=Magagnini|date=June 30, 2015|website=Sacbee.com|accessdate=October 7, 2017|via=Sacramento Bee}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time since statehood (1850) when massive immigration of Anglo-Americans during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848-49 reduced Spanish speakers to 20 percent of the population. 

California has the largest population of [[European Americans]] of any state.  For example, in 2000 California had more [[Bulgarian Americans]], [[Romanian Americans]] and [[Hungarian Americans]] than any other U.S. state. Los Angeles and San Francisco have large [[Russian American]] or [[Russia]]n populations, as well [[Ukrainian American]]s; and a long history of [[English American|English]], [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian Americans|Italian]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[Polish Americans|Polish]] communities established by immigrants in the late 19th century. There are also many [[English Americans]], [[Irish Americans]], and [[French American]]s whose ancestors were the original 49ers, also known as the [[California Gold Rush]] immigrants. There are also immigrant communities from the former [[Yugoslavia]] such as [[Bosnian American|Bosnians]], [[Croatian American|Croatians]], and [[Serbian American|Serbians]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

California has over one million residents each with [[Spanish American|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] ancestry {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, with communities along coastal parts of the state such as San Diego, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Camarillo, California|Camarillo]], [[Santa Clara Valley]] (including [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]), [[Salinas Valley]], [[Santa Maria Valley]], and [[San Joaquin Valley]]. A small wave of [[Danish people|Danish]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Swedish people|Swedish]] immigrants founded towns like [[Lathrop, California|Lathrop]] near Stockton, [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] near Los Angeles, [[Kingsburg, California|Kingsburg]] south of Fresno, [[Solvang, California|Solvang]] north of Santa Barbara in the late 1800s and the private community of [[Sveadal]] located 15 miles south of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and populated entirely by members of the [[Swedish American]] Patriotic League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515093203/http://www.sveadal.org/SAPL/Welcome.html|title=the Swedish American Patriotic league|date=May 15, 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small colonies of early 19th century [[Russia]]n settlement under the [[Russian American Company]] are in [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortross.org/|title=Fort Ross, California|website=Fortross.org|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]] and the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] Valley in [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] and [[Napa County, California|Napa]] counties. Small [[Amish]]/[[Mennonite]] colonies exist in an area bordered by the towns Oakdale, Riverbank and Ripon near [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] and in Reedley, Sanger and Orange Cove near Fresno in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]; and in the outer [[Salinas Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amishamerica.com/california-amish-community/|title=A California Amish Community|website=amishamerica.com|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state also has over 2000 [[Circassians|Circassian Americans]] with a little community in [[Anaheim]].

[[Hispanics and Latinos in California|Latino]]s, mainly [[Mexican American]]s, form major portions of the population of Southern California, especially in [[Los Angeles]], as well as the San Joaquin Valley. The city of Los Angeles is often said to be the largest Mexican community in the United States. Census records kept track of the growth since 1850, but Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have lived in California since Spanish Colonial times. However, the number and percentage population of Latinos living in California increased rapidly in the late 20th century. The result is that, today, Latinos are the largest ethnic group in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], at over 40 percent of the county's population. Latinos are predominantly concentrated in the older eastern and southern suburbs surrounding downtown Los Angeles and northern Long Beach, the southern/eastern [[San Fernando Valley]], and the [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]]/[[Pomona Valley]]s. They also comprise sizable communities in [[Arvin, California|Arvin]], Bakersfield, [[Delano, California|Delano]], [[El Monte, California|El Monte]], [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], Fresno, [[Indio, California|Indio]], [[La Puente, California|La Puente]], [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]], Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San José, Santa Barbara, [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] and [[Yuba City, California|Yuba City]]. In [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] in Orange County, Latinos comprise 75 percent of the population. Nearby [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] is over half Latino, and Orange County's population is 30-35 percent Latino.

The [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] on the U.S.-Mexican border is about 70–75% Latino; communities with many Latinos can also be found in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], especially at its eastern end, and the [[Coachella Valley]]. The [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] has many Mexican American migrant farm workers. Latinos are the majority in 14 counties: [[Colusa County, California|Colusa]], [[Fresno County, California|Fresno]], [[Glenn County, California|Glenn]], [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]], [[Kern County, California|Kern]], [[Kings County, California|Kings]], [[Madera County, California|Madera]], [[Merced County, California|Merced]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]] and [[Yolo County, California|Yolo]] counties.

Latinos make up at least 20% of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Many live in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]], [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]] and [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]] counties, as well in [[San Francisco]]. The [[Napa Valley]] and [[Salinas Valley]] have predominantly Latino communities established by migrant farm workers. San Jose is about 30-35 percent Latino, the largest Latino community in northern California, while the [[Mission District, San Francisco]] and Lower/[[West Oakland]] has [[barrio]]s established by Mexican and Latin American immigrants. The Mexican American communities of [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] and [[Logan Heights, San Diego]], as well the [[San Joaquin Valley]] are centers of historic [[Chicano]] and Latino cultures.

California also has the largest populations of Hispanics/Latinos in the country. Most of the state's Latinos have [[Mexican people|Mexican]] ancestry, having the largest Mexican population in the United States, making up about 31 percent of the state population. California has a large and diverse population, having the largest [[Central America]]n, especially [[Salvadoran American|Salvadorans]] population in the United States. [[Guatemalan American]]s are spread out in Southern California after previously centered in Los Angeles between 1970 and 2010. California also has many [[Cuban Americans]], [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], [[Honduran American]]s, and [[Nicaraguan American]]s, along with people of [[Brazilian American|Brazilian]], [[Chilean American|Chilean]], [[Colombian American|Colombian]], [[Peruvian American|Peruvian]] and other [[South America]]n ancestry. Los Angeles has had the United States' largest [[Central America]]n community, as well as the largest Mexican American community, since the 1910s. In fact, the 1900 census record finds 319 to 619 out of 100,000 residents in the city of Los Angeles were "Spanish" or "Mexican". (see [[Demographics of Los Angeles]]). Nearly 31 percent of Los Angeles itself is of Mexican descent, having the largest Mexican population of any city in the United States.

In [[Mariposa County, California|Mariposa County]], there is a very small community of Californios or Spanish American people as they identify themselves, that dates back before the U.S. annexation of California. [[Hornitos, California|Hornitos]] is home to an estimated 1,000 people and many are "[[Californios]]". The community's "Spanish" Californio culture is closely linked with Mexico and other Latin American nations. Spanish colonial/Mexican/Latino influences was always a major part of California after it became part of the U.S. since 1848 and its statehood in 1850. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The state has a long history of established [[Asian American]] communities, including Chinese since the 1850s, Japanese since the 1880s, and Filipinos for over a century. A large wave of Asian immigration since 1965 brought in more Chinese along with Koreans and [[Southeast Asians]] after the Vietnam war ended in the late 1970s. South Asians are also a fast-growing group.

Chinese Americans are numerous in [[San Francisco]], Oakland, the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], [[South Bay (San Jose, California)|South Bay]], the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Diego]], and the [[San Gabriel Valley]] region of Los Angeles County. The San Francisco Bay Area has a greater concentration of Cantonese-speaking Chinese than any other region in the United States. The Mexican border community of [[Calexico, California]] in addition to [[Mexicali, Baja California|Mexicali]] has large numbers of Chinese Mexican Americans, that is, Mexican Americans of Chinese ancestry. Smaller Chinese communities can also be found in [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto Valley]], [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]], and [[Victorville, California|Victorville]].

Southern California has perhaps the largest Taiwan-born Chinese American community in the U.S., particularly in the San Gabriel Valley (i.e. [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] and [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]]), [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]], [[West Covina, California|West Covina]], [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], communities in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles]] and southern Orange County. Many minority groups from China also live in California, for example, there are [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Mongols|Mongolian]] and [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] Americans concentrated in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Orange County, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach area.

Large Korean American communities exist in the [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]] area of Los Angeles, the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley]], the [[San Fernando Valley]], Cerritos/Long Beach, [[South Bay, Los Angeles]], northern Orange County and [[San Diego]] area. There is another large Korean American population in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Koreans are growing in number in the suburban [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]] region, in cities such as [[Chino Hills, California|Chino Hills]], [[Corona, California|Corona]], [[Desert Hot Springs, California|Desert Hot Springs]] and [[Loma Linda, California|Loma Linda]] south of [[San Bernardino]]. Since 1990, the Korean American and African American populations relocated westward and northward in the Los Angeles area.

The [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] area and [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]] have a large Japanese American community. Japanese Americans, however, are also concentrated in [[San Francisco]] and across the Bay Area, [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the [[Salinas Valley]] and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]]; and smaller communities in the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Diego]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] areas. Despite the presence of Japanese goods stores, media outlets and restaurants in the state, most "Little Tokyos" and "Japantowns" were evacuated during the forced relocation of Japanese Americans during [[World War II]] (see [[Japanese American Internment]]). As a result, most Japanese Americans in urban areas do not reside in historical Japanese communities.

California has the largest American population of Southeast Asians, concentrated in the Los Angeles-Long Beach, Sacramento, and Fresno areas. This includes the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and Vietnamese, including [[Hoa people|Chinese Vietnamese]]. [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] has one of the largest Cambodian American communities in the United States. The neighboring cities of [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] and [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] have the largest Vietnamese American community outside of Vietnam and are often dubbed "[[Little Saigon]]". Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants also settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially San Jose, [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], as well across the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and in [[San Diego]].

Over 6,000 Laotian Americans live in the [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] area, including an even larger Hmong American community, the second-largest of its kind. Other Hmong colonies in the [[Central Valley of California]] and [[Northern California]] developed since the end of the Vietnam war (1975–79).
California also has a Thai American community of over 250,000, concentrated in Southern California, with small Thai and Southeast Asian communities in [[Perris, California|Perris]] and [[Banning, California|Banning]] in the Inland Empire region. Los Angeles has the largest Thai population outside of Thailand and is also home to the world's first [[Thai Town, Los Angeles|Thai Town]]. About 150,000 [[Overseas Indonesian|Indonesians]] live in Southern California, primarily the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.

California has the largest Indian American population in the U.S. Many live in the [[Los Angeles Metropolitan Area]], [[San Diego]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The Los Angeles suburbs of [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] and [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]] have large Indian American communities. [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], and other [[Silicon Valley]] cities have many Indian Americans who are employed in the high-tech industry. Many Indian Americans are in [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] cities such as Stockton, Bakersfield, Fresno, [[Yuba City, California|Yuba City]], and the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]]. Most South Asians in California are Indian American, but there are also Pakistani Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, and Sri Lankan Americans (see [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s) esp. concentrated in the San Gabriel Valley ([[Covina, California|Covina Valley]]) of the Los Angeles area.

Over 50,000 [[Afghan American]]s are concentrated in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] primarily in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] and its communities of [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] and [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]; Afghans also live throughout the state (esp. Orange County and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]).

The state has 150,000 residents with [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]] ancestry. Most, 80,000, are [[Native Hawaiian]]s of measurable Polynesian ancestry; many also have Asian, European, or other ancestries. There are also 25,000 [[Samoan American]]s originally from [[American Samoa]] or [[Western Samoa]].  Most live in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the Los Angeles suburbs of [[Carson, California|Carson]], Artesia, Cerritos, and [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], and [[Upland, California|Upland]]. About 10,000 [[Chamorros]] from [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]] live in northern California, the largest Micronesian community in the mainland United States. An estimated 10,000 [[Tahiti]]ans from [[French Polynesia]] live in southern California.

{{citations needed|date=March 2018}}
There are also many [[Palauan American|Palau]]ans in southern California, specifically in the San Diego area, including [[Vista, California|Vista]]. Only 677 in Vista alone in the 2010 US Census. Members of the [[Palauan]] community often also have [[Malaysia|Malay]], [[Indonesia]]n, [[Micronesia]]n, [[Melanesian]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and other east Asian ancestries.  Many Chuukese or [[Chuuk State|Trukese]] live in San Diego, while the original settlers on [[Chuuk State|Truk Island]] are [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Germans|German]] but most Truukese now are Japanese and Korean, then Filipino and some Chinese, and finally the arrival of American expatriates. Many came to the [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] area due to the military installations around the city, which has the oldest [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] or Pacific Islander community. 

The state also has over 715,000 [[Arab American]]s, with large communities in Alameda, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Stanislaus County|Stanislaus]] counties. They represent all Arab and Middle Eastern nationalities, the most numerous being of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[West Bank]] (see [[Palestinian American]]s) followed by those from [[Syria]] (see [[Syrian American]]s) and [[Lebanon]] (about half- 1.5 out of 3.1 million estimated- (see [[Lebanese American]]s) live in California), [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Tunisia]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]]. Arabs have resided in California since the 1920s, most notably in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in the section of [[Little Arabia (Anaheim, California)]] and the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] area.

About 500,000 [[Iranian American]]s live throughout [[Southern California]], including about 20% of the population of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name="Living in Tehrangeles"&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5459468 | title=Living in Tehrangeles: L.A.'s Iranian Community | first=Renee | last=Montagne|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | date=2006-06-08|accessdate=2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian American communities also flourish in the [[San Fernando Valley]], Orange County, San Diego, the Palm Springs area, and the San Joaquin Valley. The majority of [[Iranian American]]s immigrated after the ouster of the pro-U.S. Shah regime of Iran in the late 1970s.

California also has the third largest [[Greek American]] population in the United States, behind [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Massachusetts]].

There is also large population of [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people|Assyrian/Chaldean]] descent living in the Central Valley, with large communities in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], [[Ceres, California|Ceres]] and [[Turlock, California|Turlock]], as well as throughout the Central Coast and the California Desert (i.e. the [[Coachella Valley|Coachella]] and [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] valleys). San Diego has one of the largest concentrations of [[Chaldean people|Chaldean]] immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaldeanchamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=35|title=Chaldean Chamber of Commerce|website=chaldeanchamber.com|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California is also home to 600,000 [[Armenian Americans]], with many in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] north of Los Angeles, as well as a large community in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. As of 1988 California had about 500,000 ethnic Armenians with over half of them living in [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF5191E679C4A7D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM ARMENIAN PONTIFF BEGINS VISIT TO SOUTHLAND WITH ENCINO STOP]."

[[Turkish Americans]] and [[Azerbaijani Americans]] form moderately-sized communities in both [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]].

California has 2.3 million African Americans as of 2010, the largest population of Black or African Americans in the western U.S,&lt;ref name="censusviewer"/&gt; and the 5th largest Black population in the United States. Cities that have the largest share of African Americans and have historically been Black cultural centers include (11 largest in the state): [[Compton, California|Compton]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]].

African Americans are approximately 7 percent of the state population. The state percentage of African Americans has dropped in the 1990s and 2000s, though the state's overall ''number'' of African-Americans has increased in that time period. The black population in East and West Oakland and South Central Los Angeles - places where they held the majority for decades - has greatly decreased as the black middle class has relocated to nearby suburbs, including those in the [[Inland Empire]] and [[Antelope Valley]] in Southern California and the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]] in Northern California. Many African Americans have also moved to the [[Southeastern United States|South]], where their grandparents may have come from in the "[[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]" of the mid-20th century.

African Americans have made a contribution to the state's hip-hop and R&amp;B music culture. African-American musical artists born and/or raised in California include: [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Ice Cube]], [[E-40]], [[Nate Dogg]], [[En Vogue]], [[Tony! Toni! Tone!]], [[Too Short]], [[Eazy-E]], [[N.W.A]], [[Keyshia Cole]], [[Digital Underground]], [[JJ Fad]], [[Barry White]], [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Kendrick Lamar]]. 

Also noted is California has small [[West Indian]] ([[Afro-Caribbean American]]) and African immigration from countries such as [[Cape Verde]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] (i.e. [[Little Ethiopia]] in [[West Los Angeles]]), [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Somalia]], [[South Africa]] (including [[White South Africans]]), [[Tanzania]] and [[Yemen]] across from the Horn of Africa. They established communities in [[Los Angeles]] known for a large Ethiopian community and [[Oakland]]/[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] (East Bay) as well [[Nuer people|Nuer]] refugees from [[South Sudan]] migrated to the [[Sacramento]] area; and the [[Cape Verde]]an community in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] and the [[Santa Clara Valley]], and the [[San Diego]] area.

As of 2010, California's Native American population of 362,801 was the most of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/12/california-has-nations-largest-native-american-population.html |author= Capitol Alert |publisher=Sacramento Bee |title=Capitol Alert: California has nation's largest Native American population | date= Dec 23, 2013| accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the [[List of federally recognized tribes by state#California|most Native American tribes]], indigenous to the state or not, but the majority of known [[Native Americans in the United States|Californian Indian]] tribes became extinct in the late 19th century. The U.S. Census includes ''Latin American Indian'', especially immigrants who belonged to indigenous peoples or who have Amerindian heritage from North and South America.

The [[Cherokee Nation]] is the largest tribe in the state with a population of 110,000, although the number of Cherokee descendants may surpass 600,000 according to demographers. They are often descendants of [[Dust Bowl]] refugees in the 1930s and 1940s who migrated to the state's farming counties and urban areas for jobs. The largest urban American Indian communities are Los Angeles/Long Beach, San Francisco/Oakland, Sacramento, and San Diego areas. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

California also has significant populations of the [[Apache]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], [[Shoshone]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]], [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblos]], [[Cahuilla people|Cahuilla]] and [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] tribes. The Cahuilla in the Coachella Valley have profited from real estate land leases, and much of [[Indio, California|Indio]] and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] are tribal-owned lands under legal tribal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.desertsun.com/article/20131012/NEWS01/310120044/New-tribal-land-tax-law-causing-alarm-Palm-Springs |last=Newkirk |first=Barrett |title=New tribal land tax law causing alarm in Palm Springs |publisher=The Desert Sun |date=October 13, 2013 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California drivers can take the written license exam in 31 languages, from Amharic, which is spoken in Ethiopia, to Thai. You can view the state's online Megan's Law database of registered sex offenders in Portuguese or Punjabi. [..] Proposition 63, which received 73 percent of the vote in 1986, was largely symbolic, sending a message to immigrants that they should learn to speak English if they expected to live in California. The measure directed the state to "preserve, protect and strengthen the English language," but did not call for any specific action or enforcement.

Most [[Roman Catholics]] in California are of [[Hispanic American|Mexican]], other [[Hispanic]], [[Spanish American|Spanish]], [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Filipino American|Filipino]] ancestry. The population of Catholic Californians is rapidly growing due to the influx of [[Latin American]] and Filipino immigrants. In the state, Roman Catholicism is highly represented among non-Hispanic European-Americans, but less represented among non-Hispanic African-Americans. Protestantism is the majority Christian denomination in non-Hispanic black and white groups.

The largest Christian denominations in California in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 10,079,310; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 529,575; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 471,119.

California also has the largest Muslim community in the United States, an estimated one percent of the population, mostly residing in Southern California. Approximately 100,000 Muslims reside in San Diego.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

California has more members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Temples]] than any state except [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="Largest LDS Communities"&gt;{{cite web |title = Largest Latter-day Saint Communities |publisher = Adherents.com |date = April 12, 2005 |url = http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_lds.html |accessdate = December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) have played important roles in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in California|settlement of California throughout the state's history]]. For example, a group of a few hundred [[Mormon]] converts from the Northeastern [[United States]] and [[Europe]] arrived at what would become [[San Francisco]] in the 1840s aboard the ship ''Brooklyn'', more than doubling the population of the small town. A group of Mormons also established the city of [[San Bernardino]] in Southern California in 1851.&lt;ref name="CalLDS"/&gt; According to the LDS Church 2014 statistics, 780,200 Mormons reside in the state of California, attending almost 1400 congregations statewide.&lt;ref name="CalLDS"/&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] is headquartered in [[Loma Linda, California|Loma Linda]] in San Bernardino county 60 miles east of Los Angeles, where the church members form the majority of the town's population. The SDA church there has a university, a free hospital and a TV station ([[3ABN]] or the 3 Angels Broadcasting Network). Seventh-day Adventists are vegetarians, so you would notice there are no fast food restaurants within the town limits. The town is known for a large number of [[centenarians]] who live over 100 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-blue-zone-loma-linda-20150711-story.html|title=Why Loma Linda residents live longer than the rest of us: They treat the body like a temple|first=Mary|last=MacVean|date=July 11, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew Research Center survey revealed, however, that California is less religious than the rest of the United States: 62% of Californians say they are "absolutely certain" of the belief "in God or a universal spirit", while in the nation 71% say so. The survey also revealed that 48% of Californians say religion is "very important", while the figure for the U.S. in general is 56%.&lt;ref name="Pew Religion and Politics"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Religion and Politics 2011: California |work = U.S. Religious Landscape Study | publisher = The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |year = 2011 |url = http://religions.pewforum.org/maps |accessdate = January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state's [[Irreligion|non-religious]], which consists of [[Atheism in the United States|atheists]], [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], and [[theism|non-affiliated theists]], is one of the fastest-growing groups in the state.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Income and socioeconomic factors ==
California's income distribution is quite broad compared to the country's as a whole; its proportions of residents with no income and of residents with income over $100,000 are both higher than the national average. This broad distribution combined with high housing and living costs give California an abnormally high poverty rate. The [[Census Bureau]]’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, calculated by comparing household income to a locally-adjusted poverty threshold, reports that 20.7% of California's population has income insufficient for their basic needs, as compared to 12.9% for the U.S. as a whole.&lt;ref name=USCB-CPS /&gt; This calculation of income includes the [[Social_programs_in_the_United_States|benefits]] of [[Welfare in California|California welfare programs]] such as [[CalFresh|food stamps]] and earned income tax credits — without these, the state's poverty rate would be 28%.&lt;ref name=PPIC-poverty-in&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Sarah Bohn| last2 = Caroline Danielson| last3 = Tess Thorman| title = Poverty in California| work = Public Policy Institute of California| accessdate = 2018-04-27| date = 2017| url = http://www.ppic.org/publication/poverty-in-california/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Distribution_of_US_and_CA_households_by_income_relative_to_CE_poverty_lines.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A comparison of the distributions of California (left) and U.S. (right) households by their income relative to their estimated cost of living, showing the higher rates of poverty and near-poverty in California. Uses 2017 CPS data&lt;ref name=USCB-CPS /&gt; about incomes in 2016. Comparison is of NAS Family Income minus Medical Out-of-Pocket to CE-Based Poverty Threshold with CPI-U and Geographical Price Adjustments, as per [https://www.census.gov/cps/data/povthresholds.html].]]

The trends of low income in California are complex; from 1975 to 2014, real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have alternated between rises and sharp declines. These incomes have decreased overall for those outside the top 20th percentile, with the bottom 20th percentile seeing an average decline of 1% per year during that period.&lt;ref name=LAO-data-on-real /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAO-californias-changing /&gt; Correspondingly, the percent of Californians with income below their poverty threshold has risen and fallen, but has on average increased by a tenth of a percentage point per year.&lt;ref name=IPUMS /&gt;

Increasing income inequality has had many effects on Californians' lives, including on life expectancy, which can be taken as a proxy for health or even general welfare. A study conducted by Clarke et al.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt; related life expectancy to socioeconomic status (SES, an index including income and other related factors), finding that Californians in the top 20% by SES live on average six years longer than those in the bottom 20% (81 years, compared to 75). This disparity becomes even more pronounced when [[intersectionality|intersected]] with race: White males in the top 20% live 14 years longer than African American males in the bottom 20% (for females, the difference is 10 years).&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

The complexity of the state's low-income trends were visible when, in response to growing Chinese and Spanish-speaking populations, the city of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] implemented the nation's first policy of recruiting bilingual applicants for public-facing city jobs in 2001. This increased the employment of Hispanic and Chinese bilinguals throughout the public workforce, but also lowered (monolingual) Black employment.&lt;ref name=sewell /&gt;

'''Earl H. Pritchard''' (June 5, 1907 &amp;ndash; May 9, 1995) was a scholar of [[China]] and one of the founders of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] and served as its president. 

Pritchard was born on June 5, 1907, in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where he spent his childhood on the farm of his father, Thomas Pritchard. He attended [[Washington State College]] and graduated with his B.A. in 1928. He then attended the [[University of Illinois]] at [[Urbana-Champaign]] where completed his M.A. in 1929. Returning to Pullman in 1930, he applied for a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and became the second student from Washington State College to win the scholarship. He spent three years at the [[University of Oxford]] and was awarded his PhD in history in 1933.

After completing his doctoral dissertation, Pritchard taught at [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] from 1934 until transferring to Washington State in 1935, where he stayed until 1937. He studied [[Chinese language|Chinese]] at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Michigan]] between 1937 and 1939, but he later regretted that his Chinese did not reach the level of proficiency he felt any serious student of China should be. 

Pritchard taught at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]] between 1939 and 1947. This stint was interrupted from 1942 to 1945 when he was a civilian analyst with [[military intelligence]] during the [[Second World War]]. He was in charge of a 15-20 person group that studied Japanese transportation networks in China and Japan. He was the first recipient of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]'s highest award for intelligence service, the [[Distinguished Civilian Service Medal]]. After the end of the war, he was an Associate Professor of [[history]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 until 1962. He was disappointed when the [[Fulbright Fellowship]] that he earned in 1948 to go to China was canceled because of the Communist revolution led by [[Mao Zedong]] that was sweeping away the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|nationalist]] forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the time. Pritchard never had an opportunity to visit the country he researched and taught about for most of his life, although he did travel to [[Japan]] in 1957. He moved to [[Tucson]] in [[Arizona]] to assume the chair of the Oriental Studies Department at the [[University of Arizona]]. He significantly built up the program until his retirement in 1972. He taught for several more years as Professor Emeritus.

Pritchard was the founder and editor of the ''[[Bulletin of Far Eastern Bibliography]]'', which became the [[Far Eastern Quarterly]] before assuming its present form as the [[Journal of Asian Studies]]. He was one of the founders of the Far Eastern Association, which later became the [[Association for Asian Studies]]. Se served as the president from 1962 to 1963, vice president from 1961 to 1962, was a director in 1948–51, 1952–55, and 1961–64.

He cited the major achievements of his career as the foundation of what was to become the Association for Asian Studies and the Journal of Asian Studies, and secondly the growth of the oriental studies at the University of Arizona. He cited as his third most important achievement the publication of ''Anglo-Chinese Relations During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries’’ (a compacted version of his M.A. thesis), ''The Crucial Years of Early Anglo-Chinese Relations 1750-
1800'' (based in part on his doctoral thesis, 1936), sections written for ''The American Historical Association's Guide to Historical Literature'' (1961), the coauthoring of Volume 4 of the [[UNESCO]] ''History of Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Development''. 

He died on May 9, 1995, in Tucson at the age of 87.

'''''Eegah''''' (also known as '''''Eegah: The Name Written in Blood''''') is a 1962 American [[horror film]] directed and produced by [[Arch Hall, Sr.]] (credited as Nicholas Merriwether), written by Bob Wehling based on a story by Hall Sr., and starring Hall Sr., [[Arch Hall, Jr.|Hall Jr.]], Marilyn Manning and [[Richard Kiel]] in the title role.

The film's notoriety was enhanced as a result of being featured on episodes of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and ''[[Elvira's Movie Macabre]]'', and was said by many{{who|date=January 2018}} to be an [[List of films considered the worst|all-time worst film]].

==Plot==
One night after shopping, Roxy Miller (Marilyn Manning) is driving to a party through the California desert when she nearly runs her car into Eegah (Richard Kiel), a giant caveman. She tells her boyfriend Tom Nelson (Arch Hall, Jr.) and her father Robert Miller (Arch Hall, Sr.) about the giant. Her father, a writer of adventure books, decides to go into the desert to look for the creature and possibly take a photograph of it. When his helicopter ride fails to show up at his designated pickup time, Tom and Roxy go looking for him.

Roxy is soon kidnapped by Eegah and taken back to his cave while Tom searches for her. In Eegah's cave, Roxy is reunited with her father, who tells her that he has begun to communicate with the caveman and has developed a theory as to the creature's astounding longevity. When a frisky Eegah expresses what seems to be romantic interest in Roxy, her father, fearful that the creature may kill them both if he is rebuffed, suggests she put up with as much of it as she can bear. Eegah never tries anything too explicit, though, and Roxy even ends up giving him a shave before Tom arrives and helps the Millers escape. Crushed, Eegah follows them back to civilization, a final confrontation ensues, and Eegah is killed.

== Production ==
Following the financial success of his first venture into the drive-in/juvenile delinquency genre, ''The Choppers'', Arch Hall, Sr. was able to fund ''Eegah'', a starring vehicle for his son, Arch Hall, Jr., who had some success with songwriter [[Alan O'Day]] on the rock and roll/surf rock scene in Los Angeles. Hall, Sr. co-wrote the film with Bob Wehling, directed the picture under the pseudonym Nicholas Merriweather, and co-starred opposite his son under the name William Watters. While the library music used to underscore the picture was supplied by André Brummer (under the name Henri Price), an uncredited O'Day ended up being the music editor on ''Eegah''.

Hall, Sr. looked to create an [[Elvis Presley]]-style screen persona for his son, and made sure that ''Eegah'' was peppered with various rock and roll songs (including two songs he wrote called "Vicky" and "Valerie"). The film attempts elements of traditional schlock-horror and youth-comedy genres, and contains echoes of the 1960s "[[Beach party film|beach party]]" genre. One of the members of the [[rock and roll]] band shown in the film was Deke Lussier, who, as [[Deke Richards]], later became a highly respected songwriter and [[record producer]] at [[Motown Records]].&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kGLtcc_pJxQC&amp;pg=PT186&amp;dq=%22deke+richards%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22deke%20richards%22&amp;f=false |title=Earth vs. the sci-fi film makers |first=Tom |last=Weaver |page=176 |publisher=McFarland |year=2005 |isbn=0-7864-2210-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall Sr.'s company, "Fairway-International Pictures", located in Burbank, California, was also Hall's place of residence and doubled for a number of locations in the picture, including the Millers' apartment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Assistant cameraman [[Ray Dennis Steckler]] appears in the picture as Mr. Fischer, the man at the hotel who is thrown at the pool near the end of the picture. Steckler, who had previously moved to Hollywood to become a cameraman, made his directing debut the next year in the Arch Hall, Jr. vehicle ''[[Wild Guitar]]''. Steckler's first independent feature, ''[[The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies|The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!?]]'', was later distributed by Fairway-International.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1993, ''Eegah!'' was featured on [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] cult television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and became a fan favorite. In the published episode guide to the series, ''The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide'' ({{ISBN|0-553-37783-3}}), the cast considers the shaving scene from ''Eegah'', in which Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream, to be one of the most disgusting things they have witnessed during their time on the show. The writers also speculate that some kind of romantic relationship existed between Arch Hall, Sr. and his on-screen daughter Marilyn Manning, due to the uncomfortably non-familial chemistry in their scenes together. One of the film's more inept moments became a running joke on the show: Hall, Sr.'s line "Watch out for snakes!" is blurted out despite a lack of any visual source for the dialog. The line became a running gag, both on other episodes of the show and was referenced in ''[[The Office]]'' and as the closing line of [[Rick Emerson#The Rick Emerson Show|''The Rick Emerson Show'']].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Eegah!'' also appeared on an episode of ''Movie Macabre'', featuring [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira, Mistress of the Dark]].

A heavily edited version accompanied by lampooning thought bubbles and comedic sound effects was included on Channel 4s [[Exploitica]].

In 2009, ''Eegah!'' was shown on [[horror host]]ed television series ''[[Cinema Insomnia]]''.&lt;ref name="Cinema Insomnia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemainsomnia.com/show.php#episode |title=Cinema Insomnia |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Cinema Insomnia |accessdate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328140102/http://www.cinemainsomnia.com/show.php#episode |archivedate=March 28, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remake of ''Eegah!'' is the second half of Impact Theatre's production of Splathouse Double Feature: ''The Sadist'' with ''Eegah!'', a stage and film hybrid that features newly shot footage for each production. The production on the remake began in January 2014 as the second project of the newly formed theatre troupe, p.d. and the bug. Michael Garrett McDonald stars as Tom with Sarah Coykendall playing Roxy. Mike Delaney portrays Roxy's father, Robert, and Eegah! is played by Joseph Mason. The newly filmed footage for Eegah! was shot and directed by Edwin Fernando Gonzalez. The first professional production of Splathouse Double Feature: The Sadist with Eegah! opened July 3, 2014 at Impact Theatre in Berkeley, CA.

In 2017, the rebooted ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' launched a live tour ("The 'Watch Out for Snakes' Tour"), performing new material with "Eegah" in several US cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1253">In [[law]], the '''family purpose doctrine''' is a rule that holds the owner of an [[automobile]] [[liable]] for [[damages]] to others while a member of the family is driving the vehicle, regardless of whether or not the owner gave permission.  The underlying theory is that the vehicle is owned for family purposes.

In the US, this is primarily a state-level rule with considerable variation in its application.  For example, in Arizona, the family purpose doctrine is applied very broadly and holds parents liable even for the [[negligence]] of a child driving a motor vehicle in defiance of driving restrictions placed upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Young v. Beck, Case No. 1 CA-CV 09-0188&lt;/ref&gt;  In Georgia, the 'family purpose' liability extends to third parties allowed by the teenage driver to operate the car.  Georgia also extends the rule to adult children in some cases and explicitly extends the rule to family boats.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart v. Stephens, 225 Ga. 185, 166 S.E. 2d 890 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colorado, on the other hand, the same term is used to describe [[joint and several liability]] for household bills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.douglasturner.com/2007/10/09/the-family-purpose-doctrine/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

Interpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote [[environmental stewardship]] of the lands they manage.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T. (2011) ''The Gifts of Interpretation: Fifteen guiding principles for interpreting nature and culture''.

The '''Institute for the Study of the Ancient World''' (ISAW) is a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education at [[New York University]].  ISAW's mission is to cultivate comparative, connective investigations of the [[ancient history|ancient world]] from the [[Ancient Near East|western Mediterranean]] to [[Ancient China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/about |title=About ISAW |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date= |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of specialty among ISAW's faculty include the [[Greco-Roman world]], the [[Ancient Near East]], [[Egypt]], Central Asia and the [[Silk Road]], [[East Asian art]] and archaeology, [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], [[ancient science]], and [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty/isaw-faculty |title=ISAW Faculty |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date= |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAW was founded in 2006 with funding from the [[Leon Levy Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFD71F31F932A15750C0A9609C8B63 |title=N.Y.U. and Columbia to Receive $200 Million Gifts for Research - NYTimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; established to continue the philanthropic legacy of [[Leon Levy]], co-founder of the Oppenheimer mutual funds. Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with his wife Shelby White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations. After Levy’s death in 2003, one of the earliest initiatives of the Leon Levy Foundation, was the fulfillment of that plan.  ISAW is a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, with its own endowment and its own board of trustees, and is housed in separate facilities in a historic six-story limestone on [[84th Street (Manhattan)|East 84th Street]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DaFTWRsVQhuFo%26refer%3Dculture-redirectoldpage |title=New York University Gets $200 Mln for Ancient Studies (Update3) |author=Patrick Cole |newspaper=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2018-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131152/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aFTWRsVQhuFo&amp;refer=culture-redirectoldpage |date=2006-03-21 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance, faculty, and staff==

The Director of ISAW is [[Alexander Jones (classicist)]]. He succeeded the founding director [[Roger Bagnall]] in September, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/1939/nyu-hires-renowned-classicist-from-columbia-u-to-lead-new-institute |title=NYU Hires Renowned Classicist From Columbia U. to Lead New Institute |website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/news/alexander-jones-appointed-director-of-isaw |title=Alexander Jones Appointed Director of ISAW |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date=2017-08-15 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 1, 2018, the following individuals served as ISAW faculty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAW Faculty|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty/isaw-faculty|website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tom Elliott (Associate Director for Digital Programs and Senior Research Scholar)
* Clare Fitzgerald (Associate Director for Exhibitions and Gallery Curator)
* Marc LeBlanc (Assistant Director for Academic Affairs)
* David M. Ratzan (Head, ISAW Library)

ISAW's website describes its governance structure as follows:

Appointments and academic programs of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World are under the jurisdiction of its faculty, which achieved independent status in fall, 2010, and which is led by the Director. The Director reports to the Provost and President of New York University. In addition, the Institute has its own [http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/directors-council Director's Council]. Its chair is the Institute's Founder, Shelby White. The Council plays a crucial role in ensuring that ISAW fulfills its mission and has the means necessary to do so. It provides essential advice to the Director on strategic directions and public programming, and its members are vital ambassadors for ISAW in enlarging the public reached by its work. 

==Academic programs==
ISAW's graduate program offers a PhD in the Study of the Ancient World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/graduate-studies |title=Doctoral Program in the Ancient World — Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |website=Isaw.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAW offers hosts visiting research scholars conducting postdoctoral research. There are three types of appointment for visiting scholars:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/visiting-scholars |title=Visiting Research Scholar Program — Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |website=Isaw.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Visiting assistant professors, appointed for two years, during which they are expected to teach two undergraduate courses and one graduate seminar.
* Visiting research scholars, appointed for one year of research, funded in part or in whole by ISAW. These scholars may be at any point in their career from postdoctoral to retired.
* Externally funded scholars, who have the same responsibilities and privileges as the categories above, but do not receive financial support from ISAW.

Scholars in all three categories are expected to be in residence at ISAW for the duration of their appointment and to participate in the intellectual life of the community, including presenting a public lecture.

{{forms of government}}

An '''interregnum''' (plural '''interregna''' or '''interregnums''') is a period of discontinuity or "gap" in a government, organization, or social order. Archetypally, it was the period of time between the reign of one monarch and the next (coming from Latin ''inter-'', "between" and ''rēgnum'', "reign" [from ''rex, rēgis'', "king"]), and the concepts of interregnum and [[Regent|regency]] therefore overlap. Historically, the longer and heavier interregna were typically accompanied by widespread unrest, [[Civil war|civil]] and [[War of succession|succession wars]] between [[warlord]]s, and [[power vacuum]]s filled by foreign invasions or the emergence of a new power. A [[failed state]] is usually in interregnum.

The term also refers to the periods between the election of a new parliament and the establishment of a new government from that parliament in parliamentary democracies, usually ones that employ some form of proportional representation that allows small parties to elect significant numbers, requiring time for negotiations to form a government. In the UK, Canada and other "[[first past the post]]" electoral systems, this period is usually very brief, except in the rare occurrence of a [[hung parliament]] as occurred both [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|in the UK]] in 2017 and [[Australian federal election, 2010|in Australia]] in 2010. In parliamentary interregnums, the previous government usually stands as a [[caretaker government]] until the new government is established.

Similarly, in some [[Christianity#Denominations|Christian denominations]], “interregnum” (interim) describes the time between vacancy and appointment of [[Priest#Christianity|priest]] or [[pastor]]s to various roles. Additionally, the term has been applied to the period of time between the election of a new [[President of the United States]] and his or her inauguration, during which the outgoing president remains in power, but as a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000477723 On the Way Out: Interregnum Presidential Activity]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical periods of interregnum==
Particular historical periods known as interregna include:
* The period of 206–202 BC in China, after the death of the final [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] emperor, when there was a contest to the throne. It ended with the accession of [[Liu Bang]], ushering in the [[Han dynasty]].
* The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (235–284) in the [[Roman Empire]], when it was split into multiple realms and chaos (invasion, civil war, [[Plague of Cyprian|Cyprian Plague]], and [[economic depression]]) was a constant threat until [[Aurelian]] and [[Diocletian]] restored the empire.
* The ten-year period from 574/575 to 584/585 in the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], known as the [[Rule of the Dukes]].
* The [[Sasanian civil war of 628-632|Sasanian Interregnum]] (628–632), a conflict that broke out after the death of [[Khosrau II]] between the Sasanian nobles of different factions.
* The 1022–1072 period in Ireland, between the death of [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] and the accession of [[Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain]], is sometimes regarded as an interregnum, as the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship]] of Ireland was disputed throughout these decades. The interregnum may even have extended to 1121, when [[Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair]] acceded to the title.
* From 1097 to 1102 in the [[Croatia]], between death of king [[Petar Svačić]] and when [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]], [[king of Hungary]] is crowned [[king of Croatia]] in 1102.
* From 13 April 1204 to 25 July 1261 in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Following the [[Sack of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantine Empire was dissolved, to be replaced by [[Frankokratia|several Crusader states]] and [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|several Byzantine states]].  It was re-established by Nicean general [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] who placed [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] back on the throne of a united Byzantine Empire.
* From 21 May 1254 to 29 September 1273, The [[Interregnum (HRE)|Great Interregnum]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the deposition of the last [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] by [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the death of his son King [[Conrad IV of Germany]] until the [[Imperial election of 1273|election]] of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] scion [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph]] as ''[[King of the Romans|Rex Romanorum]]''.
* [[List of Scottish monarchs#First Interregnum (1290–1292)|First Interregnum]] in Scotland, which lasted from either 19 March 1286 or 26 September 1290 until 17 November 1292.  The exact dating of the interregnum depends on whether the uncrowned [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] was officially queen before her death in 1290.  It lasted until [[John Balliol]] was crowned King of Scots.
* [[List of Scottish monarchs#Second Interregnum (1296–1306)|Second Interregnum]] in Scotland, from 10 July 1296, when John Balliol was deposed, until 25 March 1306, when [[Robert the Bruce]] was crowned.
* From 14 January 1301 until 1308 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the extinction of the [[Árpád dynasty]] and when [[Charles I of Hungary]] secured the throne for himself against several pretenders.
* From 5 June 1316 to 15 November 1316 in [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], between the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] and the birth of his posthumous son [[John I of France|John I]].
* From 2 August 1332 until 21 June 1340 in [[Denmark]] when the country was mortgaged to a few German counts.
* The [[1383–1385 Crisis|Portuguese Interregnum]], from 22 October 1383 until 6 April 1385, a result of the succession crisis caused by the death of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] without a legitimate heir.
* The [[Ottoman Interregnum]], from 8 March 1403 until 1413, a result of the death of Sultan [[Bayezid I]] at the hands of Central Asian warlord [[Timur]]. A period of civil war ensued as none of Bayezid's sons could establish primacy. The crisis was resolved when one of his sons, [[Mehmed I|Mehmed]], defeated and killed his brothers and reestablished the Empire.
* From 20 January 1410 to 1412 in the [[Crown of Aragon|Kingdom of Aragon]]. The death of King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin]] without heir led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war, resolved ultimately by the [[Compromise of Caspe]].
* The 1453–1456 period of civil war in [[Kingdom of Majapahit]] (now in [[Java (island)|Java]], Indonesia)
* From 1481 until 1483 in the [[Kingdom of Norway]], during a conflict over the succession of [[John, King of Denmark|John]], during the period of the [[Kalmar Union]]. The Norwegian Council of the Realm initially refused to accept the hereditary succession of John; as they asserted that Norway was an elective monarchy. When no serious opposition candidate emerged, the Council relented and elected John. There was also a interregnum from 1533 to 1537, after the dead of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] and the interregnum ended with a [[coup d'état]] by his son [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]].
* From 6 April 1490 to 15 July 1490 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the death of [[Matthias Corvinus]] and election of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]].
* The [[Time of Troubles]] in Russia (1598–1613) between the [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Romanov]] dynasties.
* The [[Interregnum (1649–1660)]], a republican period in the three kingdoms of [[Interregnum (England)|England]], [[Interregnum (Ireland)|Ireland]] and [[Interregnum (Scotland)|Scotland]]. Government was carried out by the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and the [[the Protectorate|Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and before the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]
* A second English interregnum occurred between 23 December 1688, when [[James II of England|James II]] was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the installation of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as joint sovereigns on 13 February 1689 pursuant to the [[Declaration of Right]].
* [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies]] between 1806 and 1815. The period of [[First French Empire|French]] and followed by [[British Empire|British]] rules on the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The French ruled between 1806 and 1811. The British took over for 1811 to 1815, and transferred its control back to the Dutch in 1815.
* The brief [[Russian interregnum of 1825]], caused by uncertainty over who succeeded the deceased Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], only lasted between 1 December and 26 December 1825, but was used to stage the highly resonant [[Decembrist revolt]].

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an ''interregnum'' is usually avoided due to a rule described as "[[The King is dead. Long live the King]]", i.e. the [[heir to the throne]] becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or [[abdication]]. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of [[sovereignty]], attached to a personal form of power named ''[[Auctoritas]]''. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with [[coronation]] or some other formal or traditional event. In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] who served as an [[interrex]] (ruler between kings). In [[Belgium]] the heir only becomes king upon swearing before the [[parliament]].

==Christianity==

===[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]===
A ''Papal interregnum'' occurs upon the death or resignation of the [[Pope]], though this is generally known as a ''[[sede vacante]]'' (literally "when the seat is vacant"). The interregnum ends immediately upon [[Papal election|election]] of a new Pope by the [[College of Cardinals]].

===Anglicanism===
"Interregnum" is the term used in the [[Anglican Communion]] to describe the period before a new [[parish priest]] is appointed to fill a vacancy. During an interregnum, the administration of the [[parish]] is the responsibility of the [[churchwarden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchwardens.com/duties.html |title=Responsibilities and Duties of the Churchwarden |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.churchwardens.com |publisher= |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]===
When the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] dies, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)| First Presidency]] is dissolved and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] becomes the Church's presiding body. Any members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Twelve rejoin that quorum. The period between the death of the President and the reorganization of the First Presidency is known as an "Apostolic Interregnum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Carrie A. |date=2008-01-30 |title= LDS leadership succession plan well-established |url= https://www.deseretnews.com/article/695248535/LDS-leadership-succession-plan-well-established.html |work=[[Deseret News]] |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==
[[FIDE]], the world [[Sports governing body|governing body]] of international [[chess]] competition, has had two [[Interregnum of World Chess Champions|Interregnum periods]] of having no chess champions, both during the 1940s.

===Men===
* 1946–1948 — [[List of World Chess Championships|Men's World Chess Champion]] [[Alexander Alekhine]] died of natural causes in 1946. Interregnum lasted until 1948, when [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

===Women===
* 1944–1950 — [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Chess Champion]] [[Vera Menchik]] killed in an [[airstrike|air-raid]] during [[World War II]] in Britain in 1944. Interregnum lasted until 1950, when [[Lyudmila Rudenko]] won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

==In fiction==
* The events of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation Trilogy]]'' take place during the galactic interregnum in his Foundation Universe, taking place in the [[Far future in science fiction and popular culture|25th millennium]]. [[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]] begins at the end of the Galactic Empire and notes in the novels from the [[Encyclopedia Galactica]] imply that a Second Galactic Empire follows the 1000 year interregnum.

* In [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien]]'s works, the disappearance of the King [[Eärnur]] of [[Gondor]] is followed by a 968-year interregnum (the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] years).

* ''[[The Old Kingdom Trilogy]]'' takes place after 200 years of interregnum, where the reigning Queen and her two daughters were murdered by [[Kerrigor]], 180 years of regency first and 20 years of anarchy following the death of the last Regent.

* The [[Steven Brust#The Dragaeran books|''Vlad Taltos'' series]] is set in a fantastical world of magic, at a time directly following a 250-year interregnum wherein traditional sorcery was impossible due to the orb being destroyed.

* In the world of the ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'', there was an Interregnum in the Second Era when the Second Cyrodillic Empire collapsed. It led to just over four centuries of bickering between small kingdoms and petty states. The Interregnum ended when Tiber Septim, or Talos, formed the Third Empire after a decade of war.

* In ''[[Poland (novel)|Poland]]'' by [[James A. Michener]], 1983, an historical novel that spent 38 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller List, interregnum is mentioned numerous times in the ever-shifting power struggles that plagued that country, even up to the 1980s.

[[Patrick Stewart]], who has a background of theatre at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brochbank, Phillip (Editor)|title=Players of Shakespeare|location= Cambridge, England|publisher= Cambridge University Press |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initially considered for the role of [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]].&lt;ref name="Hatfield"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Hatfiled, James &amp; Burt, George |title=Patrick Stewart: The Unauthorized Biography|location= New York|publisher= Kensington Publishing |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry did not want to cast Stewart as Picard, since he had envisioned an actor who was "masculine, virile, and had a lot of hair".&lt;ref name="bbcjustman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/justman/printpage.html | title=Robert Justman – Co-Producer Co-Creator of Star Trek |publisher=BBC | accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry's first choice was [[Stephen Macht]], and it took "weeks of discussion" with [[Robert H. Justman]], [[Rick Berman]], and the casting director to convince him that "Stewart was the one they had been looking for to sit in the captain's chair"; Roddenberry agreed after auditioning every other candidate for the role.{{r|bbcjustman}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schrager, Adam |title=Patrick Stewart: Thespian on the Bridge|work=The Finest Crew in the Fleet: The Next Generation's Cast On Screen and Off|location= New York|publisher= Wolf Valley Books |date=1997|page= 23}} This book gives the actor's name as "Steven Mocked".&lt;/ref&gt; The other actors considered included [[Yaphet Kotto]], [[Patrick Bauchau]], [[Roy Thinnes]] and [[Mitchell Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/08/star-trekcasting.html|title=Letters of Note: STAR TREK/Casting|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart was uncertain why the producers would cast 'a middle-aged bald English Shakespearean actor' as captain of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/emmys-qa-with-supporting-tv-movieminiseries-actor-nominee-patrick-stewart/|title=EMMYS: Q&amp;A With Supporting TV Movie/Miniseries Actor Nominee Patrick Stewart|first=Nikki|last=Finke|date=August 12, 2010|accessdate=October 19, 2010|authorlink=Nikki Finke}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his toupee delivered from London to meet with Paramount executives, but Roddenberry ordered Stewart to remove the "awful looking" hairpiece. Stewart's stentorian voice impressed the executives, who immediately approved the casting.{{r|bbcjustman}} Roddenberry sent Stewart [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] novels, saying the Picard character was based on Hornblower,&lt;ref name="trekmovieinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/06/22/video-patrick-stewart-on-how-he-expected-tng-to-fail-roddenberry-v-berman-star-trek-albatross-more/|title=VIDEO: Patrick Stewart On Expecting TNG To Fail, Roddenberry v Berman, Star Trek ‘Albatross’ + more|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart was already familiar with the character, having read the books as a teenager.&lt;ref name="bbcstewart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/stewart/printpage.html | title=Patrick Stewart – Jean Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise |publisher=BBC | accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series progressed, Stewart exercised more control over the character's development. By the time production began on the first ''Next Generation'' film, "it was impossible to tell where Jean[-]Luc started and Patrick Stewart ended",&lt;ref name="trekmovieinterview" /&gt; and by the fourth film, Stewart stated:

{{quote|I find myself talking a lot about Picard and one of the things that I've come to understand is that as I talk a lot about Picard what I find is I’m talking about myself.

There was a sort of double action that occurred. In one sense Picard was expanding like this and at the same time he was also growing closer and closer to me as well and in some respect I suppose even had some influence on me. I became a better listener than I ever had been as a result of playing Jean Luc Picard because it was one of the things that he does terrifically well.{{r|bbcstewart}}}}

However, Stewart stated that he is not nearly as serious or brooding as his alter ego.&lt;ref name=journalarts&gt;{{cite web|website=elliottsweb.co.uk |author=Spiner, Brent |url=http://www.elliottsweb.co.uk/brentspiner/bios/patrickinter2.htm |title=The Journal Arts: Patrick Stewart |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515090938/http://www.elliottsweb.co.uk/brentspiner/bios/patrickinter2.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart also stated, "One of the delights of having done this series and played this role is that people are so attracted to the whole idea of ''Star Trek''... several years after the series has ended... I enjoy hearing how much people enjoyed the work we did... It's always gratifying to me that this bald, middle-aged [[Englishman]] seems to connect with them".&lt;ref name=journalarts/&gt; Stewart has commented that his role has helped open up [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to science fiction fans. He has noted the "regular presence of [[Trekkie]]s in the audience" whenever he plays theater, and added: "I meet these people afterwards, I get letters from them and see them at the stage door... And they say, 'I've never seen Shakespeare before, I didn't think I'd understand it, but it was wonderful and I can't wait to come back.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/09/27/theatre_patrick_stewart_interview_feature.shtml|title=BBC - London - Entertainment - Patrick Stewart interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement of new series===
A new ''Star Trek'' series was announced by [[CBS All Access]], [[Alex Kurtzman]] and Patrick Stewart in July 2018. Stewart has been cast to reprise his role as Picard.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/star-trek-patrick-stewart-picard-cbs-all-access-1202895410/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==

===Television series and films===
{{In-universe|date=April 2017|section}}
Jean-Luc Picard was born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in [[La Barre, Haute-Saône|La Barre]], France, on 13 July 2305, and he dreamed of joining [[Starfleet]].&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]|author=[[Michael Okuda|Okuda, Mike]] and Denise Okuda, with Debbie Mirek|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and the rest of his family speak English, with [[Regional accents of English|English accents]]—the [[French language]] having become obscure by the 24th century, as mentioned in the ''Next Generation'' episode "[[Code of Honor (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Code of Honor]]". Suspiciously, Picard also has a number of British habits, including the regular consumption of [[Earl Grey tea]], a fondness for [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], which he performs - authentically enough given the origins of The Bard {{Citation needed|reason=Stewart's accent is mixture of RP and Yorkshire, no trace of West Midlands in his performance|date=December 2016}}, riding horses with English tack and a knowledge of such British songs with [[Royal Navy]] associations as "[[A British Tar]]" ([[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) and "[[Heart of Oak]]". The young Picard failed his first [[Starfleet Academy]] entrance exam, and, upon admission, met with numerous ethical/scholastic difficulties during his cadet career, but went on to flourish, developing a lifelong passion for [[archaeology]], and he became the first [[freshman]] to win the Academy [[marathon (sport)|marathon]].&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; Shortly after graduation, Picard was stabbed in the [[heart]] by a [[Nausicaan]], leaving the organ irreparable and requiring replacement with a [[artificial heart|parthenogenetic implant]]; this would prove near-fatal [[Tapestry (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|later]].&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; Picard eventually served as first officer aboard the [[USS Stargazer|USS ''Stargazer'']], which he later commanded.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; During that time, he invented a [[Warp speed|warp-speed]] starship battle tactic that would become known as the [[Picard Maneuver]].&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

Depicted as deeply moral, highly logical, and intelligent, Picard is a master of [[diplomacy]] and [[debate]] who resolves seemingly intractable issues between multiple, sometimes implacable parties with a [[Solomon]]-like wisdom. Though such resolutions are usually peaceful, Picard is also shown using his remarkable tactical cunning in situations when it is required. Picard has a fondness for [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean drama]], and [[archeology]]. He is frequently shown drinking [[Earl Grey tea]] and issuing the order, "Make it so", or, "Engage".

''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' depicts Picard's command of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-D)]].&lt;ref name="tngcompanion"&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Encounter at Farpoint|pilot episode]] shows the ship's mission to investigate a problem at Farpoint Station, which becomes sidetracked when an entity known as [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]]  makes Picard "representative" in a trial charging humanity with being a "dangerously savage child-race".&lt;ref name="tngcompanion" /&gt; Picard persuades Q to test humanity, and Q chooses as the test's first stage the crew's performance at Farpoint.&lt;ref name="tngcompanion" /&gt; The trial "ends" seven years later (when Q reminds Picard that it never does), in the [[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|series finale]], when humanity is absolved by Picard's demonstration that the species has the capacity to explore the "possibilities of existence".&lt;ref name="tngcompanion" /&gt;

The third-season finale, "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds, Part I]]", depicts Picard being assimilated by the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] to serve as a bridge between humanity and the Borg (renamed [[Locutus]] of Borg); Picard's assimilation and recovery are a critical point in the character's development, and provided [[backstory]] for the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' and the development of [[Benjamin Sisko]], the [[protagonist]] of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.&lt;ref name="tngcompanion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|isbn=978-0671-5010-68|first=Terry J.|last=Erdmann |author2=Paula M. Block|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart asked Roddenberry to keep Picard a Borg for a few more episodes beyond the third-season finale, as he thought that would be more interesting than simply restoring Picard in Part II.&lt;ref name="Hatfield" /&gt; It is later revealed in ''First Contact'' that parts of Borg machinery were removed from inside Picard, but that he retains traumatic memories and lingering neurological aftereffects of assimilation (which become a pivotal plot twist in ''Star Trek: First Contact'').

The fourth-season episode "[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]]" reveals that Picard has a brother, Robert, who took charge of the family vineyards in La Barre after Picard joined Starfleet. Robert and his wife have a young son, René, who is Picard's nephew. In the film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', Picard is devastated to learn that Robert and René have both died in a fire, and worse, the loss makes him the last of the Picard family.

Picard joins forces with the 23rd-century ''Enterprise'' captain [[James T. Kirk]] in ''Star Trek Generations'' to fight the film's villain Dr. Tolian Soran. Commanding the new [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] (after the ''Enterprise''-D is destroyed in ''Generations''), Picard again confronts the Borg in ''First Contact.'' Later, he defends the Prime Directive and fights the forced relocation of the Ba'ku in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'', and encounters Shinzon, a [[Romulan]]-made [[cloning|clone]] of himself, in ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.

In August 2018, it was reported that Patrick Stewart would reprise the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a new ''Star Trek'' series to be broadcast on [[CBS All Access]], which would explore Picard's life 20 years after the events of ''Star Trek: Nemesis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/star-trek-patrick-stewart-picard-cbs-all-access-1202895410/|title=Patrick Stewart to Return as Capt.

===Development in non-canon works===
In novels by [[Pocket Books]], Picard has married Beverly Crusher, and they have a son named René Jacques Robert François Picard. Jean-Luc also corresponds regularly with Marie, his sister-in-law, who still maintains the family vineyards. As of 2385 in the novel miniseries ''Star Trek: The Fall'', Picard remains as commanding officer of the ''Enterprise''-E.

In the comics miniseries ''Star Trek: Countdown'', a prequel to the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot (2009), Picard is depicted as having retired from Starfleet and becoming Federation Ambassador to Vulcan. In 2387, he works with Data, the new commanding officer of the ''Enterprise''-E, Ambassador Spock, and the Romulan miner Nero to save the Romulan Star Empire from a cataclysmic supernova. He is present aboard the ''Enterprise'' as it confronts Nero, who has gone mad and begun killing non-Romulans after they fail to save Romulus. The ''Enterprise'' arrives too late to aid Ambassador Spock against Nero, believing both Spock and Nero to have been consumed by the artificial black hole that Spock created.

The character received critical acclaim among fans of ''The Next Generation'', and he is usually considered one of the top two captains in the ''Star Trek'' franchise – there are often lengthy and serious debates over whether Picard or [[James T. Kirk]] is the "best" Starfleet captain. A 1991 ''[[TV Guide]]'' cover story was titled "It's Kirk vs. Picard: Experts and fans debate who's best".&lt;ref name="brady19920405"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UlhPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SgMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5604%2C1577738 | title=In Step With: Patrick Stewart | work=Parade | date=April 5, 1992 | accessdate=April 28, 2011 | author=Brady, James | pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more lighthearted take on the debate, the cover of a 1994 [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]] ''Star Trek'' special features both Kirk and Picard wrestling childishly to fit into the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s captain's chair, while [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] and [[Worf]] watch their respective commanders with looks of astonishment.&lt;ref name="captainsquable"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/10/16/watch-star-blecch-the-animated-mad-star-trek-2009-parody-more-mad-trek-fun/| title=Watch Star Blecch The Animated Parody | accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picard is deemed the ultimate delegator of authority, knowing "how to gather and use data better than any other ''Star Trek'' captain". His leadership style "is best suited to a large, process-centric, either geographically identical or diverse team".&lt;ref name="Kimmerly"&gt;Paul Kimmerly &amp; David R.

Yeager, ''The Leader's Window: Mastering the Four Styles of Leadership to Build High-Performing Teams'' New York: Wiley (1994): 38&lt;/ref&gt; When Stewart and [[William Shatner]] were asked in 1991 how their characters would have dealt with [[Saddam Hussein]], Shatner stated that Kirk would "have told him to drop dead" while Stewart joked that Picard "would still be talking".&lt;ref name="teitelbaum19910505"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ybc7Wqbr?url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |title=How Gene Roddenberry and his Brain Trust Have Boldly Taken 'Star Trek' Where No TV Series Has Gone Before : Trekking to the Top |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Tribune Company |date=May 5, 1991 |pages=16 |accessdate=April 27, 2011 |author=Teitelbaum, Sheldon |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Stewart addressed a long-asked conundrum among ''Star Trek'' fans, "If Kirk and Picard fought each other, who would win?" in ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine, by saying Picard would prefer to negotiate in the hope of avoiding a fight altogether.

[[UGO Networks]] listed Picard as one of their best heroes in entertainment, saying, "He doesn't have Kirk's sense of panache, but he did have a tendency to take everything really, really seriously for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/best-heroes-of-all-time?page=8 |title=Best Heroes of All Time |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825220404/http://www.ugo.com/games/best-heroes-of-all-time?page=8 |archivedate=August 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a sex symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=h2QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=patrick+stewart+sex+symbol&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8I_OQRaqD&amp;sig=L8PWL79i_UoJ02s_TWui7xs1jd8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij0a2N2abRAhUC4mMKHdgcCfEQ6AEIPzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=patrick+stewart+sex+symbol&amp;f=false|title=The Advocate|first=Here|last=Publishing|date=August 22, 1995|publisher=Here Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/patrick-stewart-the-spirit-of-enterprise-111029.html|title=Patrick Stewart: The spirit of Enterprise|quote=These days, he's something of a sex symbol, too - he has been repeatedly voted the sexiest man on television by American viewers, and has a large gay following.|date=June 30, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and [[Judaism]]. Elements of Jewish [[mythology]] have had a profound influence on [[Christian mythology]] and on [[Islamic mythology]], as well as on world culture in general. Christian mythology directly inherited many of the narratives from the Jewish people, sharing in common the narratives from the [[Old Testament]]. Islamic mythology also shares many of the same stories; for instance, a [[creation myth|creation-account]] spaced out over six periods, the legend of [[Abraham]], the stories of [[Moses]] and the [[Israelites]], and many more.

Jewish mythology contains similarities to the myths of other [[Religions of the ancient Near East|Middle Eastern cultures]]. The ancient [[Hebrews]] often participated in the religious practices of their neighbors, [[Monolatrism|worshiping other gods]] alongside [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 93;  Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; These pagan religions were forms of nature worship: their deities personified natural phenomena like storms and fertility.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 141"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its nature worship, [[Mircea Eliade]] argues, Near Eastern paganism expressed itself in "rich and dramatic mythologies" featuring "strong and dynamic gods" and "orgiastic divinities".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 141"/&gt;

The writings of the Biblical prophets, including [[Isaiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Jeremiah]], express a concept of the divine that is distinct from the mythologies of its neighbors. Instead of seeing the God of Israel as just one [[national god]], these writings describe Yahweh as the one God of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = Karen | author-link1 = Karen Armstrong | chapter = The Axial Age | title = A Short History of Myth | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=bg&amp;id=oTEKAQAAMAAJ | series = Myths series | publisher = Canongate | publication-date = 2005 | page = 93 | isbn = 9781841956442 | access-date = 2018-03-14 | quote = [...] the prophets of Israel [...] felt compelled to fight hard against old myths that they found incompatible with their Axial reform. [...] prophets such as Hosea, Jeremiah and Ezekiel undertook a radical revision of the old anthropomorphic myths. Because the old stories now seemed empty, they declared them to be false.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophetic writings condemned Hebrew participation in nature worship, and did not completely identify the divine with natural forces.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, p. 93"&gt;Armstrong, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, they set the stage for a new kind of mythology — a mythology featuring a [[monotheism|single God]] who exists beyond the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, pp. 95-96; Irwin, pp. 323-34&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], who [[dying-and-rising god|dies and revives]] along with the vegetation,&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; the God of the Hebrew prophets exists beyond nature&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, isn't bound by the natural rhythms, as Armstrong noted: "Where the Babylonian gods were engaged in an ongoing battle against the forces of chaos, and needed the rituals of the New Year festival to restore their energies, Yahweh can simply rest on the seventh day, his work complete."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 96; see also Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the prophets' influence, Jewish mythology increasingly portrayed God as aloof from nature and acting independently of natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', pp. 141-42; Irwin, p. 230, 233&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, this produced a mythology that was, in a sense, more complex. Instead of eternally repeating a seasonal cycle of acts, [[Yahweh]] stood outside nature and [[divine providence|intervened]] in it, producing new, historically unprecedented events; Eliade wrote: "That was [[theophany]] of a new type, hitherto unknown—''the intervention of Jahveh in history''. It was therefore something irreversible and unrepeatable. The [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|fall of Jerusalem]] does not repeat the fall of Samaria: the ruin of Jerusalem presents a new historic theophany, another 'wrath' of Jahveh. […] Jahveh stands out from the world of abstractions, of symbols and generalities; he acts in history and enters into relations with actual historical beings."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 152-53&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, this [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] God was absolutely unique and hard for humans to relate to.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 233; Armstrong, p. 82-83, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the myths surrounding Yahweh were, in a sense, less complex: they did not involve the acts of multiple, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] gods.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, p. 93"/&gt; In this sense, "Jahveh is surrounded by no multiple and varied myths", and did not share in the "rich and dramatic mythologies" of his pagan counterparts.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 141"/&gt;

The Hebrew prophets had to struggle against the nature gods' popularity, and Jewish mythology reflects this struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 142; Armstrong, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karen Armstrong]] sees the creation myth of Genesis 1 as being something composed to do just this -- "as a poised, calm polemic against the old belligerent cosmogonies", particularly the Babylonian [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' describes the god [[Marduk]] earning kingship over the other gods, battling the monster [[Tiamat]], and creating the world from her corpse. In contrast, Armstrong argues, in the Genesis account (and in the book of Isaiah that describe Yahweh's victory over the sea-monster [[Leviathan]]); she writes: "the sun, moon, stars, sky and earth are not gods in their own right, hostile to Yahweh. They are subservient to him, and created for a purely practical end. The sea-monster is no Tiamat, but is God's creature and does his bidding."&lt;ref name="Armstrong, p. 96"&gt;Armstrong, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong also notes that in Psalm 82, Yahweh stands up in the [[Divine Council#Biblical usage|Divine Council]] and condemns the pagan deities, saying that although they are gods, they will die like mortals.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 93-93&lt;/ref&gt;
==Themes and narratives==
===Creation narrative===
[[File:Jan Brueghel de Oude en Peter Paul Rubens - Het aards paradijs met de zondeval van Adam en Eva.jpg|250px|thumbnail|''[[The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man]]''. Illustration of God's creation]]
{{See also|Genesis creation narrative}}
Two creation stories are found in the first two chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]]. In the first [[Elohim]], the Hebrew generic word for [[God]], creates the heavens and the earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the [[Biblical Sabbath|seventh]]. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name [[Yahweh]], creates [[Adam]], the first man, from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]], where he is given dominion over the animals. [[Eve]], the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion. God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them.

Genesis 1:1–2:3 creation order:
* Day 1 - Creation of light (and, by implication, time).
* Day 2 -  The [[firmament]].  In Genesis 1:17 the stars are set in the firmament.
* Day 3 - Creating a ring of ocean surrounding a [[Flat Earth|single circular continent]].{{sfn|Seeley|1997|p=236}} God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them.
* Day 4 -  God puts "lights" in the firmament to "rule over" the day and the night, referring to the "sun" and "moon".{{sfn|Walsh|2001|p=37 (fn.5)}}
* Day 5 - Creation of the living creatures.
* Day 6 - Creation of first man and woman.
* Day 7 - Creation is followed by rest.
In the second story (Genesis 2:4–2:25) the order is different; God created man, the Garden of Eden and planted trees, the living creatures and then the first woman.

====The "combat myth"====
[[File:Destruction of Leviathan.png|right|220px|thumb|''Destruction of [[Leviathan]],'' 1865 by [[Gustave Doré]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions this [[sea monster]] six times.]]
Many of the Hebrews' neighbors had a "combat myth" about the good god battling the demon of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]; one example of this [[mytheme]] is the Babylonian ''[[Enûma Eliš]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A lesser known example is the very fragmentary myth of [[Labbu]].&lt;ref&gt;Labbu is discussed in terms of the developing "adversary" mythology of the Ancient Near East and the Judeo-Christian tradition, in Neil Forsyth, ''The Old Enemy: Satan &amp; the Combat Myth'' (Princeton University press) 1987:44f.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]], the combat myth's imagery influenced Jewish mythology. The myth of God's triumph over [[Leviathan]], a symbol of chaos, has the form of a combat myth.&lt;ref name="McGinn, p. 24"&gt;McGinn, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, McGinn thinks the Hebrews applied the combat myth motif to the relationship between God and [[Satan]]. Originally a deputy in God's court, assigned to act as mankind's "accuser" (''satan'' means "to oppose" - [[Hebrew]]: שָּׂטָן ''satan'', meaning "adversary"), Satan evolved into a being with "an apparently independent realm of operation as a source of evil" — no longer God's deputy but his opponent in a cosmic struggle.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, p. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[the Exodus]] story shows combat-myth influence. McGinn believes the "[[Song of the sea]]", which the Hebrews sang after seeing God drown the Egyptian army in the [[Red Sea]], includes "motifs and language from the combat myth used to emphasize the importance of the foundational event in Israel's religious identity: the crossing of the Red Sea and deliverance from the Pharaoh".&lt;ref name="McGinn, p. 24"/&gt; Likewise, Armstrong notes the similarity between pagan myths in which gods "split the sea in half when they created the world" and the story of the Exodus from Egypt, in which Moses splits the Sea of Reeds (the Red Sea) — "though what is being brought into being in the Exodus, is not a cosmos but a people".&lt;ref name="Armstrong, p. 96"/&gt; In any case, the motif of God as the "divine warrior" fighting on Israel's behalf is clearly evident in the Song of the Sea (Ex. 15). This motif recur in poetry throughout the Hebrew Scriptures (I Samuel 2; Zechariah 9:11-16;14:3-8).

Some [[comparative mythology|comparative mythologists]] think Jewish mythology absorbed elements from pagan mythology. According to these scholars, even while resisting pagan ''worship'', the Jews willingly absorbed elements of pagan ''mythology''.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 96; McGinn, p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;
===Origin myth===
====Adam and Eve====
{{Main|Adam and Eve}}
According to the [[Genesis creation narrative | creation narratives in Genesis]], Adam and Eve were the first man and woman. In the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], chapters one through five, there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve (though not referenced by name) were created together in [[image of God|God's image]] and jointly given instructions to multiply and to be [[Stewardship (theology)|stewards]] over everything else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]] where he is to have dominion over the plants and animals. God places [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil|a tree]] in the garden which he prohibits Adam from eating the fruit of. Eve is later created from one of Adam's ribs to be Adam's companion.

====Garden of Eden====
{{Main|Garden of Eden}}
{{See also|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of life}}
[[File:Benjamin West The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise.jpg|250px|thumb|''The Expulsion of Adam and Eve'']]
The biblical story of Garden of Eden, most notably in the [[Book of Genesis]] chapters 2 and 3, and also in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2011|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicts [[Adam and Eve]] as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Miller (2007) ''Miller 3-in-1: Blue Like Jazz, Through Painted Deserts, Searching for God'', Thomas Nelson Inc, {{ISBN|978-1418551179}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tfHksenSLIEC&amp;pg=PT207#v=onepage&amp;q=naked%20%22garden%20of%20eden%22%20nudity&amp;f=false PT207]&lt;/ref&gt; The man was free to eat off of any tree in the garden, but forbidden to eat from the [[tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. Last of all, the {{LORD}} God made a woman ([[Eve]]) from a rib of the man to be a companion to the man. However, the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] tricks Eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree. Following Eve, Adam broke the commandment and ate of the forbidden fruit. God curses only the serpent and the ground. He prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their [[sin]] of disobeying God. Then he banishes "the man" from the Garden of Eden to prevent him from eating also of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], and thus living for ever. East of the garden there were placed [[Cherub]]im, "and a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life". (Gen.3:24)

The story of the Garden of Eden makes theological use of mythological themes to explain human progression from a state of innocence and bliss to the present human condition of knowledge of sin, misery, and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden Garden of Eden], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Campbell notes that the [[Garden of Eden]] narrative's [[Forbidden fruit|forbidden tree]] is an example of a motif "very popular in fairy tales, known to folklore students as the One Forbidden Thing".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; For another example of the One Forbidden Thing, see the Serbian fairy tale [[Bash Chelik]], in which the hero is forbidden to open a certain door but he does anyway, thereby releasing the villain. Also see the classic story of [[Pandora's box]] in ancient [[Greek mythology]].

====Sodom and Gomorrah====
{{Main|Sodom and Gomorrah}}
[[File:John Martin - Sodom and Gomorrah.jpg|250px|thumb|The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah]]
The story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|18–19|HE}}. Three men came to [[Abraham]] in the plains of Mamre. After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah, "the Lord" revealed to Abraham that he would confirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah, "and because their sin is very grievous". At this time, "the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the {{LORD}} exceedingly". Sodom was ruled by King [[Bera (Bible)|Bera]] while Gomorrah was ruled by King [[Birsha]].

In response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein. Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time.&lt;ref&gt;This is compared with the [[Sorites paradox]] in ''Geocomputation'', Stan Openshaw, Robert J. Abrahart, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zc0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA163 p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt; Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot. Before they lay down, the men of the city demanded lot to bring the guests out onto them so that they may "know them".{{Bibleverse|Genesis|19:4–5|HE}} Lot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two [[almah|virgin]] daughters "which have not &lt;u&gt;known&lt;/u&gt; man" and to "do ye to them as ''[is]'' good in your eyes". However, they refused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders, and then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to "look not behind thee" (singular "thee"). However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with [[fire and brimstone|brimstone and fire]] from the Lord, [[Lot's wife]] looked back at the city, and she became a pillar of salt.

In [[Abrahamic religions]], Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of [[divine retribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|last2=Baumann|first2=Martin|title=Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practises |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]](S15) [[Al-Hijr]]:72–73&lt;/ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Jude|1:7}}

===Flood narrative===
{{Main|Flood myth|Genesis flood narrative}}
[[File:Noahs Ark.jpg|250px|thumb|''[[Noah's Ark]]'', oil on canvas painting by [[Edward Hicks]], 1846 Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
The [[Genesis flood narrative]] has similarities to ancient flood stories told worldwide. One of the closest parallels is the [[Mesopotamian]] myth of a world flood, recorded in ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. In the Hebrew Bible flood story (Genesis 6:5-22), God decides to flood the world and start over, due to mankind's sinfulness. However, God sees that a man named [[Noah]] was righteous (because he walked with God) and blameless among the people. God instructs Noah to build an [[Noah's Ark|ark]] and directs him to bring at least two of every animal inside the boat, along with his family. The flood comes and covers the world. After 40 days, Noah sends a raven to check whether the waters have subsided, then a dove; after exiting the boat, Noah offers a sacrifice to God, who smells "the sweet savour" and promises never to destroy the earth by water again - making the [[Rainbows in mythology|rainbow]] a symbol of this promise. Similarly, in the Mesopotamian ''Epic of Gilgamesh'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Gilgamesh'', p. 108-13&lt;/ref&gt; the bustle of humanity disturbs the gods, who decide to send a flood. Warned by one of the gods, a man named [[Utnapishtim]] builds a boat and takes his family and animals inside. After the flood, Utnapishtim sends a dove, then a swallow, then a raven to check whether the waters have subsided. After exiting the boat, Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell "the sweet savour" and repent their choice to send the flood.

Another ancient flood myth is the Hindu story of [[Matsya]] the fish. According to this story,&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the Hindu scripture ''Matsya'' 1:11-35 in ''Classical Hindu Mythology'', p. 71-74&lt;/ref&gt; the god [[Vishnu]] takes the form of a fish and warns the ancestor [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] about a coming flood. He tells Manu to put all the creatures of the earth into a boat. Unlike the Biblical and Mesopotamian floods, however, this flood is not a unique event brought on by a divine choice; instead, it's one of the destructions and recreations of the universe that happen at regular intervals in [[Hindu mythology]].

===National myth===
====The Patriarchs====
[[File:Lutte de Jacob avec l'Ange.jpg|thumb|''Jacob Wrestling with the Angel'']]
The Patriarchs in Hebrew bible are [[Abraham]], his son [[Isaac]], and Isaac's son [[Jacob]], also named [[Israel]], the ancestor of the [[Israelites]]. These three figures are referred to collectively as the [[patriarch]]s of [[Judaism]], and the period in which they lived is known as the [[patriarchal age]]. The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. Abraham is called by [[God]] to leave the house of his father [[Terah]] and settle in the land originally given to [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]] but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to [[Ishmael]] about founding a great nation, [[Isaac]], Abraham's son by his half-sister [[Sarah]], inherits God's promises to Abraham. Jacob is the son of Isaac and [[Rebecca]] and regarded as a Patriarch of the [[Israelites]] as his twelve sons became the progenitors of the "[[Tribes of Israel]]".
====The Exodus====
[[File:Aivazovsky Passage of the Jews through the Red Sea.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Passage of the Jews through the Red Sea]]
{{Main|The Exodus}}
The story of the exodus is told in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The [[Israelites]] had settled in the [[Land of Goshen]] in the time of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Jacob]], but a new [[pharaoh]] arose who enslaved and oppressed the children of Israel. At this time Moses was born; the Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses' mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, and raised as an Egyptian. One day after Moses had reached adulthood he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to [[Midian]].

There, on [[Mount Horeb]], [[God]] appeared to Moses as a [[burning bush]] revealed to Moses his name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]&lt;ref&gt;"I AM WHO I AM"; and He said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'{{bibleverse|Exodus|3:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]] (Israel) out of bondage and into the [[Promised Land]].&lt;ref&gt;"Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me."{{bibleverse|Exodus|8:1|NASB}}{{Citation | quote = It was the [[Religious calling|prophet's call]]. It was a real [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic experience]], like that of [[David]] under the baka-tree, [[Elijah]] on the mountain, [[Isaiah]] in the temple, [[Ezekiel]] on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khebar]], [[Jesus]] in the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] on the [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|Damascus road]].

Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to [[plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the [[Crossing the Red Sea|Red Sea Crossing]] as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol III : Chapter I]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Egypt, Moses [[The Exodus|led the Israelites]] to [[biblical Mount Sinai]], where he was given the [[Ten Commandments]] from God, written on [[Stele|stone tablets]]. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted [[Kohen|the priesthood]] under the sons of Moses' brother [[Aaron]], and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. After the forty years had passed, Moses eventually led the Israelites into the Land of Canaan.

===Heroic narratives===
====Gideon====
[[File:Poussin La Victoire de Gédéon contre les Madianite.jpg|280px|thumb|Gideon's victory over the Midianites]]
{{Main|Gideon}}
Gideon was a military leader, judge and prophet whose calling and decisive victory over the [[Midianites]]. He went on to send out messengers to gather together men in order to meet an armed force of the people of Midian and the [[Amalek]] that had crossed the [[Jordan River]], and they encamped at the [[Well of Harod]] in the [[Valley of Jezreel]]. But God informed Gideon that the men he had gathered were too many – with so many men, there would be reason for the Israelites to claim the victory as their own instead of acknowledging that God had saved them. At first Gideon sent home those men who were afraid and invited any man who wanted to leave, to do so; 22,000 men returned home and 10,000 remained. Yet with the number, God told Gideon they were still too many; Gideon brought his troops to the water, where all those who lap the water with their tongues, were put to one side; all those who kneel down to drink, putting their hands to their mouths, were put to the other side. The number of those that lapped was three hundred; but all the rest of the troops knelt down to drink water. Then the Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go to their homes.” ({{Bibleref2|Judges7:4–7}}).

During the night, God instructed Gideon to approach the Midianite camp. There, Gideon overheard a Midianite man tell a friend of a dream in which "a loaf of [[barley bread]] tumbled into the camp of Midian" ({{Bibleref2|Judges 7:13}}), causing their tent or camp to collapse. This was interpreted as meaning that God had given the Midianites over to Gideon. Gideon returned to the Israelite camp and gave each of his men a trumpet (''[[shofar]]'') and a clay jar with a torch hidden inside. Divided into three companies, Gideon and his 300 men marched on the enemy camp. He instructed them to blow the trumpet, give a battle cry and light torches, simulating an attack by a large force. As they did so, the Midianite army fled ({{Bibleref2|Judges 7:17–22}}). Later, their leaders were caught and killed.
====Samson====
[[File:SamsonDestroyTemple.jpg|200px|thumb|Samson destroys the temple]]
{{Main|Samson}}
Samson was the last of the [[Biblical judges|judges]] of the ancient [[Israelites]] mentioned in the [[Book of Judges]]. The biblical account states that Samson was a [[Nazirite]], and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform [[superhuman]] feats,&lt;ref&gt;{{wwbible|Old Testament, 316–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if Samson's [[Long hair#In Jewish and Christian scriptures|long hair]] was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated and he would lose his strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|16:17|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first instance of this is seen when Samson was on his way to ask for the Philistine woman's hand in marriage, when he was attacked by a lion. He simply grabbed it and ripped it apart, as the spirit of God divinely empowered him.
After the philistines burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death, Samson, in revenge, slaughtered many more Philistines, saying, "I have done to them what they did to me. Samson then took refuge in a cave in the [[rock of Etam]].&lt;ref name="ppp"&gt;{{JewishEncyclopedia|article=Samson|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=122&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Samson}}&lt;/ref&gt; An army of Philistines came to the [[Tribe of Judah]] and demanded that 3,000 men of Judah deliver them Samson. In order to avoid a war and with Samson's consent, they tied him with two new ropes and were about to hand him over to the Philistines when he broke free of the ropes. Using the jawbone of a donkey, he slew 1,000 Philistines.&lt;ref name="igb"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Illustrated Guide to the Bible|last=Porter|first=J. R. |year= 2000|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7607-2278-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samson falls in love with [[Delilah]] in the [[Nahal Sorek|valley of Sorek]]. The Philistines approach Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy. While Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her with false answers, he finally wears down and tells Delilah that God supplies his power because of his consecration to God as a [[Nazirite]] and that if his hair is cut off he will lose his strength. Delilah then woos him to sleep "in her lap" and calls for a servant to shave his hair. Samson loses his strength and he is captured by the Philistines who blind him by gouging out his eyes. They then take him to Gaza, imprison him, and put him to work turning a large millstone and grinding corn.

One day, the Philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice to [[Dagon]], for having delivered Samson into their hands.&lt;ref name="eej"&gt;{{wwbible|Old Testament, 319}}&lt;/ref&gt; They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/judges/16-27.htm Judges 16:27]&lt;/ref&gt; Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Judges|16:28–30|HE}}, JPS (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have interpreted Samson as a [[demigod]] (such as [[Heracles]] or [[Enkidu]]) enfolded into Jewish religious lore,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=IhhOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244|page=244|title=The Mertowney Mountain Interviews|first=Richard|last=Leviton|authorlink=Richard Leviton|publisher=[[iUniverse]]|year=2014|isbn=9781491741290}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an [[archetype|archetypical]] [[folk hero]].

====David and Goliath====
[[File:David and Goliath by Caravaggio.jpg|200px|thumb|David and Goliath]]
{{Main|Goliath}}
According to the [[Book of Samuel]], [[Saul]] and the [[Israelites]] are facing the [[Philistines]] in the [[Valley of Elah]]. Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. [[David]], bringing food for his elder brothers, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, [[Sling (weapon)|sling]] ({{Lang-he|קָלַע}} ''{{transl|he|qāla‘}}'') and five stones from a brook.

David and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. David hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites "as far as Gath and the gates of [[Ekron]]". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, "I am the son of your servant [[Jesse]] the [[Bethlehem]]ite."

===Architectural myth===

====Tower of Babel====
{{Main|Tower of Babel}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|250px|thumbnail|''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] (1563)]]
The story of the Tower of Babel explains the origin of different human languages. According to the story, which is recorded in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:1–9|HE}}, everyone on earth spoke the same language. As people migrated from the east, they settled in the land of [[Shinar]] (Mesopotamia). People there sought to make bricks and build a city and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for themselves, so that they not be scattered over the world. God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as one people with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God went down and confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over the face of the earth, and they stopped building the city. Thus the city was called Babel.
===Watchers===
{{Main|Watcher (angel)|Nephilim}}
Also possibly derived from pagan mythology is the story of the "Watchers" (Genesis 6:1-4). According to this story, heavenly beings once descended to earth, intermarried with humans, and produced the ''[[nephilim]]'', "the [[hero]]es of old, men of renown". Jewish tradition regards those heavenly beings as wicked angels,&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; but the myth may represent a fragment of pagan mythology about gods interbreeding with humans to produce heroes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Zoroastrian influence==
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|200px|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]] in 750 CE. Khorasan was a province of [[Persia]] in [[yellow]].]]R. C. Zaehner, a professor of Eastern religions, argues for [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianism's]] direct influence on Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological myths]], especially the [[resurrection of the dead]] with rewards and punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Zaehner, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear history===
{{See also|Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history}}
The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] believes the Judeo-Christian idea of [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear history]] originated with the Iranian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]]. In the mythologies of India and the Far East, "the world was not to be reformed, but only known, revered, and its laws obeyed".&lt;ref name="Campbell, p. 191"&gt;Campbell, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in Zoroastrianism, the current world is "corrupt [...] and to be reformed by human action".&lt;ref name="Campbell, p. 191"/&gt; According to Campbell, this "progressive view of cosmic history"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; "can be heard echoed and re-echoed, in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaean, Arabic, and every tongue of the West".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditional cultures limited mythical events to the beginning of time, and saw important historical events as repetitions of those mythical events.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 190; Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mircea Eliade, the Hebrew prophets "valorized" history, seeing historical events as episodes in a continual divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; This doesn't mean that ''all'' historical events have significance in Judaism;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; however, in Jewish mythology, significant events happen throughout history, and they are not merely repetitions of each other; each significant event is a new act of God:
{{quote|"The fall of Samaria actually did occur in history [...] It was therefore something irreversible and unrepeatable. The fall of Jerusalem does not repeat the fall of Samaria: the ruin of Jerusalem presents a new historic theophany."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By portraying time as a linear progression of events, rather than an [[Eternal return|eternal repetition]], Jewish mythology suggested the possibility for [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited by Christianity, this view of history has deeply influenced Western philosophy and culture. Even supposedly secular or political Western movements have worked within the world-view of progress and linear history inherited from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 69; Campbell, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this legacy, the religious historian Mircea Eliade argues that "Judaeo-Christianity makes an innovation of the first importance" in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade believes that the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before their contact with Zoroastrianism,&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 302"&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; but agrees with Zaehner that Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time with eschatological elements that originated in Zoroastrianism. According to Eliade, these elements include [[Dualistic cosmology#Moral dualism|ethical dualism]], the myth of a [[Messiah|savior]], and "an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 302"/&gt;

==Talmud==
The Jewish people's tendency to adopt the neighboring pagan practices, denounced as it had been by the Jewish prophets, returned with force during the [[Talmud]]ic period. However, almost no mythology was borrowed until the Midrashic and Talmudic periods, when what can be described as mysticism emerged in the [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] schools.

===''Shedim''===
One such aspect was the appearance of the "Shedim", or [[demon]]s; these became ubiquitous to the ordinary Jews&lt;ref&gt;G. Dennis, "Demons and Demonology," ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic, and Mysticism''&lt;/ref&gt; with the increased access to the study of the Talmud after the invention of the printing press.

===Dreams===
The classical [[rabbi]]s themselves were at times not free from sharing in the popular beliefs. Thus, while there is a whole catalog of prognostications by means of Dreams in Ber. 55 et seq., and Rabbi Johanan claimed that those dreams are true which come in the morning or are dreamed about us by others, or are repeated,&lt;ref&gt;Ber. 56b&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Meïr declares that dreams help not and injure not.&lt;ref&gt;Gittin 52a, and parallels&lt;/ref&gt; Dream interpretation is not however a factor in considering mythologyfication of Talmud knowledge since it was at the time a part of the wider nascent development of what later became the discipline of [[Psychology]], and also incorporated [[Astrology]], and effect of digestion on behaviour.

===The ''Keresh'' and the ''Tigris'' of the ''Bei Ilai''===
An example of typical mythology in the Talmud exists as a discussion about a [[Deer in mythology|giant deer]] and a [[Lion#Cultural depictions|giant lion]] which are both originated in a mythical forest called "Bei Ilai". ('Bei' means house in Aramaic)&lt;ref&gt;חולין נט ע"ב - ע"ב, [http://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Chullin.pdf ''Chullin'' 59b]&lt;/ref&gt; The deer is called "keresh", it has one horn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_28.html Babylonian Talmud, ''Shabbath'' 28ab.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 2:3. [https://books.google.co.za/books?id=JoTNH9K7_JEC&amp;q=Judah+skins+of+#v=snippet&amp;q=Judah%20skins%20of&amp;f=false ''The Talmud of the Land of Israel, Volume 11: Shabbat'', ed. by Jacob Neusner, page 98.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tanhuma|Midrash Tanchuma]] 6: [https://books.google.com/books?id=WLOi9vWEzTEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=midrash+tanhuma&amp;sig=b3ZLY8QYc6nEESbH_31KBjO15TM#v=onepage&amp;q=midrash%20tanhuma&amp;f=false ''Midrash Tanchuma–Yelammedenu: An English Translation of Genesis and Exodus'' by Samuel A. Berman, page 524].&lt;/ref&gt; and its skin measures 15 [[cubit]]s in length.&lt;ref&gt;15 cubits. ''English measure'' Cubit = 18 inches × 15 = 270 inches ÷ 12 = 22.5 feet in length. Compare ''[[Elasmotherium]]'', about 15–18 feet in length, with a massive horn on its forehead. (''see'' [[Relict (biology)|Relict]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The lion, called "tigris", is said to be so big that there is a space of 9 cubits between its ears.&lt;ref&gt;9 cubits. ''English measure'' Cubit = 18 inches × 9 = 162 inches ÷ 12 = 13.5 feet between its ears.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|Caesar]] [[Hadrian]] once asked Rabbi [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] to show him this lion, since every lion can be killed, but the Rabbi refused and pointed out that this is not a normal lion. The Roman Caesar insisted, so the Rabbi reluctantly called for the lion of "Bei Ilai". He roared once from a distance of 400  [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Length and distance|parasangs]], and all pregnant women [[Miscarriage|miscarried]] and all the city walls of Rome tumbled down. Then he came to 300 parasangs and roared again, and the front teeth and molars of Roman men fell out, and even the emperor himself fell from his throne. He begged the Rabbi to send it back. The Rabbi prayed and it returned to its place.

===Traditional folk beliefs===
The authorities of the Talmud seem to be particularly influenced by popular conception in the direction of [[folk medicine]]. A belief in the [[Evil eye]] was also prevalent in Talmudic times, and occasionally omens were taken seriously, though in some cases recognized as being merely popular beliefs. Thus, while it is declared to be unlucky to do things twice, as eating, drinking, or washing,&lt;ref&gt;Pesachim 109b&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Dunai recognized that this was an old tradition.&lt;ref&gt;ib. 110b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planting ''huppah'' trees===
A remarkable custom mentioned in the Talmud is that of planting trees when children are born and intertwining them to form the huppah when they marry.&lt;ref&gt;Gittin 57a&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this idea may be originally Iranian{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} and is also found in India.&lt;ref&gt;W. Crookes, in "Folk-Lore," vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological components of Haggadic exegesis===
It may be possible to distinguish in the [[haggadic]] legends of Biblical character those portions that probably formed part of the original accounts from those that have been developed by the exegetic principles of the [[haggadists]].

The uniqueness of the Talmudic style of both recording meaning and deriving it using exegesis places the many seemingly mythological components of the much larger halachic content into a content very unlike the purely story-telling corpus of other cultures.

==Popular culture==
In the past century to modern day, there have been many retellings of Jewish myths (mostly from the [[Torah]]), and adaptations for the modern public. They have mostly been in the regions of [[science fiction]], as [[Isaac Asimov]] noted in his introduction to ''More Wandering Stars'':
{{quote|"...Can science fiction be part of Jewish culture? From fantasy stories we know?/ And as I think of it, it begins to seem to me that it is and we do know. And the source? From where else? From the Hebrew source for everything-- From the Bible. We have but to look through the Bible to see for ourselves."|Isaac Asimov}}

He goes on to show parallels between biblical stories and modern science fiction [[Fantasy tropes and conventions|tropes]]:
* [[Let there be light]] was an example of advanced scientific mechanisms
* God is an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]
* Adam and Eve as colonists on a new planet
* The serpent was an alien, as Earth snakes don't speak or show any intelligence
* The flood was a story of a world catastrophe, and the survivors
* The [[Tower of Babel]] (like ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', which it inspired in part)
* [[Moses]] vs. the Egyptian magicians is advanced technological warfare
* [[Samson]] as [[sword and sorcery]]
* The first chapter of [[Ezekiel]] is a [[UFO]] account.

The [[Hugo Awards]], one of the highest distinctions for science fiction writers, have been awarded to biblically derived stories. For instance [[Harlan Ellison]]'s "[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]", [[Larry Niven]]'s "[[Inconstant Moon]]" and [[Harlan Ellison]]'s "[[The Deathbird]]".

Another example is [[Hideaki Anno]]'s [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] anime series, which uses kabbalah elements while narrating a reinterpretation of events surrounding [[Adam]], [[Eve]] and [[Lilith]] in a futuristic and apocalyptic way.

Edward M. Erdelac's [[weird western]] series Merkabah Rider features a Hasidic mystic gunslinger and draws heavily from Jewish myth and folklore.

It is often suggested that [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], the two Jewish creators of [[Superman]], essentially the beginning of superhero comics and [[comic book]]s, were partly inspired by the story of the [[Golem of Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;For a sample discussion of this subject see [http://www.supermanfan.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=147 "Superman and the Golem"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Legion of Net.Heroes''', or '''LNH''', is the oldest (and perhaps the first) [[Usenet]]-based [[shared universe]] still in existence, and the name of the premiere "[[superhero|net.hero]]" team in that universe. Birthed from a rec.arts.comics cascade thread in April 1992 [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics/browse_thread/thread/99f96d23932a9546/2f233def357d57fd?q=Legion+of+Net+Heroes&amp;], it began as [[parody]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] (LSH), and other comic book superheroes. It featured characters like Cheesecake-Eater Lad (based on [[Matter-Eater Lad]]) and Super Apathy Lad defending the “Looniverse” from the likes of Lagneto ("[[Lag]]" spliced with "[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]") and Doctor [[Killfile]]. Over time, it has evolved to include [[comedy]], serious [[drama]], [[fictional character|character]] pieces and [[melodrama]]. With 181 stories posted in 2007, it is still active.

==History==

===In the beginning===

On April 27, 1992, rec.arts.comics member Bill Sherman, commenting on the correct spelling of the name [[Winsor McCay]], declared himself "Spelling Boy" of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|LSH.]]  Two days later, [[Dan'l Danehy Oakes]] suggested that long-time posters form a Legion of Net. Heroes. He declared himself [[California|California Kid]], "whose power is to read [[comix]] weeks after everyone else has discussed 'em..."

The thread took off, spawning 115 (mostly) on-topic replies and a large and diverse pool of "net.heroes". On May 5, Steve Librande, no doubt growing tired of the thread, declared himself  "the ingenious Doctor Killfile"
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|newsgroup=rec.arts.comics|author=Steve Librande|title=NET: Brotherhood of Evil.Net.Villians
|message-id=1992May6.163235.7110@news.media.mit.edu|date=6 May 1992 &lt;!-- 16:32:35 GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening to "release the awesome force of my patented Kill-O-Ray, destroying all posts about you blithering Net.Heroes!!"

Benjamin Pierce, in the net.persona of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel_Zombie Lad]], rallied his fellow "net.heroes" to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|newsgroup=rec.arts.comics|author=Craig Thomas Judd|title=LNH Chapter I|message-id=1992May8.001901.11375@cam.compserv.utas.edu.au|date=8 May 1992|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/rec.arts.comics/Do3cz91jXi4/97A1Ix5ohOcJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that forty-four different authors began working on the first actual LNH story, later called ''[[Plot device|The Cosmic Plot Device Caper]]''. At that time, Usenet users were primarily college students, and when summer vacation came, interest in the LNH waned.

Come the fall, interest was stirred up again, primarily because of Todd "Scavenger" Kogutt. [http://www.eyrie.org/lnh/faq.html]  New LNH stories and new authors debuted on rec.arts.comics.misc (rec.arts.comics had become defunct in late 1992). Some authors created continuing "series", with issue numbers and [[Webserial|serial]]ised stories; the first of these was Kyle Lucke's ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Cheeezarr/ Quest for Cheeze]'', soon followed by Ray "wReam" Bingham's ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Ultimate.Ninja/ Ultimate Ninja]''.

===The newsgroup shuffle===

Many posters on rec.arts.comics.misc were annoyed by the LNH stories in what was primarily a discussion newsgroup. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.misc/msg/8db8747bb0163ec6]

The LNH moved to their very own newsgroup, alt.comics.lnh, before finding their permanent home on [https://web.archive.org/web/20060515122546/http://www.wilsego.com/racc/ rec.arts.comics.creative]. RACC also hosts a number of other original fiction shared universes, such as [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/ash ASH], [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/omega OMEGA] and [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/8fold 8FOLD]. Occasionally RACC receives cross-posts from [[Superguy]]. It is moderated by Russ "Eagle" Allbery, who also maintains the eyrie [[ftp]] [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc archives].

==The Looniverse==

The world of the LNH, known as the Looniverse, is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] much like our own, but with the presence of net.heroes, [[metahuman|net.ahumans]], and net.villains.

One notable difference, besides the presence of superpowers, is that the vast majority of LNH characters are aware of the [[fourth wall]]: they know that they are fictional characters in fictional stories, and often will comment on bad characterizations and ludicrous plot-twists, sometimes talking directly to the audience or their author. Sometimes, the plot-twists themselves come out of fourth-wall breaking. For example, in Gary St. Lawrence's story, ''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/d5ad142db42c3fc9?dmode=source The Case of the Clueless Mystery]'', the characters discover how to defeat the villain by consulting the script. [[Metafiction]]al concepts such as Comedy and Drama are treated like real cosmic forces.[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/e281e0e65a9a0630?dmode=source]

The Looniverse is also notable for its ability to simultaneously [[Cognitive dissonance|contain mutually exclusive ideas]]. In the work of Hubert Bartels, for example, mainstream comic books are treated something akin to movies: heroes audition for the likes of [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Marv Wolfman]] and model for the penciller. Other authors treat the work of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]] as comic books that are products of their writer's imagination. Still others use parody titles to represent mainstream comics, i.e., ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Justice Mind-Wipers of America]]'' instead of ''[[JLA (comic book)|Justice League of America]]'', ''[[Adventism|New Adventists]]'' instead of ''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]''.

Some characters operate in a world of realistic [[Newtonian physics|physics]]; others operate by the laws of [[Cartoon physics]]. For some characters, time unfolds akin to real-world time; for others, all their lives have taken place in "[[floating timeline|the last ten years]]". Yet these characters can often meet and team-up in the same time-frame.

===Humour===
The humour of the LNH has broadened considerably from its joke-name beginnings, and now includes broad parody, subtle satire, and character humour. However, there are some major trends that have remained a constant thread throughout its lifetime.

The two prime targets of LNH parody are superheroes, and the [[Internet]]. In fact, net terminology and conventions extends even to the naming of characters and places: for example, Lurking Girl and Lurker Lad derive their invisibility powers from "lurkers", newsgroup readers who do not actively take part in the discussion, but rather, "lurk". Many of the cities in the Looniverse have net-based names: [[Metropolis (comics)|Net.ropolis]] and [[Chicago|Sig.ago]], for example.[http://www.eyrie.org/lnh/gazette.html]

===Fictional history===

Since the day Dr. Killfile attacked the LNH, a number of LNH Writers have filled in the gaps within the Looniverse's back [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/294f6ff0b730e476?dmode=source&amp;hl=en history]. Retcons, however, often make the task of history scribing very difficult in an ever-changing Looniverse. The more popular ideas tend to remain and the other ones tend to disappear.

====Backstory====

Back during the 19th century, Net.ropolis was known as Babbagetown. Little is known of how far the origins of this city go back. The history of the LNHQ is also rather murky. What is known though is that the current LNHQ used to be the Net.ropolis Hotel Grand. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/browse_thread/thread/249a1ddf0d51f012/be169faee7316033?q=LNH+Volume+8&amp;rnum=1#be169faee7316033][http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/b655f0e2e4f5e34c?dmode=source&amp;hl=en]

Sometime in the 1920s or 1930s, a hero by the name of [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.misc/msg/178a7e802a2e09c3?dmode=source Boy Lad] formed the Legion of Net. Heroes. During this time, he was the only member (Boy Lad Jr., his sidekick, wasn't allowed to join, due to the "no sidekicks are allowed to join" rule). No one knows what ultimately happened to him although someone who claimed to be him made an appearance in the ''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/88b99a91506736aa?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Omaha Project]'' series.

After Boy Lad disappeared, the [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/f7823cd01f914e7e?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Agents of P.U.L.P], [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.misc/msg/649da67dd0d685d9?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Classic Squad], and [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/211f274effe809a5?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Society of Wireless Heroes] (A British-based super group) took over the hero game in the 1940s and 1950s. Some members of the Classic Squad would eventually become part of the current LNH incarnation like Old Comics Man, [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Man]], and Kid Yesterdaze.

During the 1960s, the [[Fantastic Four|Net.astic Nine]][http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/5d93683082edab56?dmode=source&amp;hl=en] and the [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Challengers/ Challengers of the Abominable] helped protect Net.ropolis and the Looniverse from destructive forces. The LNHer [[Signature block|Sig.Lad]] was formerly a member of the Net.astic Nine. At the end of the 60's, a demon going by the name of [[Anti-Christ|Anti-Christ Lad]] controlled all of Net.ropolis including the LNH that was operating during this time period: [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/c01b821670411647?dmode=source&amp;hl=en The Legion of Net. Hippies]. Self-Righteous Preacher, after joining with the [[Hippies|Legion of Net.Hippies]] helped free the LNH from Anti-Christ Lad's control and sent him back to hell. A few Legion of Net. Hippies like [[Naturism|Nudist Man]], Super Apathy Lad, and [[Procrastination|Procrastination Boy]] remained with the current Legion.[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/browse_thread/thread/708b75891a00eb46/6e12eab6a7d66d82?q=LNH+Volume+9&amp;rnum=1#6e12eab6a7d66d82]

In the 1980s, [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/e5d8b9eaaad6355a?dmode=source&amp;hl=en The Legion of New-Wave Heroes] arrived on the scene and quickly disappeared.

As to when the current incarnation of the LNH got its start is a subject of some debate. It could have begun a few days or a few years before the ''Cosmic Plot Device Caper'' depending on which stories one reads.[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/browse_frm/thread/4b0387cc34cddd34/f779960c6568b30a?q=Bandwagon+Chick&amp;rnum=1#f779960c6568b30a]

====The LNH begins====

After the ''Cosmic Plot Device Caper'', came the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#"Five Years Later"|2½ Month Gap]], a mysterious period of which little is known. During this time period, [[Rebel Yell]] became leader of the LNH and Y-Plex Burp replaced Lurking Girl with an evil clone called Lurking Lass. After that a number of crises took shape. During a time called Beige Noon, two god like beings called Dekay and Diskolor attempted to drain the color from the Looniverse and turn it into a wasteland. This was followed by the RMGrouping of rec.arts.comics, which caused the entire LNH to be scattered across the Net. In ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/501.Blues/ 501 Blues: The Long Road to Nowhere]'', Rebel Yell tried to find all of the lost legionaries and succeeded in finding Lurking Girl.

This was followed by ''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/7e79013a7e5dee03?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Cry.Sig]'', a parody of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], where the Crossover Queen caused tons of havoc (including destroying Canada with a reality ray).  ''Cry.Sig'' gave LNH Writers an excuse for rampant retconning of continuity. [[Dial H for Hero|Dial-D-for-Dvandom]] became the [[Phantom Stranger|Dvandom Stranger]] and Pre-Cry.Sig [[Occult|Occultism Kid]] became the August One, mentor to the Post-Cry.Sig Occultism Kid.

====Post-Cry. Sig====

The [[Ninja|Ultimate Ninja]] joined with the LNH after Cry. Sig. Somewhere along the line the leadership of the LNH became a [[triumvirate]] with Rebel Yell, Continuity Champ, and the Ultimate Ninja each taking a share of LNH power.

In the ''Integrity Quest'', written by Doug P. Wojtowicz, Stephane Savoie, and Hubert Bartels, the characters Lost Cause Boy, Kid Anarky, and Panta the cat-girl were introduced; in the tenth installment, Wojtowicz referred to a penile erection as a "woody": this caused a minor controversy dubbed [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/8ae0c05cb60531d9?dmode=source&amp;hl=en "The Woody Scandal"], and resulted in the ostracization of Wojtowicz. Other stories of this era also skirted the line of good taste: Gary St. Lawrence's stories ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Miniseries/Pigs.Space/ Pigs in Space]'' and  [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Saint.Squad/ ''Passionfishing''], however, produced a much less volatile reaction. These three stories challenged the notions of what was acceptable content in LNH stories and led to the development of a "mature audiences" label, Acraphobe.

In 1993, Rebel Yell, due to events depicted in the ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/501.Blues/ Lurk of Faith]'', took a leave of absence from the LNH (never returning), leaving the Ultimate Ninja in complete control. Myk-El was revealed to be a traitor and killed by the Ultimate Ninja. The Secret Dvanders dug up Myk-El's grave, not convinced that he was indeed a traitor in ''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/7a17a6adec692c46?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Constellation #27]'', which set up the beginning for Retcon Hour.

''[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/fdfd3bac42fe9ba4?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Retcon Hour]'', a parody of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], was the biggest planned crossover the LNH has ever had. At least fourteen writers took part in it, it touched both the PULP and NTB imprints, and also was linked with the Omaha Project series. During the chaos involved with transferring the Looniverse from alt.comics.lnh to rec.arts.comics.creative, two Time Crappers (post and pre-Cry. Sig), and wReamicus Maximus (wielding the all-powerful Ring of Retcon) washed the Looniverse over with a number of retcons in order to take control of it. Contraption Man was revealed to be the traitor he had been sent to stop. The resurrected and vindicated Myk-El became the consort of the [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|RACCelestial Madonna]]. After the dust settled a few heroes, like Sig. Lad, left for a new life. And some new heroes, like the Legion of Occult Heroes, joined the LNH.

A brain dead Dr. Killfile was totally obliterated in ''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/0bcdd6966b192a3c?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Looniverse Adrift]'' and the supervillain Tsar Chasm appeared to die too. Pocket Man married Organic Lass in [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/e73d25b8376da18c?dmode=source&amp;hl=en the first LNH wedding].

====Post-retcon hour====

In 1995 in ''[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/4336eec8b6a5054a?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Dvandom Force #48]'', Sig. Lad was killed by Squidman (formerly the LNHer called [[Suicide Squid|Squid Boy]]) to prevent a dystopian future where he would have killed the entire LNH.

In 1997 [http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Return.Tsar.Chasm/ Tsar Chasm returned] from the dead and it was revealed that he was posing as the LNHer Kid G. In 1998, Dr. Killfile also returned with no explanation of how he had cheated death in the pages of [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/b9498507038dee7b?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Teenfactor].

In 1999 in ''[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/13092d88cfa47778?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Tales of the LNH #370]'', Panta was retconned out of existence, sacrificing herself to save the Looniverse from the Collector.

In 2000, [[Hexadecimal]] [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] became [[POTUS|President of the Loonited States]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/1702a738613dd862]  In 2004, he was re-elected. [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comics.lnh/msg/ee035e13f2a334a2]

In March 2001, the city of Sig.ago was completely destroyed (it would eventually be restored). [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/6a5a38b21242e357?dmode=source&amp;hl=en]

In July 2001, a number of LNHers were married including Deja Dude, Master Blaster and Sister State the Obvious, Innovative Offense Boy and Ordinary Lady, and Cheesecake Eater Lad and aLLiterative Lass [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/f8e400cca85fa446?dmode=source&amp;hl=en]. Since then a few of them have become parents.

In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 Mid-Term Election]], [[Haiku|Haiku Gorilla]] won a seat as Senator for the "floating" city of Net.ropolis. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/e30331ffc28dafae]

In 2007, the Ultimate Ninja decided to take a vacation which kicked off [http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Infinite_Leadership_Crisis Infinite Leadership Crisis], a storyline in LNH Comics Presents written by nine writers. Every day in April, a different member of the LNH became leader and disappeared. There were 465 days in this Infinite April. The conclusion led to the [http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Beige_Countdown Beige Countdown] series, which counted down to the 2008 event [http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Beige_Midnight Beige Midnight] parodying the concept of never ending comic book events.

===The legion===

The headquarters of the LNH (called LNHHQ or LNHQ) is based in Net.ropolis and houses literally hundreds of members. The ever-expanding and out-of-control roster is one of the key conceits of the Legion. The team does lend itself nicely to several less unwieldy sub-groups.

The LNH are, for the most part, a privately funded but government-sanctioned team, responding to crises both cosmic and mundane; one sub-group, the ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/LNH.Tsk.Force/ TSK Force]'', is chosen to deal with minor annoyances.

Legionnaires (also known as LNHers or LNH'rs) are given free room and board at LNHQ, plus a small allowance for purchases. How one gains membership into the LNH depends on the author writing the story: many stories feature characters rejected by the Legion who go off to form their own teams; other stories, featuring much less powerful characters, find those characters accepted instantly.

====LNHQ====

Like physics and aging in the Looniverse as a whole, the features of LNHQ are mutable depending on who is writing the story. A general-use [http://www.eyrie.org/lnh/lnhq.html floor-plan] is available, and there are a number of features that are generally consistent from interpretation to interpretation:

LNHQ as a building has many unusual properties. For example, its rooms expand to fit the number of people within the room, making for a building that is much larger inside than it appears outside (something akin to a [[TARDIS]].)  It possesses a nearly infinite number of sub-basements (each level identified by an additional "sub", as in, sub-sub-sub-sub-basement) which are host to a number of ghosts, supernatural creatures, [[kiwi]]s, and a species of incredibly stupid bird known as the Oozelfinch.

Not only does LNHQ provide living space for its hundreds of members, but it also contains a multitude of ways for them to pass their downtime. The [[Danger Room|Peril Room]] is a training room akin to those used by many hero teams, fraught with boobytraps and holographic opponents. One of the unique features of the Peril Room is that, [[Bugtown]]-like, one cannot sustain lasting injury within; many stories pit a would-be legionnaire against the Ultimate Ninja in mortal combat: if they last more than a minute before he slices them in twain, then they are granted membership.

The LNH also has a more general-use [[holodeck]] and swimming pool. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/browse_thread/thread/99426c9b82a9fa9f/c1458526d63fc168#c1458526d63fc168 The Hall of Lost Heroes] contains memorials to those who have fallen in battle. The Ultimate Ninja apparently has his own personal [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/2f78e34f0d03b523 garden] for meditation and tea, where he also grows his own supply of [[Maple tree|Ninja bush]].

It has been hinted in some stories that LNHQ is itself [[Sentience|sentient]].[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.creative/msg/fdfc131d60aa8579]

===WCs and NWCs===

The original LNH characters have been designated as ''writer characters'', or ''WCs''. This is because these characters were intended largely as extensions of their authors' personalities; for example, Brian Perler says that he can easily remember useless information, but cannot retain useful facts: thus, he is [[trivia|Obscure Trivia Lad]].

As the stories became more sophisticated, a number of ''non-writer characters'', or ''NWCs'', were created. Many LNH authors still have a character that serves as an [[author surrogate]], but by-and-large the distinction between WCs and NWCs has blurred.

Some characters are owned by their creators or other writers; others are free for use by any writer.

===The cast===

Because the LNH is so large, to list all of its members in this article would be nearly impossible. What follows are a half-dozen characters whose names and concepts are the most essentially LNH-like.

* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Ultimate_Ninja Ultimate Ninja]'': the leader of the LNH, he possesses any ability that is construed as being oriental in nature. He is a master martial artist, a stern but effective leader, and uses maple seeds (or "Ninja Bush") to propel himself into a deadly rage. Part of the tension in the character is that, at any moment, at the drop of a hat, he could kill the entire Legion.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Cannon_Fodder Cannon Fodder]'': possessing the ability to be [[comic book death|killed]], only to appear again in the next issue; no matter where he is killed, he always regenerates within the Peril Room.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Catalyst_Lass Catalyst Lass]'': one of the Ninja's most trusted deputies, Cat possesses the ability to convince others to share her interests (thus being the [[catalyst]] for new hobbies and opinions). How she does this, and her general personality, is a point of contention: some authors write her as being very domineering, others as very sexy (or, for that matter, ditzy and frivolous), while some try to integrate all these various ideas.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Kid_Recap Kid Recap]'': possessing the uncanny ability to [[wikt:recapitulate|recap]] what happened in previous stories.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Master_Blaster Master Blaster]'': a [[chauvinist]] [[pig]] who uses "Mack Daddy Vibes" to seduce unsuspecting women. He is often seen using a large gun and spouting ridiculous opinions. His sexism has mellowed somewhat since his marriage to Sister State-the-Obvious, who—obviously—has the ability to state that which is obvious.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/CAPTAIN_CAPITALIZE CAPTAIN CAPITALIZE]'': he speaks only in capital letters; this is a reference to bad [[netiquette]].
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/Kid_Kirby Kid Kirby]'': a cosmic being with many untold cosmic powers and infallible wisdom, including the ability to be the tallest person in the room. These are derived from the [[Jack Kirby|Power Kirby]]. He also has an army of Kirbybots who often take his place in stories.

With the exception of Kid Kirby, all these characters occupy the large pool of characters who can be used freely by any writer, a possible reason for their popularity and the universe's general longevity.

==Evolution==

The LNH is not only a parody universe: over the last fourteen years, it has been expanded upon to include a number of stories, characters, tones, and spin-offs.

===Series===

Among the most acclaimed of the LNH canon are:

* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Aeneas/ Aeneas and Ferris]'': K. M. Wilcox's elegiac and mysterious series chronicles the strange friendship of housemates [[Aeneas]] Boddy (an immortal net.villain) and Ferris "[[Sherlock Holmes|Deductive Logic Man]]" Jones (a member of the LNH).
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Alt.Riders/ Alt. Riders]'': Jamas Enright's straight superhero adventure series follows a team under the leadership of the mysterious and ruthless Agent. The Alt. Riders seek to assess and, if necessary, intercept, possible dangers to the Looniverse before they become a problem.

[[File:DF100.gif|thumb|220px|Dvandom Force, as drawn by the author, Dave Van Domelen.]]

* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Dvandom.Force/ Dvandom Force]'': Dave Van Domelen's series is a mixture of high drama, political intrigue, and [[anime]]-based parody. Probably one of the most admired series on RACC, it ended its run with issue # 100.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Easily-Discovered/ Easily-Discovered Man]'': Rob Rogers's series follows the green glowing radioactive net.hero, Professor Theodore Wong, who has the ability to be easily discovered. The series, narrated by his sidekick, Easily-Discovered Man Lite, is goofy but more character and situation-based than parody.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Limp-Asparagus.Lad/ Limp-Asparagus Lad]'': Saxon Brenton's series starring the man with the powers and personality of limp [[asparagus]]. Like Martin Phipps in ''LNH'', Brenton often addresses meta-fictional themes in this chronically late series.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/LNH/ LNH]'': One of the flagship titles of the LNH, it is one of the sillier series. Writer Martin Phipps often uses this series (and his other stories) to explore metafictional conceits, such as the relationship between an author and his fiction. The series was relaunched in 2005 as ''Legion of Net.Heroes Vol. 2'', written by multiple authors.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/LNH.Triple.Play/ LNH Triple Play]'': Joltin' Jeff McCoskey wrote this series, featuring "three-way team-ups" between superheroes. The comedy in the series was often gentle and character-based; it is also notable for giving deeper characterizations to one-note characters, such as Self-Righteous Preacher.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Misfits/ Misfits]'': Jennifer Whiston's dark, turbulent and emotional melodrama charts the supernatural adventures of Brittany, Payton, and Savannah: the Misfits.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Saviors.NET/ Saviors of the Net]'': One of the most successful examples of a cascade story—a sort of [[Round-robin story|round-robin]] style of fiction writing, only without any pre-planning or set order for authors to write in—this parody of [[Grant Morrison|Morrison's]] [[JLA (comic book)|JLA]] and [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek's]] [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] introduces a rival group of heroes who create a god-like being called The Mechanical Author in order to bring about a painless, utopian society. The Author took control of the Looniverse for a couple of years, although the LNH was completely unaware of this until the end of another cascade, ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Mutton.Mania/ Mutton Mania]''.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Tales.LNH/ Tales of the LNH]'': Hubert Bartel's Panta walked a delicate line between extremes of sexiness, innocence, and violence, making her an extremely popular character, even after Bartels erased her from existence.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Series/Writers.Block/ Writer's Block Woman (and Mouse)]'': Jessica Ihimaera-Smiler's comedy series follows overly enthusiastic net.heroine Writer's Block Woman and her wise-cracking daughter-cum-sidekick, Mouse.

===Spin-off imprints===

* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/ntb/ The Net. Trenchcoat Brigrade]'': The NTB was the first and probably the most significant of all the LNH spin-offs. Like the LNH it sprang to life from a cascade [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.misc/browse_frm/thread/c54bceec368d1ac9/d6b3154900b94a83?lnk=st&amp;q=group%3Arec.arts.comics.misc+insubject%3ANet.Trenchcoat.Brigade&amp;rnum=2&amp;hl=en#d6b3154900b94a83]. The NTB consists of a bunch of trenchcoat wearing, chain-smoking bastards that are constantly manipulating people.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/PULP/ The PULP Imprint]'': Jeff McCoskey created the [[Pulp magazine|PULP]] Imprint to tell Pulp Fiction type tales set in the LNH's past.  ''Agents of the Pulp'' is the flagship title of the imprint. It eventually expanded into telling stories beyond the scope of the LNH Imprint.
* ''The LNH-Men Universe'': Jeff McCoskey wrote an acclaimed series called ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Miniseries/Golden.LNH-Men/ The Golden LNH-Men]'' which put a revamped version of the LNH into a dark grim and gritty [[Watchmen]] like Universe. Peter "Tick" Milan and Matthew "Badger" Rossi wrote a sequel to it called ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh/Miniseries/LNH-Men.Silver.Age/ LNH-Men: The Silver Age]''.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lofh/ League of Heroes]'': This was an imprint created by Ben Rawluk to tell stories set in an alternate universe called Earth B. This universe has been destroyed.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/osd/ The Order of St. Doomas]'': This is a group of vigilantes that roams the Net hunting down [[Spam (electronic)|sphammers]]. After rec.arts.comics.creative became moderated this imprint pretty much died down.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/misc/RACCCafe/ The RACCCafe]'': Not really a spin-off, but an out-of-continuity café where LNHers hang out along with other characters from the variety of RACC Imprints. It tends to be dominated by LNH characters though.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnh2/ The LNH2 Imprint]'': An imprint created by Martin Phipps set in a possible LNH future.
* ''[http://archives.eyrie.org/racc/lnhy/ The LNHY Imprint]'': An imprint created by Arthur Spitzer involving stories set in the Looniverse Y universe. Unlike the Classic Looniverse, each writer in this universe is allowed to have only one character in the LNH.
* ''[http://www.lnhq.info/wiki/LNH20 The LNH20 Imprint]'' An imprint created by several LNH Writers to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the LNH.

==Significance and legacy==

With well over a thousand stories posted by over a hundred authors, the LNH is the predominant Usenet-based shared writing universe, and the most active of all the rec.arts.comics.creative universes. In May 1994, the estimated readership of alt.comics.lnh was 45,000. [http://groups.google.com/group/news.lists/msg/cd0de35a4261ae7e?dmode=source&amp;hl=en]  The LNH has had writers from places as diverse as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], the [[Philippines]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] write for it. It is an "open universe"—— meaning that anyone can join, providing they abide by basic netiquette and respect the intellectual property of others [http://www.eyrie.org/lnh/faq.html]—— and this openness is probably a key part of its continued life.

{{cquote|There will always be an LNH. Period. Even if all the current writers disappear in a poof of light, some wandering group of weirdos will come and look over the remnants of RACC, see what the LNH was, and rebuild it all over again.|30|30|Chad Imbrogno, December 18, 1997}}

'''Nico Ditch''' is a six-mile (9.7&amp;nbsp;km) long linear [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] between [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Stretford]] in Greater Manchester, England. It was dug as a defensive fortification, or possibly a boundary marker, between the 5th and 11th centuries.

The ditch is still visible in short sections, such as a {{convert|330|yard|adj=on}} stretch in [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] Golf Course. In the parts which survive, the ditch is {{convert|4–5|yards}} wide and up to {{convert|5|feet}} deep. Part of the earthwork is protected as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].

==Etymology==
The earliest documented reference to the ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in [[Audenshaw]] to the monks of the [[Kersal|Kersal Cell]]. In the document, dating from 1190&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1212, the ditch is referred to as "Mykelldiche", and a ''magnum fossatum'', Latin for "large ditch".&lt;ref name="N92 78"/&gt;&lt;!--depending on the context, it might be "THE large ditch", as Latin has no definite article--&gt;

The name Nico (sometimes Nikker) for the ditch became established in the 19th and 20th centuries. It may have been derived from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[Nickar|Hnickar]]'', a water spirit who seized and drowned unwary travellers, but the modern name is most likely a corruption of the name Mykelldiche and its variations, as the Anglo-Saxon word ''micel'' meant "big" or "great", harking back to the early 13th century description of the ditch as ''magnum fossatum''.&lt;ref name="N92 78"/&gt; An alternative derivation is that Nico comes from ''nǽcan'', an Anglo-Saxon verb meaning "kill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bosworthandtoller.com/read.htm?page_nr=706 |author=Based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth, D.D.

Nico Ditch stretches {{convert|6|mi|abbr=on}} between Ashton Moss ({{gbmapping|SJ909980}}) in Ashton-under-Lyne and Hough Moss ({{gbmapping|SJ82819491}}), just east of [[Stretford]].&lt;ref name="Lands and Lordships"&gt;Nevell (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; It passes through [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]], [[Reddish]], [[Gorton]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Burnage]], [[Rusholme]], [[Platt Fields Park]] in [[Fallowfield]], [[Withington]] and [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], crossing four [[metropolitan borough]]s of present-day [[Greater Manchester]]. The ditch coincides with the boundaries between the boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]] and [[Manchester]], and between Tameside and Manchester as far as Denton golf course. A section is now beneath the [[Audenshaw Reservoirs]], which were built towards the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The ditch may have extended west beyond Stretford, to [[Urmston]] ({{gbmapping|SJ78299504}}).&lt;ref name="N92 78"&gt;Nevell (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nico Ditch in Greater Manchester.png|thumb|right|Approximate course of Nico Ditch, shown in red. It may have extended further to the west than indicated, after a gap necessitated by mossland in its path.{{Attached KML}}]]
The earthwork was constructed some time between the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in the early 5th century and the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist [[Anglo-Saxons]], or it may have been a late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref name="N 92 83"&gt;Nevell (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early medieval]] period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and [[Wessex]] struggled for control over [[North West England]],&lt;ref&gt;Hylton (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] and the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;82&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend has it that Nico Ditch was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869–870; Manchester may have been [[looting|sacked]] by the Danes in 870.&lt;ref&gt;Hylton (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that each man had an allocated area to construct, and was required to dig his section of the ditch and build a bank equal to his own height.&lt;ref name="N 92 83"/&gt; According to 19th century folklore, the ditch was the site of a battle between [[Saxons]] and Danes; the battle was supposed to have given the nearby towns of Gorton and Reddish their names, from "Gore Town" and "Red-Ditch",&lt;ref&gt;Booker (1857), p.&amp;nbsp;197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harland &amp; Wilkinson (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; but the idea has been dismissed by historians as a "popular fancy".&lt;ref&gt;Farrer &amp; Brownbill (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;279.&lt;/ref&gt; The names derive from "dirty farmstead" and "reedy ditch" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2008/08/01/010808_nico_ditch_feature.shtml |title=A ditch in time |publisher=BBC |date=1 August 2008}} Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antiquarian]]s and historians have been interested in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank to the north of the ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary.&lt;ref name="Lands and Lordships"/&gt; The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Despite heavy weathering, the ditch is still visible in short sections, which can be {{convert|4-5|yards}} wide and up to {{convert|5|feet}} deep. A {{convert|330|yard|adj=on}} stretch through [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] Golf Course, and a section running through [[Platt Fields Park]], are considered the best preserved remains.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (2008), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a {{convert|150|yard|adj=on}} segment of the ditch in Platt Fields was protected as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.&lt;ref name="Nico Ditch"&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=1033812 |mname=Nico Ditch|accessdate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[entertainment industry]], a '''one-sheet''' or '''one sheet''' is a single document that summarizes a product for [[publicity]] and sales.

== Cinema ==
A one sheet is a specific size (typically {{convert|27|×|41|in|cm}} before 1985; {{convert|27|×|40|in|cm}} after 1985) of film poster advertising. Multiple one-sheets are used to assemble larger advertisements, which are referred to by their sheet count, including 24-sheet&lt;ref name="24-sheets"&gt;{{cite news
  | first = Randy
  | last = Schueller
  | url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Billboard.html
  | title = How Billboard Is Made
  | publisher = How Products Are Made
  | date = July 26, 2007
  | accessdate = 2007-07-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s, and 30-sheet billboards. The term is also used as synonym for the [[poster art]]work and the [[film poster]] itself.&lt;ref name="EW-Miller"&gt;{{cite news
  | first = Nancy
  | last = Miller
  | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,264510,00.html
  | title = One-Sheet Wonders
  | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]]
  | date = June 28, 2002
  | accessdate = 2007-01-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since a one-sheet is used in the official advertising for films, they are prized by both collectors of [[memorabilia]] for specific films and of film posters themselves. Film posters sold in general retail are in poster size, {{convert|24|×|36|in|cm}}. Prior to 1985, the majority of film posters sent to cinemas were folded before mailing and, on rare occasions, they were instead rolled and shipped in tubes. While today there are several ways to eliminate these fold lines, many purists prefer film posters in their used condition.

== Music ==
In music publicity and distribution, a one-sheet is exactly what the name implies:  One sheet of [[paper]], on which information is provided about the musician and/or a specific [[release (music)|release]] which is being distributed.  One-sheets often accompany a [[Gramophone record|record]] or [[Compact Disc|CD]] when it is being shipped to [[radio station]]s and music publications (i.e., [[magazine]]s, [[Internet forum|Web-based forums]], etc.)  A one-sheet is sometimes also referred to as a press sheet or a promo sheet.

=== Layout and content ===
Depending on the purpose it serves, a one-sheet will often contain a variety of information about its subject. Often comprising both images and text, one-sheets typically serve as a way to introduce the unfamiliar reader to a particular artist.  The name of the artist (and perhaps the title of the release) will appear prominently. Some common elements found on a one-sheet can include:

* Logo
* [[Biography|Biographical information]]
* Photograph(s) of the artist

[[Oriental carpet|Carpets]] of [[Middle-Eastern]] origin, either from [[Turkish carpet|Anatolia]], [[Persian carpet|Persia]], [[Armenian carpet|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijan]], the [[Levant]], the [[Mamluk]] state of [[Egypt]] or [[Northern Africa]], were used as decorative features in Western European [[paintings]] from the 14th century onwards. More depictions of '''Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting''' survive than actual carpets produced before the 17th century, though the number of these known has increased in recent decades. Therefore, comparative art-historical research has from its onset in the late 19th century relied on carpets represented in datable European paintings.

== Art historical background ==
[[File:Petrus Christus Virgin and Child Detail.jpg|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]], Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis (detail), 1457, with a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] depiction of a pile-woven carpet. [[Städel]] Museum, Frankfurt]]

Activities of scientists and collectors beginning in the late 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of carpet weaving. This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of art historical and cultural knowledge.

The tradition of precise realism among Western painters of the late 15th and 16th century provides pictorial material which is often detailed enough to justify conclusions about even minute details of the painted carpet. The carpets are treated with exceptional care in the rendering of colors, patterns, and details of form and design: The painted texture of a carpet depicted in [[Petrus Christus]]'s "Virgin and Child", the drawing of the individual patterns and motifs, and the way the pile opens where the carpet is folded over the steps, all suggest that the depicted textile is a pile-woven carpet.

Visually, the carpets serve to draw attention either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel with the development of Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out on the carpets. Later on, the carpets were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental carpets appeared on the portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay less attention to detail.

The richly designed Oriental carpets appealed strongly to Western painters. The rich and various colours may have influenced the great Venetian painters of the [[Quattrocento]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the pictorial representation of carpets is linked to the development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bier|first1=Carol|title=From grid to projected grid: Oriental carpets and the development of linear perspective.|journal=Proceedings of the Textile Society of America - 12th Biennal Symposium|date=2010|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=tsaconf|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first described by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberti|first1=Leon Battista|editor1-last=Sinisgalli|editor1-first=Rocco|title=On painting : a new translation and critical edition|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107000629|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of oriental carpets in Renaissance paintings is regarded as an important contribution to a "world history of art", based upon interactions of different cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=A world art history and its objects|date=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=978-0271034157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs from the Islamic world arrived in large numbers in Western Europe by the 15th century, which is increasingly recognized as a pivotal temporal nexus in the cultural encounters that contributed to the development of Renaissance ideas, arts, and sciences. Intensified contacts, especially the increasing trade between the Islamic world and Western Europe, have provided material sources and cultural [[Islamic influences on Christian art|influences]] to Western artists during the next centuries to come. In turn, European market demands also affected the carpet production in their countries of origin.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;

== Origin and limitations of the comparative approach ==

In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets for lack of material, because ancient oriental carpets were not yet collected at the time when he worked on his book.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving, and was further elaborated and expanded mainly by scholars of the "Berlin school" of History of [[Islamic art]]: [[Wilhelm von Bode]], and his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] developed the ''"[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]"'' method for the dating of oriental carpets based on Renaissance paintings.

These art historians were also aware of the fact that their scientific approach was biased: Only carpets produced by manufactories were exported to Western Europe, and consequently were available to the Renaissance artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erdmann |first1=Kurt |title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K. Erdmann |date=1977 |publisher=Oguz Pr. |location=London |isbn=9780905820026 |edition=1977 English ed. of the original, 1957 German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village or nomadic rugs did not reach Europe during the Renaissance, and were not depicted in paintings. Not until the mid twentieth century, when collectors like Joseph V. McMullan or [[James F. Ballard]] recognized the artistic and art historic value of village or nomadic carpets, were they appreciated in the Western World.

Pile carpets with geometric design are known to have been produced from the 13th century among the [[Seljuks of Rum]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], whom [[Venice]] had had commercial relations since 1220.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.74"&gt;Mack, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Medieval trader and traveler [[Marco Polo]] himself mentioned that the carpets produced at [[Konya]] were the best in the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Carpets were also produced in [[Al Andaluz|Islamic Spain]], and one is shown in a fresco of the 1340s in the [[Palais des Papes]], [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of carpets in 15th- and 16th-century paintings are either from the [[Ottoman Empire]], or possibly European copies of these types from the [[Balkans]], Spain, or elsewhere.  In fact these were not the finest Islamic carpets of the period, and few of the top-quality Turkish "court" carpets are seen.  Even finer than these, [[Persian carpet]]s do not appear until the end of the 16th century, but become increasingly popular among the very wealthy in the 17th century.  The very refined [[Mamluk]] carpets from [[Egypt]] are occasionally seen, mostly in [[Venice|Venetian]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of an oriental carpet in a European painting is [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Saint Louis of Toulouse Crowning Robert of Anjou, King of Naples'', painted in 1316-1319.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.74-75. [[:File:1s louis21.jpg|Image]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Anatolian animal carpet appears in a c. 1340-45 Sienese panel of the Holy Family attributed to Pietro or Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Abegg-Stiftung, Riggisberg) with alternating black and white animals within colorful octagonal medallions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, S. Maureen, 'Mary with Her Spools of Thread: Domesticating the Sacred Interior in Tuscan Trecento Art,' in John Garton and Diane Wolfthal, eds., ''New Studies on Old Masters: Essays in Renaissance Art in Honour of Colin Eisler'', Toronto: Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2011, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; European depictions of Oriental carpets were extremely faithful to the originals, judging by comparison with the few surviving examples of actual rugs of contemporary date.  Their larger scale also allows more detailed and accurate depictions than those shown in miniature paintings from Turkey or Persia.

Most carpets use [[Islamic art|Islamic]] geometric designs, with the earliest ones also using animal patterns such as the originally Chinese-inspired "phoenix-and-dragon", as in [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s ''[[:File:Domenico di Bartolo The Marriage of the Foundlings 1440.jpg|Marriage of the Foundlings]]'' (1440).  These had been stylised and simplified into near-geometric motifs in their transmission to the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.75. King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 13, and 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole group, referred to in the literature as "[[Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Animal rugs]]" disappeared from paintings by about the end of the 15th century.  Only a handful of original animal-pattern carpets survive, two from European churches, where their rarity presumably preserved them.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Marby Rug", one of the finest examples, was preserved in a church of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] town of Marby, and a bold adaptation of an originally Chinese "dragon and phoenix" motif is in Berlin. Both are rugs, less than 2 metres long, and about 1 metre wide, with two compartments, though the Berlin carpet lacks a border down one long side.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

Although the carpets were displayed on a public floor in a few examples, most carpets on the floor are in an area reserved for the main protagonists, very often on a dais or in front of an altar, or down steps in front of the [[Virgin Mary]] or [[Saints]], or rulers,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; in the manner of a modern [[red carpet]].  This presumably reflected the contemporary practice of royalty; in [[Denmark]] the 16th century Persian [[Coronation Carpet]] is used under the throne for coronations to this day.  They are also often hung over [[balustrade]]s or out of windows for festive occasions, such as the processions through Venice shown by [[Vittore Carpaccio]] or [[Gentile Bellini]] (see gallery);&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; when Carpaccio's [[St Ursula]] embarks they are hung over the sides of boats and footbridges.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Vittore Carpaccio 045.jpg|Carpaccio image]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental carpets were often depicted as a decorative element in religious scenes, and were a symbol of luxury, status and taste,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.73-93&lt;/ref&gt; although they were becoming more widely available throughout the period, which is reflected in the paintings. In some cases, such as paintings by Gentile Bellini, the carpets reflect an early [[orientalism|Orientalist]] interest, but for most painters they merely reflect the prestige of the carpets in Europe.  A typical example is the Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary in the 1456-1459 [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 028.jpg|see detail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-royal portrait sitters were more likely to place their carpet on a table or other piece of furniture, especially in Northern Europe, though small rugs beside a bed are not uncommon, as in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' of 1434.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpets are seen on tables in particular in Italian scenes showing the ''Calling of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]'', when he was engaged in his work as a tax-collector,&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the life of [[Saint Eligius]], who was a [[goldsmith]].  Both are shown sitting doing business at a carpet-covered table or shop counter.
 
The Oriental carpets used in Renaissance painting had various geographical origins, designated in contemporary Italy by different names: the ''cagiarini'' (Mamluk design from Egypt), the ''damaschini'' ([[Damascus]] region), the ''barbareschi'' (North Africa), the ''rhodioti'' (probably imported through Rome), the ''turcheschi'' ([[Ottoman Empire]]) and the ''simiscasa'' ([[Circassians|Circassian]] or [[Caucasus|Caucasian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prayer carpets represented in Christian religious paintings are also Islamic [[prayer mats]], with such motifs as the [[mihrab]] or the [[Kaaba]] (the so-called re-entrant carpets, later called the "Bellini" type).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.84. King &amp; Sylvester, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of such prayer rugs disappeared after 1555, probably as a consequence of the realization of their religious meaning and connection to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of Oriental carpets in paintings other than portraits generally declined after the 1540s, corresponding to a decline in the taste for highly detailed representation of objects (Detailism) among painters,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; and grander classicising surrounds for hieratic religious images.

When Western scholars explored the history of Islamic carpetmaking, several types of carpet pattern became conventionally called after the names of European painters who had used them, and these terms remain in use.  The classification is mostly that of [[Kurt Erdmann]], once Director of the [[Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)]], and the leading carpet scholar of his day.  Some of these types ceased to be produced several centuries ago, and the location of their production remains uncertain, so obvious alternative terms were not available.  The classification ignores the border patterns, and distinguishes between the type, size and arrangement of [[gul (design)|gul]], or larger motifs in the central field of the carpet.  In addition to four types of Holbein carpets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period3.html Old Turkish carpets] website&lt;/ref&gt; there are Bellini carpets, Crivellis, Memlings, and [[Lotto carpet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester&lt;/ref&gt;  These names are somewhat random: many artists painted these types, and single artists often painted many types of carpets.

===Bellini carpets===
Both [[Giovanni Bellini]] and his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]] (who visited [[Istanbul]] in 1479) painted examples of these prayer-rugs with a single "re-entrant" or keyhole motif at the bottom of a larger figure traced in a thin border.  At the top end the borders close diagonally to a point, from which hangs down a "lamp".  The design had Islamic significance, and its function seems to have been recognised in Europe, as they were known in English as "musket" carpets, a corruption of "mosque".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 14-16, 56, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Gentile Bellini seen at top the rug is the "right" way round; often this is not the case.  Later Ushak prayer-rugs where both ends have the diagonal pointed inner border, as at the top only of Bellini rugs, are sometimes known as [[Tintoretto]] rugs, though this term is not as commonly used as the others mentioned here.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crivelli carpets===
[[Carlo Crivelli]] twice painted what seems to be the same small rug, with the centre taken up with a complex sixteen-pointed star motif made up of several compartments in different colours, some containing highly stylised animal motifs. Comparable actual carpets are extremely rare, but there are two in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;One shown [http://www.turkotek.com/misc_00021/hash_gul.htm here], about a third of the way down the page.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt shows it at the top, and the same carpet seems to be used in the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] (1486), which shows the type hung over a balcony to the top left, and a different type of carpet over another balcony in the right foreground.  These seem to be a transitional type between the early animal-pattern carpets and later purely geometrical designs, such as the Holbein types, perhaps reflecting increased [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] enforcement of Islamic [[aniconism]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 14, 26, 57-58. Campbell, p. 189.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work National Gallery zoomable image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507124425/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work |date=2009-05-07 }}. There is a different type of carpet hung from the Virgin's house, at top center-right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memling carpets===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = Left image: yellow Oriental carpet in [[Hans Memling]] altarpiece of 1488-1490. The "hooked" motif defines a "Memling carpet".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;br&gt; Right image: [[Konya]] 18th century carpet with Memling gul design.| footer_align = left | image1 =Hans Memling La Vierge et l Enfant entre Saint Jacques et Saint Dominique 1488 1490.jpg| width1 = 265 | caption1  = | image2 =Konya 18th carpet with Memling gul design.jpg| width2 = 112 | caption2 = }} 
These are named after [[Hans Memling]], who painted several examples of what may have been [[Armenian carpet]]s in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and are characterised by several lines coming off the motifs that end in "hooks", by coiling in on themselves through two or three 90° turns.  Another example appears in a miniature painted for [[René of Anjou]] about 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Richardson, ''Plague, Weather, and Wool'', AuthorHouse, 2009, p.182(344), {{ISBN|1-4389-5187-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4389-5187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holbein carpets===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = Left image: Unknown painter, The [[Somerset House Conference (painting)|Somerset House Conference]], with a small-pattern Holbein carpet.&lt;br&gt; Right image: Small-pattern Holbein carpet, [[Anatolia]], 16th century.| footer_align = left | image1 =The Somerset House Conference 19 August 1604.jpg| width1 = 280 | caption1  = | image2 =Small pattern Holbein carpet Anatolia 16th century.jpg| width2 = 110 | caption2 = }}

{{main|Holbein carpet}}
These in fact are seen in paintings from many decades earlier than [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], and are sub-divided into four types (of which Holbein actually only painted two); they are the commonest designs of [[Anatolia]]n carpet seen in Western Renaissance paintings, and continued to be produced for a long period.  All are purely geometric and use a variety of arrangements of [[lozenge]]s, crosses and octagonal motifs within the main field. The sub-divisions are between:&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 26-27, 52-57. Campbell, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type I: Small-pattern Holbein. This type is defined by an infinite repeat of small patterns, with alternating rows of octagons and staggered rows of diamonds, as seen in Holbein the Younger's ''Portrait of [[Georg Giese|Georg Gisze]]'' (1532), or the [[Somerset House Conference (painting)|Somerset House Conference]] (1608).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets], see also last note.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Erdmann| first1=Kurt| title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. = Oriental Carpets: An Essay on their History. tr.

*Type III: Large-pattern Holbein. The motifs in the field inside the border consist of one or two large squares filled with octagons, placed regularly, and separated from each other and from the borders by narrow stripes. There are no secondary "[[Gul (design)|gul]]" motifs.

These were previously known as "small-pattern Holbein Type II", but he never painted one, unlike [[Lorenzo Lotto]], who did so several times, though he was not the first artist to show them.  Lotto is also documented as owning a large carpet, though its pattern is unknown.  They were primarily produced during the 16th and 17th centuries along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] of [[Anatolia|Anatolia, Turkey]], but also copied in various parts of Europe, including Spain, England and Italy.  They are characterized by a lacy [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], usually in yellow on a red ground, often with blue details.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they look very different from Holbein Type I carpets, they are a development of the type, where the edges of the motifs, nearly always in yellow on a red ground, take off in rigid [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s somewhat suggesting foliage, and terminating in branched [[palmette]]s.  The type was common and long-lasting, and is also known as "Arabesque [[Ushak]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cambell, p. 189. [http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets. Type II Holbein or "Lotto" Carpets].  King and Sylvester, pp. 16, 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

To judge from paintings, they reached Italy by 1516, Portugal about a decade later, and reached northern Europe, including England, by the 1560s. They continue to appear in paintings until about the 1660s, especially in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"/&gt;

=== Ghirlandaio carpets ===

A carpet closely related to the 1483 painting by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] was found by A. Boralevi in the Evangelical church, Hâlchiu (Heldsdorf) in [[Transylvania]], attributed to Western Anatolia, and dated to the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="15th century Ghirlandaio Rug"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Transsylvanian Tale|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/HALI137.pdf|website=www.transsylvanian rug|publisher=HALI 137, 53|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general design of the Ghirlandaio type, as in the 1486 painting, is related to Holbein Type 1. It is defined by one or two central medallions of diamond shape, consisting of an octagon within a square, from whose sides triangular, curvilinear patterns arise. Carpets with this medallion have been woven in the Western [[Anatolia]]n region of [[Çanakkale]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|pages=59–65|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet fragment with a Ghirlandaio medallion was found in the [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği Great Mosque]], and dated to the 16th century.

In his essay on "Centralized Designs", Thompson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the central medallion pattern of oriental carpets to the "lotus pedestal" and "cloud collar (yun chien)" motifs, used in [[Buddhist art|the art of Buddhist Asia]]. The origin of the design thus dates back to pre-Islamic times, probably [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan time]] China. Brüggemann and Boehmer further elaborate that it might have been introduced to Western Anatolia by the Seljuk, or Mongol invaders in the 11th or 13th century.&lt;ref name="Brüggemann/Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann,|first1=Werner|last2=Boehmer|first2=Harald|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|pages=60–78|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the manifold variation of patterns seen in other carpet types, the Ghirlandaio medallion design has remained largely unaltered from the 15th to the 21st century, and thus exemplifies an unusual continuity of a woven carpet design within a specific region.

=== Van Eyck and Petrus Christus: Painted carpets without surviving counterparts ===

The Netherlandish painters [[Jan van Eyck]], in his [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]], 'Lucca Madonna", and the [[Dresden Triptych]], and [[Petrus Christus]] in his "Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis" have painted four different carpets, three of them of a similar design. By the [[Realism (art)|realism]] of the depictions, these are pile-woven carpets. No directly comparable carpets have survived.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] could be traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar, but not identical carpets appear in the "Lucca Madonna", Dresden triptych, and "Virgin with Child and Saints" paintings which show a predominantly geometric design with a lozenge composition in infinite repeat, built up from fine bands which connect eight-pointed stars. Yetkin has identified an Anatolian carpet with a similar, but more advanced lozenge design (Yetkin, 1981, plate 47&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt; in the [[Mevlana Museum]], Konya, dated to the 17th century. She relates these carpets to 19th century Caucasian "Dragon" rugs with a similar lozenge design (p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;), and claims that carpets of a type as depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus are early Anatolian forerunners to the later Caucasian design.

The main borders of the carpets in the "Paele" and "Lucca Madonna", as well as in "Virgin with Child and Saints" however, each show a non-Oriental undulating trefoil stem.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"&gt;Ydema, 1991, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ornaments can be found in the borders of many carpets in Netherlandish paintings from the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt; The fringes of these carpets are often found at the sides of the painted carpets, not at the upper and lower ends. Either did the carpets have an uncommonly square shape, or maybe the artists have used some license and improvised with the authentic models. Alternatively, the carpets depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus could be of Western European manufacture. The undulating trefoil (clover) design is a well-known feature of Western Gothic ornament.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt;

== Specific carpet types ==

=== Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene carpets ===

From the middle of the 15th century onwards, a type of carpet was produced in Egypt which is characterized by a dominant central medallion, or three to five medallions in a row along the vertical axis. Numerous smaller ornaments are placed around the medallions, such as eight-pointed stars, or small ornaments composed of stylized floral elements.  The innumerable small geometric and floral ornaments give a kaleidoscopic impression. Sixty of these carpets were given to the English cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] in exchange for a license for Venetian merchants to import wine to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Oriental Rugs|date=1972|publisher=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection|location=Castagnola|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known painting representing a Mamluk carpet is Giovanni Bellinis "Portrait of the Doge of Venice Loredan and his four advisers" from 1507. A French master depicted "The Three De Coligny brothers" in 1555. Another representation can be found on Ambrosius Frankens "The Last Supper", about 1570. The large medallion is depicted in a way that it forms the nimbus of the head of Christ. The characteristic mamluk carpet ornaments are clearly visible. Ydema has documented a total of 16 dateable representations of Mamluk carpets.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1517 Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. After the conquest, the Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt into the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet of the Ottoman Cairene type is depicted in Ludovicus Finsonius' painting "The Annunciation". Its border design and guard borders are the same as a carpet in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; A similar carpet has been depicted by Adriaen van der Venne in "Geckie met de Kous", 1630. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]s "Christ in the House of Mary and Martha", 1628, shows the characteristic S-stems ending in double sickle-shaped lancet leaves. Various carpets of the Ottoman Cairene type are depicted in [[Moretto da Brescia]]s frescoes in the "Sala delle Dame" at the [[Palazzo Salvadego]] in Brescia, Italy.

=== "Chequerboard"- or Compartment carpets from the 17. century ===

An extremely rare group of carpets, "chequerboard" carpets were assumed to be a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a star pattern. All "chequerboard" carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are "S-spun" and "Z-twisted" and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to [[Damascus]]. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Franses|first2=Michael|title=East mediterranean carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=4|issue=1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current dating of the chequerboard carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the "chequerboard" type are depicted on [[Pietro Paolini]]s (1603−1681) "''Self portrait''", as well as on [[Gabriël Metsu]]s painting "''The musical party''".

=== Large Ushak (star and medallion) carpets ===
In contrast to the relatively large number of surviving carpets of this type, relatively few of them are represented in Renaissance paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star Ushak''' carpets were often woven in large formats. As such, they represent a typical product of higher organized, town manufacture. They are characterized by large dark blue star shaped primary medallions in infinite repeat on a red ground field containing a secondary floral scroll. The design was likely influenced by northwest Persian book design, or by Persian carpet medallions.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Ushak, Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/451471|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to the medallion Ushak carpets, the concept of the infinite repeat in star Ushak carpets is more accentuated and in keeping with the early Turkish design tradition.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak - Turkish design"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tapis - Present de l'orient a l'occident|date=1989|publisher=L'Institut du Monde Arabe|location=Paris|isbn=9782906062283|page=4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their strong allusion to the inifinite repeat, the star Ushak design can be used on carpets of various size and in many varying dimensions.

'''Medallion Ushak''' carpets usually have a red or blue field decorated with a floral trellis or leaf tendrils, ovoid primary medallions alternating with smaller eight-lobed stars, or lobed medallions, intertwined with floral tracery. Their border frequently contains palmettes on a floral and leaf scroll, and pseudo-kufic characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medallion Ushak carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/445311|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known representation of a Medallion Ushak was painted in 1656 by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] in his painting [[The Procuress (Vermeer)|"The Procuress"]]. It is placed horizontally; the upper or lower end with the star-shaped corner medallion can be seen. Under the woman's hand which holds the glass, a part of a characteristic Ushak medallion can be seen. The carpet seen on Vermeer's "Music lesson", "Girl reading a letter at an open window", and "The Concert" hardly show any differences in the details of the design or the weaving structure indicate that all three pictures might trace back to one single carpet Vermeer might have had at his studio. The painings by Vermeer, Steen, and Verkolje depict a special type of Ushak carpet of which no surviving counterpart is known. It is characterized by its rather sombre colours, coarse weaving, and patterns with a more degenerated curvilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 39–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpets remained an important way of enlivening the background of full-length portraits throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, for example in the English portraits of [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The finely-knotted silk carpets woven in the time of [[Shah Abbas I]] at [[Kashan]] and [[Isfahan]] are rarely represented in paintings, as they were doubtless very unusual in European homes;&lt;ref&gt;Examples in Polish collections led to their being miscalled "Polish carpets" in the 19th century, a misnomer that has stuck: "representations of 'Polish' silk rugs in paintings are rare" report Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''A Lady playing the Theorbo''. by [[Gerard Terborch]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],  14.40.617) shows such a carpet laid upon the table on which the lady's cavalier is sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Dimand and Jean Mailey, ''Oriental Rugs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' p. 60, fig.83.&lt;/ref&gt; Floral "Isfahan" carpets of the [[Herat]] type, on the other hand, were exported in great numbers to Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, and are often represented in interiors painted by Velásquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Vermeer, Terborch, de Hooch, Bol and Metsu, where the dates established for the paintings provide a yardstick for establishing the chronology of the designs.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand and Mailey 1973, p 67, illustrating floral Herat rugs in  ''A Visit to the Nursery'' by [[Gabriel Metsu]] (Metropolitan Museum of Art,  17.190.20), p. 67,fig. 94; ''Portrait of Omer Talon'', by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1649 ([[National Gallery of Art, Washington]], p.70, fig. 98); ''Woman with a Water Jug'', by Jan Vermeer (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 89.15.21, p.71, fig. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony van Dyck]]'s royal and aristocratic subjects had mostly progressed to Persian carpets, but less wealthy sitters are still shown with the Turkish types. The 1620 "Portrait of Abraham Graphaeus" by [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Thomas de Keyser]]s "Portrait of an unknown man" (1626) and "Portrait of Constantijn Huyghens and his clerk" (1627) are amongst the earliest paintings depicting a new type of Ottoman Turkish manufactory carpet, which was exported to Europe in large quantities, probably in order to meet the increasing demand. A large number of similar carpets were preserved in Transylvania, which was an important center of Turkish carpet trade during the 15th–17th century. Hence carpets of this type are known by a term of convenience as "Transylvanian carpets".&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania|date=2005|publisher=Verduci Editore|location=Rome|edition=1st|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter de Hooch]]s 1663 painting "Portrait of a family making music" depicts an Ottoman prayer rug of the "Transylvanian" type.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In the American colonies Isaac Royall and his family were painted by [[Robert Feke]] in 1741, posed round a table spread with a [[Bergama]] rug.&lt;ref&gt;In the collection of Harvard University Law School; illustrated in Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.193, fig. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-century European direct trade with [[India]] brought [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] versions of Persian patterns to Europe.  Painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] showed their skill by depiction of light effects on table-carpets, like [[Vermeer]] in his ''Music Lesson'' ([[Royal Collection]]).  By this date they have become common in the homes of the reasonably well-to-do, as is shown by historical documentation of inventories. Carpets are sometimes depicted in scenes of debauchery from the prosperous [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the century Oriental carpets had lost much of their status as prestige objects, and the grandest sitters for portraits were more likely to be shown on the high-quality Western carpets, like [[Savonnerie manufactory|Savonneries]], now being produced, whose less intricate patterns were also easier to depict in a [[painterly]] manner. A number of [[orientalism|Orientalist]] European painters continued to accurately depict Oriental carpets, now usually in Oriental settings.

[[File:P boel martwa natura globus l.jpeg|thumb|[[Pieter Boel]], Still life with globe and parrot, circa 1658]]

The perception of Oriental carpets during the Renaissance is characterized by three main aspects: 
# Due to their perceived rarity, preciousness and strangeness, Oriental carpets were depicted as a background for saints and religious scenes. Later on, the religious iconography was taken over by politically powerful persons in order to assert their status and power.
# Oriental carpets were more generally perceived as a rare commodity, and objects of luxury and decoration. From the mid 16th century onwards, the iconological context sometimes extended towards the idea of profligacy or vanity.
# When contacts, often of a violent nature, grew closer between the Islamic world and Europe, Oriental carpets were sometimes used as a symbol of Christian self-assertion.
In any case, Oriental carpets were used in Western Europe in different ways and contexts than in the Islamic world, and their original cultural context was never fully understood.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

=== Sacred Ground - or "Christian Oriental Carpets"? ===
Oriental carpets appear for the first time on early Renaissance paintings of the late 12th century. In most cases the carpets serve as a background for religious scenes. Saints were depicted enthroned or standing on carpets, thus being elated, and separated from their surroundings.
Ordinary people, often the donors of the painting, were sometimes allowed to participate in the atmosphere of holiness by depicting them near the holy person, or literally kneeling or standing "on the same carpet" as the saint. This context is still understood and at times used today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of the religious context has been proposed by V. Gantzhorn in 1998: He compared in detail the patterns and symbols of both the Renaissance paintings and surviving carpets with ancient ornaments, for example with [[Armenian art|Armenian]] [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illuminated manuscripts]]. He concluded that the majority of the surviving and painted carpets alike were produced by Christian Armenian weavers. The hidden Christian symbolism of the carpet patterns had therefore made the so-called "Christian oriental carpets" appropriate adornments for Western European Christian churches. Following this hypothesis, the lack of contemporary Western European written sources, which could otherwise provide independent evidence to support Gantzhorns claims, is explained by the fact that the knowledge of the hidden symbols was subject to oral tradition, and restricted to a small religious élite. The [[Armenian Genocide]] had led to the loss of the oral tradition, and, subsequently, to an incorrect "Islamic" attribution of the carpets by the majority of Western art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gantzhorn|first1=Volkmar|title=Orientalische Teppiche : eine Darstellung der ikonographischen und ikonologischen Entwicklung von den Anfängen bis zum 18.

=== Objects of luxury and decoration ===

We do not understand exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian [[Piazza San Marco]] was adorned with carpets hanging from the windows of the surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate [[pseudo-kufic]] writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

In a series of letters&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass / Writings|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Europe and the Oriental Rug"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] tells his friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] about his efforts to buy two carpets for him in Venice:

{{Quotation|''Vnd dy 2 tebich will mir Anthoni Kolb awff daz hubschpt, preytest vnd wolfeillest helfen khawffen. So jch sy hab, will jch sy dem jungen Im Hoff geben, daz er ys ewch einschlache. Awch will jch sehen noch den kranchs federen.''&lt;br&gt;
"Anthoni Kolb will help me buying 2 carpets, the nicest, broadest and cheapest [we can get]. As soon as I have them, I will hand them over to the young Im Hoff, and he will prepare them for transport. I will look for crane feathers as well."

(18 August 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jtem allen fleis hab jch an kertt mit den tewichen, kan aber kein preiten an kumen. Sy sind al schmall vnd lang. Aber noch hab jch altag forschung dornoch, awch der Anthoni Kolb.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've done all I could with the carpets, but I cannot get any of the broad ones. They are all narrow and oblong. I'm continuing my search every day, Anthoni Kolb as well."

(8 September 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jch hab awch zwen dewich bestelt, dy würd jch morgen tzalen. Aber jch hab sy nit wolfell kunen kawffen.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've ordered two carpets, and will pay for them tomorrow. But I could not buy at a cheap price."

(13 October 1506)|Albrecht Dürer, letters from Venice to Willibald Pirckheimer&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"/&gt;}}

Dürer was buying various exotic luxury goods for Pirckheimer in Venice, and he mentions the two carpets amongst gold, jewels, or crane feathers. We do not know if Dürer in any way attributed artistic value to these carpets. No oriental carpets were ever depicted by Dürer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raby|first1=Julian|title=Venice, Dürer, and the oriental mode|date=1982|publisher=Islamic Art Publications|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0856671623|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], the so-called [[Merry Company]] type of painting, depicts a group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making. In these pictures, Oriental carpets often cover and decorate the table, or are spread over the furniture. As such, they either underline the wealth and respectability of the portrayed, or add a context of exoticism and profligacy to brothel scenes, or scenes of debauchery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westermann|first1=Mariët|title=A worldly art : the Dutch Republic, 1585-1718|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0300107234|edition=2nd reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, Oriental carpets were often depicted in [[still life]] paintings. Assorted valuable, exotic objects like Chinese porcelain bowls and animals like parrots are depicted, often with an allegorical meaning, or symbolizing "[[vanitas]]", the futility of human life. The allusion to futility is made apparent by the inclusion of symbols like a human skull, or inscriptions quoting the biblical book of [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Ecclesiastes|1:2;12:8|KJV}}. As early as 1533, Hans Holbein's painting [[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|"The Ambassadors"]] prominently shows an [[anamorphic projection]] of a human skull. Objects in still lifes, regardless of their allegorical meaning, are often placed on precious velvet table cloths, marble plates, or oriental carpets. As such, Oriental carpets are treated similar to other precious objects or materials, the focus being on their material value and decorative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergström|first1=Ingvar|title=Dutch still-life painting in the seventeenth century|date=1983|publisher=Hacker art books|location=New York|isbn=978-0878172795|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of European self-assertion ===
In September 1479 the Venetian painter [[Gentile Bellini]] was sent by the Venetian Senate as a cultural [[ambassador]] to Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital [[Constantinople]] as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] wrote that Bellini "portrayed the Emperor Mahomet from the life so well, that it was held a miracle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasari|first1=Giorgio|editor1-last=du C. de Vere|editor1-first=Gaston|editor2-last=Jack|editor2-first=Philip|title=The lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors, and architects|date=2005|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0375760365|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating and authorship of the portrait by Bellini have been placed in question,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3099 |title=The Sultan Mehmet II |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826181140/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG3099 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Bellini is the first great Renaissance painter who actually visited an Islamic Sultan's court.

The influence of Bellinis encounter with the Islamic world is reflected by Oriental motifs appearing in several of his paintings. His 1507 ''St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria'' anachronistically shows the patron saint of Venice preaching to Muslims. The architecture shown in the background is an incongruous assortment of buildings, not corresponding to contemporary Islamic architecture. The stage-like setting for St Mark's sermon is adorned by exotic animals like a camel and a giraffe, as well as architectural elements like an ancient Egyptian [[obelisk]], in the background.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt; Bellini's use of these decorative elements resembles the way Oriental carpets are depicted in 14th and 15th century Renaissance paintings: They are depictions of the exotic and the precious, they set a stage for an important person or action, but, as yet, essentially ignore their original cultural context.

The 1547 depiction of King [[Edward VI of England]] standing on an Oriental carpet, in front of a throne on the same carpet asserts the young [[Fidei defensor]]'s strength and power, by a deliberate echo of the pose of his father's famous portrait by Holbein.

Nothing is known about how much [[Ambrosius Francken]] knew about the cultural background of the Mamluk carpet which he used as a decoration for his ''Last Supper''. The painting can only be roughly dated to the 16th century. The use of the central medallion of an Oriental carpet to highlight the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] of Christ, however, represents a special case: The use of the motif could either have resulted from a mere similarity of the two pictorial patterns, but it can also be understood as an assertion of Renaissance Christian predominance. Europeans had reasons to fear the Islamic world: In 1529, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was [[Siege of Vienna|besieging Vienna]], and the Ottoman Empire remained a constant threat to Western Europe until the late 17th century.

In his 1502–9 cycle of the Piccolomini library frescoes at the Dome of Siena, [[Pinturicchio]] depicts [[Pope Pius II]] convoking, as the Latin inscription explains, a Diet of Princes at [[Mantua]] to proclaim a new [[crusade]] in 1459. On the eighth fresco, a table in front of the Pope's throne is covered by an Oriental carpet. It was hypothesized that the carpet might have been a trophy from previous expeditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

Precious Oriental carpets were part of the so-called "''[[:de:Türkenbeute|Türkenbeute]]''" (lit.: "Turkish loot") from the [[Battle of Vienna|siege of Vienna]] which ended on 12 September 1683 and their new Christian owners proudly reported back home about their plunder. Carpets exist with inscriptions indicating the new owner, and the date when it was acquired:

{{Quotation|'''''A. D. Wilkonski XII septembris 1683 z pod Wiednia''''' &lt;br&gt; "A. D. Wilkonski, Vienna, 12 September 1683"|Inscription on the backside of an Oriental "Polonaise" carpet, once in the Moore collection, current location unknown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;}}

The majority of Oriental carpets, however, continue to be depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for a better understanding of the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to a better understanding of the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.

'''Political criticism''' (also referred to as '''political commentary''' or '''political discussion''') is [[criticism]] that is specific of or relevant to [[politics]], including [[policies]], [[politicians]], [[political parties]], and types of [[government]].

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over the relevance and importance of political criticism in civilizations, particularly [[democratic societies]].

Advocates argue that political discussion creates and promotes the variety of opinions necessary for a true democracy. The [[American constitution]] is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as [[free speech]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Critics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual  basis, the "Average Joe") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient [[intelligence]] to do the matter justice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Methods==
There are many methods used throughout [[written history|history]] of promoting political opinions and with the development of new  [[technologies]] new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:

===Books===
[[Image:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|[[The Bible]], one of the most influential books of all time]]
Throughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably '''the''' most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as [[the Bible]], [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], the [[Qur'an]], ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of [[writing]]. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from [[common sense]], the drive of [[literature]] and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the [[emotions|emotional impact]] of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] concerning American views about [[slavery]]. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", derives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Television and films===
Since their development in this past century, both [[television]] and [[films]] have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]], [[Citizen Kane]], the works of [[Walt Disney]], and such political [[satire]] as that found in [[The Simpsons]]. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political [[propaganda]] on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.

===Political cartoons===
{{Main|Political satire}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:conscripcartoon.jpg|thumb|150px|Editorial cartoon concerning [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s freedom from his [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription promise]] by [[Johnny Canuck]].]] --&gt;
[[Political cartoons]] (also known as "editorial cartoons") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a [[:wikt:verbal|verbal]] but a [[visual]] one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful  [[symbols]] or [[metaphors]] in order to communicate the artist's messages.

===News===
Since many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by [[news media|the media]], the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of [[newspapers]], news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.

===Internet===
With the recent invention of the [[Internet]], political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the [[World Wide Web]]. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.

The many means of exchanging ideas, including [[blogs]] and [[internet forum]]s, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute.  This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that [[political parties]] stay connected to [[Electoral district|constituents]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">'''The Private Eye Project''' is a research based educational program created by Kerry Ruef in 1988. Founded in both [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[active learning]] approaches, it is designed to accelerate student learning by the development of critical thinking skills, creativity, literacy, and scientific literacy. Some of the main themes are "close observation", "thinking by [[analogy]]", "hands-on investigation", "changing scale", and "theorizing". One of the main tools used in the program for enhancing close observation is a [[loupe]]. The first three and one half years were grant-funded by the Discuren Charitable Foundation and piloted in the [[Seattle Public Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Private Eye |url=http://www.the-private-eye.com/html/aboutTPE/Wht1_whatis.html |title=What is the Private Eye? |publisher=The-private-eye.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2010, The Private Eye Project has been used by thousands of teachers and over 3 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-0qC44Og0Q |title=The Private Eye and The Interdisciplinary Mind |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Private Eye Project is both a curriculum and staff development program; its teacher-training component is also distributed via university school of education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.uab.edu/alahasp/ALAHASPandThePrivateEye.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Ed.uab.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, it has been recognized positively by many University department directors, professors, and professional scientists, as well as numerous teachers and administrators; [[Fritjof Capra]] says the pattern-recognition skills embedded in The Private Eye are central to learning systems thinking;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Private Eye |url=http://www.the-private-eye.com/html/testimonials.html |title=Private Eye Testimonials |publisher=The-private-eye.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Nelson (astronaut)|George Nelson]] calls it an exciting approach to ... the art of mathematical and scientific thinking which should be a part of every school.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Katie.

Stone and [[Zenobia Barlow]], eds., Ecological Literacy: Educating Our Children for a Sustainable World, Sierra Club Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an innovative program for teaching thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbhm.org/News/2011/PrivateEye.html |title=Private Eye Program Makes Connections in World, Brains|publisher=WBHM |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology of The Private Eye Project is sometimes referenced in discussions of creativity and critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bernstein | first = Robert | title = Sparks of genius : the thirteen thinking tools of the world's most creative people | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Co | location = Boston, Mass | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-395-90771-9 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roso schola copia.jpg|thumb|280px|Inauguration of the “House of the Philosopher” of the Schola Philosophicae Initiationis. On first plane there appear Mario Roso de Luna and Eduardo Alfonso.]]

The '''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis''' (School of Philosophical Initiation) was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[splinter group]] created in [[Madrid]] in 1928 by Eduardo Alfonso and [[Mario Roso de Luna]] in response to what they considered the doctrinal deviations of the [[Theosophical Society]], especially in reference to the proclamation of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[Theosophical Society#"The "World Teacher"|World Teacher]].

==Foundation==

In mid-1921, Mario Roso de Luna, with a dozen companions from Madrid, formed the ''Rama Hesperia,'' which kept close ties with the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] in [[India]] as well as with the dissident [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]] in [[California]]. Around 1928,  Roso de Luna and his group founded the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiatic]] philosophical school ''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis'' (SPI) that was "a reaction against the instability and indiscipline of the Theosophical Society."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: El porvenir de la Teosofía comprometido por la Sociedad Teosófica&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the SPI were "the comparative study of the philosophies, sciences and arts in their mutual relations, and promoting the health and culture of its members as well as their moral progress".&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: La Casa del Filósofo&lt;/ref&gt;

The new School bought a property in [[Manzanares el Real]] in the [[Community of Madrid]] to build a center for advanced philosophical studies called ''The House of the Philosopher''. The School was based on three stages of knowledge "as corresponds to any initiatic society and consequently to the three objects of the Theosophical Society, that deep inside are nothing but the three initiatic grades of all corresponding institutions which, having been misunderstood and disrespected, have led the T.S. to disunity and mental anarchy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The disciples of the SPI followed a gradual and methodical program of studies covering the three stages: the first, studies on [[Hygiene]] and [[Morality|Morals]]; the second on [[Science]] and [[Nature]]; and the third on [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]].

==Decline and dissolution==

Mario Roso de Luna died in 1931, after which Dr. Eduardo Alfonso became the head of the School, continuing the instruction of disciples. However, after 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] caused the suspension of many of the philosophical and cultural activities in Madrid. At the end of the Civil War, Eduardo Alfonso was tried according to the “Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism” and sentenced to several years of imprisonment which he served in a Burgos prison from 1942 to 1948. After serving his time, Alfonso was exiled to Latin America until 1966 when he returned to his Country.

'''Sebastian Bakare''' (born 1940) is a Zimbabwean retired Anglican Bishop of the [[Anglican Diocese of Harare|Diocese of Harare]] and former [[Bishop of Manicaland]].  He was once in a power struggle over the leadership of the Diocese of Harare with [[Nolbert Kunonga]], the former Bishop of Harare, since Kunonga was stripped of his episcopacy in January 2008 by the Province.

==Life==
Bakere was formerly Bishop of Manicaland until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Episcopal Church Annual 2003'', p. 445. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Episcopal Church Annual 2007'', p. 460. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Morehouse Church Resources, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to reside in Mutare, the see city of his diocese, until he was asked by the Dean of the Church of the Province of Central Africa on 7 November 2007 to take over the Diocese of Harare after the ouster of Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, who had aligned himself with the Marxist régime of [[Robert Mugabe]] in an attempt to withdraw his diocese from the Province of Central Africa.  It was expected Bakare would be a caretaker bishop until a substantive leader could be elected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglican-mainstream.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakare denounced Mugabe's treatment of Christians, particularly Anglicans who refuse to recognize the authority of Kunonga. Many Anglican churches have been closed on the orders of Mugabe's party, [[Zanu-PF]], which believes it should continue to rule Zimbabwe despite an electoral defeat in March 2008.

At the decennial [[Lambeth Conference]] in [[Canterbury, England]], Bakare spoke of Zimbabwe to newsmen: "The ruling system is so oppressive that it has denied the people their human rights, including religious freedom. My diocese continues to suffer persecution. We have been denied the freedom to worship."

On 30 October 2008, it was announced that Bakare had been awarded [[Sweden]]'s 2008 [[Per Anger]] Prize for his "committed work for human rights in a politically unstable Zimbabwe."  He received the award in [[Stockholm]] on 10 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.episcopalchurch.org&lt;/ref&gt; "It is like a war, in the sense that there is total absence of peace," Bakare told Swedish radio news in describing conditions in his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;http://danielmolokele.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susquehannock''' is an [[extinct language]] that once was spoken by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Susquehannock]]s. It is a part of the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language family]].

Little of the Susquehannock language has been preserved. The only source is a ''Vocabula Mahakuassica'' compiled by the Swedish missionary [[John Campanius|Johannes Campanius]] during the 1640s and published with additions in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Campanius Holm. 1702. ''A short description of the province of New Sweden'', tr. Peter S. du Ponceau. Pennsylvania Historical Society Memoirs 3:1:1-166. (Reprinted 1834 in Philadelphia)&lt;br&gt;cited in Marianne Mithun. ''The Languages of Native America'' (1999, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Campanius's vocabulary contains only 89 words but is sufficient to show that Susquehannock was a northern Iroquoian language closely related to those of the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Mithun. 1981. "Stalking the Susquehannocks," ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 47:1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving remnants of the Susquehannock language include the river names [[Conestoga River|Conestoga]], [[Juniata River|Juniata]], and [[Swatara Creek|Swatara]].

'''Total Information Awareness''' ('''TIA''') was a program of the United States [[Information Awareness Office]] that began during the 2003 fiscal year. It operated under this title from February until May 2003, before being renamed as the '''Terrorism Information Awareness'''.&lt;ref name=dapra1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rename&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan Singel|title=Funding for TIA All But Dead|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2003/07/59606|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)]]''|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=07.14.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the concept of [[predictive policing]], TIA aimed to gather detailed information about individuals in order to anticipate and prevent crimes before they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=N.|title=Profiling in the age of total information awareness|journal=[[Race &amp; Class]]|date=4 October 2010|volume=52|issue=2|pages=3–24|url=http://rac.sagepub.com/content/52/2/3.abstract|doi=10.1177/0306396810377002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of efforts to win the [[War on Terror]], the program searched for all sorts of personal information in the hunt for terrorists around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=JOHN MARKOFF|title=Pentagon Plans a Computer System That Would Peek at Personal Data of Americans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/politics/09COMP.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=November 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral [[John Poindexter]] referred to it as a "[[Manhattan Project]] for [[Counter-Terrorism]]".&lt;ref name= shorrock&gt;{{cite book| last = Shorrock| first = Tim| title = Spies for Hire: The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing| publisher = Simon and Schuster| date = 2008| location =| pages = 221| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qTnGl9nmNw8C&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780743282246}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Senator [[Ron Wyden]] (D-Ore.), TIA was the "biggest surveillance program in the [[history of the United States]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pentagon's 'Terror Information Awareness' program will end|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-25-pentagon-office_x.htm|accessdate=19 December 2013|newspaper=''[[USA Today]]''|date=2003-09-25|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was defunded alongside the Information Awareness Office in late 2003 by the [[United States Congress]] after media reports criticized the government for attempting to establish "Total Information Awareness" over all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jonathan Turley|title=George Bush's Big Brother|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/17/opinion/oe-turley17|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=November 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= washtimes1&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. agencies collect, examine personal data on Americans|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/28/20040528-122605-9267r/?page=all|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=May 28, 2004|quote=The most widely reported data-mining project — the Pentagon's Total Information Awareness (TIA) program — was shut down by Congress because of widespread privacy fears.

Although the program was formally suspended, its [[data mining]] software was later adopted by other government agencies, with only superficial changes being made. The core architecture of TIA continued development under the code name "'''Basketball'''." According to a 2012 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, the legacy of Total Information Awareness is "quietly thriving" at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).&lt;ref name="nytimesnsa"&gt;{{cite web|last=SHANE HARRIS|title=Giving In to the Surveillance State|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/whos-watching-the-nsa-watchers.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program synopsis ==
Total Information Awareness (TIA) was intended to be a five year long research project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). The goal was to integrate components from previous and brand new government intelligence and surveillance programs, including [[Project Genoa|Genoa]], [[Project Genoa II|Genoa II]], Genisys, [[Scalable Social Network Analysis|SSNA]], [[Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery|EELD]], [[Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment|WAE]], [[Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization|TIDES]], Communicator, HumanID and Bio-Surveillance with [[data mining]] knowledge gleamed from the private sector to create a resource for the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence]], [[counterintelligence]], and [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/poindexter.html| title = OVERVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AWARENESS OFFICE  | last = Poindexter| first = John| date = 2 August 2002| website = fas.org| publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]]| access-date = 3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= stevens&gt;{{cite book| last = Stevens| first = Gina Marie| title = Privacy: Total Information Awareness Programs and Latest Developments| publisher = Nova Publishers| edition = illustrated| date = 2003| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W5bDA0EkNTgC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781590338698}}&lt;/ref&gt; These components consisted of information analysis, collaboration, decision-support tools, language translation, data-searching, [[pattern recognition]], and privacy-protection technologies.&lt;ref name= congress&gt;{{cite web| url = https://epic.org/privacy/profiling/tia/may03_report.pdf| title = Report to Congress Regarding the Terrorism Information Awareness Program: In response to Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub.

TIA research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities: [[INSCOM]], [[NSA]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]], [[CIA]], [[Counterintelligence Field Activity|CIFA]], [[STRATCOM]], [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]], [[JFCOM]], [[JWAC]].&lt;ref name= congress/&gt; These agencies were to be able to access TIA's programs through a series of dedicated [[Node (networking)|nodes]].&lt;ref name= bamford/&gt; TIA's hardware was to be housed by INSCOM in [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name= jacobsen&gt;{{cite book| last = Jacobsen| first = Annie| title = The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top-Secret Military Research Agency| publisher = Little, Brown| edition = illustrated| date = 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OYgQBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=| isbn = 9780316371650}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Companies that were contracted to work on TIA included the [[Science Applications International Corporation]],&lt;ref name= harris2/&gt; [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], [[Lockheed Martin Corporation]], Schafer Corporation, [[Sound Retrieval System|SRS Technologies]], Adroit Systems, CACI Dynamic Systems, ASI Systems International, and Syntek Technologies.&lt;ref name= bigbrother/&gt;

Universities enlisted to assist with research and development included [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Colorado State University|Colorado State]], [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of Texas at Dallas|Dallas]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology|GeorgiaTech]], [[University of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[University of Southampton|Southampton]].&lt;ref name= bigbrother/&gt;&lt;ref name= gtech/&gt;

===Mission===

The goal of the Total Information Awareness program was to revolutionize the ability of the United States to detect, classify and identify foreign terrorists – and decipher their plans – and thereby enable the U.S. to take timely action to successfully preempt and defeat terrorist acts.

To that end, the TIA program objective was to create a counter-terrorism information system that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Information Awareness (TIA) System|url=http://www.darpa.mil/iao/tiasystems.htm|publisher=[[DARPA]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003053651/http://www.darpa.mil/iao/tiasystems.htm|archivedate=October 3, 2002|date=October 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Increases information coverage by an order of magnitude, and affords easy future scaling

2. Provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed

3. Automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90% of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks

4. Supports collaboration, analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize, test and propose theories and mitigating strategies about possible futures, so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of current or future policies and prospective courses of action.

===Components===

====Genoa====
{{main|Project Genoa}}
Unlike the other program components, Genoa predated Total Information Awareness and provided a basis for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Balancing Privacy &amp; Security: The Privacy Implications of Government Data Mining Programs: Congressional Hearing| publisher = DIANE Publishing| pages = 126| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IR9z1pcQqoC&amp;dq=| isbn = 9781422320259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genoa's primary function was [[intelligence analysis]] in order to assist human analysts.&lt;ref name= verton/&gt; The program was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches; a policy maker could hypothesize a possible attack and use Genoa to look for supporting evidence of such a plot, or it would compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes. Human analysts would then be able to modify the diagram to test various cases.&lt;ref name= harris/&gt;

Genoa, which had been independently commissioned in 1996, was completed in 2002 as scheduled.

While Genoa primarily focused on intelligence analyses, Genoa II was aimed towards providing means with which computers, software agents, policy makers, and field operatives could collaborate.&lt;ref name= verton&gt;{{cite magazine| author = Dan Verton | title = Genoa II: Man and Machine Thinking as One| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N1zRvHre4noC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| magazine = [[Computerworld]]| publisher = IDG Enterprise| date = 1 September 2003| access-date= 3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genisys====
[[File:Genysis.gif|thumb|Graphic describing the goals of the Genysis project]]
Genisys aimed at developing technologies which would enable "ultra-large, all-source information repositories".&lt;ref name="iaosite-genisys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Genisys.htm|title=Genisys|work=Information Awareness Office (official website)|accessdate=2009-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216080922/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Genisys.htm|archivedate=2009-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vast amounts of information were going to be collected and analyzed, and the available [[database]] technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data. So they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation in order to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases, as well as unstructured public data sources, such as the [[World Wide Web]]. "Effective analysis across heterogenous databases" means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records, a [[NSA call database|phone call database]] and a foreign intelligence database. The World Wide Web is considered an "unstructured public data source" because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—such as blogs, emails, records of visits to web sites, etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently.&lt;ref name="iaosite-genisys"/&gt;

Another goal was to develop "a large, distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input, analysis results, and feedback, that will result in a simpler, more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely."&lt;ref name="iaosite-genisys"/&gt;

====Scalable Social Network Analysis====
Scalable Social Network Analysis (SSNA) aimed at developing techniques based on [[social network analysis]] for modeling the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminating these groups from other types of societal groups.&lt;ref name="ethier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spyapps.net/current-research-in-social-network-theory/ |title=Current Research in Social Network Theory |last=Ethier |first=Jason |work=Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226213456/http://spyapps.net/current-research-in-social-network-theory/ |archivedate=February 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery====
[[File:EELD.gif|thumb|right|Graphic displaying a simulated application of the Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery (EELD) project]]
Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery (EELD) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources (such as phone call records from the [[NSA call database]], internet histories, or bank records).&lt;ref name="iaosite-eeld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/EELD.htm|title=Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery|work=Information Awareness Office (official website -- mirror)|accessdate=2009-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094707/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/EELD.htm|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EELD was designed to design systems with the ability to extract data from multiple sources (e.g., text messages, social networking sites, financial records, and web pages). It was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or people communicating (e.g., financial transactions, communications, travel, etc.).&lt;ref name="iaosite-eeld"/&gt;

It is designed to link items relating potential "terrorist" groups and scenarios, and to learn patterns of different groups or scenarios to identify new organizations and emerging threats.&lt;ref name="iaosite-eeld"/&gt;

====Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment====
Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment (WAE) focused on developing automated technology capable of identifying predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and examining the motivation of specific terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/WAE.htm| title = Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment (WAE)| website = www.darpa.mil/iao| publisher = [[Information Awareness Office]]| access-date = 16 June 2016| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120528103612/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/WAE.htm| archivedate = 28 May 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization====
Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) developing advanced language processing technology to enable English speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages.&lt;ref name="iaosite-tides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/TIDES.htm|title=TIDES|work=Information Awareness Office (official website -- mirror)|accessdate=2009-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094744/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/TIDES.htm|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside groups (such as universities, corporations, etc.) were invited to participate in the annual [[information retrieval]], topic detection and tracking, automatic content extraction, and [[machine translation]] evaluations run by [[NIST]].&lt;ref name="iaosite-tides"/&gt; [[Cornell University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] were given grants to work on TIDES.&lt;ref name= bigbrother/&gt;

====Communicator====
[[File:Total Information Awareness -- Communicator diagram.gif|thumb|right|300px|Diagram describing capabilities of the "Communicator" project]]
Communicator was to develop "dialogue interaction" technology that enabled warfighters to talk with computers, such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without ever using a keyboard-based interface .  The Communicator Platform was to be both wireless and mobile, and to be designed to function in a networked environment.&lt;ref name="iaosite-communicator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Communicator.htm|title=Communicator|work=Information Awareness Office (official website)|accessdate=2009-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094648/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Communicator.htm|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue interaction software was to interpret the context of the dialogue in order to improve performance, and to be capable of automatically adapting to new topics so conversation could be natural and efficient. The Communicator program emphasized task knowledge to compensate for natural language effects and noisy environments. Unlike automated translation of [[natural language processing|natural language]] speech, which is much more complex due to an essentially unlimited vocabulary and grammar, the Communicator program is directed task specific issues so that there are constrained vocabularies (the system only needs to be able to understand language related to war). Research was also started to focus on foreign language computer interaction for use in supporting coalition operations.&lt;ref name="iaosite-communicator"/&gt;

Live exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations with the [[United States Marines]] to test the technology in extreme environments.&lt;ref name="iaosite-communicator"/&gt;

====Human Identification at a Distance====
[[File:Human-id-at-a-distance.gif|thumb|right|300px|Diagram describing capabilities of the "Human Identification at a Distance" project&lt;ref name="iaosite-humanid"/&gt;]]
The Human Identification at a Distance (HumanID) project developed automated [[biometric]] identification technologies to detect, recognize and identify humans at great distances for "force protection", crime prevention, and "homeland security/defense" purposes.&lt;ref name="iaosite-humanid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/HID.htm |title=Human Identification at a distance |work=Information Awareness Office (official website -- mirror) |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094729/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/HID.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of HumanID were to:&lt;ref name="iaosite-humanid"/&gt;
* Develop algorithms for locating and acquiring subjects out to 150 meters (500&amp;nbsp;ft) in range.
* Fuse face and [[gait]] recognition into a 24/7 human identification system.
* Develop and demonstrate a human identification system that operates out to 150 meters (500&amp;nbsp;ft) using visible imagery.
* Develop a low power millimeter wave radar system for wide field of view detection and narrow field of view gait classification.
* Characterize gait performance from video for human identification at a distance.
* Develop a multi-spectral infrared and visible face recognition system.

A number of universities were included to assist in designing certain areas of HumanID. The [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]] focused on [[gait recognition]]. Gait recognition was key component of HumanID, because it could be employed on low-resolution video feeds and therefore help to identify subjects at a distance.&lt;ref name= biometrics&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Bolle| first1 = Ruud M. | last2 = Connell| first2 = Jonathan | last3 = Pankanti| first3 = Sharath| last4 = Ratha| first4 = Nalini K.| last5 = Senior| first5 = Andrew W.| title = Guide to Biometrics| publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media| edition = illustrated| date = 29 June 2013| pages = 239| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLbBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781475740363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They planned on developing a system that recovered static body and stride parameters of subjects as they walked, while also looking into the ability of time-normalized joint angle trajectories in the walking plane as a means of recognizing gait. The university also did related work in locating and tracking faces with expressions and speech.&lt;ref name= gtech&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/hid/| title = Human Identification at a Distance| date = 2003| website = www.cc.gatech.edu| publisher = [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing]]| access-date = 16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Robotics Institute (part of the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]]) worked on dynamic face recognition. The research focused primarily the extraction of body biometric features from video and identifying subjects from the extracted body biometric features. To conduct its studies, the university created databases of synchronized multi-camera video sequences of body motion, human faces under a wide range of imaging conditions, AU coded expression videos, and hyperspectal and polarimetric images of human faces.&lt;ref name=cmu&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ri.cmu.edu/research_lab_group_detail.html?lab_id=56&amp;menu_id=263| title = Human Identification at a Distance (HumanID)| website = Carnegie Mellon University: The Robotics Institute| publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]]| access-date = 16 June 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160809063631/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/research_lab_group_detail.html?lab_id=56&amp;menu_id=263| archive-date = 9 August 2016| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video sequences of body motion data consisted of six separate viewpoints of 25 subjects walking on a treadmill. Four separate 11-second gaits were tested for each: slow walk, fast walk, inclined, and carrying a ball.&lt;ref name= biometrics/&gt;

The [[University of Maryland]]'s Institute for Advanced Computer Studies' research focused on the recognition of an individual at a distance through gait and face information. Also to be utilized were [[infrared]] and 5-degree-of-freedom cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/labs/pirl/hid/overview.html| title = Human Identification at a Distance: Overview| date = 17 April 2001| website = University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies| publisher = [[University of Maryland]]| access-date = 16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test conducted included filming 38 male and 6 female subjects of different ethnicity and physical features walking along a T-shaped path from various angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor = Bahram Javidi| title = Optical and Digital Techniques for Information Security| publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media| series = Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications| volume = 1| edition = illustrated| date = 28 June 2005| pages = 283| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=amZSD-UJUVMC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780387206165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Southampton]]'s Department of Electronics and Computer Science was developing an "Automatic Gait Recognition" system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gait.ecs.soton.ac.uk/| title = Automatic Gait Recognition for Human ID at a Distance| last = Nixon| first = M.S.| date = 7 August 2003| website = www.ecs.soton.ac.uk| publisher = [[University of Southampton]]| access-date = 16 June 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160805154831/http://www.gait.ecs.soton.ac.uk/| archive-date = 2016-08-05| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Texas at Dallas]] was compiling a database to test facial systems. The data included a set of nine static pictures taken from different viewpoints, a video of each subject looking around a room, a video of the subject speaking, and one or more videos of the subject showing facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.utdallas.edu/~otoole/HID/hum_id_main.html| title = Human Identification Project| last = O'Toole| first = Alice| website = www.utdallas.edu| publisher = [[University of Texas at Dallas]]| access-date =16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colorado State University]] developed multiple systems for identification via facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cs.colostate.edu/evalfacerec/index10.php| title =  Evaluation of Face Recognition Algorithms| website = www.cs.colostate.edu| publisher = [[Colorado State University]]| access-date = 16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia University]] participated in implementing HumanID in poor weather.&lt;ref name= cmu/&gt;

====Bio-Surveillance====
[[File:Bio-Surveillance.gif|thumb|right|Graphic describing the goals of the Bio-Surveillance project]]
The Bio-Surveillance project was designed to predict and respond to [[bioterrorism]] by monitoring non-traditional data sources such as animal sentinels, behavioral indicators, and pre-diagnostic medical data. It would leverage existing disease models, identify abnormal health early indicators, and mine existing databases to determine the most valuable early indicators for abnormal health conditions.&lt;ref name= BIO/&gt;

===Scope of surveillance===

As a "virtual, centralized, grand database",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony M. Townsend|title=Your city is spying on you: From iPhones to cameras, you are being watched right now|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/10/13/your_city_is_spying_on_you_from_iphones_to_cameras_you_are_being_watched_right_now/|publisher=''[[Salon (website)]]''|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scope of surveillance includes, among others, [[credit card]] purchases, [[magazine]] [[Subscription business model|subscription]]s, [[Web browsing history|web browsing histories]], phone records, [[Academic grading in the United States|academic grade]]s, [[Deposit account|bank deposit]]s, gambling histories, [[passport]] applications, airline and railway tickets, [[driver's license]]s, [[gun license]]s, [[Toll bridge|toll records]], [[Criminal record|judicial records]], [[divorce]] records, etc.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = stevens/&gt;

Health and biological information collected by TIA included [[medical prescription|drug prescription]]s,&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; [[medical record]]s,&lt;ref name="wyden"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Ron Wyden]]|title=Wyden Calls For Congressional Oversight, Accountability of Total Information Awareness Office|url=http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-calls-for-congressional-oversight-accountability-of-total-information-awareness-office|quote=On the Web site of this particular program, the Total Information Awareness Program, they cite a Latin slogan -- "Knowledge is power" -- something we would all agree with, and state: The total information awareness of transnational threats requires keeping track of individuals and understanding how they fit into models.

===Privacy===
The Genisys component of TIA, in addition to integrating and organizing separate databases, was to run an internal "Privacy Protection Program." This was intended to restrict analysts' access to irrelevant information on private U.S. citizens, enforce [[privacy law]]s and policies via software mechanisms, and report misuse of data.&lt;ref name= lee&gt;{{cite book| last = Lee| first = Newton| title = Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness| publisher = Springer| edition = 2, illustrated, revised| date = 7 April 2015| pages = 141| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zSv3BwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9783319172446}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also plans for TIA to have an application that could "anonymize" data, so that information could be linked to an individual only through a court order (especially for medical records gathered by the Bio-Surveillance project).&lt;ref name=BIO&gt;{{cite web| url = http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/BSS.htm| title = Bio- Surveillance| website = www.darpa.mil/iao| publisher = [[Information Awareness Office]]| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060919113254/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/BSS.htm| archivedate = 2006-09-19| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of audit logs were to be kept, which would keep track of whether innocent Americans' communications were getting caught up in relevant data.&lt;ref name="nytimesnsa"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Admiral John Poindexter, official Navy photo, 1985.JPEG|thumb|[[Admiral (United States)|Adm.]] [[John Poindexter]], the Director of the [[Information Awareness Office]] and chief supporter of TIA]]

The term "total information awareness" was first coined at the annual DARPAtech conference of 1999 in [https://web.archive.org/web/20081125153748/http://www.darpa.mil/darpatech99/Presentations/isopdf/isotia.pdf a presentation] by the deputy director of the Office of Information Systems Management, Brian Sharkey. Sharkey applied the phrase to a conceptual method by which the government could sift through massive amounts of data becoming available via digitization and draw important conclusions.&lt;ref name= harris&gt;{{cite book| last = Harris| first = Shane| title = The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State| publisher = Penguin| edition = reprint| date = 18 February 2010| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kGEMwv0VHL4C&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781101195741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early developments ===

TIA was proposed as program shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 by Rear Admiral [[John Poindexter]]. A former national security adviser to President [[Ronald Reagan]] and a key player in the [[Iran–Contra affair]], he was working with Syntek Technologies, a company often contracted out by the government for work on defense projects. TIA was officially commissioned during the 2002 [[fiscal year]].&lt;ref name= bigbrother&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.publicintegrity.org/2002/12/17/3164/outsourcing-big-brother| title = Outsourcing Big Brother: Office of Total Information Awareness relies on private sector to track Americans| last1 = Mayle| first1 = Adam| last2 = Knott| first2 = Alex| date = 17 December 2002| website = www.publicintegrity.org| publisher = [[Center for Public Integrity]]| access-date = 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poindexter was appointed Director of the newly created [[Information Awareness Office]] division of DARPA in January 2002, which managed TIA's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl31786.pdf| title = Total Information Awareness Programs: Funding, Composition, and Oversight Issues| last = Belasco| first = Amy| date = 21 March 2003| website = www.au.af.mil/au| publisher = [[Congressional Research Service]] | access-date = 7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office temporarily operated out of the fourth floor of DARPA's headquarters, while Poindexter looked around for a place which could permanently house TIA's researchers.&lt;ref name= jacobsen/&gt; Soon [[Project Genoa]] was successfully completed and its research moved on to [[Genoa II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/darpatech2002/speeches/ARMOUR.pdf| title = Genoa II DARPAtech 2002 Presentation Script| last = Armour| first = Tom| date = 2002| website = w2.eff.org| publisher = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]| access-date = 20 June 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161008004230/https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/darpatech2002/speeches/ARMOUR.pdf| archive-date = 2016-10-08| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Genoa.htm| title = Genoa| website = www.darpa.mil/iao| publisher = [[Information Awareness Office]]| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090216081001/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/Genoa.htm| archivedate = 2009-02-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late that year, the [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC) was awarded a $19 million contract by the Information Awareness Office to develop the "Information Awareness Prototype System", the core architecture to integrate all of TIA's information extraction, analysis, and dissemination tools. This was done through its consulting arm, Hicks &amp; Associates, which employed many former [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and military officials.&lt;ref name= harris2/&gt;

The earliest version of TIA employed a software called Groove, which had been developed in 2000 by [[Ray Ozzie]]. Groove made it possible for analysts from many different government agencies to share intelligence data instantly, and it linked specialized programs that were designed to look for patterns of suspicious behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TECHNOLOGY; Many Tools Of Big Brother Are Now Up And Running|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/23/business/technology-many-tools-of-big-brother-are-now-up-and-running.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=December 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional restrictions and termination===

On 24 January 2003, the [[United States Senate]] voted to limit the TIA program by restricting its ability to gather information from emails and the commercial databases of health, financial and travel companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADAM CLYMER|title=Senate Rejects Privacy Project|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/24/politics/24PRIV.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=January 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Division M, § 111(b)'' passed in February, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of TIA's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ7/html/PLAW-108publ7.htm| title = Joint Resolution| date = February 2003| website = www.gpo.gov| publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office]]| access-date = 7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report arrived on May 20. It disclosed that the program's computer tools were still in their preliminary testing phase. Concerning the pattern recognition of transaction information, only synthetic data created by researchers was being processed. The report also conceded that a full prototype of TIA wasn't scheduled to be ready until the 2007 fiscal year.&lt;ref name= congress/&gt; Also in May, Total Information Awareness was renamed '''Terrorism Information Awareness''' in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information gathering practices on average citizens.&lt;ref name= snowden&gt;{{cite web| url = http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB436/| title = The Snowden Affair| last = Richelson| first = Jeffrey T.| date = 4 September 2013| website = nsarchive.gwu.edu| publisher = [[National Security Archive]]| access-date = 9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in early 2003, the [[National Security Agency]] began installing access nodes on TIA's classified network.&lt;ref name= shorrock/&gt; The NSA then started running stacks of emails and intercepted communications through TIA's various programs.&lt;ref name= bamford/&gt;

Following a scandal in the Department of Defense involving a [[Policy Analysis Market|proposal]] to reward investors who predicted terrorist attacks, John Poindexter resigned from office on 29 August.&lt;ref name= bamford&gt;{{cite book| last = Bamford| first = James| title = The Shadow Factory: The Ultra-Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America| publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group | date = 14 October 2008| pages =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YfiTZBYnZd4C&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780385528399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2003, Congress officially cut off funding for TIA and the Information Awareness Office (with the [[United States Senate|Senate]] voting unanimously against it)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Solove| first = Daniel J.| title = Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security| publisher = Yale University Press| date = 2011| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UUdQi4FxRxAC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780300177251}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its unpopular perception with the general public and the media.&lt;ref name="washtimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= donohue258&gt;{{cite book| last = Donohue| first = Laura K.| title = The Cost of Counterterrorism: Power, Politics, and Liberty| publisher = Cambridge University Press| date = 14 April 2008| pages = 258| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QpVVPtzu1LUC&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781139469579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Senators [[Ron Wyden]] and [[Byron L.

===After 2003===
Reports began to emerge in February 2006 that TIA's components had been transferred to the authority of the [[National Security Agency]]. In the Department of Defense [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] for the 2004 fiscal year, a classified annex provided the funding. It was stipulated that the technologies were limited for military or foreign intelligence purposes against non-U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Williams Pontin. [http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/16741/ The Total Information Awareness Project Lives On], ''MIT Technology Review'', 26 April 2006, retrieved 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved, but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned.&lt;ref name= shorrock/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesnsa"/&gt;

====Topsail====
[[Genoa II]], which focused on collaboration between machines and humans, was renamed "Topsail" and handed over to the NSA's [[Advanced Research and Development Activity]], or ARDA (ARDA was later moved to the [[Director of National Intelligence]]'s control as the [[Disruptive Technologies Office]]). Tools from the program were utilized in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|war in Afghanistan]] and in other efforts as part of the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name= harris2/&gt; In October 2005, the [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] signed a $3.7 million contract for work on Topsail.&lt;ref name= harris/&gt; In early 2006 a spokesman for the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] said that Topsail was "in the process of being canceled due to lack of funds." When inquired about Topsail in a [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]] hearing that February, both [[National Intelligence Director]] [[John Negroponte]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] said they didn't know about the program's status. Negroponte's deputy, former [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Director]] [[Michael V. Hayden]] said, "I'd like to answer in closed session."&lt;ref name= harris2/&gt;

====Basketball====
The Information Awareness Prototype System was reclassified as "Basketball" and work on it continued by SAIC, supervised by ARDA. As far in as September 2004, Basketball was fully funded by the government and being tested in a research center jointly run by ARDA and SAIC. As of 2006, it was unknown whether this research persisted.&lt;ref name= harris2&gt;[http://shaneharris.com/magazinestories/tia-lives-on/ TIA Lives On], ''[[National Journal]]'', 23 February 2006, retrieved 14 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics allege that the program could be abused by government authorities as part of their practice of [[mass surveillance in the United States]]. In an op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the American author [[William Safire]] called it "the supersnoop's dream: a Total Information Awareness about every U.S. citizen."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=WILLIAM SAFIRE|title=You Are a Suspect|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/14/opinion/you-are-a-suspect.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=November 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Mark, a former director of defense research and engineering at the [[University of Texas]], called it a "dishonest misuse of [[DARPA]]".&lt;ref name=dapra1&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title=Defence research: Still in the lead?|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080123/full/451390a.html|work=Nature|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|accessdate=7 December 2013|pages=390–393|doi=10.1038/451390a|date=24 January 2008|quote=Poindexter and his office proved to be more polarizing than expected; its Total Information Awareness programme (later changed to Terrorism Information Awareness), which aimed to sift through huge amounts of data to track terrorists, was attacked on privacy grounds, and Congress eventually cancelled it. "That was a dishonest misuse of DARPA," says Hans Mark, a former director of defense research and engineering now at the University of Texas at Austin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] launched a campaign to terminate the full implementation of Total Information Awareness, claiming that if implemented, it would "kill privacy in America" because "every aspect of our lives would be catalogued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A on the Pentagon's "Total Information Awareness" Program|url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/qa-pentagons-total-information-awareness-program|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=April 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' criticized the program for "Fighting terror by terrifying U.S. citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ROB MORSE|title=Fighting terror by terrifying U.S. citizens|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Fighting-terror-by-terrifying-U-S-citizens-2752084.php|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle ]]''|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=November 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In the 2008 British television series [[The Last Enemy (TV series)|''The Last Enemy'']], Total Information Awareness (TIA) is portrayed as a UK-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody effectively by putting all available government information in one place.

'''''Tragic Lovers''''' is a classical music album by the [[Oregon Symphony]] under the [[Artistic director (music)|artistic direction]] of [[James DePreist]], released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tragic-lovers-mw0001408043|title=Tragic Lovers|work=''AllMusic''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'' (1865), [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name=WDAV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdav.org/1_180_412.cfm?date=1/18/2009|title=New Classics|publisher=[[WDAV]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s of the album; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine and Adam Stern. The album's creation was financially supported by the Gretchen Brooks Recording Fund, which supported two recording sessions per year for each of DePreist's final five years as music director.&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Keeping Score|date=June 16, 2001|page=37|accessdate=April 22, 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Steve|last=Smith|volume=113|number=24|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tragic Lovers'' was the orchestra's final recording with DePreist — who left the Oregon Symphony in April 2003 — as [[Conducting|conductor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orsymphony.org/news/0203/apr18_CL14.html|title=James DePreist Finishes Classical Season with "Emperor" Piano Concerto Performed by Pianist Horacio Gutiérrez and Brahms' Symphony No. 4|date=April 18, 2003|publisher=Oregon Symphony|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.

Compositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including [[Public Radio Exchange]], [[WDAV]], New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) and [[Northwest Public Radio]]. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death. The Classical Music Sentinel published a positive review of the album, comparing it to a three-movement symphony.

==Composition==
''Tragic Lovers'', released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008, contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'', [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''. The album contains three tracks, each one comprising a single composition and running more than fifteen minutes in length.&lt;ref name=Liner&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Tragic Lovers|others=[[Oregon Symphony]]|year=2008|type=booklet|publisher=[[Delos Productions|Delos]]|first1=Harry J.|last1=Pack|first2=Jim|last2=Svejda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine for the Wagner and Berlioz works and Adam Stern for the Tchaikovsky composition. The album was [[Audio engineer|engineered]] by John Eargle, with Andrés Villalta serving as associate engineer for the Wagner and Berlioz recordings. [[Digital audio editor|Editing]] was completed by Fine (Wagner, Berlioz) and Stern (Tchaikovsky).&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt; The album marked the orchestra's final recording with DePreist as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.&lt;ref name=Delos&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://browse.delosmusic.com/Tragic-Lovers-James-DePreist-p/de%203369.htm|title=Tragic Lovers|accessdate=March 28, 2013|publisher=Delos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasts==
All three compositions were featured on the [[Public Radio Exchange]] program "Compact Discoveries"; the Berlioz and Tchaikovsky recordings aired on an episode titled "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet", and the Wagner recording was part of the following episode, titled "More Famous Lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32486/transcripts/86770|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 151: Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet|accessdate=April 18, 2013|publisher=[[Public Radio Exchange]]|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 151: "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32686/transcripts/87170|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 152: More Famous Lovers|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=Public Radio Exchange|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 152: "More Famous Lovers".&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Joe Brant featured the album on his [[WDAV]] program "New Classics", which highlights newly released classical music recordings.&lt;ref name=WDAV/&gt; New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) aired two tracks from the album: the Tchaikovsky recording was broadcast in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=726746&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 21, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Berlioz track aired in November 2010 and again on February 11, 2013, following DePreist's death on February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624057&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 02, 2010|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624331&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 03, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=847754&amp;eventID=209404|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Feb 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlioz recording also aired on the [[Northwest Public Radio]] program "Classical Music with Robin Rilette" on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.publicbroadcasting.net/nwpr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=845309&amp;eventID=229836|title=NWPR Playlists: Classical Music with Robin Rilette: Robin Rilette: Feb 01, 2013|publisher=[[Northwest Public Radio]] ([[Washington State University]])|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony.&lt;ref name=Duperron&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicalmusicsentinel.com/collections/collection-lovers.html|title=Collection – Tragic Lovers – James DePreist (Conductor) – Oregon Symphony Orchestra – Delos DE3369|accessdate=March 28, 2013|first=Jean-Yves|last=Duperron|publisher=Classical Music Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition "works perfectly" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a "central movement" for its more "pleasant" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and "tumultuous" qualities.&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt; Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions "loud and clear", and specifically highlighted the "massive walls of sound" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances "with clean and powerful dynamics throughout" and concluded the review by quipping: "This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!"&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt;

==Track listing==
#"Prelude and 'Liebestod' from ''Tristan and Isolde''" ([[Richard Wagner]]) – 17:14
#"'Love Scene' from ''Roméo et Juliette'', Op. 17" ([[Hector Berlioz]]) – 15:59

'''Vampire films''' have been a staple since the era of [[silent film]]s, so much so that the depiction of [[vampire]]s in popular culture is strongly based upon their depiction in films throughout the years. The most popular cinematic adaptation of [[Vampire literature|vampire fiction]] has been from [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', with over 170 versions to date. Running a distant second are adaptations of ''[[Carmilla]]'' by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. By 2005, Dracula had been the subject of more films than any other fictional character.

As folklore, vampires are defined by their need to feed on blood and on their manipulative nature; this theme has been held in common throughout the many adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;"vampire n."  The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Twelfth edition . Ed. Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  York University.  23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although vampires are usually associated with the [[horror film|horror]] (and sometimes [[Zombie film|zombie]] genre), vampire films may also fall into the [[drama film|drama]], [[action film|action]], [[science fiction]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[Comedy (genre)|comedy]] or [[fantasy]] genres, amongst others.

==History==

Early cinematic vampires in other such films as ''[[The Vampire (1913 film)|The Vampire]]'' (1913), directed by [[Robert G. Vignola]], were not [[undead]] bloodsucking fiends, but '[[Femme fatale|vamps]]'. Such [[femme fatale]]s were inspired by a poem by [[Rudyard Kipling]] called "The Vampire", composed in 1897. This poem was written as kind of commentary on a painting of a female vampire by [[Philip Burne-Jones]] exhibited in the same year. Lyrics from Kipling's poem: ''A fool there was ... '', describing a seduced man, were used as the title of the film ''[[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|A Fool There Was]]'' (1915) starring [[Theda Bara]] as the 'vamp' in question and the poem was used in the publicity for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Per the Oxford English Dictionary, ''vamp'' is originally English, used first by [[G. K. Chesterton]], but popularized in the American silent film ''The Vamp'', starring [[Enid Bennett]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An authentic supernatural vampire features in the landmark ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922 Germany, directed by [[F. W. Murnau]]) starring [[Max Schreck]] as the hideous [[Count Orlok]]. This was an unlicensed version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', based so closely on the novel that the estate sued and won, with all copies ordered to be destroyed. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. The destruction of the vampire, in the closing sequence of the film, by sunlight rather than the traditional stake through the heart proved very influential on later films and became an accepted part of vampire lore.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nina Auerbach (1997) "Vampires in the Light" in the Norton Critical edition of ''Dracula'': 389-404&lt;/ref&gt;

The next classic treatment of the vampire legend was an adaptation of the stage play based on [[Bram Stoker|Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) starring [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]. Lugosi's performance was so popular that his Hungarian accent and sweeping gestures became characteristics now commonly associated with Dracula.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Erik. Metamorphoses of the Vampire in Literature and Film : Cultural Transformations in Europe, 1732–1933. Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2010. Electronic.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the release of the film, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936), a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'', starring [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944) and ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945)—both starring [[John Carradine]]—and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948). While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other films during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula on-screen for the second (and last) time.

A transition between the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] tradition and the later [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] style is exemplified by the 1957 Mexican film ''[[El Vampiro]]'' that showed the vampire fangs (Universal did not).

Dracula was reincarnated for a new generation in [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] series, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as the Count. In the first of these films ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) the spectacular death of the title character through being exposed to the sun, reinforced this part of vampire lore, first established in ''Nosferatu'', and made it virtually axiomatic in succeeding films.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of the seven [[sequel]]s. A more faithful adaptation of Stoker's novel appeared as ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'' (1992) directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] though also identifying Count Dracula with the notorious medieval Balkan ruler [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Bartlett and Flavia Idriceanu (2005) ''Legends of Blood: The Vampire in History and Myth'': 42&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's ''Carmilla'' explored the topic of the [[lesbian vampire]]. Although implied in ''Dracula's Daughter'', the first openly lesbian vampire was in ''[[Blood and Roses]]'' (1960) by [[Roger Vadim]]. More explicit lesbian content was provided in [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]]'s [[The Karnstein Trilogy|Karnstein Trilogy]]. The first of these, ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'', (1970), starring [[Ingrid Pitt]] and [[Madeline Smith]], was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality. Later films in this subgenre such as ''[[Vampyres (film)|Vampyres]]'' (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.

Beginning with ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) the vampire has often been the subject of comedy. ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) by [[Roman Polanski]] was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include ''[[Vampira (1974 film)|Vampira]]'' (1974) featuring [[David Niven]] as a lovelorn Dracula, ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979) featuring [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], ''[[My Best Friend Is a Vampire]]'' (1988), ''[[Innocent Blood (film)|Innocent Blood]]'' (1992), ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1992), ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' (1995), directed by [[Mel Brooks]] with [[Leslie Nielsen]], and, more recently, [[Taika Waititi]] and [[Jemaine Clement]]'s [[mockumentary]] take on the subject, ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'' (2014).

Another development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964, directed by Ubaldo Ragona), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971 US, directed by [[Boris Sagal]]) and two other films were all based on [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''. They explain the condition as having a natural cause. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' (1976) and ''Red-Blooded American Girl'' (1990) directed by David Blyth, as well as in the [[Blade (film series)|''Blade'' trilogy]] to a limited extent.

Race has been another theme, as exemplified by the [[blaxploitation]] picture ''[[Blacula]]'' (1972) and its sequel ''[[Scream Blacula Scream]]''.

Though always a representation of passion and desire, since the time of Béla Lugosi's ''Dracula'' (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. [[Christopher Lee]], [[Delphine Seyrig]], [[Frank Langella]], and [[Lauren Hutton]] are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex-appeal into their portrayal of the vampire. Latterly the implicit sexual themes of vampire film have become much more overt, culminating in such films as ''Gayracula'' (1983) and ''The Vampire of Budapest'', (1995), two [[Pornography|pornographic]] all-male vampire films, and ''Lust for Dracula'' (2005), a [[softcore pornography]] all-[[lesbian]] adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic.

There is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal ''Nosferatu'' (1922) in which the portrayal of the vampire is similar to the hideous creature of European folklore. [[Max Schrek]]'s disturbing portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by [[Klaus Kinski]] in [[Werner Herzog]]'s remake ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' (1979). In ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]'' (2000). directed by [[E. Elias Merhige]], [[Willem Dafoe]] plays Max Schrek, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Dafoe's character is the ugly, disgusting creature of the original ''Nosferatu''. [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'' (1979) notably depicts vampires as terrifying, simple-minded creatures, without erotism, and with the only desire to feed on the blood of others. The main vampire in the [[Subspecies (film series)|Subspecies]] films, Radu, also exhibits similar aesthetic influences, such as long fingers and nails and generally grotesque facial features. This type of vampire is also featured in the film [[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]].

A major character in most vampire films is the [[vampire hunter]], of which Stoker's [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in ''[[Vampires (film)|Vampires]]'' 1998, directed by [[John Carpenter]], Jack Crow ([[James Woods]]) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters, and in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1992, directed by [[Fran Rubel Kuzui]]), writer [[Joss Whedon]] (who created TV's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'') attached The Slayer, [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Kristy Swanson]] in the film, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in the TV series), to a network of [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watchers]] and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.

===Dracula in films and his legacy===
{{Further|Dracula in popular culture}}
{{Main|List of vampire films}}
By far, the most well-known and popular vampire in the films is [[Count Dracula]]. An amazing number of films have been filmed over the years depicting the evil count, some of which are ranked among the greatest depictions of vampires on film. Dracula has over 170 film representations to date making him the most frequently portrayed character in horror films; also he has highest number of film appearances overall followed by [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?s=tt&amp;q=dracula&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=Find - IMDb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?s=tt&amp;q=Sherlock%20Holmes&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=Find - IMDb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vampire television series ===
{{Main|List of vampire television series}}

==== Live action ====
One of the first television series with a vampire as a main character was the 1964 comedy series ''[[The Munsters]]''. [[Lily Munster]] and [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]] (also known as Vladimir Dracula, Count of Transylvania) are vampires.

''The Munsters'' was followed in 1966 by the Gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', in which the vampire [[Barnabas Collins]] became a main character. 

In 1985 ''[[The Little Vampire]]'' was a television series made for children. It tells the adventures of the vampire child Rüdiger and his human friend Anton.

''[[Forever Knight]]'' (1992–1996) was the first vampire detective story, later followed by many similar series like ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Moonlight (TV series)|Moonlight]]'', ''[[Blood Ties (TV series)|Blood Ties]]'' and ''[[Vampire Prosecutor]]''.

In 1997 the teenage vampire series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' became popular around the world. Buffy is a teenage girl who finds out that she is a vampire slayer. She also finds herself drawn to a vampire.

''[[True Blood]]'' (2008) centers on the adventures of the telepathic waitress [[Sookie Stackhouse]] who falls in love with a vampire. In the same year [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] series ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'' became popular in Britain. It features an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in [[Bristol]].

In 2009 ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' told the story of the school girl [[Elena Gilbert]], who falls in love with vampire [[Stefan Salvatore]] but finds herself also drawn to Stefan's brother [[Damon Salvatore]].

''[[The Strain (TV series)|The Strain]]'' (2014) is based on [[The Strain|the novel of the same name]] by [[Guillermo del Toro]].

==== Animation ====
One of the first animated vampire series was the 1989 series ''[[Count Duckula]]'', a parody of Dracula. In 1985, the anime film adaptation of the inaugural ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'' novel was released direct to video, and became popular in both Japan and the United States, prompting an adaptation of the third novel into the also direct to video film ''[[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]'' in 2000. The two films and the novels they are based on revolve around the eponymous D, a vampire hunter who is the apparent half-vampire/half-human son of Dracula who battles vampires in the year 12,090 AD. In 1997 the [[anime]] series ''[[Vampire Princess Miyu]]'' became popular in Japan, many other anime followed. Later in 2012, ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' was released, followed by a sequel in 2015, ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' and in 2018's ''[[Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation]].

Another Japanese anime series, ''[[Rosario + Vampire]]'', portrays one of the leading female characters, [[Moka Akashiya]], as a vampire, whose demonic powers are sealed inside her with a rosary seal on her neck. The series portrays other kinds of fictional monsters as well, including a [[witchcraft|witch]] and a [[Yuki-onna|snow-woman]].

=== Vampire web series ===
{{Main|List of vampire television series#Web series}}
From 2001 onward vampire web series became popular around the world. One of the first web series was the 2001 series ''[[The Hunted (web series)|The Hunted]]''. It is about a group of vampire slayers who have been bitten by vampires (but not yet turned into vampires) and try to fight the bloodsucking vampires. ''The Hunted'' was followed by ''[[30 Days of Night: Blood Trails]]'' (2007) and ''[[30 Days of Night: Dust to Dust]]'' (2008) who were based on the films ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' and ''[[30 Days of Night: Dark Days]]''. In 2009 the MTV online series ''[[Valemont]]'' follows Maggie Gracen who decides to infiltrate Valemont University, because her brother Eric has vanished. She soon finds out that the University is full of vampires. The 2009 web series ''[[I Heart Vampires]]'' focuses on two teenage vampire fans who find out that vampires are more than real. In 2011 the ''Being Human'' spin-off ''[[Becoming Human]]'' was released online. It is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who go to a school together and try to solve a murder. The 2014 vampire series ''[[Carmilla (series)|Carmilla]]'' tells the story of the vampire Carmilla Karnstein who visits the university and falls in love with a human girl.

== 2013 controversy ==
In December 2013, YouTube enabled automated Content ID claiming on videos uploaded by users who were signed with [[multi-channel network]]s (MCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/11/5200418/youtube-defends-copyright-crackdown|title=YouTube defends copyright crackdown|last=Campbell|first=Colin|date=2013-12-11|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, videos uploaded to channels that were linked to MCNs could only be claimed manually or removed with a [[Notice and take down|DMCA takedown]]. This led to a large amount of new claims which suddenly left uploaders unable to place advertisements on their videos until they disputed. Users such as [[Angry Joe]] created videos complaining about the changes and how they would negatively affect the livelihoods of video creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vargas|first=Joe|title=Youtube Copyright Disaster! Angry Rant|date=2013-12-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQfHdasuWtI|accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden increase in claims especially affected channels which uploaded content featuring video games (such as [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Plays]]) and movies (such as reviews).

==Fine Brothers controversy==
{{Main|React (media franchise)#React World}}

Popular YouTubers the [[Fine Brothers]], received criticism for their attempts to trademark and license content. Specifically, the brothers, who produce multiple series of "reaction videos", applied for trademarks in 2015 for the word "react" along with the names of their different series such as "Kids React" and "Adults React".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10906032/fine-brothers-youtube-trademark|title=The Fine Brothers tried to trademark YouTube reaction videos. The backlash changed their minds.|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By having these terms trademarked, the Fine Bros. could use Youtube's copyright system to help them remove videos similar to their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, they announced React World, a program where people could use the Fine Bros.'s icons to make their own videos for free, but there were limitations that their content must be monetized on YouTube (with Google AdSense) and that the Fine Bros. would take some of the money that the creator made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That started to cause controversy with the Fine Bros. and the "Reaction" video genre to the point where the Fine Bros. cancelled the program and lost more than 400,000 subscribers, by some accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the criticism, the Fine Bros. also rescinded their trademarks and applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==2015–present fair use controversy==
{{see also|Digital Homicide Studios#Lawsuits}}
Outcries arose from the YouTube community in late 2015 and onward, regarding the unfair removal of YouTube videos and even entire channels based upon allegations of [[copyright infringement]], many of which were invalid as no [[fair use]] laws were broken. Much of the controversy erupted when a review of the film ''Cool Cat Saves the Kids'' by the channel I Hate Everything was removed from YouTube on November 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foxworth|first=Chris|date=13 November 2015|title=Daddy Derek: The Wiseau-Tier filmmaker and his fall from viral fame to viral hatred.|url=https://medium.com/the-foxworth/daddy-derek-the-wiseau-tier-filmmaker-and-his-fall-from-viral-fame-to-viral-hatred-da5e52eacca4#.3xhx8dno7|location=TheFoxworth|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos by large channels such as [[Channel Awesome]] and [[Markiplier]] were being taken down and deleted from the website; complaints sparked across YouTube, as well as on the social media site [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Mark|date=4 February 2016|title=The Trouble With YouTube|url=https://www.wow247.co.uk/2016/02/04/fine-brothers-i-hate-everything-copyright-strikes-the-trouble-with-youtube/|publisher=Wow 24/7|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morning"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chingcuangco|first=Alexi|date=21 February 2016|title=YouTube Fair Use: Nostalgia Critic, Alex of I Hate Everything, Markiplier Rally Against Unjust Copyrights|url=http://www.morningledger.com/youtube-fair-use-nostalgia-critic-alex-hate-everything-markiplier-rally-unjust-copyrights/1358695/|location=Morning Ledger|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2016, YouTube CEO [[Susan Wojcicki]] responded to the controversy on Twitter, writing "Thank you @YouTube community for all the feedback. We're listening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tamburro|first=Paul|date=27 February 2016|title=YouTube Responds to #WTFU, Claims it Will "Strengthen Communication with Creators"|url=http://www.craveonline.com/design/958857-youtube-responds-wtfu-claims-will-strengthen-communication-creators|location=|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the May 24, 2016, YouTube user Matt Hosseinzadeh sued Ethan and Hila Klein of the YouTube channel [[H3h3Productions|h3h3productions]] citing a video that criticized his content. Fellow YouTube user [[Philip DeFranco]] started a [[GoFundMe]] fundraiser entitled "Help for H3H3".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/05/26/h3h3productions-gofundme-raises-100000-philip-defranco-markiplier-pewdiepie/|title=GoFundMe For H3h3productions' Copyright Suit Raises $100,000 From Philip DeFranco, Markiplier, PewDiePie|date=2016-05-26|website=Tubefilter|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative raised over $130,000. The Kleins later uploaded a video where they announced that any funds from the fundraiser left over from their lawsuit would be entrusted in to a 'Fair Use Protection Account', which other users could request assistance from in the event they were sued for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=h3h3Productions|title=A New Chapter for Fair Use on YouTube|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix4mTekl3MM|accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2016, YouTuber and freelance video game critic [[Jim Sterling]] included clips of footage from [[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain|''Metal Gear Solid V'']], ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'', as well as the song "[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]", in a video largely discussing ''[[Star Fox Zero]]''. Sterling explained this at the end of the video as a way of preventing [[Nintendo]] from claiming and monetizing the video by including other material which was similarly flagged by Content ID, hoping that multiple claims would prevent anyone from monetizing the video and running advertisements on his channel, which is intended to be ad-free and funded solely by [[Patreon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=27 April 2016|title=Game Critic Uses Brilliant Workaround For YouTube's Copyright Bullshit|url=http://kotaku.com/game-critic-uses-brilliant-workaround-for-youtubes-copy-1773452452|location=|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up video, he claimed that the technique, which he termed the "copyright deadlock" had succeeded, as the video received multiple ContentID claims, one of which attempted to monetize the video, while two others prevented any monetization, allowing the video to run advertisement-free. Sterling stated that this was indicative of a poorly designed system on YouTube's part, as a video which was well within the bounds of fair use had attracted three copyright claims. He also claimed that he would continue to include material which had previously received Content ID claims in videos likely to attract monetization attempts from the copyright owners, since fair use was not protecting his videos from copyright claims, pointing out that he now felt incentivized to use as much copyrighted material in his videos as possible, the opposite of what YouTube's copyright policies were intended to achieve.

*Satya Yuga (also known as Krita Yuga "Golden Age"): The first and best Yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This Yuga has Zero Percent of Crime and Hundred Percent of Kindness. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were gigantic, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*Treta Yuga: Is considered to be the second Yuga in order, however Treta means the "Third". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. Oceans and deserts are formed.  People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*Dvapara Yuga: Is considered to be the third Yuga in order.  Dvapara means "two pair" or "after two". In this age, people become tainted with [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamasic]] qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.
*Kali Yuga: The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People become sinners and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished.  Families become non-existent. By the end of Kali Yuga the average lifespan of humans will be as low as 70 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Durations of the four Yugas==
[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|frame|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]

According to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:&lt;ref name=penprase182/&gt;
* Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&amp;f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Together, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga and equal 4.32 million human years.&lt;ref name=penprase182&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4.32 billion human years. A Mahakalpa consists of 100 years of Brahma.&lt;ref name=penprase182/&gt;

According to [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19, which most scholars agree was composed around 500 to 1000 CE, the Yugas are much longer, using a divine year in which one day is equal to one human year, thus:
{{quote|one year of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|demigod]]s is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 x 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 x 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 x 360, or 864,000 years.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://vedabase.com/sb/3/11/19/|title=SB 3.11.19|first=|last=|access-date=15 July 2011|website=vedabase.com|date=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Viṣṇu Purāṇa Time measurement section of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa Book I Chapter III adds:

* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.
* 12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mahā-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva (divine) Yuga).
* 2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.

While the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.

==Decline==
The ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.
* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' –  Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits. Average human lifespan was 100,000 years.
* ''[[Treta Yuga]]'' – There was 3 quarter virtue and 1 quarter sin. Normal human stature was 14 cubits. Average human lifespan was 10,000 years.
* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]'' – There was 1 half virtue &amp; 1 half sin. Normal human stature was 7 cubits. Average human lifespan was 1,000 years.
* ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' – There is 1 quarter virtue &amp; 3 quarter sin. Normal human stature is 3.5 cubits. Average human lifespan will be 100 years.

In the present days we may be said to live in a ''Kali Yuga'', which is said to have started in 3102 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4DZYbWQbKAsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Richter-Ushanas+indus+script+and+the+rgveda#v=onepage&amp;q=yuga&amp;f=false|title=The Indus Script and Rg-veda|page=16|first=Egbert|last=Richter-Ushanas|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=1997|isbn=9788120814059}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the end of the [[Kurukshetra War|Mahabharata war]]. This date is also considered by many Hindus to be the day that [[Krishna]] left Earth and went to his abode.{{efn|According to [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], guru of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]],  The ascending  phase of the Kali Yuga began in September 499 CE. Since September 1699, we have been in the ascending phase of the Dwapara Yuga. According to Sri Yukteswar, nobody wanted to announce the bad news of the beginning of the descending Kali Yuga, so they kept adding years to the Dvapara date (at that time 2400 Dvapara) only retitling the epoch to Kali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Te-ftAEACAAJ&amp;dq=yukteswar+1949|title=The Holy Science|author=Swami Yukteswar|publisher=Yogoda Sat-Sanga Society of India|year=1949|page={{page missing|date=August 2018}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

is derived from the pronunciation of the words  "béł", "bëła" (Polish:  "był", "była", English: "was") as "bél", "bëla".&lt;ref name=karas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialektologia.uw.edu.pl/index.php?l1=leksykon-kaszubski&amp;lid=1089 |title=Dialektologia Polska |publisher=Dialektologia.uw.edu.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding group of dialects is called ''gwary bylackie''&lt;!--cannot find english term--&gt;.

The merger is attributed to the historical language contact with [[Low German]] being more intensive than with Polish compared to other Kashubian dialects.&lt;ref name=LiC/&gt;
