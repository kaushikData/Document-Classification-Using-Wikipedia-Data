==Biography==

===Early life===
Gordon was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], to James M. and Mary Clarkson Gordon, both Christian [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].  When she was three, her family moved to [[Auburndale, Massachusetts|Auburndale]].  She went on to attend [[Boston High School (Massachusetts)|Boston High School]], [[Lasall Seminary]], and [[Mount Holyoke College]].  She spent a year abroad in [[San Sebastián]] with her sister, [[Alice Gordon Gulick]], who had started a school for girls there in 1871.

===Woman's Christian Temperance Union===
[[File:Mrs Willard centre in London Annes E Slack to left.png|thumb|Temperance group in 1895, back l to r. Gordon, Mary E. Sanderson, (front) [[Agnes Elizabeth Slack]], [[Frances E. Willard]], and [[Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort|Lady Henry Somerset]]]]
In 1877, Gordon met [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances E. Willard]] at a [[Dwight L. Moody]] [[revival meeting]], in the building where Willard was holding temperance meetings.  Gordon's younger brother Arthur had died just days before, a traumatic event which had, as Willard later wrote, driven Gordon "Godward".  The two became close friends, with Gordon continuing to play organ for Willard's meetings.  Gordon eventually moved into Willard's residence as her personal secretary.  Gordon subsequently followed her employer on her travels through the United States, Canada and Europe, spending a year in England, mostly as the guests of [[Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort|Lady Henry Somerset]].

Gordon and Willard remained close friends until Willard's death in 1898, at which time [[Lillian M. N. Stevens]] became president of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], with Gordon as vice-president.  That same year, Gordon also wrote a memorial biography of Willard (expanded and reprinted in 1905).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon Lillian Stevens' death in 1914, Anna Adams Gordon became president of the WCTU.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], Gordon was instrumental in convincing [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] to harden the federal government's policies against the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, most notably by criminalizing the use of foodstuffs to make alcohol.  Later, in 1919, temperance organizations scored a major victory with the ratification of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which fully established [[prohibition in the United States]].  After this success, the WCTU under Gordon's guidance began to turn more towards temperance enforcement, and causes peripheral to the temperance movement, such as [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|citizenship for immigrants]], [[Feminism|women's rights in the workplace]], and [[child protection]].&lt;ref name="alcohol"/&gt;

In November 1922, she was elected president of the World Women's Temperance Union (WWCTU), and resigned her presidency of the national WCTU organization.

She died on June 15, 1931, in [[Castile, New York]].

==Works==
During Gordon's career, she also became president of the [[World League Against Alcoholism]], vice-president of the [[National Temperance Council]], and vice-chairman of the Commission of Nineteen on the National Constitutional Prohibition Amendment. She was deeply involved in temperance work with the [[International Council of Women|National Council of Women]], the International Sunday-School Association, the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the National Legislative Council, etc.&lt;ref name="alcohol"/&gt;

As a leader in the WCTU, Gordon was a staunch believer in the need to interest children in temperance at a very early age.  To that end, she authored a number of books of stories, verse, and song aimed at children, as well as publications for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

She was also the editor of the ''[[Union Signal]]'', the news organ of the WCTU, and ''[[The Young Crusader]]'', the newspaper of the [[Loyal Temperance Legion]], the WCTU's children's branch.

'''Backyard Worlds: Planet 9''' is a [[NASA]]-funded [[citizen science]] project which is part of the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] [[web portal]].&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA wants you to help find a new planet|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/16/us/nasa-search-worlds-trnd/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aims to discover new [[brown dwarf]]s and other low-mass stars, some of which might be among the [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|nearest neighbors of our solar system]], and might conceivably detect [[Planet Nine]].  The project's principal investigator is [[Marc Kuchner]], an astrophysicist at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="huntforplanet9"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt for Planet 9: how you can help NASA search for brown dwarfs and low-mass stars|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/Spacebound/2017/0217/Hunt-for-Planet-9-how-you-can-help-NASA-search-for-brown-dwarfs-and-low-mass-stars|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=17 February 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Backyard Worlds was launched in February 2017 shortly before the 87th anniversary of the discovery of [[Pluto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/backyard-worlds-planet-9|title=Backyard Worlds: Planet 9|website=nasa.gov|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which until [[Pluto#IAU classification|its reclassification]] as a [[dwarf planet]] in 2006 was considered the Solar System's ninth major planet.  Since that reclassification evidence has come to light that there may be another planet located in the outer region of the Solar System far beyond the [[Kuiper belt]], most commonly referred to as [[Planet Nine]].  This hypothetical new planet would be located so far from the Sun that it would reflect only a very small amount of visible light, rendering it too faint to be detected in most [[astronomical survey]]s conducted to date.&lt;ref name=lurking&gt;{{cite news |last=Achenbach |first=Joel |last2=Feltman |first2=Rachel |date=20 January 2016 |title=New evidence suggests a ninth planet lurking at the edge of the solar system |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/20/new-evidence-suggests-a-ninth-planet-lurking-at-the-edge-of-the-solar-system/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"/&gt;  Models of the conjectured planet's atmosphere suggest however that methane condensation could in some cases make it detectable in infrared images captured by the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fortney |first1=Jonathan J. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=The Hunt for Planet Nine: Atmosphere, Spectra, Evolution, and Detectability |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=824 |issue=2 |pages=L25 |arxiv=1604.07424 |bibcode=  2016ApJ...824L..25F|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/824/2/L25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the effects of [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] Planet Nine would appear to move in a distinctive way between images taken of the same patch of sky at different times.  In addition to Planet Nine other objects such as nearby brown dwarfs would also be seen to move.

The citizen scientists search through a [[flip book]]-style animation of specially processed infrared images captured by WISE, taken with filters at the wavelengths of 3.4 and 4.6 [[Micrometre|micrometer]]s. The images contain [[Artifact (error)|instrumental artifacts]] and are [[image noise|noisy]], which hampers the use of automated [[image processing]] software and makes the task ideal for exploiting human visual recognition capabilities.&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huntforplanet9"/&gt;

The project has been awarded a grant from NASA's Astrophysics Data Analysis Program which will fund it until 2020.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180214"/&gt;

==Discoveries==
In June 2017, it was announced that Backyard Worlds had made its first official discovery: a brown dwarf designated [[WISEA 1101+5400]], of [[spectral type]] T5.5 and located 34 parsecs (111 light years) from Earth. A paper announcing the discovery was accepted for publication in ''[[Astrophysical Journal Letters]]'', and Backyard Worlds now holds the record among all Zooniverse projects as having the shortest time from project launch to first publication.&lt;ref name="blogpost20170608"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/06/08/our-first-paper-the-discovery-of-brown-dwarf-wisea-11015400/|title=Our First Paper: the Discovery of Brown Dwarf WISEA 1101+5400|date=8 June 2017|website=Blog.backyardworlds.org|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kuchner |first1=Marc J. |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=The First Brown Dwarf Discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=841 |issue=2 |pages=L19 |arxiv=1705.02919 |bibcode=  2017ApJ...841L..19K|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aa7200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, seven new brown dwarfs were confirmed, as well as two [[Subdwarf#Cool subdwarfs|cool subdwarf]]s. The spectral types of the new brown dwarfs were T0, T2.8, T5, T6, T6.5, and two of type T8. In addition, there were 337 brown dwarf candidates awaiting spectra for confirmation.&lt;ref name="blogpost20171222"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/12/22/snow-white-and-the-seven-new-confirmed-brown-dwarfs/|title=Snow White and the Seven New Confirmed Brown Dwarfs|date=22 December 2017|website=Blog.backyardworlds.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the first anniversary of the project in February 2018, the project has so far discovered 17 brown dwarfs and two cool subdwarfs. The coldest object discovered is of spectral type T9, which raises hopes of discovering type Y dwarfs in the future. In addition, a spectrum was also taken of one possibly variable object of unknown type that does not actually exhibit proper motion. There are 432 objects of interest awaiting verification, of which 38 are Y dwarf candidates.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180214"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2018/02/14/we-love-you-and-happy-anniversary/|title=We Love You!

In July 2018 an update on the project's blog stated that in total 42 brown dwarfs have so far been spectroscopically confirmed from a list of 879 candidates.  Fourteen of those confirmed are closer to the solar system than {{convert|20|pc|ly|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180711"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2018/07/11/42-confirmed-brown-dwarfs-and-counting/|title=42 Confirmed Brown Dwarfs and Counting

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The status of '''cannabis in [[North Korea]]''' is unclear due to the lack of sources available to the outside world, with some observers stating that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is effectively legal, or at least tolerated, in the country and others arguing that this is a misapprehension and that the drug is illegal.

==History==
===Early history===
Cannabis was an important crop in ancient Korea, with samples of hempen fabric discovered dating back as early as 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Duvall2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Duvall|title=Cannabis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVU8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30|date=15 November 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-386-4|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[sambe]] cloth is made from [[hemp]].&lt;ref name="koreaexpose1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh |first=Emily |url=http://www.koreaexpose.com/in-depth/drugs-south-korea-a-silent-crisis/ |title=Drugs in South Korea: A Silent Crisis &amp;#124; KOREA EXPOSĂ‰ |publisher=Koreaexpose.com |date=2016-10-21 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern accounts===
In 2010, the American NGO [[Open Radio for North Korea]] stated that their source informed them that a crackdown on meth had been announced in [[Hamkyungbuk-do]], but that the crackdown was focused on methamphetamine, with opium and marijuana not being considered "drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.nkradio.org/news/286|title= Drug Users Face Firing Squad |date=27 October 2010|publisher=Open Radio for North Korea }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, citing sources at [[NK News]] and [[Reddit]], [[Vice News]] reported that cannabis was widely used and tolerated in North Korea, smoked as ''ipdambae'' (잎담배, "leaf tobacco") by the lower classes as a cheap alternative to cigarettes and to relax after a day of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-is-stoned-all-the-time-which-explains-a-lot|title=North Korea Smokes Weed Every Day, Explaining a Lot - VICE - United States|date=16 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lexi De Coning of [[MassRoots]], it is fairly common for North Koreans to grow their own marijuana, or to simply harvest marijuana plants which grow wild across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/global-marijuana-policies-4-countries-with-unexpected-regulations/|title=Global Marijuana Policies: 4 Countries with Unexpected Regulations - MassRoots|date=15 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a reply by journalist Keegan Hamilton in a 2014 article in ''The Guardian'' sought to debunk these as rumors. He cited Matthew Reichel of the [[Pyongyang Project]] who notes that ipdambae is actually a mixture of herbs and tobacco, superficially resembling cannabis but unrelated. Cannabis is cultivated industrially, but in the form of low-THC hemp, and while some people may cultivate personal amounts of psychoactive cannabis, its use is not condoned, though it is also unlikely to be punished severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/mythbusters-uncovering-the-truth-about-north-korea-cannabis-metro|title=Mythbusters: uncovering the truth about North Korea|first1=Maeve|last1=Shearlaw|first2=North Korea|last2=experts|date=13 May 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Care work''' is a sub-category of [[Employment|work]] that includes all tasks that directly involve care processes done in service of others. It is often differentiated from other forms of work because it is considered to be intrinsically motivated, meaning that people are motivated to pursue care work for reasons other than financial compensation.&lt;ref name=Video_trans&gt;{{cite web|last1=Folbre|first1=Nancy|author-link1=Nancy Folbre|title=Caring labor - transcription of a video by Oliver Ressler, recorded in Amherst, USA|url=http://www.republicart.net/disc/aeas/folbre01_en.htm|publisher=Republic Art|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor that is often used to differentiate caring labor from other types of work is the motivating factor. This perspective defines care labor as labor undertaken out of affection or a sense of responsibility for other people, with no expectation of immediate pecuniary reward.&lt;ref name=Paradox&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link= Nancy Folbre | title = "Holding hands at midnight": the paradox of caring labor | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–92 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/714042215 | date = 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/714042215 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of motivation, care work includes care activities done for pay as well as those done without remuneration.

Care work refers to those occupations that provide services that help people develop their capabilities, or the ability to pursue the aspects of their lives that they value. Examples of these occupations include [[child care]], all levels of [[teaching]] (from [[preschool]] through university [[professors]]), and [[health care]] of all types ([[nurses]], [[physician|doctors]], [[physical therapists]] and [[psychologists]]).&lt;ref name=England_1&gt;{{Cite journal | last = England | first = Paula | title = Emerging theories of care work | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume =31 | pages= 381–399 | publisher= Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.31.041304.122317 | date = 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.31.041304.122317 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care work also includes the array of [[domestic work|domestic unpaid work]] that is often disproportionately performed by [[women]].&lt;ref name="UN_1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Development Report 1999 |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/260/hdr_1999_en_nostats.pdf | page=77 | format=PDF |year=1999  |publisher=United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care work is frequently focused on the responsibility to provide for dependents, such as [[children]], the [[illness|sick]], and the [[elderly]].&lt;ref name=UN_1999 /&gt; However, care work also refers to any work done in the immediate service of others, regardless of the recipient's dependent or nondependent status, and can even extend to "animals and things."&lt;ref name="OHara" /&gt;

The study of care work is closely linked with the fields of [[feminist economics]] and [[feminist legal theory]], and is associated with scholars including [[Marilyn Waring]], [[Nancy Folbre]], [[Martha Albertson Fineman]], Paula England, Maria Floro, [[Diane Elson]], Caren Grown and [[Virginia Held]].

==Importance==

[[File:Abbey of Port-Royal, Caring for the Sick by Magdeleine Hortemels c. 1710.jpg|thumb|left|Effective care for the sick allows people to remain productive and continue contributing to society.]]

The products of care work are essential to human [[well-being]]. Without genuine care and nurturing, it is thought that children cannot develop into high-functioning individuals, and adults have a hard time maintaining or expanding their well-being and productivity.&lt;ref name=UN_1999 /&gt; Actively involved childcare, whether provided in the [[home]] or by the [[private sector]], contributes to the development of healthy and productive children. Effective care for the sick allows recipients to remain productive and continue contributing to society. In this sense, care work is directly related to the health of a society as well as to the [[economic development]] of that society in that well-cared for people can more effectively contribute to the [[Market (economics)|market]].  Care work is responsible for creating both social capital and human capital.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt;

Caring for others is often costly, which is why care work is associated with the “care penalty”.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Gerald 2012 pp. 112-115"&gt;Friedman, Gerald (2012), Microeconomics: Individual Choice in Communities, Ed. 5.1, Amherst: independently published, pp. 112-115, {{ISBN|978-1-939402-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This penalty is so named because a person's work caring for others is often not compensated by any monetary means. It has been suggested that individuals who don’t take care of others—especially the next generation—will not be capable of reproducing themselves.  The implication is that the receipt of care is often necessary for individuals to reach the stage of life where they can go on to care for others.&lt;ref name=NF_Powerpoint&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Nancy Folbre | title = "The care penalty" in "The invisible heart: economics and family values" | medium = Powerpoint presentation | publisher = Dr. Jennifer E. Horan, University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW) | location = Wilmington, North Carolina | date = | url = http://people.uncw.edu/horanj/PLS316/The%20Invisible%20Heart.ppt }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument suggests that care is necessary for the development of human life and, on a larger scale, for functional societies. The target of teaching individuals to care for others may lead to forms of distributional struggle, particularly along gender lines.

A popular belief in economics is that the household sector is a wealth spender rather than a wealth creator, although many argue that the household sector plays a very important role in wealth creation. Unlike the business sector, the wealth created by the household sector is not financial wealth, which is unsurprising in that much of the work done in the household sector is unpaid. The resulting wealth falls into the category of social wealth because the care work that parents perform in raising a child increases that child's ability to perform in society later. As a whole, the individuals who benefit from having received care perform better in academic and social settings, enabling them to create financial wealth later in life and to play a part in increasing social capital.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt;

Sabine O’Hara offers an expanded concept of the role of care in the economy, arguing that not only people, but "everything needs care." Foregrounding what is often treated as "context" and highlighting the sustaining nature of care services offered outwith the formal economy, she sees care as the basis of market economies.&lt;ref name="OHara"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O’Hara|first1=Sabine|editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first =Margunn|editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first =Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay|title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|url=|year=2014|format=|location=Bradford|publisher=[[Demeter Press]]|pages=37–56|chapter=Everything Needs Care: Toward a Context-Based Economy|isbn=9781927335277|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sbh8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who does care work?==

Before the Industrial Revolution, care work (such as taking care of the household and raising children) was done by the entire family, and often involved the contributions of an entire community. In this sense, the core sphere was not seen as separate from daily business interactions, because the idea of the market did not yet exist as it does today. With the dawn of the Industrial Era, the core sphere became more separate from jobs and business, which were performed outside and away from the home. Largely as a product of patriarchal societies, men became the ones who left the home to do their work in factories and other non-domestic jobs. Women, who were considered better suited to nurturing, were left at home and expected to provide childcare and do the housework. This familial hierarchy persisted and has continued to show itself in the contemporary American family, with a breadwinner father, a homemaker mother, and their children. As women's duties in the home were not seen as part of any economic market, they were believed to be unimportant and were largely ignored.&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;{{Citation | last = Goodwin | first = Neva | contribution = The Core Sphere: households and communities / households and communities as organizations / the core sphere in historical perspective / work/family challenges / theories of household behavior | editor-last1 = Goodwin | editor-first1 = Neva | editor-last2 = Ackerman | editor-first2 = Frank | editor-last3 = Nelson | editor-first3 = Julie A. | editor-last4 = Weisskopf | editor-first4 = Thomas | editor-link2 = Frank Ackerman | editor-link3 = Julie A. Nelson | title = Microeconomics in context | pages = 355–356 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780618345991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue persists today in the field of economics. Acts performed in the home often carry considerable replacement costs but are not factored into productivity.  It is possible to pay others to perform many of the tasks associated with care work, but to do so is often prohibitively expensive.  When adding up the potential costs of work such as round-the-clock childcare, housekeeping, cooking, and the cost of a person such as a home health aide to provide care for elderly family members, it proves much more cost effective for families to substitute their time rather than pay the replacement cost.  While paid care work is considered employment, work undertaken by family members is not counted as productive towards the economic market and is therefore overlooked when considering things such as employment status.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Gerald 2012 pp. 112-115"/&gt;

Despite persisting complications regarding the perception of care work, the economic environment has changed from what it was a century ago. Many more women now participate in the labor force at least part-time, and many more believe that the "cult of domesticity" for women of the 19th and 20th centuries is a thing of the past.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"/&gt; However, studies show that women have come to dominate caring professions - such as teaching, childcare, nursing, social work - and that most of these professions are paid considerably less than the occupations more frequently held by men. To add to this, women frequently are still expected to do the housework and to raise the children in many families. The persisting idea that care work is unimportant combined with these factors explains why care work continues to be ignored from an economic point of view, and why women still have a difficult time shirking gender roles.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt;

Many studies have shown that women provide the majority of unpaid childcare, while some have shown men to be more likely to support the elderly.  The comparative willingness of women to perform unpaid care work has historically contributed to the poor compensation received by people in care-based professions.  The historical and cultural pressure on women to provide these services without assurance of financial compensation has devalued care work, leading to these professions being heavily underpaid in comparison to professions which require a similar amount of training and work but are not equivalent to any domestically performed tasks.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Gerald 2012 pp. 112-115"/&gt;

Women also carry a heavier burden of care work in the home in comparison to men.  This is largely due to both biological differences and historical and cultural traditions. The biological differences explain that women show more affection and love in performing care work when compared with men. Historical and cultural traditions explain the widely held ideology of women's role in caring for others.&lt;ref name=NF_Powerpoint /&gt; In Nepal women work 21 more hours each week than men, and in India, 12 more hours. In [[Kenya]] 8- to 14-year-old girls spend 5 hours more on household chores than boys. In all these cases most of these extra work hours for women are spent on care work.&lt;ref name=UN_1999 /&gt; This poses a particular problem for women in that these extra hours of domestic care work translate into a difficult balance for women between market work and domestic work.&lt;ref name=Beneria_1&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Benería | first = Lourdes | authorlink = Lourdes Benería | title = The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–21 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/13545700802081984 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545700802081984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the division of household labor women have not been given many choices other than care work as patriarchal systems have used their physical force, property rights, and cultural norms to force women to take over specializations that are deemed unfit for men.

The historical push of women into care work combined with the contemporary dominance of women in these fields, accounts for the modern conceptions that care work is inherently feminine work. However, care work is not naturally feminized. Instead, care work is only socialized into a feminine sphere, and is also done by males. Despite the social nature of the feminization of care work, it has become so feminized that there is often a stigma against men who engage in care work.&lt;ref name=Invisible_xv&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | page = xv | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stigma may discourage men from entering care work as well as further propagate the belief that care work is inherently women's work.

Furthermore, there are many differences in earning between high school graduates and college graduates. This difference is especially pertinent between male and female individuals searching for a job. If unemployed, the differences between the rates of high school graduates and college graduates may even be similar. However, women tend to find more opportunities in unpaid care work if they are unable to get into the paid work force. If individuals are unable to achieve a degree, they will not meet the threshold of what many jobs require. This inevitability is felt by much of the world population who are unable to attend school due to staying in their household to take care of elderly or sick family members.&lt;ref name=NF_Powerpoint /&gt;

Recently, individual people are not the only ones who claim to provide care. An increasing number of companies are claiming that they will care for you in order to attract you into purchasing their services. For example, Lufthansa, an airline company, had an advertisement that read, "Service as dependable as a shoulder to lean on." The accompanying picture displayed a woman leaning her head on a man's shoulder, with both sound asleep. In this case, the take-away message seems to be that a high degree of care translates into high quality. Another airline company, British Airways, had an ad that displayed the same message. It read, "New Club World cradle seat. Lullaby not included." The image accompanying the statement showed a woman caring for a baby in her arms. The baby's head, however, was switched with that of a relaxed and content passenger. These are only a few of the companies that are now promoting themselves as care-oriented in order to gain customers.&lt;ref name=NF_Powerpoint2&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Nancy Folbre | title = Selling care | medium = Powerpoint presentation | date = 2011 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baumol Effect==
{{main|Baumol's cost disease}}
Caring for others has sparked a lot of controversy as the market prices of items that are required for care increase and just as many care opportunities continue to be non-paid. The costs are increasing and the relative rise of price for the services is not providing any substitutes; this is known as the [[Baumol's cost disease|Baumol Effect]]. William Baumol and William Bowen describe the Baumol Effect as when there is a relative rise of price of services without substitutes. For example, the costs of childcare and sending children to college have become notably higher than in recent years. To further the pressure on caregivers, elderly lives are increasing and there are fewer siblings to share elder care responsibilities as there were, for example, during the baby boom. However, one issue to note about this effect is people taking advantage of others due to rising costs of items needed for care. The Nice Person's Dilemma is a risk that opportunists will take when they seize advantage of those who are generous and cooperative.&lt;ref name=NF_Powerpoint /&gt; If the Baumol effect occurs, many will take advantage of these “Nice Persons” and act as if they will pay them back, but never do because of the higher prices. This dilemma proves why ''individuals'' are unable to make any change in community care. It takes ''whole communities'' to commit this change in order for the communities to gain from provided care and make sure that people do not cheat the system through the Nice Person's Dilemma.

==Care work and the market==
[[File:Altenpflege.jpg|thumb|right|Care work of a volunteer]]
Today, there are four parts of the economy: Business, Household, Public, and Non-profit. Typically, we only think that the business sector creates any wealth, and that the other three serve the business sector and alongside it. The truth is that all four parts of the economy generate wealth, and that wealth flows over into other sections of the economy as well. Part of the reason that unpaid care work is largely ignored is because of this belief that the household does not form wealth. In reality, the household prepares children for the other parts of the economy, and without that, none of the other sectors would flourish.&lt;ref name=Lecture&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elson|first1=Diane|author-link1=Diane Elson|title=Transcript of lecture "Unpaid work: creating social wealth or subsidizing patriarchy and private profit?"|date=1 December 2005|location=Forum on Social Wealth - The Levy Economics Institute, University of Massachusetts, Amherst|url = http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/dpe/fsw/Diane.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically care work has largely been associated with [[domestic worker|domestic]] [[unpaid work]], yet with the growth and changing nature of the market, care work is occurring more frequently in the paid sphere than it has in the past.&lt;ref name=UN_1999 /&gt; This shift has dramatic implications on both care work itself and on society as a whole. As care work is increasingly marketized there is a possibility that those that need care—the sick, the elderly and children—will not be able to afford the care they need.&lt;ref name=Invisible_xv /&gt; Another concern is that the quality of care may decrease in response to the call for profit-making and efficiency.&lt;ref name=Invisible_xv /&gt;

As a consequence of these and other concerns, this marketization of care work is under much public and academic scrutiny. These discussions focus on an array of issues including explanations for the endemic low-pay of care work, the effects of the market on the quality of care work, and the implications of the market on care workers themselves. Five particularly prominent theories of care work including[[#Devaluation theory|devaluation theory]], [[#Public good theory|public good theory]], [[#Prisoner of love theory|prisoner of love theory]], [[#Commoditization of emotion theory|commoditization of love theory]] and [[#love and money theory|love and money theory]] are frameworks by which academics study and explain these phenomena.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; Each of these theories examines care work in relation to the market.

=== Devaluation theory ===

Devaluation theory seeks to explain the low-wages that are typical of care work by focusing on the fact that many care workers are women and that [[sexism|gender-based biases]] remain in societies. In short, devaluation theory asserts that decision makers under- estimate the contribution of female dominated jobs to organizational goals, including profits, and therefore underpay these workers.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt;

The devaluation theory is supported by sociological studies. In 2002, sociologist Paula England conducted a studying that revealed, even after controlling for skill demands, educational requirements, industry, and sex composition, a net penalty of 5%–10% for working in an occupation involving care was found (one exception was [[nursing]], which did not seem to experience the pay penalty of other care work).&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; Overall, the evidence suggests that care work pays less than would be expected, given its educational and other requirements. However, it is not necessarily clear that this relation is caused by discriminatory factors, although it is a likely explanatory factor.

===Public good theory===

Care work has a multitude of indirect social benefits that associate it with a specific type of good known as a [[public goods]]; goods that have benefits that are impossible to deny to those who have not paid for them.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; [[Education]], an example of care work, is a classic example of a public good. Care work is unique in the category of public goods, however, in that receiving care also helps recipients develop skills, values, and habits that benefit themselves and others.&lt;ref name=Human_capital&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Folbre | first1 = Nancy | last2 = England | first2 = Paula | author-link1 = Nancy Folbre | contribution = Reconceptualizing human capital | editor-last1 = Raub | editor-first1 = Werner | editor-last2 = Wessie | editor-first2 = Jeroen | title = Valuing children rethinking the economics of the family | pages = 126–128 | publisher = Thela Thesis publishers | location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands | year = 2001 | isbn = 9789051705164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, care work, by developing peoples internal capacities, imbues them with future abilities to contribute to society in the form of a public good.

This theory may explain the low-wages characteristic of care work. The standard economic argument is that public goods will be underprovided by markets because there is no way to capture and turn into profits benefits that come through social interaction.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt;

===Prisoner of love theory===

Care work has been defined as work that provides services based on sustained personal interaction, and is motivated (at least in part) by concern about the recipient's welfare.&lt;ref name=Paradox /&gt; This understanding of care work has distinct effects both on the nature and wages of care work. If care workers are actually motivated by an intrinsic value for the work which they do, then economic theory asserts that they will tolerate lower wages for their work.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; In this sense, the low-wages of care work may be explained. Further, the connection that these workers feel to their work puts them in a poor bargaining position.&lt;ref name=Invisible_40&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = The care penalty | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | page = 40 | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, nurses may be reluctant to strike because a strike would negatively affect their patients whom they care about.

===Commoditization of emotion theory===

Commoditization of emotion theory focuses on the effects of marketized care work on the care workers’ personal experiences and individual well-being. The commoditization of emotion theory asserts that many jobs in the new service economy require workers to act emotions they do not really feel and that this process is harmful to workers.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; For example, the commoditization of childcare may be overly emotionally exhausting on childcare workers due to the conflict between the natural emotions of this job and these workers’ need for pay. Arlie Russell Hochschild explores this theory in [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|The Managed Heart]].

=== “Love and Money” theory ===

The “Love and Money” theory attempts to reconcile the perceived divide between work done for intrinsic motivation and work done for pay. Theorists assert that because male and female are seen as opposite, and because gender schema organize so much of our thinking, we develop a dualistic view that “women, love, altruism, and the family are, as a group, radically separate and opposite from men, self-interested rationality, work, and market exchange.”&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; This belief has led to the idea that care work should not be done for pay because pay will undermine the intrinsic motivations for this work. However, studies have shown that these divides may not be so stark. Instead, it has been found that acknowledging rewards send the message that the recipient is trusted, respected, and appreciated These results suggest that the more that pay is combined with trust and appreciation, the less it drives out genuine intrinsic motivation—especially important in care work.&lt;ref name=England_1 /&gt; As a result, theorists argue that the central problem with care work is under-demand and that care work should be better compensated by the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nelson | first = Julie A. | authorlink = Julie A.

== Care work and public policy ==

The debate surrounding care work has specific policy implications ranging from issues of market structure, work environments, incentive schemes, regulatory requirements, adequate financial support for care.&lt;ref name=Love_money&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Folbre | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Nelson | first2 = Julie A | authorlink1 = Nancy Folbre | authorlink2 = Julie A.

===Accounting for unremunerated care===
For example, The Unremunerated Work Act of 1993 would require the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] to conduct surveys that would measure [[feminist economics#Unpaid work|unpaid labor]] and include these measures in the [[GDP]]. This bill was supported by many but not all feminist economists. Critics argue that this bill would romanticize care work and propagate gender biases in the field. Other critics argue that care work can be performed more efficiently outside the home. Finally, some critics believe that this would create a move for care givers to value efficiency over affection, quantity and quality.&lt;ref name=Invisible_47&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = The care penalty | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | page = 47 | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting for time spent in unpaid care is extremely difficult because it is often an emotionally involved activity that isn't always reported as singular activities. This becomes even more difficult because there is a "social desirability" bias. For example, husbands will often report more time spent devoted to care work than their wives would report for them, and vice versa. People do this because providing care is considered praiseworthy. Thus, it is hard to make a survey that can get accurate results. However, most of the problems can be minimized through the use of a time diary. This method involves respondents describing the activities that they performed during the previous day. The responses are then standardized for analysis purposes. For example, "eating sandwich" and "drinking juice" would both be considered as "eating."&lt;ref name=Value_2&gt;{{cite book | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | title = Valuing children rethinking the economics of the family | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780674026322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care work wage parity===
A second policy relating to care work is the push for higher wages in the sphere of paid care work. Advocates of this policy believe that individuals who respect and fulfill norms of care will be seen as losers in the competitive economic game, if [[wages]] are not increased. Due to this stigma, some economists argue that there may be a gradual erosion of the supply of unpaid care services in the system.&lt;ref name=Love_money /&gt; Therefore, in order to encourage care work, these proponents advocate for higher wages for care work. However, not all feminist economists believe that higher wages would be appropriate for care work. For example, those who ascribe to the commoditization of emotion framework argue that higher wages may push out true caring emotions in care workers.

===Care work and gender===
A third policy debate surrounding care work involves the feminization of care work and focuses on an attempt to make care work more gender neutral, or at least, less disproportionately burdensome to women. One model set forth to address these disparities is the ‘‘universal-breadwinner model’’ which aims at achieving equity through women’s employment and parity with men. The ‘‘caregiver- parity model’’ promotes increased support for informal care work and on forms of employment for women, such as part-time employment, that would increase their time available to provide domestic care work. The first model shifts care and reproductive work to the market and the state, whereas the second keeps care work within the household with support from public funds. Yet both models, to an extent, lift the burden of care work off of women and transfer it either toward the state or toward men.&lt;ref name=Beneria_1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mathieu | first = Sophie | title = From the defamilialization to the "demotherization" of care work | journal = [[Social Politics]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 576–591 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/sp/jxw006 | date = Winter 2016 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxw006 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model is [[Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage]], which involves not transfer payments from taxpayers to women for women to do the care work, but men actually taking responsibility for half the care work themselves, and women taking half the financial responsibility of basic needs of the family.  The fact that paternity is now inexpensively provable is used to support recognition of this model.  This model is also focused on improving the experience of children and removing developmental distortions from the feminization of care, such as those that arise from symbiotic mothering or paternal neglect trauma.

=== Care work and gender analysis in economic policy ===
Care work, in that it is disproportionally done by women and is also often unpaid, highlights the importance of the larger issue of considering gender in economic policy. As a result, many economists argue that gender analysis should be an essential part in the consideration of any economic policy.&lt;ref name=Visible /&gt;

===Care work and economic policy across the world===
Care work is a universal force, but it is manifested differently across the world due to differences in a number of factors including the availability of [[domestic service]], the extent of the [[informal economy]], and [[international migration]].&lt;ref name=Beneria_1 /&gt; For this reason, economists argue that there are differences between Northern and Southern countries that would influence the effectiveness of certain policies in the South. Public policies suggested for these regions include increased availability of day care centers, greater access to schools, greater access to health care, improved public transportation, increased access to telephones and more.&lt;ref name=Beneria_1 /&gt;

== The Care Penalty ==

The Care Penalty is the term for the sacrifices one makes when performing care work. [[Nancy Folbre]] describes the term care penalty in depth in her book The Invisible Heart. Care penalties can refer to an array of sacrifices, whether it's a loss of personal time, money, or experiences missed out on while providing care. The care work in question can be provided to children, animals, the elderly, the sick, the mentally challenged, the learning incapable, and others of like disability. Providing care work limits a person's ability to compete with those who don’t have to provide such care. For example, say a single woman with the responsibility of a child is in the cards for a job promotion, but so is a single, childless woman. There is a high chance the company will take this into account and give the job to the woman who isn’t tied down to a child, because she likely has far more time to devote to the position.

Folbre points out that the concept of the care penalty leads to distributional struggles extremely relevant to [[gender role]]s (see 5.3). In situations like the Good Parent's Dilemma, this is made known. When two people choose to have a child, in most cases, one parent is forced to sacrifice far more than the other, so that the other can work and provide for the family. A vast majority of the time, the parent that ends up staying home and caring for the children is the mother.&lt;ref name=Invisible_9&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = The milk of human kindness | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | pages = 9–10 | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Census Bureau report of 2012, there were only 189,000 homes run by [[stay-at-home dad]]s, compared to 5,091,000 homes run by [[stay-at-home mom]]s, meaning that roughly 4,902,000 more women are paying care penalties than men.&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{cite web|last1=Table|first1=FG8|title=Family and living arrangements - America's families and living arrangements: 2012: family groups (FG table series)|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/families/data/cps2012FG.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When women make this sacrifice, it not only affects them in the moment, but it affects them even after the child is capable of being independent. By taking time off from their careers, these women are at a disadvantage in the work force for years to come.

This long term decline in earnings is referred to by Folbre as the “Family Gap or Motherhood Gap.” &lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- Valuing Family Work"&gt;Folbre, Nancy- Valuing Family Work&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in compensation is not attributable to working fewer hours. Rather, mothers with families often are passed for advancement opportunities such as the promotion scenario described above. The motherhood penalty has been increasing in part due to increased parity of pay for men and women. In 1991 it was estimated that the “motherhood gap” accounted for 60% of the difference between men's and women's compensation.&lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- Valuing Family Work"/&gt; Additionally, tends to be more severe for women with higher levels of education.

Parenthood is seemingly the type of care work that evokes the most significant, and most common, care penalty. Since the mere cost in dollars of raising a child increases constantly, the sacrifices one has to make to raise children are increasing at the same rate. The amount of money parents give up to their children is only money they are taking away from themselves; this is an extreme care penalty. Separate from the issue of money, children tend to cause parents to make many other sacrifices. Being responsible for a child can dictate a person's decisions on where to live, what to do in their free time, and what jobs to take.&lt;ref name=Invisible_13&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = The milk of human kindness | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | page = 13 | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are opportunities that are necessary to turn down when one is held accountable for another person's well being, which is the perfect definition of the care penalty.

Although parenthood may be the most common source of the care penalty, elder care also imposes costs upon the caregiver. Unlike parenthood which entails choice to some extent, an individual cannot choose whether to have elderly members of a family such as parents. Caring for elders is not legally required of a son or daughter in the same way that parents are legally bound to care for their children. There is a societal expectation, however, that adult children will provide care for their parents. In addition to societal expectations, research shows that an expectation of inheritance does have an effect on the behavior of adult children.&lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- The Care Penalty"&gt;Folbre, Nancy- The Care Penalty&lt;/ref&gt;

The care penalty suffered by caregivers of the elderly can be just as costly as the care penalty endured by parents of young children. The penalties can be both emotional and economic. Research has shown that over 60% of caregivers for the elderly experienced some depression.&lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- The Care Penalty"/&gt; With regard to economic consequences, Brandeis University research demonstrated that approximately 66% of caregivers lost out on career opportunities such as training in due to care obligations.&lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- The Care Penalty"/&gt; Similarly to the childcare, the caregivers for the elderly are largely female. The burden of eldercare is expected to increase due to shifting demographics which render the elderly an increasing percentage of the population. The number of persons over the 85 is expected to increase especially and this group often requires high levels of care.

The care penalty is commonly a necessary evil. If someone is in need of supervision, there are not many options to give him or her the care they require. If a person didn’t want to or for some reason could not care for this person on their own, the only other course of action would be to pay someone else to provide them with the care they need. This is sometimes impossible, since professional care can be extremely costly and can seem inefficient. With professional care there also comes moral issues; it's likely that a person wouldn’t trust a stranger to care for someone they love, and would find more peace of mind in taking on the responsibility themselves. For this reason, some victims of the care penalty have actually chosen the position, though they are aware of the sacrifices that come with it.

The Care penalty to some degree is shaped by public policy. In the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act provides that mothers are entitled to 24 weeks of leave and must be permitted to return to their same position.&lt;ref name="Folbre, Nancy- Valuing Family Work"/&gt; The Family Medical Leave Act, however, only provides for unpaid leave and it does not address long term reduction in earnings or career advancement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/1421.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally the prevalence of part-time employment often influences the severity of the care penalty. For example, the care penalty is more severe in the United Kingdom since part-time employment is more common.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, N ancy- Valuing Family Work&lt;/ref&gt;

Many benefits arise when parents raise successful children. Not only do the children themselves benefit, but employers benefit from new, productive employees. Also, the elderly benefit from the Social Security taxes paid by the younger generations. Parents benefit because of reciprocity, with the child in the care-giving role and the parents in the care-receiving role. These positive externalities make it hard for those who provide the care services to charge a price that would reflect the true value of their services. Thus, the care penalty exists to this day.&lt;ref name=Invisible_2&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = The care penalty | editor-last = Folbre | editor-first = Nancy | editor-link = Nancy Folbre | title = The invisible heart: economics and family values | pages = 22–52 | publisher = New Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781565847477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations for the overspecialization of women in care work ==

Theories of evolutionary biology explain females’ investment in care as rational response to ensure the benefits of their investment (i.e. the maturity of their pregnancy and child). On the other hand, men simply need to diversify their opportunities, by distributing their seed widely enough, to ensure their genes are cared for and carried forth by invested females. Institutional economics responds to this framework by emphasizing how these analyses ignore the power of social institutions that exaggerate biologically explained male power, including brute strength and freedom from childbearing and child rearing activities. The social arrangements perpetuated by these institutions are deemed to be internalized as individual preferences.&lt;ref name=Chicks&gt;{{Citation | last = Folbre | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Folbre | contribution = Chicks, hawks, and patriarchal institutions | editor-last1 = Altman | editor-first1 = Morris | title = Handbook of contemporary behavioral economics foundations and developments | pages = 499–516 | publisher = Thela Thesis publishers | location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands | year = 2001 | isbn = 9789051705164 }} [http://www.ub.edu/tig/GWBNet/MadridPapers/Folbre%20preiliminary%20copy.pdf Preliminary manuscript pdf version.]&lt;/ref&gt; Women's “overspecialization” in child rearing is understood has an outgrowth of the institution of patriarchy, rather than an absolutely biologically determined phenomenon.

Gerda Learner's research on the history of women has identified patriarchy, men's control over women, as a human-devised social institution dating back to the Bronze Age. Learner argues that the “production of the idea system” itself, including our recorded history, was constructed within and therefore imbued with the patriarchical system that underemphasizes women's contributions to public society. Learner asserts that this misrepresentation of women in history not only underemphasizes women's role outside of domestic work, but also works to dampen future women's ambitions outside of the home, thereby reinforcing this misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=Mishlove&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Jeffrey Mishlove | title =Gerda Lerner (1920–2013): Women and History (excerpt) -- A Thinking Allowed DVD w/ Jeffrey Mishlove  | medium =DVD excerpt | publisher =ThinkingAllowedTV via YouTube | location =Online | date =28 August 2010 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_PJwMpAgtQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutionalized male dominance (patriarchy) has not only excluded women from written history, but also worked to limit their political representation, education and property rights.&lt;ref name=Love_speech&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Nancy Folbre | title =Speech "For Love and Money: the distinctive features of care work" | medium =Video recording | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) via YouTube | location =Online | date =29 November 2011 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91N5HtMbVHY }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are distinct examples of United States law and public policies that have reinforced the patriarchical structure. Until the 19th constitutional amendment provided women the right to vote, women's interests were deemed to be represented through men's political participation. Further, women only began to secure property rights on a state by state basis after the civil war and still women continued to lack any legal claim to their husband's income at this time.&lt;ref name=Braunstein&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braunstein | first1 = Elissa | last2 = Folbre | first2 = Nancy | author-link2 = Nancy Folbre | title = To honor and obey: efficiency, inequality, and patriarchal property rights | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages= 25–44 | publisher= Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/713767276 | date = 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713767276 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutionalized patriarchy has worked to limit women's agency in the public sector by concentrating political and economic power in men.&lt;ref name=Braunstein /&gt; cite Gary Becker's Rotten Kid Theorem as a disruption to the idea that a woman's interests can be adequately represented by their husband. If individual family members consistently acted in the collective interest of the entire unit, it would be in the interest of individual family members to act in coordination with the family, which is not always the case as demonstrated by children's rebellion. This recognition of what Braunstein &amp; Folbre (2001)&lt;ref name=Braunstein /&gt; term the “non-benevolent patriarch” debunks the idea that women can be adequately represented by a single head of household and contend that families represent a myriad of interests that are not always manifested in one member's actions.

Braunstein &amp; Folbre&lt;ref name=Braunstein /&gt; assert that the hierarchical relationship produced from the patriachical system over allocates care work to women. Understanding that economic resources translate to increased bargaining power, Braunstein &amp; Folbre contend that men (who historically control the resources) encourage women's specialization in care work in order to limit their economic activity, thereby limiting women's bargaining power, in an effort to preserve their own authority. Therefore, the individual controlling the influx of financial resources is seen as more profoundly interested in preserving their control and power, than in preserving the well being of the entire family. In fact, Braunstein &amp; Folbre demonstrate that more egalitarian families, where men and women are holding comparable economic resources, distribute care work more efficiently that patriarchy structures that have asymmetrical concentrations of power.

Modern public policy can be interpreted as covertly enforcing patriarchy by discriminating against single parent households and encouraging the patriarchical family structure that relies on a primary income earner and an unpaid care laborer. For example, the welfare law Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 cites among its goals to end pregnancy out of marriage and to promote two parent households.&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rice | first = Joy K | title = Poverty, welfare, and patriarchy: how macro-level changes in social policy can help low-income women | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages= 355–374 | publisher= Wiley | doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00218 | date = Summer 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0022-4537.00218 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, United States tax law imposes a lower tax rate on families that have earners with a wide income disparity than the rate applied to families with adults earning a similar income.&lt;ref name=Schneebaum&gt;{{Citation | last = Schneebaum | first = Alyssa | contribution = All in the family: patriarchy, capitalism, and love | editor-last1 = Jónasdóttir | editor-first1 = Anna G. | editor-last2 = Ferguson | editor-first2 = Ann | editor-link1 = Anna G.

'''''Civil Society Coordination 2.0''''' refers to the strong coordination achieved through the online [[Virtual community]] and the [[Web 2.0]] phenomenon over the [[World Wide Web]]; Civil Society Coordination 2.0 basically refers to the new organizational strengths the [[Internet]] has afforded to the 21st century [[Civil Society]].

==History==

&lt;blockquote&gt;“It is our duty to monitor, evaluate and direct the activities of our governments 
It is our duty to ensure that governments provides adequate mentoring for their citizens 
Our method is “Government Mentoring and Monitoring System (GMMS)”
Our platform will be the Mentorship Advocate (MA) website; created and managed by the Civil Society Coordination 2.0”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Key principle==

The importance '''''Civil Society Coordination 2.0''''' is based on the Key principle that large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant, organised groups of people are better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future. It is perceived that some emerging Government policies are leveraging on the social web, it might be considered as a successful type of [[community organizing]]

==Governance and transparency==

'''''Civil Society Coordination 2.0''''' is playing a remarkable role in Governance and transparency, Nations of the world are yielding to its dictates. Examples of '''''Civil Society Coordination 2.0''''' influence and control  include the official [[government]] presence in social networking sites, blogs,  and  video sharing sites,

Robbery and mugging occur along the Boulevard de France (the beach road by the Marina and Novotel Hotels) and on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors. Most of the reported incidents involve the use of force, often by armed persons, with occasional minor injury to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/travel/Benin/crimes.htm|title=Benin Crime.

There has been a continued increase in the number of robberies and [[carjacking]] incidents after dark, both within metropolitan Cotonou and on highways and rural roads outside of major metropolitan areas. Overland travel to [[Nigeria]] is dangerous near the Benin/Nigeria border due to unofficial checkpoints and highway [[banditry]].{{cn|date=May 2016}}

[[Drug trafficking]] in Benin is increasing, due mainly to the porous borders and lack of government intervention of the illegal drug trafficking.  While neighboring countries are making a concerted effort to fight the drug trade, the traffickers are using Benin to traffic drugs from South America into the United States and Europe. Drug use within Benin is low, with marijuana being the drug of choice. Marijuana is grown in the central region of Benin.&lt;ref name=OSAC /&gt;

There is a high rate of credit card and automated teller machine (ATM) fraud, largely targeting foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1066.html "Benin"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704070446/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1066.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}.

'''Croatian Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens who are of [[Croats|Croatian]] descent. The community exists in major cities including the [[Greater Toronto Area]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Montreal]].

Popular events celebrated in the Croatian-Canadian community include the Canadian-Croatian Folklore Festival (held in eastern and western Canada) and the [[Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament]].

==Demographics==

==Religious affiliation==

Most Croatian Canadians are [[Roman Catholic]] who follow the [[Latin Rite]] of their ancestors in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  A very small minority of Croatians are [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Roman Catholics]].  There is also a community of [[Croats]] who follow [[Islam]], the descendants of those who converted after the 16th century, after the conquest of much of [[Croatia]] by the [[Ottomans]].  Communities of [[Protestants]] have historically been negligible in [[Croatia]].

In Canada, the first ethnic Croatian parish was established in Windsor in 1950.  Soon, parishes were established in Toronto (1951), Hamilton (1958), Vancouver (1967). Today there are ethnic Croatian parishes and missions in seventeen cities in Canada. In addition, previously unorganized Croats of the Muslim faith, with the arrival of eminent physician [[Asaf Duraković]]&lt;ref name="Poskok.info"&gt;[http://www.poskok.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13160 Poskok.info] Fikret Artuković: Toronto slavi 35 godina hrvatske džamije (picture)&lt;/ref&gt; founded the [[Croatian Islamic Centre, Toronto|Croatian Islamic Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salatomatic.com/d/Etobicoke+4037+Croatian-Islamic-Centre Salatomatic - Croatian Islamic Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; on June 23, 1973 in [[Etobicoke]] (75 Birmingham Street, Etobicoke, ON M8V 2C3),&lt;ref name="BH raja.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhraja.ca/Vijesti/BiH-i-Kanada/Toronto:-%22Hrvatska%22-d%C5%BEamija-slavi-35-godina-postojanja!.html|title=Toronto: 'Hrvatska' džamija slavi 35 godina postojanja!|trans-title=Toronto: 'Croatian' mosque celbrates 35th anniversary!|language=hr|publisher=BH raja.ca|date=June 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422094608/http://www.bhraja.ca/Vijesti/BiH-i-Kanada/Toronto%3A-%22Hrvatska%22-d%C5%BEamija-slavi-35-godina-postojanja%21.html|archivedate=April 22, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by the Croatian Catholic community.&lt;ref name="Poskok.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tgmag.ca"&gt;[http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt48.html Vinko Grubisic: Croatians in Toronto, From: Polyphony Vol.6, 1984 pp. 88-91] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205440/http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt48.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An old Catholic school was bought for 75,000 CAD and readjusted into [[masjid]]. There was also a community of [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslims]] of Yugoslav option, but the Croat option of Bosnian Muslims never cooperated with them, since Muslim Croats considered all Yugoslavs and Communists as chetniks and as their worst enemies. Since the old building was in catastrophic condition, a new mosque was built on the site of the old one in 1983.&lt;ref name="Poskok.info"/&gt;  Today, given changing political affiliations and political pressures from 1990's, and influx of non-Croat option of Bosnian Muslims,the center is now known as the Bosnian Islamic Centre.

While an overwhelming percentage of Croatians in Canada remain Roman Catholic, there are significant non-Catholic populations, including [[Protestants]] (most of whom have been in Canada for more than one generation) and [[Eastern Orthodox]] (the majority of whom are of mixed ethnic background).

The '''Czech national identity card''' ({{lang-cs|'''Občanský průkaz'''}}, ''citizen card'', literally ''civic certificate''; {{IPA-cs|ˈoptʃanskiː ˈpruːkas}}) is the [[identity document]] used in the [[Czech Republic]] (and formerly in [[Czechoslovakia]]), in addition to the [[Czech passport]]. It is issued to all citizens, and every person above 15 years of age permanently living in the Czech Republic is required by law to hold a valid identity card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/328/1999 Law No. 328/1999 Coll.] § 2, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to use the ID card for travel within Europe (except [[Belarus]], [[Kosovo]] (requires biometric IDs), [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]]) as well as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Montserrat]] instead of a passport.

==History==
[[File:Op 91.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1991 ''průkaz'' booklet from the [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|ČSFR]].]]
The first mandatory identity document was introduced during the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|German occupation]], on 17 March 1939 in a decree made by ''Reichsprotektor'' [[Konstantin von Neurath]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} This document was based on the model of a similar document already in use in the [[Third Reich]] and included a photograph. Known as a ''legitimace'', it was often nicknamed ''[[Kennkarte|kennkarta]]''.

During the communist regime ([[History of Czechoslovakia|1948–89]]) this simple card developed into a booklet dozens of pages long. It contained such personal details as employment history and [[vaccination]] records.

==Requirements==
To acquire the machine-readable version of the card, a citizen must present either a currently valid card (in case of renewals), or a [[birth certificate]] and proof of citizenship. A photograph is made at the premises of the issuing authority; the form is filled out by an employee of the issuing authority and only requires the signature of the applicant.

To acquire the non-machine-readable version, a citizen must present a filled out application, two photographs, and either a currently valid card (in case of renewals) or a birth certificate and proof of citizenship.

==Photograph==
The photograph(s) must be 35x45 mm, correspond to the current look of the person, show the person looking forwards with the distance from the eyes to the chin at least 13&amp;nbsp;mm, in civil clothes, without dark glasses (except the blind), without any head cover (except for health/religious reasons, which may not cover the face in a way that makes the person difficult to distinguish). The photograph must be smooth.

==Data included==

===Front side===
* Card ID
* Surname
* First name
* Date of birth
* Nationality (''Česká republika'')
* Date of expiration

'''Dan Gillmor''' is an [[Americans|American]] technology writer and columnist. He is director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at [[Arizona State University]]'s [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]]&lt;ref name=cronkite-news&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronkite.asu.edu/news/gillmor-110607.php|title=Digital Media Leader Named Knight Center Director, Kauffman Professor at ASU|publisher=Arizona State University|date=2007-11-06|accessdate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]].

Gillmor is also the author of a popular [[weblog]] covering technology news and the Northern California technology business sector, criticizing rigid enforcement of [[copyright]]s, and commenting on politics from a liberal perspective.

==Career==
Before becoming a journalist, Gillmor worked as a musician for seven years. During the 1986–87 academic year he was a [[Michigan Journalism Fellow]] at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], where he studied history, political theory and economics. Gillmor worked at the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' and several newspapers in Vermont, followed by six years at the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.

From 1994 to 2005, Gillmor was a columnist at the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', [[Silicon Valley]]’s daily newspaper, during which time he became a leading chronicler of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and its subsequent bust. Starting in October 1999, he wrote a weblog for ''The Mercury News'',  which is believed to have been the first by a journalist for a traditional media company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Crown | last = Rosenberg | first = Scott | title = Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters | location = New York | year = 2009| pages=134–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillmor's ''eJournal'' archives were believed to be lost but have been found in the [[Internet Archive]] and are now restored at  Bayosphere.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Dan Gillmor| last = Gillmor| first = Dan| title = Mediactive| chapter = Information safety| accessdate = 2012-03-10| year = 2010| chapterurl = http://mediactive.com/7-10-information-safety/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillmor left ''The Mercury News'' in January 2005 to work on a start-up venture in [[citizen journalism]] called ''Bayosphere'', which aimed to "make it easier for the public to report and publish on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| page = 1E| title = Dan Gillmor to leave MN| work = San Jose Mercury News| location = San Jose, CA| date = 2004-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in May 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/30/internet.onlinesupplement| last = Johnson| first = Bobbie| title = Blog watch: Citizen chain| work = The Guardian| location = London| date = 2005-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bayosphere'' closed in January 2006.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite news|date=January 25, 2006|title='Citizens Media' Pioneer Dan Gillmor Leaving Bayosphere|first=Miki|last= Johnson|work=Editor &amp; Publisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After closing ''Bayosphere'', Gillmor moved on to a new project, the Center for Citizen Media, a non-profit organization affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism and the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University Law School.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt;

In 2007, Gillmor co-founded [[Dopplr]], an online travel application project.&lt;ref name=cronkite-news /&gt;

In November 2007, Gillmor was named founding director of [[Arizona State University]]'s new Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]].&lt;ref name=cronkite-news /&gt; Dan Gillmor is a board member of the [[Global Editors Network]] since its creation in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/board-members/ |title=Global Editors Network board members |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624172532/http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/board-members/ |archivedate=24 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''derde''''' (derda, derdai, dardai) is the title held by the highest religious and political authority among the [[Toubou]] [[Teda people|Teda]] of the [[Tibesti]], in north-western [[Chad]]. He is elected among the three most prominent families of the Tomagra clan, and at the death of the ''derde'' the title never passes to the son of the deceased, but to a member of the other two families.

The ''derde'' exercises judicial rather than executive power, arbitrating conflict and levying sanctions based on a code of compensations. He is assisted in the exercise of his role by a council of nobles.

It appears that already in the 17th century the ''derde'' of the Tomagra had already established its preeminence over much of the Tibesti, through the lines of succession still valid today. The Teda of the Tibesti in the 17th and 18th centuries distinguished themselves for their raids from the [[Fezzan]] to the north and to [[Borno State|Borno]] to the south.

In 1842 century Tibesti found itself attacked by the [[Awlad Sulayman]] [[Arabs]], who had been expelled from the [[Fezzan]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces in [[Libya]]; but the key event of the century for the Teda of the Tibesti was the birth of the [[Senussi]], a [[Muslim]] political-religious order. They were invited by the ''derde'', and with his encouragement at the end of the 19th century a Senussi [[zaouia]] was established in [[Bardaï, Chad|Bardaï]], the most strategically situated [[oasis]] in Tibesti. This brought to the full [[Islam]]ization of the Toubou, that until then had been quite superficial.

When the [[France|French]] colonial forces in 1907 made the first raids in northern [[Chad]], the ''derde'' asked for the help of the Ottomans, who responded by establishing a few garrisons in Tibesti; but they were evacuated when the Ottomans were forced to cede [[Libya]] to [[Italy]]. The first French troops arrived later in 1914, but a moderate degree of control was exercised only from the 1930s. The ''derde'' collaborated with the French, retaining or even increasing this way their political and religious authority.

[[Chad]] became independent in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian administration settled itself in Tibesti. The ''derde'', [[Oueddei Kichidemi]], saw himself stripped of his powers by the new government, provoking him in going in exile in 1966, an event considered the signal of the start of the [[Civil war in Chad (1965–1979)|Chadian Civil War]] in the north. The ''derde'' became now for the first time a national symbol through his opposition to the government, a role that after 1975, when the ''derde'' returned in Chad, was never to be recovered again{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">'''Federal parole in the United States''' is a system that is implemented by the [[United States Parole Commission]]. Persons eligible for federal parole include persons convicted under civilian federal law before November 1, 1987, persons convicted under District of Columbia law, "[[transfer treaty]]" inmates, persons who violated military law who are in federal civilian prisons, and persons who are defendants in state cases and who are under the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] [[Witness Protection Program]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FAQ-Federal-Parole-11.29.pdf FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LACK OF PAROLE FOR FEDERAL PRISONERS ]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6dkHBKKGr?url=http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FAQ-Federal-Parole-11.29.pdf Archive]). [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]]. p. 2/4. Retrieved on December 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, federally sentenced inmates were eligible to participate prior to the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] of 1984. Parole of federal prisoners began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/uspc/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313150144/http://www.justice.gov/uspc/history.htm |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[parole]], prisoners were eligible for release before their sentences were complete. [[Parole board]]s under the [[United States Parole Commission]] determines whether a prisoner should be released and whether or not a parolee who violated parole should be sent back to prison. For persons convicted under civilian federal law after November 1, 1987, federal parole has been abolished, but the parole statutes continue to apply to prisoners who were [[grandfathered in]].

'''Filipinos in Poland''', the citizens of the [[Philippines]] as well as their descendants who are currently living in [[Poland]], are mostly residing in the country on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="cfo" /&gt; {{As of|2012|9}}, there were an estimated 525 Filipinos across the country.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; 

==Demographics==
Although Filipinos in Poland are spread throughout the country, they are mostly concentrated in urban centers, with Filipino communities in cities like [[Warsaw]],&lt;ref name="choir" /&gt; [[Kraków]],&lt;ref name="fatherherbie" /&gt; [[Poznań]],&lt;ref name="glass" /&gt; and [[Łódź]].&lt;ref name="distress" /&gt;  Most Filipinos in Poland are employed either in the banking sector, in the hospitality industry, as domestic helpers, or as Catholic clergy.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;  Some are employed also as computer programmers,&lt;ref name="programmers" /&gt; while a number are also students: twelve Filipinos have studied at the [[University of Warsaw]] from 2010 to 2013 under the European Union's [[Erasmus Mundus]] program.&lt;ref name="uw" /&gt;

==Society and culture==
The Filipino community in Poland regularly organizes events, at times with the participation of the [[Embassy of the Philippines, Warsaw|Philippine Embassy in Warsaw]].  Filipinos are a fixture at Warsaw's only English-language Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], where many are active in church services,&lt;ref name="programmers" /&gt;  and around 100 people also gather every first Sunday of the month to hear a separate community Mass at the [[:pl:Parafia Najświętszej Maryi Panny Matki Kościoła na Ksawerowie|Parish of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church]] in the [[Mokotów]] district of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="church" /&gt;

Likewise, the Philippine Embassy organizes events around major Philippine holidays such as [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] and the [[People Power Revolution]].&lt;ref name="kalayaan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edsa" /&gt;  In 2011, the Philippine Embassy organized a Marian pilgrimage to [[Domacyno]], its first outreach project outside of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="mary" /&gt;

There has also been interest in organizing an Association of Filipinos in Poland.&lt;ref name="association" /&gt;

===Filipinos in Polish popular culture===
Filipinos have appeared on Polish television shows such as ''[[Dzień Dobry TVN]]'',&lt;ref name="tvn" /&gt; ''Pytanie na śniadanie'' and other programs.  Notably, Filipinos who joined Polish [[talent show]]s on television have done well: these include Christina Bien winning ''[[Szansa na sukces]]'' in 2008,&lt;ref name="szansa" /&gt; Alexander Martinez placing third in the second season of ''[[Mam talent!]]'' in 2009,&lt;ref name="mamtalent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="distance" /&gt; and Conrado Yanez placing second in the Polish version of ''[[Must Be the Music (TV series)|Must Be the Music]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="mustbethemusic" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38131">The '''history of radiation therapy''' or '''radiotherapy''' can be traced back to experiments made soon after the discovery of [[x-rays]] (1895), when it was shown that exposure to [[radiation]] produced cutaneous [[burn]]s. Influenced by [[electrotherapy]] and [[escharotic]]s — the medical application of caustic substances — doctors began using radiation to treat growths and lesions produced by diseases such as [[lupus]], [[basal cell carcinoma]], and [[epithelioma]].&lt;ref name="pusey302"/&gt; Radiation was generally believed to have bactericidal properties, so when [[radium]] was discovered, in addition to treatments similar to those used with x-rays, it was also used as an additive to medical treatments for diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] where there were resistant [[bacilli]].&lt;ref name="kassabian501"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coe302"/&gt;

Additionally, because radiation was found to exist in hot spring waters which were reputed for their curative powers, it was marketed as a [[panacea (medicine)|wonder cure]] for all sorts of ailments in [[patent medicine]] and [[quackery|quack]] cures. It was believed by medical science that small doses of radiation would cause no harm and the harmful effects of large doses were temporary.&lt;ref name="singerxxv"/&gt;

The widespread use of radium in medicine ended when it was discovered that physical tolerance was lower than expected and exposure caused long term cell damage that could appear in [[carcinoma]] up to 40 years after treatment.&lt;ref name="mould"/&gt; The use of radiation continues today as a treatment for cancer in [[radiation therapy]].

==Early development of radiotherapy (1895–1905)==

The [[medical radiography|imaging]] properties of x-rays were discovered, their practical uses for research and diagnostics were immediately apparent, and soon their use spread in the medical field. X-rays were used to diagnose bone fractures, heart disease, and phthisis. Inventive procedures for different diagnostic purposes were created, such as filling digestive cavities with [[bismuth]], which allowed them to be seen through tissue and bone.&lt;ref name="squibb722"/&gt;

===Discovery of the therapeutic potential of radiation===

During early practical work and scientific investigation, experimenters noticed that prolonged exposure to x-rays created inflammation and, more rarely, tissue damage on the skin. The biological effect attracted the interest of [[Leopold Freund|Léopold Freund]] and [[Eduard Schiff]], who, only a month or two after Röntgen's announcement, suggested they be used in the treatment of disease.&lt;ref name="mackee19"/&gt; At approximately the same time, [[Emil Grubbe]], of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896, began experimenting in Chicago with medical uses of x-rays.&lt;ref name=pioneer /&gt; [[Escharotic]]s by this time had already been used to treat skin malignancies through caustic burns, and [[electrotherapy]] had also been experimented with, in the aim to stimulate the skin tissue.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The first attempted x-ray treatment was by [[Victor Despeignes]], a French physician who used them on a patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment was followed by a diminution of pain and reduction in the size of the tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments.&lt;ref name="belot364"/&gt; Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a [[naevus]] in order to induce [[epilation]] and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of [[lupus vulgaris]].  A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies.&lt;ref name="freund299"/&gt; Thereafter they did a successful treatment of [[lupus erythematosus]] in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly-patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.&lt;ref name="belot812"/&gt;

Within a few months, scientific journals were swamped with accounts of the successful treatment of different types of skin tissue malignancies with x-rays. In Sweden, [[Thor Stenbeck]] published results of the first successful treatments of [[rodent ulcer]] and [[epithelioma]] in 1899, later that year confirmed by [[Tage Sjögren]].&lt;ref name="williams438"/&gt; Soon afterwards, their findings were confirmed by a number of other physicians.&lt;ref name="belot367"/&gt;

The nature of the active agent in therapeutic treatment was still unknown, and subject to wide dispute. Freund and Schiff believed it to because of electrical discharge, [[Nikola Tesla]] argued they were because of the [[ozone]] generated by the x-rays, while others argued that it was the x-rays themselves. Tesla's position was soon refuted, and only the other two theories remained. In 1900, [[Robert Kienböck]] produced a study based on a series of experiments that demonstrated that it was the x-rays themselves. Studies published in 1899 and 1900 suggested that the rays varied in penetration according to the degree of vacuum in the tube.&lt;ref name="belot88"/&gt;

===Niels Finsen and phototherapy===
[[File:Finsen lamp-1900.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Finsen hospital lamp, 1900. The projecting tubes can be adjusted so as to permit the focusing of the light, which is directed through a hollow lens that's kept pressed down upon the part under treatment. The nurses and patients are wearing dark glasses to protect the eyes from the light.]]
[[Niels Finsen]], a Faroese-Danish physician, had by that time already pursued interest in the biological effects of light. He published a paper, ''Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden'' ("On the effects of light on the skin") in 1893. Inspired by the discovery that x-rays could have therapeutic effects, he extended his research to examine directed light rays. In 1896, he published a paper on his findings, ''Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler'' ("The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine"). Finsen discovered that lupus was amenable to treatment by [[ultraviolet]] rays when separated out by a system of [[quartz]] crystals, and thereafter created a lamp to sift out the rays. The so-called [[Finsen lamp]] became widely used in for [[phototherapy]], and derivatives of it became used when experimenting with other types of radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="metzenbaum22"/&gt; Modifications were made to Finsen's original design, and it found its most common forms in the [[Finsen-Reyn lamp]] and [[Finsen-Lomholt lamp]] .

By 1905, it was estimated that fully 50 percent of the cases of lupus were successfully healed by Finsen's methods.&lt;ref name="metzenbaum22"/&gt; Finsen was soon awarded a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prize for his research.

===Röntgenotherapy===
[[File:Technic of roentgenotherapy to treat epitheleoma of the face - 1915.jpg|thumb|325px|left|X-ray apparatus used for treatment of epithelioma of the face, 1915. The tube is in a localizing shield, and a perforated sheet of metal is securely fashioned to the surface by adhesive plaster.&lt;ref name="sinclair1103"/&gt;]]
From initial therapeutic experiments, a new field of x-ray therapy was born, referred to as ''röntgenotherapy'' after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], the discoverer of x-rays. It was still unclear how the x-rays acted on the skin; however, it was generally agreed upon that the area affected was killed and either discharged or absorbed.&lt;ref name="grubbe692"/&gt;

By 1900, there were four well established classes of problems that were treated by x-ray, based on a set of five classes initially outlined by Freund: &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;''1.''&lt;/span&gt; in hypertrichosis, for the removal of unwanted hair; &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;''2.''&lt;/span&gt; in the treatment of disease of hair and hair follicles in which it was necessary to remove hair; &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;''3.''&lt;/span&gt; in the treatment of inflammatory affections on the skin like eczema and acne; &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;''4.''&lt;/span&gt; and in the treatment of malignant affections on the skin in cases like lupus and epithelioma.&lt;ref name="pusey303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="belot261"/&gt;

Additionally, x-rays were successfully applied to other appearances of [[carcinoma]], trials were done in treating [[leukemia]], and because of the supposed bactericidal properties, there were suggestions it could be used in diseases such as tuberculosis. Experiments were also done using x-rays to treat [[epilepsy]], which had previously also experimentally been treated with electrical currents.&lt;ref name="kassabian488"/&gt;

==Further development and the use of radium (1905–1915)==
Because of the excitement over the new treatment, literature about the therapeutic effects of x-rays often exaggerated the propensity to cure different diseases. Reports of the fact that in some cases treatment worsened some of the patients' conditions were ignored in favor of hopeful optimism. [[Henry G. Piffard]] referred to these practitioners as "radiomaniacs" and "radiografters". It was found that x-rays were only capable of producing a cure in certain cases of the basal cell type of epithelioma and exceedingly unreliable in malignant cancer, not making it a suitable replacement for surgery. In many cases of treatment, the cancer recurred after a period of time. X-ray experiments in pulmonary tuberculosis proved useless. Aside from the medical profession losing faith in the ability of x-ray therapy, the public increasingly viewed it as a dangerous type of treatment. This resulted in a period of pessimism about the use of x-rays, which lasted from about 1905 to 1910 or 1912.&lt;ref name="mackee20"/&gt;

===Radium therapy ===
[[File:Application of radium tubes - 1905.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Small tubes containing radium salts are strapped to a woman's face to treat what was either lupus or rodent ulcer, 1905.&lt;ref name="metzenbaum26"/&gt;]]
Soon after the discovery of [[radium]] in 1898 by Pierre and [[Marie Curie]], there was speculation in whether the radiation could be used for therapy in the same way as that from x-rays. The physiological effect of radium was first observed in 1900 by [[Otto Walkhoff]],&lt;ref name="cameron171"/&gt; and later confirmed by what famously known as the "Becquerel burn". In 1901, [[Henri Becquerel]] had placed a tube of radium in a waistcoat pocket where it had remained for several hours; a week or two after which there was severe inflammation of his skin underneath where the radium had been kept. [[Ernest Besnier]], a dermatologist, examined the skin and expressed the opinion that it was due to the radium, leading to experiments by Curie which confirmed it. Besnier suggested the use of radium for therapy along the same purposes as x-rays and ultraviolet rays.

Becquerel for this purpose loaned some radium to [[Henri-Alexandre Danlos]] of the [[hôpital Saint-Louis|hôpital St. Louis]] in Paris in 1901.&lt;ref name="mackee25"/&gt; Danlos successfully treated a few cases of lupus with an admixture of [[radium]] and [[barium chloride]]. Further trials of radium therapy began, though at a much slower pace than did those using x-rays because radium was expensive and difficult to obtain.

====Methods of application====
[[File:Glass applicators for radium emanation - 1918.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Glass applicators for radium emanation, 1918.&lt;ref name="knox500"/&gt;]]
[[File:Radium salt tube - 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration showing a tube for applying radium salts, 1918.&lt;ref name="knox499"/&gt;]]
Radium was soon seen as a way to treat disorders that were not affected enough by x-ray treatment because it could be applied in a multitude of ways in which x-rays could not.&lt;ref name="metzenbaum22"/&gt; Different methods of applying radium had been tested, which fell into two categories: the use of radium emanation (now referred to as [[radon]]), and the use of radium salts.

One method using emanation was through inhalation, where it was mixed with air. Radium inhalation had been most studied in Germany, where regular inhalation institutes were established, and the goal was to target the lungs. That was done either to treat lung diseases, like tuberculosis, or to be absorbed through the surface of the lung to the blood, where it could circulate through the body. It was claimed that the beneficial effects produced by radium water baths were the result of inhalation of the vapors.&lt;ref name="knox498"/&gt;

Another method of treatment was to condense the emanation at liquid air temperature on substances such as vasoline, glycerine, and lanoline, to apply externally to the part affected; or on quinine, bismuth, subnitrate, and arsenic, to be consumed or applied internally.&lt;ref name="cameron173"/&gt;

Radium emanation was also passed into glass or metal tubes or flat glass-tight applicators and applied in the same way as radium tubes. In other cases was also deposited on metal points or flat surfaces of metal using electrical devices, which had the same level of radioactivity as the parent radium, but lasted a shorter duration. One way of treatment was to then drive the deposits of radioactive material into tissue using galvanic current. It was also a method of applying radium emanation to a specially designed applicator constructed to suit the needs of the patient, who could later take it home.&lt;ref name="knox501"/&gt;

Dilute solutions of radium salts were also made, meant to be used internally. Patients would be prescribed regular dosages. More rarely, the salts were also suspended in liquids to be injected in subcutaneous treatments, which could be applied locally to affected tissues. That was considered the most expensive method, because the radium used was irreparably lost.&lt;ref name="cameron173"/&gt;

As with radium emanation, solutions of free radium salts were also placed in tubes; in this case, the tubes were made from platinum. In metal tubes, the radium could be employed in a number of ways: externally; to the interior of the body in places like the mouth, nose, esophagus, rectum and vagina; and into the substance of a tumor through incisions.&lt;ref name="knox501"/&gt;

====Radium baths====

In 1903, the discoverer of the electron, [[J. J. Thomson]], wrote a letter to the journal ''Nature'' in which he detailed his discovery of the presence of radioactivity in well water. Soon after, others found that the waters in many of the world's most famous health springs were also radioactive. This radioactivity is due to the presence of radium emanation produced by the radium that is present in the ground through which the waters flow. In 1904, ''Nature'' published a study on the natural radioactivity of different mineral waters.&lt;ref name="strutt473"/&gt;

Inspired by this, using preparations of radium salt in bath water was suggested as a way for patients to be treated at home, as the radio-activity in the bathwater was permanent.&lt;ref name="tousey1115"/&gt; Radium baths became used experimentally to treat [[arthritis]], [[gout]], and [[neuralgia]]s.

===Röntgenotherapy vs. radium therapy===
[[File:X-ray treatment of tuberculosis 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|X-ray treatment of [[tuberculosis]] in 1910]]

X-rays and radium were noted by physicians to have different advantages in different cases. The most marked effects produced with radium therapy were with lupus, ulcerous growths, and [[keloid]], particularly because they could be applied more specifically to tissues than with x-rays.&lt;ref name="cameron174"/&gt; Radium was generally to be preferred when a localized reaction was desired, while for x-rays when a large area needed to be treated.&lt;ref name="boggs77"/&gt; Radium was also believed to be bactericidal, while x-rays were not. Because they could not be applied locally, x-rays were also found to have worse cosmetic effects than radium when treating malignancies. In certain cases, a combination of x-ray and radium therapy was suggested. In many skin diseases, the ulcers would be treated with radium and the surrounding areas with x-rays so it would positively affect the lymphatic systems.&lt;ref name="simpson1"/&gt;

===Tuberculosis and iodo-radium therapy===

After using radium in the surgical treatment of tuberculosis, researchers including [[Béla Augustin]] and [[A. de Szendeffy]] soon developed a treatment using radioactive metholated iodine, which was patented under the name ''dioradin'' (formed from "iodine and radium") in 1911. Application of this treatment was referred to as ''iodo-radium therapy'', and involved injecting dioradin intramuscularly. It seemed promising to the developers, because in several cases, fever and [[hemoptysis]] had disappeared.&lt;ref name="coe302"/&gt; Inhalation of iodine alone had been an experimental treatment for tuberculosis in France between 1830 and 1870.&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum"/&gt;

==Commercialization, quackery, and the end of an era (1915–1935)==
[[File:Radium therapy - 1913.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Advertisement for a scientifically developed radiation emanation activator.&lt;ref name="mould"/&gt; This particular device is suggested for use by Augustus Callé in a textbook on post-graduate medicine.&lt;ref name="calle65"/&gt;]]
Widespread commercial exploitation of radium only began in 1913, by which time more efficient methods of extracting radium from [[pitchblende]] had been discovered&lt;ref name="bright558"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moore79"/&gt; and the mining of radium had taken off.&lt;ref name="moore8"/&gt;

===Commercial products===

[[File:Tho-Radia-IMG 1228.JPG|thumb|200px|"Tho-radia" powder, based on [[radium]] and [[thorium]], according to the formula of Dr Alfred Curie]]
The radium commonly used in bath salts, waters, and muds was in low-grade preparations, due to the expense, and their usefulness in curative solutions was questioned, since it had been agreed upon by physicians that radium could only be used successfully in high doses.&lt;ref name="moore110"/&gt; It was believed that even radiation emanation at higher doses that were useful would cause no harm, because the radioactive deposits were found to have been absorbed and released in urine and waste within a period of three hours.&lt;ref name="singerxxv"/&gt;

====Radiation emanation activators====

''Radium emanation activators'', apparatuses that would apply radium emanation to water, started being produced and marketed. Scientifically constructed emanators were sold to hospitals, universities, and independent researchers. Certain companies advertised that they would only give them out to others on a medical prescription&lt;ref name="singerxxv"/&gt; and would guarantee the strength of radium in each dose.

Many products which imitated emanation activators were more broadly marketed to the public. One such product was the ''[[Revigator]]'', a "radioactive water crock."  A dispensing jar made of radium-containing ore, the idea was that radon produced by the ore would dissolve in the water overnight. It was advertised:  "Fill jar every night. Drink freely . . . when thirsty and upon arising and retiring, average six or more glasses daily."  The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) was concerned that the public was being fleeced by charlatans. In response, the AMA established guidelines (in effect from 1916 to 1929) that emanators seeking AMA approval had to generate more than 2 [[micro-|μ]][[curie|Ci]] (74 [[kilo-|k]][[becquerel|Bq]]) of radon per liter of water in a 24-hour period. Most devices on the market, including the ''Revigator'' did not meet that standard.&lt;ref name="frame"/&gt;

====Patent medicines====
{{Main|Radioactive quackery}}
Many other [[Quackery|quack]] cures and [[patent medicines]] were sold on the market. [[Radithor]], a solution of radium salts, was claimed by its developer [[William J. A. Bailey]] to have curative properties. Many brands of toothpaste were laced with radium that was claimed to make teeth shine whiter, such as [[Doramad Radioactive Toothpaste]]. Ostensibly, this would be because the radium would kill the bacteria in a person's mouth. One item, called "Degnen's Radio-Active Eye Applicator" manufactured by the Radium Appliance Company of Los Angeles, California, was sold as a treatment for [[myopia]], [[hypermetropia]], and [[presbyopia]]. Face creams and powders were sold, with names like 'Revigorette' and 'Tho-radia'. It was also sold as a supplement to smoking cigarettes. Companies also marked radioactive pads and compresses for the treatment of illnesses.&lt;ref name="oakridge"/&gt;

===Joachimsthal radium spa hotel===

In light of the supposed curative properties of radioactivity, a spa was opened up in [[Joachimsthal]], the place at which Madame Curie gathered some of her original samples of radium from spring waters. Radon inhalation rooms were set up, where air tubes carried the gas up from a processing tank in the basement; the visitor would then use it through an inhalation apparatus. Baths were set up which were also irradiated, and irradiated air was also filtered through a trumpet-like pipe for inhalation.&lt;ref name="mould"/&gt;

===Public health concerns===

Concerns about radium were brought up before the [[United States Senate]] by California Senator [[John D. Works]] as early as 1915. In a floor speech he quoted letters from doctors asking about the efficacy of the products that were marketed. He stressed that radiation had the effect of making many cancers worse, many doctors thought the belief that radium could be used to cure cancers at that stage of the development of therapy was a "delusion" — one doctor quoted cited a failure-to-success rate of 100 to 1 — and the effects of radium water were undemonstrated.&lt;ref name="works107"/&gt;

Around the start of the 1920s, new public health concerns were sparked by the deaths of factory workers at a [[radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] watch factory. In 1932, a well-known industrialist, [[Eben Byers]] died of radiation poisoning from the use of [[Radithor]], a radium water guaranteed by the manufacturer to contain 2 [[micro-|μ]][[curie|Ci]] of radium.&lt;ref name="frame"/&gt; Cases sprung up of the development of carcinoma in patients who had used conventional radium therapy up to 40 years after the original treatments.&lt;ref name="mould"/&gt;

Robley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At [[MIT]] he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to establish the [[tolerance level]] for radium of 0.1 [[micro-|μ]][[curie|Ci]] (3.7 [[kilo-|k]][[becquerel|Bq]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=H2EzvHupWRkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=%CE%BCCi+national+bureau+of+standards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bVZCpMk7tA&amp;sig=JB4D0BvweEf0m6-9mb0x97bds1I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiwe-f2tPLAhUJNJQKHWQDBhYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%CE%BCCi%20national%20bureau%20of%20standards&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coutard method===

At the International Congress of Oncology in Paris in 1922, [[Henri Coutard]], a French radiologist working with the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Institut Curie]], presented evidence that laryngeal cancer could be treated without disastrous side-effects. Coutard was inspired by the observations of [[Claudius Regaud]], who found that a single dose of x-rays sufficient enough to produce severe skin damage and tissue destruction in a rabbit, if administered in fractions, over a course of days, would sterilize the rabbit but have no effect on subcutaneous tissues.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

By 1934, Coutard had developed a protracted, fractionated process that remains the basis for current radiation therapy.&lt;ref name="halperin4"/&gt; Coutard's dosage and fractionation were designed to create a severe but recoverable acute mucosal reaction. Unlike previous physicians, who believed that cancerous cells were more affected by radiation, he assumed that the population of cancerous cells had the same sensitivity for regeneration as normal cells.&lt;ref name="bomford316"/&gt; Coutard reported a 23% cure rate in the treatment of head and neck cancer.&lt;ref name="beyzadeogluxxiii"/&gt; In 1935, hospitals everywhere began following his treatment plan.&lt;ref name="bomford316"/&gt;

==Radiation therapy today (1935—)==

{{Main|Radiation therapy}}
Treatments of cancer by x-ray today generally follows Coutard's fractionated process, while radiated rods are used in [[brachytherapy]].

The three main divisions of radiation therapy are [[external beam radiation therapy]] or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion.

[[Particle therapy]] is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are [[protons]] or heavier [[ions]].

Intraoperative radiation therapy or [[IORT]] is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or [[TARGIT]]), brain tumors and rectal cancers.

Radioactive iodine, as developed in 1911, survives today primarily in the treatment of [[thyrotoxicosis]] (hyperthyroidism) and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. Treatment involves the important iodine isotope [[iodine-131]] (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I), often simply called "radioiodine" (though technically all [[radioisotope]]s of iodine are radioiodines; see [[isotopes of iodine]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48680">The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) is a union of wage workers which [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|was formed]] in [[Chicago]] in 1905. The IWW experienced a number of divisions and splits during its early history.

When the office of the IWW president was abolished at the convention in 1906, deposed President Sherman and his supporters, many from the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the [[Western Federation of Miners]], formed a rump IWW, which ceased to exist after about a year.&lt;ref name="syndicalism174"&gt;[[Paul Frederick Brissenden]], ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, pages 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1908 convention of the original IWW, at which [[Socialist Labor Party]] (SLP) head [[Daniel DeLeon]] was barred from voting via credentials challenges, DeLeon and the SLP bolted to form another rump IWW, which came to be called the Detroit IWW. In 1915, the Detroit IWW changed its name to the [[Workers' International Industrial Union]] (WIIU). The WIIU continued its close relationship with the SLP, but ceased to exist in 1924.

There was another division within the original Chicago IWW which caused political infighting for many years, and finally split the organization in 1924. This time, the two groups were referred to as the centralizers and the decentralizers. This split was in part responsible for a serious decline in membership — a decline from which the organization has never fully recovered. The decentralizers' faction ceased to exist as a separate group in 1931.

For the existing IWW, the results of the splits were, in part, the abolition of the office of president; the departure of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party; a constitutional provision barring alliance with any political party; a reliance on direct (economic) action rather than political petition; and a focus on [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|using creative tactics]] to organize low-wage, itinerant, unskilled, migratory, and immigrant workers.

== Eastern Wobblies, western Wobblies ==

The divisions in the early days of the IWW were based upon differing philosophies and ideologies, and to a considerable extent these differences could be traced to regional particulars.

The Western Wobblies were often casual workers from the mines, mills, lumber camps, and agricultural regions of the West and Midwest. These were largely male, unattached, footloose, and open to adventure. In 1918, just after the United States had entered [[World War I]] and the government charged IWW leaders with violation of the espionage law for their anti-war expressions, Robert W. Bruere wrote in ''Harper's Magazine'' that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Workers of the World are most numerous among the migratory workers of the West; among the homeless, wayfaring men who follow the harvests from Texas across the Canadian border; among the lumberjacks who pack their quilts from camp to distant camp in the fir and pine and spruce forests of the Northwest; and among the metalliferous miners of Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, and Old Mexico. In other words, they are strongest among the men upon whom the nation depends for three of its basic raw materials—materials of fundamental importance at all times; of crucial importance in time of war.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to our best information, approximately four-fifths of these migratory workers are men whose family ties have been broken—"womanless, voteless, and jobless men." Competent authorities estimate that about one-half of them are native Americans, and the other half men who have been uprooted by labor brokers and padrones from their native ethnic and social environments; voluntary or forced immigrants from the agricultural districts of Ireland, from the Welsh and Cornish mines, from the hungry hills of Italy, Serbia, Greece, and Turkish Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="interpretation1918"&gt;Robert W. Bruere, The Industrial Workers of the World, An Interpretation, Harper's magazine, Volume 137 Making of America Project Harper &amp; Brothers, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bruere wrote of a "[[Gandy dancer#Economic circumstance of maintenance of way employees .281918.29|pernicious system of sabotage]]" by railroad corporations and other business interests, creating "hobos, vagabonds, wayfarers—migratory and intermittent workers, outcasts from society and the industrial machine, ripe for the denationalized fellowship of the I. W. W."&lt;ref name="interpretation1918"/&gt;

Typical IWW tactics in the West were [[Soapbox|soap boxing]] and, where they found it necessary, the [[free speech fights|free speech fight]]. As a direct result of their working class experiences in western states, Western Wobblies developed a bitter hostility toward political parties.&lt;ref&gt;While this hostility toward politics was developed independently, it mirrored the sentiments of syndicalists in France. Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 231&lt;/ref&gt; The most conspicuous example of these anarchistic sentiments among Western Wobblies was the [[Wobbly lingo#Overalls Brigade|Overalls Brigade]], who were suspicious of all political parties; believed voting and legislating a ritual aimed at deluding workers; were antagonistic toward [[craft unionism|craft unions]], referring to them as [[Wobbly lingo#Coffin society|coffin societies]]; and, were generally opposed to leaders of any kind, even within the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, the IWW became the champion of ethnic solidarity and the focus of immigrant discontent, during [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|a strike of women mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and elsewhere. One [[1913 Paterson silk strike|notable struggle in Paterson, New Jersey]] involved the production of a pageant in [[Madison Square Garden]], performed by the strikers themselves. Many Eastern IWW members tended to be more supportive of radical state socialist principles of the Socialist Labor Party variety. They did not care for anarchy, and tended to dismiss the Socialist Party's reformist philosophy. According to Brissenden, Eastern Wobblies were "revolutionary Marxists — doctrinaire to the bone — saturated with the [[dialectic]]."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1905 on, many workers in the West were unable to vote. This created a different dynamic from the experiences of early IWW supporters in the East. However, by the time the IWW began to organize [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts]] in 1912, the IWW would confront the same circumstance in the East. In 1913, IWW organizer [[Bill Haywood]] would declare, "I advocate the industrial ballot alone when I address the workers in the textile industries of the East where a great majority are foreigners without political representation. But when I speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Marot, Industrial Workers of the World, American labor unions, H. Holt and company, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; But by this time, regional differences had already exerted a significant impact on the organization.

In some sense, the Western Wobblies would evolve into the Chicago IWW after the split of 1908. The Eastern Wobblies, whom Brissenden believed held most closely to the ideals of the first convention, became the Detroit IWW after the same division.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, pages 234-236&lt;/ref&gt;

These two factions became the most visible manifestations of a divided IWW. The Chicago, or "Red IWW" was referred to variously as the direct action, the economic, the [[Wobbly lingo#Bummery|bummery]], or the anarchist faction. The Detroit, or "Yellow IWW" faction was called the doctrinaire, the political, or the socialist faction. However, there were other splits, both before and after this most significant split, in which some of the same philosophical differences played a role.

==1906 split==

For the first several years the differences between those who favored political action via electoral politics, and those who believed that working people could never obtain justice through political action, played out within the IWW.

However, other divisions wracked the young organization, initially over the leadership style and practices of President Charles O. Sherman, the first (and only) president of the IWW. Sherman, a failed AFL union leader who sought redemption in the IWW, was accused of expensive habits and financial improprieties, but was also faulted for favoring "pure and simple unionism" of the AFL variety. IWW organizer [[James P. Cannon]] observed that members questioned Sherman's commitment to revolutionary principles espoused at the [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|organization's founding]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charles O. Sherman, the first general president of the IWW, was an exponent of the industrial-union form of organization. But that apparently was as far as he wanted to go, and it wasn’t far enough for those who took the revolutionary pronouncements of the First Convention seriously.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Cannon, The IWW, Fourth International, Summer 1955 http://www.iww.org/en/history/library/Cannon/iww/2 retrieved July 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Melvyn Dubofsky, Sherman was duplicitous, and used his position as president of the IWW "to increase his power and line his own pockets."&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William-e-trautmann.png|thumb|140px|left|alt=Portrait of a man.|[[William Trautmann]]]]
Sherman was supported by conservative elements in the WFM. He was opposed by IWW Secretary Treasurer [[William Trautmann]], [[Vincent St. John]], and [[Daniel DeLeon]], head of the [[Socialist Labor Party]], who averred that they sought to rescue the organization's stated purpose and philosophy—revolutionary working class solidarity. The more "radical" element within the IWW — composed of those referred to as "beggars, tramps, and proletarian rabble" — specifically, those who favored direct action, some organization leaders, plus DeLeon's group — adopted a member's proposal published in the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' which called for abolishing the office of president.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was agreed to at the 1906 convention.

[[File:Vincent-st-john-circa-1905.jpg|thumb|100px|right|alt=Portrait of a man.|[[Vincent St. John]]]]
Paul Brissenden believed, however, that the issues behind divisions in the first two years were more personality than principle, complicated by intrigue on the part of individuals in the two socialist parties.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 136&lt;/ref&gt; Brissenden weighed the arguments of the two sides, and concluded that neither side acted charitably toward the other. Furthermore, Bill Haywood, writing from prison in Idaho before his acquittal, emphatically condemned "Shermanism", but then chided that with a bit of diplomacy, the troubles could have been smoothed over.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, pages 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Big Bill's charismatic leadership skills temporarily unavailable, the die had been cast. Haywood would later write (in his autobiography, published in 1929), "Sherman had proved incapable, and if not actually dishonest, he had used an enormous amount of the funds for unnecessary purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, International Publishers, 1929, page 202 ppbk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haywood, Moyer, Pettibone.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Group portrait of three men, the middle standing in profile.|1907 photo of (left to right) [[Charles Moyer]], [[Bill Haywood]], and [[George Pettibone]] while imprisoned in Idaho, accused by WFM member and police informant [[Harry Orchard]] of conspiracy to commit murder. (Orchard found guilty, all others acquitted and/or released)]]
After the Sherman faction was outvoted at the 1906 convention, they took their argument to the largest organization within the IWW, the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM). There, the questions of propriety and organizational philosophy raged for the next eighteen months,&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 59-66&lt;/ref&gt; with the WFM ultimately taking a conservative turn under WFM President [[Charles Moyer]]. Moyer was incarcerated along with Haywood in Idaho, but was freed without a trial. Haywood's radicalism was affirmed by imprisonment, while Moyer, sharing the same cell, was a changed man. He supported those who were already seeking to withdraw the organization from the IWW and, in spite of the fact that Haywood and St. John were likewise officials in the WFM, Moyer was successful.

Historian Joseph Rayback traces the conservative turn of the WFM to the loss of a strike in [[Goldfield, Nevada]], where many of the Cripple Creek miners had migrated after their defeat in the [[Colorado Labor Wars]]. While the Colorado governor had mobilized the national guard, the governor of Nevada called for federal troops, which this time "reduced leadership to despair" and forced the WFM rank and file to finally give up its radical leanings. By 1911, the WFM once again affiliated with the AFL. Thus ended the WFM's decade long flirtation with revolutionary sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, pages 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

The departure of deposed President Sherman and his supporters from the 1906 convention resulted in the first of several occasions that members found themselves with a choice between two IWWs. While the so-called "beggars, tramps, and proletarian rabble" — the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction — finished the convention with theoretical control of the organization, Sherman benefited from "the manipulations of a socialist lawyer"&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, International Publishers, 1929, page 203 ppbk&lt;/ref&gt; to gain possession of the office, the records, and the resources to publish the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', which he continued to publish for a year thereafter. Sherman took the smaller share of union locals, but retained some support within the soon-to-depart Western Federation of Miners.&lt;ref name="syndicalism174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 61-66&lt;/ref&gt; Each side claimed to be the real IWW, while simultaneously disparaging the other side.

For approximately a year, the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction fought for control, and eventually prevailed. During this time they published a newspaper called the ''[[Industrial Union Bulletin]]'' instead of the ''Industrial Worker'', only reviving that instrument in 1909.

Sherman's supporters held a convention of the "Sherman IWW" in the summer of 1907, but there seem to be no records of the event. It appeared to be their last gasp as a rump IWW.

Although the 1907 convention of the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John IWW was relatively peaceful, the earlier departures of the WFM and the Sherman crowd didn't bring an end to dissension within the organization.

==1908 split==

While DeLeon had helped to rescue the radical character of the organization from what was alleged to be a conservative and corruptive element, his own beliefs and practices soon became an issue for those same "beggars and tramps" with whom he'd previously allied. DeLeon's history and personality made him a fairly easy target for dissenters. DeLeon was head of the Socialist Labor Party, which Paul Brissenden described as "always ... emphatically Marxian and its leaders have been so decidedly doctrinaire in their interpretation of Marxian socialism ... that they have been not unjustly called [[Impossibilism|impossibilists]]."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; DeLeon's enemies commonly referred to him as the "Pope of the S.L.P."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel deleon gov photo.jpg|thumb|120px|right|alt=Portrait of a man.|[[Daniel DeLeon]]]]
DeLeon believed that a rise in wages for workers resulted in a rise in price, so that workers obtained no worthwhile gain from seeking higher wages. This argument suggested that one of the most significant immediate goals of unions was not worthwhile. James P. Thompson and [[James Connolly]] expressed the opposite viewpoint, grounding their writings in the work of [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. When DeLeon launched a secret hearing against Connolly for "economic heresy" in 1907, the issue of politics vs. the economic class struggle came to the attention of the entire union, including branches of the organization in Britain and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

DeLeon possessed "a supreme confidence in himself and his views," and was "highly impatient" with those who did not agree. A prolific writer, he hammered away at theory in Socialist Labor Party publications, emphasizing the importance of the IWW's participation in the ''political'' fight, and "making it unmistakably clear that this meant helping to build" the Socialist Labor Party.&lt;ref name="movement108"&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage was set for a showdown.

===Overalls brigade===

Out of the West came the [[Wobbly lingo#Overalls Brigade|overalls brigade]], a group of Wobblies who wore blue denim overalls covering jet black shirts, with red bandannas around their necks. They wore IWW buttons, and they were proud of their organization. They were nineteen men and one woman, and they referred to themselves as "red blooded working stiffs."&lt;ref name="movement108"/&gt; They rode the rails from Portland to the IWW convention in Chicago, stopping in working class communities along the way. They held propaganda meetings at each stop, singing IWW songs and selling literature to finance their trip.&lt;ref name="industrial78"&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Led by capable Wobbly organizer [[James H. Walsh]], they traveled over 2,500&amp;nbsp;miles in their "Red Special" cattle car, ate in hobo jungles, and preached revolution in prairie towns.&lt;ref name="industrial78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

These were itinerant workers from the West — representing farm hands, miners, sailors, dock workers, and "timber beasts" who traveled with the job, and spent much of their time unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; They couldn't rely upon the vote, because many of them didn't reside in one location long enough to register. They likewise didn't trust that votes counted by "some [[Citizens' Alliance]] disciple or the [[Mine Owners Association]]" could ever usher in the revolution.&lt;ref name="movement108"/&gt;

At the convention, DeLeon criticized the newer IWW members "for their crudities, their rawness, and their inability to perceive the more 'civilized' methods" that he had long recommended to the organization. Historian Rayback comments, "It was an ill-advised attack."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, page 243&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1905 Preamble to the IWW Constitution had stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers come together ''on the political'', as well as on the industrial field, and take and hold that which they produce by their labor through an economic organization of the working class without affiliation with any political party. ''[emphasis added]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/constitution/1905const.html Retrieved July 30, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the 1908 convention, members of the IWW, led by the overalls brigade, first challenged DeLeon's credentials, declaring that he didn't actually work in the Industrial Union with which he was registered.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, pages 243-244&lt;/ref&gt; Then they removed the Preamble language about "struggle [on] the political, as well as on the industrial field," which DeLeon had made a condition of his participation at the founding convention in 1905. The IWW was left with only the industrial struggle delineated in the Preamble. DeLeon and his SLP followers walked out of the convention, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannon wrote that St. John, in his capacity as the leader of the early IWW, "judged socialist 'politics' and political parties by the two examples before his eyes — the Socialist Party bossed by Berger and Hillquit and the Socialist Labor Party of De Leon — and he didn’t like either of them."&lt;ref&gt;James P. Cannon, The IWW, Fourth International, Summer 1955 http://www.iww.org/en/history/library/Cannon/iww/4 retrieved July 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Labor historian Melvyn Dubofsky weighs in on the rejection of the SLP,

&lt;blockquote&gt;DeLeon was among the first to attack the "new" IWW (on the grounds of becoming an anarchist organization) ... But DeLeon and others misunderstood what the convention had done ... [delegates] recognized ... that political debates between socialist factions wrecked union locals and undermined labor's morale. Hence, the Wobblies decided to keep political debate within the party, where it belonged, and to promote industrial action within the IWW, whereby workers could improve their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Foner, the new orientation of the IWW was a mixed result because,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he program virtually guaranteed the isolation of the I.W.W. from vast numbers of American workers who knew from experience that political action was a necessary weapon in the class struggle, and that, indeed, the existence of many unions, threatened by injunctions and other court decisions, could only be preserved by labor's effectiveness at the ballot box ... [Yet] there were still fertile fields for organizing ... [and in the following years the IWW would] bring the principles of industrial unionism to the attention of hundreds of thousands of American workers, including even many of the A.F.&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;L.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===IWW east, IWW west===

After the Socialist Labor Party withdrew from the IWW in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Fred W. Thompson, Patrick Murfin, The IWW: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, 1976, pages 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verity Burgmann, Revolutionary industrial unionism, 1995, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; it formed an offshoot of the "Chicago IWW" in [[Detroit]] which also adopted the name Industrial Workers of the World. (It changed its name to [[Workers' International Industrial Union]] in 1915).&lt;ref&gt;Fred W. Thompson, Patrick Murfin, The IWW: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, 1976, pages 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hoxie]], author of ''Trade Unionism in the United States'', referred to the Detroit IWW as ''socialistic'', and the Chicago IWW as ''quasi anarchistic''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxie, who was writing in the 1913-14 time-frame (his book was a joint effort published in 1921), wrote that socialistic unions (some of which were AFL unions) "look forward to a state of society which, except for common ownership and control of industry and strong centralized government in the hands of the working class, does not differ essentially from our own."&lt;ref name="autogenerated166"&gt;[[Robert Franklin Hoxie]], Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were "revolutionary," they would attain their goals by peaceful means, both political and industrial. The quasi anarchistic unionists, on the other hand, envision an industrial society in which the unions would act as the government.

Hoxie believed that quasi anarchistic unions were abhorrent of political action.&lt;ref name="autogenerated166"/&gt; Other authors have a different interpretation. Quoting passages from ''Bread and Roses Too'', Verity Burgmann has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Chicago IWW was 'non-political' rather than 'anti-political'. J.R. Conlin insists too much has been made of the deletion of the political clause in 1908; equally significant was the rejection without discussion by the 1911 Chicago IWW Convention of an amendment to the Preamble that referred to 'the futility of political action'.&lt;ref&gt;Verity Burgmann, ''The IWW in International Perspective: comparing the North American and Australasian Wobblies'', Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 2007, quoting Conlin, Bread and Roses Too, page 35. {{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164928/http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }} retrieved March 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing decades earlier, Brissenden had already taken up this question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''constitution'' of the I. W. W. is not anti-political. It is merely non-political. Any wage-earner is admitted regardless of creed, race, or political opinion. But it is also true that in actual practice, as Levine remarks, "the Industrial Workers have played and are playing the game of antipolitics." "Their spokesmen," he says, "ridicule the 'politicians'; severely criticize the Socialist party and insult its most prominent leaders. The non-political portion of the I.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;W. is therefore practically anti-political."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, pages 236-237, quoting Louis Levine, The Development of Syndicalism in America, Political Science Quarterly, vol. xxviii, 1913, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brissenden then elaborates on the animosity between the two IWW organizations. However, he follows with the observation,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The break was not, however, entirely caused by disagreement over political and economic principles. It was partly a matter of personal temperament—and primarily the personal temperament of Daniel DeLeon...&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brissenden notes that the organizations which were run by Daniel DeLeon reflected DeLeon's character.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 240&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes Socialist Labor Party journalist [[Louis C. Fraina]]'s evaluation of the SLP to assess that character:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The S. L. P. ignored the psychology of struggling workers [he says]. Its propaganda was couched in abstract formulas; just as its sectarian spirit developed a sort of subconscious idea that revolutionary activity consisted in enunciating formulas. This sectarian spirit produced dogmas, intemperate assertions, and a general tendency toward caricature ideas and caricature action; and discouraged men of ability from joining the S.&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;P.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 241, quoting Louis C. Fraina, "DeLeon", New Review, July, 1914, vol. ii, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because IWW President Sherman and some of his followers, who left as a result of the 1906 split, had been associated with the Socialist Party, a member of the Chicago IWW expressed the impression that they had purged the Socialist Party during the 1906 split, and then the Socialist Labor Party during the 1908 split. Thus, the non-political, direct action focus of the surviving organization evolved over a period of time.

===The Detroit IWW===

{{Main|Workers' International Industrial Union}}

The Detroit IWW (which became the WIIU) created an industrial union structure that was similar to that of the IWW.&lt;ref name="autogenerated173"&gt;Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The split between the Chicago IWW and the Detroit IWW was replicated in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Verity Burgmann, ''The IWW in International Perspective: comparing the North American and Australasian Wobblies'', Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164928/http://www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/asslh2/burgmann.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }} retrieved March 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the Detroit IWW reported 23 local organizations.&lt;ref name="syndicalism231"&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 231&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the areas represented were mostly in the East, including Philadelphia, Boston, Bridgeport, Brooklyn, and Paterson.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the IWW, which from 1908 onwards constitutionally restricted itself from political alliances, the WIIU advocated political associations, and maintained its close association with the SLP, although (as of 1922) it declined to openly affirm this association.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the IWW, the WIIU advocated use of the [[general strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Radicalism, New York (State) Legislature, Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities, Clayton Riley, page 908.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WIIU was criticized for focusing more on party propaganda than on organizing workers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated173"/&gt; From 1908 to 1922, the relationship between the IWW and the WIIU was characterized as "bitter".&lt;ref name="autogenerated173"/&gt; When the WIIU reported its routine labor statistics to ''The American Labor Year Book'' for 1916 (shortly after changing its name), it included — along with its declaration of principles and its membership stats — an editorial comment on the perceived practices of the "Chicago IWW",

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Workers' International Industrial Union is the new name adopted in 1915 to designate the socialist industrial class union, which was organized in 1905 under the name of the Industrial Workers of the World. The change of name was deemed advantageous to distinguish the Socialist organization from the one which follows the tenets of anarchy, advocates "sabotage," and so-called "direct action," usually denoting non-political action. The career of the so-called Industrial Workers of the World was started at the fourth convention of the I. W. W. in 1908 with the slogan: "Strike at the ballot box with an ax."&lt;ref&gt;The American labor year book, Volume 1, Rand School of Social Science. Dept. of Labor Research, 1916, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The WIIU shared much of its membership with the SLP, and struggled after DeLeon's death in 1914. According to labor historian Philip Foner, the WIIU never did conduct a strike of any importance.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; It disbanded in 1924.

The Detroit IWW, which became the [[Workers' International Industrial Union]] in 1916, published the ''Industrial Union News''.

===The Chicago IWW===

{{Main|Industrial Workers of the World}}

The Chicago IWW is the organization that survives as the modern Industrial Workers of the World. After the 1908 split, the Chicago IWW began to refer to itself as the Red IWW, and the Detroit group as the Yellow IWW.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;An Alphabet Soup - the IWW Union Dictionary, IWW website, http://www.iww.org/culture/official/dictionary retrieved March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel DeLeon's followers referred to the Chicago IWW, who ultimately retained the mantle, if not the founding philosophy of the IWW, as "[[Wobbly lingo#Bummery|the bummery]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 220&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the Chicago IWW reported 100 local organizations.&lt;ref name="syndicalism231"/&gt; From 1908 onwards, the more energetic Chicago IWW could take credit for far the greatest share of organizing and propagandizing.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoxie observed that quasi anarchistic unionists like those in the Chicago IWW have a different goal than the socialistic unionists such as the Detroit IWW:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They look forward to the ''complete'' abolition of the state and of existing governmental machinery. They visualize, not a political, but an industrial society, where the ''unions'' would be the government. All political action is abhorrent to them, partly because the state is outside their scheme of things and political action is a recognition of a compromise with it, but largely because they believe that experience has proved it to be not only useless as a working-class weapon but positively harmful to working class interests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated166"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hoxie continues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The Chicago IWW unionists] have noted that political associations and political gains make the workers soft, conservative, and nonrevolutionary. Revolution degenerates into mere reform, and political preferment makes traitors of working-class leaders . . . Direct action, therefore, has become their slogan, that is, the making and enforcing of demands upon the enemy directly by the workers, through demonstrations, strikes, sabotage and violence. At this point, however, the quasi anarchistic revolutionary unionists themselves split into two camps, centralizers and decentralizers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 166-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW newspaper that focused most specifically on the Western United States (and which continues to be published today) is the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' (which, for a time after the 1906 split, was duplicated and/or replaced by the ''[[Industrial Union Bulletin]]''). In the East, the IWW newspaper of record for the Chicago IWW was ''[[Solidarity (U.S. newspaper)|Solidarity]]''.

====Seeds of another split====

Foner identified a schism within the Chicago IWW in addition to the east/west divide, consisting of those who wanted a labor union with a revolutionary program, and those who merely wanted to be a revolutionary cadre leading the working class to revolution via propaganda and agitation.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Many other analysts, however, identified two contesting groups essentially according to what they called themselves — centralizers and decentralizers.

====Centralizers====

Of the centralizers, Hoxie observes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The centralizers believe that the actual building up of the industrial organization will train and educate the workers in the conduct, not only of industry, but of all social affairs, so that when the organization has become universalized it can perform all the necessary functions of social control now exercised by the state in its legislative, executive and judicial capacities. This universal organization of the workers will then displace the state, government and politics in the present sense; private ownership, privilege and exploitation will be forever abolished. The [[One Big Union (concept)|one big union]] will have become the state, the government, the supreme organic and functional expression of society; its rules and decisions will be the law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Decentralizers====

Hoxie explains the decentralizers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The decentralizers look forward to what they call a free industrial society. Each local group of workers is to be a law to itself. They are to organize as they please. The present industrial and social arrangements are to be overthrown simply by making it unprofitable for the employing class to own and operate industries. Future society is to consist of independent groups of workers freely exchanging their products. The proper proportions of investments and production, the ratio of exchange of goods, etc., will automatically be determined, just as they are under competitive industry, only then the competition will be between groups of workers, instead of between individuals. Universal knowledge and a superior morality, which will spring up as soon as capitalist society is abolished, will take the place of our present complicated system of social control and do away with the necessity of government in the present sense.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond the described differences, Hoxie concludes, the theories, methods, and policies of the centralizers and the decentralizers were much the same.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 168.&lt;/ref&gt; But historian [[Philip S. Foner]] described the decentralizers as "the most vehement and noisiest of the anti-leadership element." They wanted to remove all officers of the union, and replace them with a stenographer. They also sought to abolish the union's General Executive Board and the annual convention. In 1913 a majority of delegates rejected the goals of the decentralizers, yet they continued their efforts for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==1924 split==

In 1924 (three years after Hoxie's analyses were published), as the Detroit IWW languished, the Chicago IWW was once again split by a division between centralizers and decentralizers.

===Impact of the divisions===

In 1919 Paul Brissenden wrote that while the departure of Sherman and the Western Federation of Miners in 1906, and the DeLeon faction in 1908, meant the loss of its "most reputable, best financed, and most respectable elements, their loss tended to give sharp definition and emphatic impulse toward a more revolutionary policy."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 177&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the IWW became the champion of unskilled and migratory workers, including workers facing frequent unemployment, during the decade that followed. Brissenden commented in 1919 that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Wobblies] were able to develop great strength because they had modified their theories to the extent necessary to make some appreciable application of them to the actual conditions of economic life. They were confronted by conditions and met them at the cost of doctrinal consistency. They were unconscious pragmatists and the result is that they have made themselves felt to a much greater extent than the doctrinaires [of the Detroit IWW]. They have been strikingly successful as gadflies—stinging and shocking the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'' into the initiation of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet Brissenden wrote that the question of decentralization was "perhaps the most fundamental [issue] ever given wide discussion by the I.W.W. membership."&lt;ref name="syndicalism304"&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 304&lt;/ref&gt; Brissenden, acknowledging in 1919 that the decentralization forces within the IWW had not dissipated, had a sense of foreboding about the future of that organization. He wrote, "the doctrine was not annihilated in 1913; it was merely smothered. The I.W.W. may yet be 'unscrambled'."&lt;ref name="syndicalism304"/&gt;

In spite of "anti-radical hysteria" during and just after the war years, the IWW continued to grow. The IWW's peak membership probably occurred in 1923.&lt;ref name="progressive63"&gt;Daniel Earl Saros, Labor, industry, and regulation during the progressive era, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2009, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; 1924 would see the beginning of a dramatic decline, and the recent repression would work to exacerbate the internal tensions responsible for that decline.

There were a number of reasons that the IWW faced division in 1924. Wobbly leaders who had been arrested and imprisoned during or after [[World War I]] on [[espionage]] charges (for opposing the war) had just been released in two groups; some, in mid-1923, agreed to a [[pardon]] that stipulated they must refrain from activities related to their former union activism. Their decision was viewed with suspicion by the IWW, and by those who refused the pardon. Those who chose to stay in prison were released in December 1923, but their circumstances were likewise divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 263-264&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW reacted to the repression commencing in 1917, in part, by making all former leaders of the IWW ineligible for office. Ralph Darlington observed that this "effectively severed the organization from its past, decapitating the IWW even more ruthlessly than the government had been able to."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Darlington, Syndicalism and the transition to communism: an international comparative analysis, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former leaders, including [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[James P. Cannon]], and [[William Z. Foster]], had joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and disagreement over [[bolshevism]] created additional dissension.&lt;ref name="industrial264"&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 264&lt;/ref&gt; One IWW leader, George Williams, had been in Moscow in 1921, and formed a bad opinion of the political situation in the Soviet Union. He warned against possible Communist influence in the IWW, stating that it would endanger both the principles of the IWW, and the organization itself.&lt;ref name="industrial264"/&gt; Acting upon Williams' recommendation, the IWW chose to oppose Bolshevism.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 264-265&lt;/ref&gt; But Bolshevism was only a complicating factor. The centralist-decentralist split would play the decisive role in the future of the IWW.

==Two IWWs, side by side==

The modern IWW website describes a historical offshoot led by James Rowan of the [[Lumber Workers Industrial Union]] (LWIU), who invoked the E-P (Emergency Program). The other faction was sometimes called the "Four Trey" group, taking their name from the address of the IWW headquarters at 3333 W. Belmont in Chicago.&lt;ref name="explorations82"&gt;Archie Green, Wobblies, pile butts, and other heroes:
laborlore explorations, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, the question of politics played a significant role between union factions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; At the 1924 IWW convention, decentralist Rowan scheduled a session in parallel with the official session controlled by the leadership. The result was two competing factions who, as in 1906, fought in the streets and in the courts for control of IWW headquarters.&lt;ref name="industrial265"&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; In his book about the IWW ''We Shall Be All'', Melvyn Dubofsky concluded that the IWW had torn itself apart through internal conflict, and that the result was "total collapse".&lt;ref name="industrial265"/&gt; Rowan formed an "emergency program" (the "E-P") from his base in Washington state, in an effort to save the IWW.&lt;ref name="industrial265"/&gt; "The E-Pers believed that the administration of the IWW was too strongly emphasizing 'Political Action' as opposed to Organizing on the Job. The E-P claimed to oppose 'centralism' in favor of 'decentralism', but the E-P sought to centralize power within individual Industrial Unions."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Decline of the IWW after 1924===

Archie Green attributed the decline of the IWW to the 1924 split, which was exacerbated by government persecution, and the defection of many members to the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="explorations82"/&gt; At the 1925 convention, there were only eleven delegates. There were no conventions in 1926 and 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 265-266&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, in some parts of the country, there were two IWW halls, some of them very near to each other, each following one faction or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Nelson, Break Their Haughty Power, Joe Murphy in the Heyday of the Wobblies, ISM Press, 1993 (2001), page 285. This material (side by side IWW halls) subject to confirmation. Break Their Haughty Power is a [[biographical novel]] based upon oral history.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, Rowan's separatist movement was [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] and had about two hundred followers.&lt;ref name="industrial265"/&gt; By 1931 the E-P, which had been the smaller of the two factions, ceased to exist. Presumably, many in the E-P group began to drift back into the main IWW faction. However, a significant number of members "dropped out the middle" during the period of infighting.&lt;ref&gt;Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, The IWW: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Industrial Workers of the World, publisher, 1976, pages 151-155&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 book ''Labor, industry, and regulation during the progressive era'', Daniel Earl Saros concluded that however one characterizes its successes and failures, the IWW "demonstrates that strong challenges were being made to the ideology of social responsibility and that the defenders of that ideology had much to gain from the suppression of [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|radical alternatives]]."&lt;ref name="progressive63"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}

The '''house system''' is a traditional feature of schools in [[England]], originating in England. This nomenclature may apply to similar schools in the United States. The school is divided into subunits called "houses" and each student is allocated to one house at the moment of enrollment. Houses may compete with one another at sports and maybe in other ways, thus providing a focus for group loyalty.

Different schools will have different numbers of houses: some might have more than 10 houses (with as few as 50 students in each house) or as few as four or fewer (with as many as 200 students in each). In some cases, individual houses can be even larger, as in [[McCracken County High School]] in the U.S. state of Kentucky, whose five houses have nearly 400 students each.&lt;ref name=McCracken&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccracken.kyschools.us/AboutMCHS.aspx |title=About MCHS |publisher=McCracken County High School |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities, such as [[pastoral care]], may be provided on a house basis to a greater or lesser extent depending on the type of school. Historically, the house system was associated with established [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] in England, especially full [[boarding school]]s, where a "house" referred to a [[boarding house]] at the school. In modern times, in both day and boarding schools, the word "house" may refer only to a grouping of pupils, rather than to a particular building.

Houses may be named after [[saint]]s, famous historical alumni or notable regional topics (e.g. in international schools, houses are sometimes named in honor of local celebrities). Other more arbitrary names—animal names or colours, for example—are also often used. Houses are also often referred to by the original name of the building or by the name or initials of the teacher in charge of the house ([[housemistress]] or [[housemaster]]). Each house will usually also be identified by its own symbol, logo, or colours.

At co-educational boarding schools, there may be separate houses for boys and girls, as at the [[Lawrenceville School]], whose house system is itself based on that of [[Rugby School]]. Students may also be grouped by year groups or status as boarders or day students. At [[Winchester College]] and [[Eton College]], there is a separate house for foundation scholars. Where the school has boarders and day pupils like the [[King's School, Canterbury]] or [[Shrewsbury School]], they will often be allocated to separate houses. There have also been cases, for example at [[Cheltenham College]], of pupils being allocated to different houses according to their religion. At traditional full boarding schools such as [[Radley College]] and [[Harrow School]], students are grouped by boarding house.

==Pastoral care==
Especially at a boarding school, one of the main purposes of the house system is to provide [[pastoral care]] to the [[student]]s. With parents absent, children are likely to depend on the school to look after their basic physical, [[social]] and [[emotional]] needs.

==Competition between houses==
A secondary feature of house systems is the competition between houses. For example, the traditional school [[sports day]] is usually an inter-house competition. [[Debating]] competitions and charity drives are also often organised along inter-house lines. Merit points for behaviour and academic achievement may also be totalled up for comparison between houses.

Some schools have a year-long programme of inter-house events, in which each house "hosts" an event at which all houses compete, with points contributing to the award of the House Cup at the end of the year.

[[Shrewsbury School]] and [[Eton College]] still maintain an annual [[bumps race]] between houses, which was carried on by old boys to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] colleges, both of which still race in bumps; Shrewsbury and Eton race in fours, whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.

==Membership and roles==
Pupils are usually assigned to houses randomly, perhaps with the aim of balancing the houses in order to increase competition.  Sometimes the assignment is based on the social and emotional needs of the student and to ensure proper [[peer mentor]]ing is enhanced with the right fit of students within a house.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Traditionally, however, once a pupil has been assigned to a house, any younger siblings he or she has may automatically become members of that house when they arrive at the school, but this varies from school to school. (This tradition sometimes extends to the children of former pupils.) Once a pupil has been allocated to a house they stay with that house as they move up through the year groups.

One notable feature of the house system is the appointment of ''house captains'', and maybe other house [[prefect]]s, who exercise limited authority within the house and assist in the organisation of the house. Large schools may have a house captain for each year group (with vice-captains in the largest schools).

In boarding schools, the term ''housemaster''  or ''housemistress'' is the title held by the member of staff responsible for pupils living in a particular house (or [[dormitory]]). In [[state school]]s, members of staff are appointed as (or volunteer to become) ''head of house''. However, both terms can be used at either style of school for the sake of formality.

In some cases, houses may have their own staff members other than housemaster or housemistress. For example, at the aforementioned McCracken County High School, each house has its own principal, guidance counselor, and teachers.&lt;ref name=McCracken/&gt;

==Other uses==
The term "house system" is also used to refer to the [[residential college]] systems found in some US colleges and universities, such as [[Rice University]], [[Caltech]], [[Yale College]], [[Harvard College]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and [[University of Chicago]]. These systems are based on the college systems of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge Universities]] in the United Kingdom, which in turn share many similarities with the house systems of British secondary schools.

==Prominence in school stories==
The first boarding-school story was [[Sarah Fielding]]'s ''[[The Governess, or The Little Female Academy]]'', published in 1749.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt; The genre did not become popular until 1857, with [[Thomas Hughes]]' novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]''.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt; The house system has since featured prominently in thousands of [[school stories]] books, with many authors writing a whole series of books such as [[Chalet School]] and [[Malory Towers]] which have been published around the world and translated into several languages.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harry Potter - All Things to All People? | author = Gill James |publisher = Proceedings of the first Harry Potter conference on the UK (Accio UK 2005) | url = http://accio.org.uk/05/proc/gilljames.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books and films (re)popularized this genre, and resulted in unprecedented awareness of British boarding schools (and their house system) in countries where they were previously unknown.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt;

These stories depict the popular conception of a British boarding school rather than how modern boarding schools work in reality, and often focus on the most positive aspects.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt; For example, loyalty to one's house is very important in real-life houses, and features prominently in many of these books.&lt;ref name="steege"&gt;{{citation | title= The ivory tower and Harry Potter: perspectives on a literary phenomenon |chapter= Harry Potter, Tom Brown, and the British School Story: Lost in Transit? |author= David K. Steege |editor= Lana A. Whited |edition= illustrated |publisher= University of Missouri Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-8262-1549-9 |pages= 140–156 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Harry Potter'' books have updated the boarding school to 21st-century values, for example by depicting [[mixed-sex education]] houses.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt; Most Britons never went to a boarding school, but have integrated their values by reading these books.&lt;ref name="steege"/&gt;

The translators of some foreign editions of the ''Harry Potter'' books had difficulties conveying the "house" concept in languages like Russian or German, because there was no word that could adequately convey the importance of belonging to a certain house, the loyalty owed to one's house, and the pride in the prizes won by one's own house.&lt;ref name="russian"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Meta Translators' Journal | title = From Harry to Garri: Strategies for the Transfer of Culture and Ideology in Russian Translations of Two English Fantasy Stories | author = Judith Inggshttp | volume = 48 | issue = 1-2 Traduction pour les enfants / Translation for children | date = May 2003 | pages = 285–297 | url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2003/v48/n1-2/006975ar.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This forces translators to insert extra explanations in the dialogue, making foreign readers think that the house and boarding systems were a special feature of the fantasy setting rather than a real-world feature which would not need to be explained to a typical British child.&lt;ref name="feral"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The French translation does not explain the differences between the French and English real-world boarding schools, instead having the house system and the head boys explained as peculiarities of [[Hogwarts]].&lt;ref name="feral" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Trafficking of women, children and men routes.svg|thumb|300px|Trafficking routes of women, children and men]]
The [[United Nations]] defines trafficking as "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation."&lt;ref name=Lazco&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lacko|first=Frank|title=Developing Better Indicators of Human Trafficking|journal=Brown Journal of World Affairs|volume=X|series=1|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United Nations has reported on forced prostitution of Dominican women in [[brothels in Haiti]] frequented by [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] Peacekeepers.

Dominican men and women have been subjected to sex [[forced labor in the United States]] and [[Argentina]]. Most trafficked victims are sent to Western Europe, and some are sent to North America.&lt;ref name="M'Cormack" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benoit /&gt; Out of all areas in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic has the highest amount of trafficked persons; women are trafficked to [[Human trafficking in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] and [[Human trafficking in Panama|Panama]] as well as to Western Europe. There are over one thousand Dominican commercial sex workers in [[Spain]] and 3,675 in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Hope&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas-Hope|first=Elizabeth|title=Human Trafficking in the Caribbean and the Human Rights of Migrants|pages=1–15|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ministry of Labor reported that sugar [[plantation]]s no longer use [[child labor]], the sugar industry has been cited as vulnerable for possible use of forced labor. A 2009 NGO study found of some 500 male Haitian construction workers interviewed, 21 percent reported experiencing forced labor in the Dominican Republic at some point, although not in their current jobs as construction workers. However, the December 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' reported 5 agricultural goods produced under such working conditions in the Dominican Republic, all of them involving child labor and one involving both child labor and forced labor. Street children and undocumented or stateless Haitian people – including the Dominican-born children and grandchildren of Haitian migrants – were vulnerable groups to trafficking. [[Child sex tourism]] is a problem, particularly in coastal resort areas, with child sex tourists arriving year-round from various countries.

The Government of the Dominican Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The government has not convicted any trafficking offenders, including officials possibly complicit in trafficking, since 2007. Results in the areas of victim protection, and trafficking prevention were also limited.

==Why the Caribbean? ==
[[Unemployment]], poverty, [[illiteracy]], history of abuse, [[drug abuse|drug use]], and gang membership are all individual causes of rising human trafficking within the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Hope"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seelke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seelke|first=Clare|title=Trafficking in persons in Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=Trends in Organized Crime|volume=14|issue=2/3|pages=272–277|doi=10.1007/s12117-011-9135-z}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, traffickers will work along the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic and trick fathers and mothers into letting their children leave, resulting in the exploitation of their children.&lt;ref name=unicef&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Trafficking: Dominican Republic|url=http://www.unicef.org/republicadominicana/english/protection_12467.htm|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are external and global factors as well, some of which include the global demand for domestic servants, agricultural workers, and factory labor; political, social, or economic crises; [[natural disasters]], the [[machismo]] attitude which causes men to discriminate against the female gender, public corruption, lack of government interest, and the limited economic opportunities. Most trafficked individuals often are never able to pay off their remittances which equates to about an estimated amount of 325 billion U.S. dollars; resulting in a lack of development to his or her said country.

More specifically, in the Dominican Republic, 38% of the 784 Dominican and Haitian children questioned worked in the agricultural sector, as domestic workers in family homes and other informal activities such as [[hawker (trade)|street selling]]. Most children work six or seven days a week because they are required to take care of themselves.&lt;ref name=unicef /&gt;

Two groups that are currently of specific concern are irregular migrants and [[Deportation|deportees]]. Irregular migrants are those that move illegally across borders, those who enter a country legally but then stay beyond the limits of his or her [[visa (document)|visas]], and people whose residency or [[citizenship]] status is modified because of changes in laws and regulations. Irregular migrants often enter into a vulnerable state where they suffer from both physical and emotional abuse. They do not want to leave the country and so suffer extortion and exploitation as a result. Many are promised that they will gain employment and then are sold by trafficking gangs.&lt;ref name=Hope /&gt;

It is difficult to deduce the exact impact of trafficking or the number of women and children who have been affected because of circumstances such as violence, abuse, [[coercion]], trauma and stigma associated with being a victim of trafficking. The [[language barrier]] can sometimes be a problem; especially when some words in the English language are not in the Spanish vocabulary. Another reason why it is difficult to obtain an exact number of people who are being trafficked is because there are no registers or indicators, no legal processes on the matter, and there are seldom complaints and reports of this type of offense.&lt;ref name=unicef /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langberg|first=Laura|title=A Review of Recent OAS Research on Human Trafficking in the Latin American and Caribbean Region|journal=International Migration|volume=43|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.0020-7985.2005.00315.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-03-27--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and government responses==
Dominican law prohibits all forms of trafficking through its comprehensive anti-trafficking Law 137-03, which prescribes penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment. The government reported 36 persons “currently in preventive detention” under Law 137-03, but these data conflate trafficking and [[smuggling]], as Law 137-03 covers both. Authorities reported the government may prosecute trafficking offenders under other statutes; [[NGO]] observers have said corruption on the part of authorities is a problem. The government reported it provided training for officials posted abroad on identifying and assisting trafficking victims, and each year, judges take an online course on trafficking, available through the National Magistrates School.&lt;ref name=State&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dominican Republic|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2010|journal=U.S. Department of State|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has claimed to have made several efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims,{{when|date=May 2013}} but results were limited. The government has not clarified whether it has a formal mechanism to guide officials in proactively identifying victims among vulnerable groups and refer them to available services offered by NGOs. The government provided $13,500 in support for an NGO-run shelter and religious order that assisted adult, female victims.

A government agency, which is reportedly underfunded, managed shelters for children that assisted child trafficking victims during the reporting period. While the government did not provide formal long-term reintegration assistance programs for trafficking victims, the First Lady’s office facilitated victims’ access to psychological and financial support, and another government agency offered skills training to some victims during the reporting period. The Dominican government claimed to have encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but few elected to do so. Another NGO reported an instance where several victims were willing to assist with a prosecution but claimed there had been no progress in four years. Some officials and an NGO reported some alleged trafficking offenders made deals to compensate victims in lieu of criminal prosecution.

The government did not implement a national public awareness campaign during the reporting period, though there were several campaigns on raising anti-trafficking awareness targeted toward at-risk populations and tourist areas. A national interagency anti-trafficking commission chaired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated inter-agency cooperation and oversaw implementation of a national action plan, which remained reliant on donor funding but was hampered by lack of participation of the prosecution service. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex acts]] during the reporting period. Since 2001, the U.S. government has given over four hundred million dollars in foreign assistance to help combat and eliminate human trafficking and the U.S. government has funded 42 task forces on human trafficking between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name="M'Cormack" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benoit /&gt;  However, on July 16, 2012, the Dominican Republic signed three agreements dealing with [[human trafficking within the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karas|first=David|title=Human trafficking: Corporate America enlists in the global fight|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|date=July 13, 2011|url=http://find.galegroup.com/gic/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;idigest=8b4f5c18b21409583272658ff128480b&amp;prodId=GIC&amp;userGroupName=drakeu_main&amp;tabID=T004&amp;docId=A297301115&amp;type=retrieve&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act]] was enacted by the United States in 2000 and was created to establish minimum standards to combat human trafficking applicable to countries that have significant trafficking problems.&lt;ref name=Seelke /&gt; The Secretary of State was to provide reports each year about countries that do not follow the minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. Each country is part of a Tier group; 1-3 with 3 being the worst. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 was created much like the VTVPA however it also addressed the top countries to be keeping a close eye on.&lt;ref name=Seelke /&gt; The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 gave more freedom to monitor and evaluate all assistance given under the previous laws. Other countries were also required to undergo inspections in critical areas where trafficking is most likely. Lastly, there also need to be better indicators for human trafficking.&lt;ref name=Laczko&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laczko|first=Frank|author2=Marco A. Gramegna|title=Developing Better Indicators of Human Trafficking|journal=Brown Journal of World Affairs|date=Fall 2003|volume=X|issue=1|url=http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/laczko_gramegna_2003__devel.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data needs to describe the international population movements and provide governments with a solid basis for policy formulation and implementation. One of the greatest needs is to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries in order to enable them to collect better migration data.&lt;ref name=unicef /&gt;

==Results of human trafficking in the Caribbean==
There are many economic, societal, health, and other impacts on human trafficking.&lt;ref name="M'Cormack" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benoit /&gt;

===Economic impacts===
Trafficking results in a transfer of money to developing countries because the trafficked individuals have to pay off the debt that he or she has for being trafficked.

===Societal impacts===
Trafficking reduces extended family ties and the forced absence of females leads to a breakdown of families and [[child neglect|neglect of children]] and the elderly members of the family. The victims of trafficking are often ignored and shunned once he or she returns to the community and then this individual gets involved with [[criminal activity]]. Children who are trafficked are seen as forever damaged and these children suffer from [[Psychological truama|trauma]] and psychological problems.

===Health impacts===
Transporting individuals can result in [[injury]] and for some even [[death]] before he or she reaches their intended destination. Certain diseases can be a result because the transportation devices are overcrowded and unsanitary. Many individuals who are trafficked for the sex industry may also develop [[HIV]] and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]]; many times the victims are not given the option to use [[condom]]s.

===Miscellaneous impacts===
Women and children are the main vulnerable groups of exploitation. These people who are trafficked no longer have [[human rights]]; these people lose the right and opportunity to grow up in a protected environment. These people also lose the right to [[healthcare]], education, work, and other [[Civil liberties|freedoms]]. Many governments are unable to protect women and children who are [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and many government officials are bribed by the traffickers and therefore cannot combat against the rugs [[human trafficking]].

The skills and practices involved are transmitted by human [[culture]] through social [[learning]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011/&gt;

[[Plants]] provide the greater part of the [[food]] for people and their [[domestic animal]]s: much of human [[culture]] and [[civilisation]] came into being through [[agriculture]]. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of [[staple crop]]s including [[wheat]], [[rice]], and [[maize]] provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, [[animals]] provide much of the [[meat]] eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as [[model organism|models]] in [[biological research]], such as in [[genetics]], and in [[drug testing]]. Until the 19th century, [[medicinal plant|plants yielded]] most of the [[medicinal drugs]] in common use, as described in the 1st century by [[Dioscorides]]. Plants are the source of many [[psychoactive drug]]s, some such as [[coca]] known to have been used for thousands of years. [[Yeast]], a fungus, has been used to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[cereal]]s such as wheat and barley to make [[bread]] and [[beer]]; other fungi such as ''[[Psilocybe]]'' and [[fly agaric]] mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.

Many species of animal are kept as [[pet]]s, the most popular being [[mammals]], especially [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as [[cactus]]es, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as [[houseplant]]s.

Animals such as [[horse]]s and [[deer]] are among the earliest subjects of [[art]], being found in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as at [[Lascaux]].

Living things further play a wide variety of symbolic roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Sometimes a major [[disease]] like [[tuberculosis]], caused by a [[bacterium]], [[Tuberculosis in human culture|plays a role in culture]], in its case being associated for some reason with artistic creativity.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchman1987"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Churchman |first1=David |title=The Educational Role of Zoos: A Synthesis of the Literature (1928-1987) with Annotated Bibliography |date=1987 |publisher=California State University |page=8 |ref=ED289742 |quote=addressing the broad question of the relationship between animals and human culture.

[[Anthropology]] has traditionally studied the roles of animals and of plants in human culture in two opposed ways: as physical resources that humans used; and as symbols or concepts through [[totemism]] and [[animism]].

Plants provide the greater part of food for humans, and for their [[domestic animal]]s. They have [[History of agriculture|played a key role in the history of world civilizations]]. Agriculture includes [[agronomy]] for arable crops, [[horticulture]] for vegetables and fruit, and [[forestry]] for timber.&lt;ref name=NatGeogAgriculture&gt;{{cite web |title=The Development of Agriculture |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=20 June 2016 |date=2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species.

===For work and transport===
{{main article|Working animal|Pack animal}}

[[Working animal|Working domestic animals]] including cattle, horses, yaks, camels, and elephants have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, [[pack animal]]s continue to transport goods.&lt;ref name="Pond2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pond |first=Wilson G. |title=Encyclopedia of Animal Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SQl7Ao3mHoC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=2004 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-5496-9 |pages=248–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Medicinal plants}}

[[Vaccine]]s have been made using animals since their discovery by [[Edward Jenner]] in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live [[cowpox]] afforded protection against the more dangerous [[smallpox]]. In the 19th century, [[Louis Pasteur]] developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for [[rabies]]. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases [[mumps]] and [[polio]] were developed using animal cells grown [[in vitro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vaccines and animal cell technology |url=http://www.actip.org/library/vaccines-and-animal-cell-technology/ |publisher=Animal Cell Technology Industrial Platform |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing variety of [[medicinal drug]]s are based on [[toxin]]s and other molecules of animal origin. The cancer drug [[Yondelis]] was isolated from the [[tunicate]] ''[[Ecteinascidia turbinata]]''. One of dozens of toxins made by the deadly cone snail ''[[Conus geographus]]'' is used as [[Prialt]] in pain relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medicines by Design |url=https://publications.nigms.nih.gov/medbydesign/chapter3.html |publisher=National Institute of Health |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[classical antiquity|classical times]] and possibly much earlier, hundreds of species of plants have provided drugs to treat a wide range of conditions. [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', written by 70 AD, listed some 600 [[medicinal plant]]s and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[colocynth]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], [[opium]] and [[squill]]. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European [[pharmacopoeia]] until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Osbaldestonxxi&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/box_widget.html | work=Dioscorides | publisher=Ibidis Press | author=Osbaldeston, Tess Anne (translator) | year=2000 | location=Johannesburg | title=Introduction | pages=xxi–xxvi | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062658/http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/box_widget.html | archivedate=2014-09-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vos 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author=De Vos, Paula | year=2010 | title=European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use | journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume=132 | issue=1 | pages=28–47 | doi=10.1016/j.jep.2010.05.035 | pmid=20561577 | pmc=2956839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For pleasure===
[[File:Azaleas in a Landscape Isabella Plantation.jpg|thumb|The colourful floral display in the [[Isabella Plantation]], [[Richmond Park]], London attracts many visitors.]]

Both animals and plants are used to provide pleasure, through a range of activities including keeping pets, hunting, fishing, and gardening.

A wide variety of animals are kept as [[pet]]s, from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses, insects including [[praying mantis]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other bugs|url=http://www.keepinginsects.com/cockroaches-locusts-ants/|publisher=Keeping Insects|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reptile]]s such as [[snake]]s and [[chameleon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Melissa|title=So, you think you want a reptile?|url=http://www.anapsid.org/parent.html|publisher=Anapsid.org|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bird]]s including [[Canary (bird)|canaries]], [[parakeet]]s and [[parrot]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pet Birds|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/pet_birds/|publisher=PDSA|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; all finding a place.

Thousands of plant species are cultivated for aesthetic purposes as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to [[garden tourism|historic gardens]], [[national park]]s, [[rainforest]]s, [[forest]]s with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as [[Hanami|Japan's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T2blg2Kw_zcC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=hanami#v=onepage&amp;q=hanami&amp;f=false |page=12 |title=Introduction to Japanese culture |first=Daniel |last=Sosnoski |publisher=Tuttle |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8048-2056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Cherry Blossom Festival|America's cherry blossom festivals]].&lt;ref name="NCBF"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314055554/http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/about/history/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url=http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/about/history/ |title=History of the Cherry Blossom Trees and Festival |work=National Cherry Blossom Festival: About |publisher=National Cherry Blossom Festival |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some [[garden]]s are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. [[Arboretum]]s and [[botanical garden]]s are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardens may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with [[topiary]] or [[espalier]]. [[Gardening]] is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or [[horticulture therapy]] is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as [[houseplant]]s, or in specialized buildings such as [[greenhouse]]s that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. [[Venus Flytrap]], [[sensitive plant]] and [[resurrection plant]] are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as [[bonsai]], [[ikebana]], and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. [[Ornamental plant]]s have sometimes changed the course of history, as in [[tulip mania|tulipomania]].&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Tim|title=A Brief History of Gardening|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
{{further|Animal painting}}

Both animals and plants are significant in art, whether as background or as main subjects.

Animals, often mammals but including fish and insects among other groups, have been the [[Animal painting|subjects of art]] from the earliest times, in both early history as in [[Ancient Egypt]], and prehistory, as in the [[Lascaux|cave paintings at Lascaux]] and other sites in the [[Dordogne]], France and elsewhere. Major artistic depictions of animals include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1515 ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|The Rhinoceros]]'', and [[George Stubbs]]'s c. 1762 horse portrait ''[[Whistlejacket]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |accessdate=24 June 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants appear in art, either to illustrate their botanical appearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Antheunisse |first1=Max |title=About |url=http://www.plantillustrations.org/about.php |publisher=Plant Illustrations |accessdate=20 June 2016 |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for the purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the [[Virgin Mary]] was compared by the [[Venerable Bede]] to a [[lily]], the white [[petal]]s denoting purity of body, while the yellow [[anther]]s signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's [[Annunciation]] may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in [[still life]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Botanical Imagery in European Painting |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Raymond |first1=Francine |title=Why botanical art is still blooming today |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/9924556/Why-botanical-art-is-still-blooming-today.html |accessdate=19 June 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri''' (April 18, 1982–2017) was a citizen of [[Saudi Arabia]] suspected of being chief bomb-maker of [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=SaudiGazette2009-08-31&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009083148387 |title       = Suicide bomber named |date        = September 1, 2009 |author      = Abdullah Al-Oreifij |publisher   = [[Saudi Gazette]] |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saudigazette.com.sa%2Findex.cfm%3Fmethod%3Dhome.regcon%26contentID%3D2009083148387&amp;date=2009-09-01 |archivedate = September 1, 2009 |accessdate  = August 2, 2009 |deadurl     = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was reported to have been responsible for making the bombs used by his brother [[Abdullah al-Asiri]] in his suicide bombing, the [[2009 Christmas Day bomb plot]], the [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]], and the [[May 8th 2012 Terror Plot]].&lt;ref name=DailyBeast2012-05-14&gt;{{cite news |url        = http://www.thedailybeast.com//content/newsweek/2012/05/13/al-qaeda-s-body-bombs-al-asiri-s-next-threat.html |title      = Ibrahim al-Asiri: The Body Bomb Menace |publisher  = [[Daily Beast]] |date       = 2012-05-14 |accessdate = 2012-05-14 |author     = Daniel Klaidman, Christopher Dickey}} [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fnewsweek%2F2012%2F05%2F13%2Fal-qaeda-s-body-bombs-al-asiri-s-next-threat.html&amp;date=2012-05-14 mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Little is known about al-Asiri’s early life; he was born in 1982 into a religious and military family in [[Riyadh]] with four brothers and three sisters.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web| title=Profile: Al-Qaeda 'bomb maker' Ibrahim al-Asiri | author=BBC News| publisher=BBC News| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11662143|  date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Asiri's father is a retired soldier. As of September 2009, he had two surviving brothers.&lt;ref name=SaudiGazette2009-08-31/&gt;

The ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'' reported that al-Asiri had been imprisoned and released. His imprisonment was a result of an attempt to enter [[Iraq]] to join Islamist insurgents.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; He reportedly left Saudi Arabia for [[Yemen]] together with his brother [[Abdullah al-Asiri]]&amp;nbsp;— whom he had recruited to al-Qaeda&amp;nbsp;— to join up with al-Qaeda members.&lt;ref name=SaudiGazette2009-08-31/&gt;

On February 3, 2009, al-Asiri and Abdullah were named on a [[Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists|list of Saudi Arabia's most wanted terrorist suspects]].&lt;ref name=ArabNews2009-02-03&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=118850&amp;d=3&amp;m=2&amp;y=2009 |title       = Kingdom unveils list of 85 wanted militants abroad |date        = February 3, 2009 |publisher   = [[Arab News]] |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arabnews.com%2F%3Fpage%3D1%26section%3D0%26article%3D118850%26d%3D3%26m%3D2%26y%3D2009&amp;date=2009-09-10 |archivedate = September 10, 2009 |deadurl     = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SaudiGazetteSaudiMostWanted2009-02-03&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009020328293 |title       = 85 on Saudi wanted list of militants |publisher   = [[Saudi Gazette]] |date        = February 3, 2009 |accessdate  = February 3, 2009 |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saudigazette.com.sa%2Findex.cfm%3Fmethod%3Dhome.regcon%26contentID%3D2009020328293&amp;date=2009-02-04 |archivedate = February 4, 2009 |deadurl     = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2009-02-02&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/story/884630.html |title       = Saudi 'most wanted list' includes freed Guantánamo detainees |publisher   = [[Miami Herald]] |author      = Carol Rosenberg |date        = February 2, 2009 |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.miamiherald.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fstory%2F884630.html&amp;date=2009-02-03 |archivedate = February 3, 2009 |deadurl     = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list published by the Government of Saudi Arabia listed 85 individuals, 83 of whom were Saudis, and 2 were from Yemen.

==Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula==

al-Asiri is suspected of being the main explosives expert for [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) and the bomb-maker responsible for building the bombs in the [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/31/cargo-bombs-plot-us-saudi-extremist | title=Cargo bombs plot: US hunts Saudi extremist|accessdate=October 31, 2010|date=October 31, 2010|publisher=The Guardian|last1=McGreal|first1= Chris|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a likely suspect due to his history of creating explosive devices using [[PETN]], including his involvement in the failed [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|Christmas Day bomb plot]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8102883/Al-Qaeda-plot-flight-ban-on-freight-from-Somalia.html|title=Al-Qaeda plot: Flight ban on freight from Somalia |publisher=Telegraph |date=November 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 1, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggested the same person constructed both the Yemen parcel bombs and the device worn by [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], the Nigerian who attempted to ignite the Christmas Day bomb on a plane in 2009.

===Reports of death===

In September 2011, al-Asiri was reported to have possibly been killed by a [[drone strike]] together with other AQAP suspects, including American-Yemeni cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/30/national/main20114215.shtml?tag=contentBody;storyMediaBox Top al Qaeda bombmaker dead in drone strike], CBS News, September 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A Yemeni official denied that al-Asiri was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/official-al-qaida-in-yemen-bomb-maker-not-killed-in-al-awlaki-strike/2011/10/02/gIQAPDakFL_story.html Official: Al-Qaida in Yemen bomb maker not killed in Al-Awlaki strike], Associated Press in ''Washington Post'', October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 2013, it was reported that Al-Asiri may have been seriously wounded by a drone strike which occurred on August 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/13/20009098-reports-al-qaedas-master-bombmaker-wounded-in-us-drone-strike?lite|author=Jim Miklaszewski, Courtney Kube and Richard Esposito|title=Reports:Al-Qaeda's Master Bombmaker Wounded In US Drone Strike|publisher=NBC News|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Yemeni official denied that al-Asiri was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/08/yemeni_official_denies_report.php&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Asiri was thought to have possibly been killed in a fire fight on April 20, 2014. Yemeni troops recovered bodies to run DNA tests, but the tests were not a match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/world/meast/yemen-terror-operation-dna/index.html?hpt=wo_c2 Was al Qaeda bomb chief killed in Yemen?], Mohammed Jamjoom and Barbara Starr, CNN, April 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/28/world/meast/yemen-dna-al-qaeda/index.html?hpt=wo_c2 DNA test: Remains from airstrike in Yemen not those of al Qaeda bomb-maker], Paul Cruickshank, Mohammed Jamjoom and Nic Robertson, CNN, April 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Asiri appeared in a 2016 video making references to Saudi Arabia's recent executions of al-Qaeda militants, thus confirming that he remained alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bomb-making terrorist threatens US, Saudi Arabia over executions|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/01/11/al-qaida-threatens-saudis-us-over-execution-militants.html|website=Fox News|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2018, United States officials announced they were confident that Al-Asiri had been killed by a drone strike in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ibrahim-al-asiri-chief-al-qaeda-bomb-maker-killed-in-u-s-drone-strike/|title=U.S. officials confident drone strike killed chief al Qaeda bomb maker|last=Martin|first=David|date=August 20, 2018|work=[[CBS News]]|access-date=August 21, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions===

On 24 March 2011, al-Asiri was added to the U.S. list of terrorists. He was wanted by the government of Saudi Arabia and was the subject of an [[Interpol]] Orange Notice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/03/158911.htm Department of State's Terrorist Designation of Ibrahim Hassan Tali Al-Asiri], [[U.S. Department of State]], 24 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-us-us-al-qaidabombma,0,621043.story US designates al-Qaida bomb maker as a terrorist], ''[[Associated Press|AP]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 24 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kaba languages''', also called ''Sara Kaba'' but not to be confused with the [[Sara languages]],&lt;ref&gt;The [http://morkegbooks.com/Services/World/Languages/SaraBagirmi//pdfs/SaraKabaNotSaraProper.pdf Sara Language Project], among others, argues that Sara Kaba is distinct from the Sara languages.&lt;/ref&gt; comprise three to five languages of [[Chad]] and the [[Central African Republic]]. They are [[Bongo–Bagirmi languages]] of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] language family. 

The most populous Kaba languages are [[Kaba Deme language|Kaba Deme]] and [[Kaba Na language|Kaba Naa]] (Kaba Na, Kaba Nar), spoken by about forty thousand people apiece. Others are [[Kaba language|Kaba proper]] (Ta Sara), [[Kaba Dunjo language|Kaba/Sara Dunjo]], and [[Kulfa language|Kulfa]] (Kaba So, Kurmi). It is not clear that Naa, Dunjo, and Kaba proper (Ta Sara) are actually distinct languages. Kulfa speakers are ethnically distinct. 

The terms "Kaba" and "Sara" are generic and often interchangeable, and do not correspond to the somewhat arbitrarily named Kaba and Sara branches of Central Sudanic. [[Kabba language|Kabba]] and [[Laka language|Kabba Laka]], for example, are Sara languages, and many of the Kaba languages go under the names "Kaba", "Sara", and "Kaba Sara".

'''Karagounides''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Καραγκούνηδες; Singular: '''Karagounis''' [[Greek language|Greek]]: Καραγκούνης) is the name of the native people of the western plains of [[Thessaly]], [[Greece]]. More specifically, the term is used to refer to the inhabitants of the lowland farming communities of the [[Karditsa (regional unit)|Karditsa]] and [[Trikala (regional unit)|Trikala]] regions, and the area around the city of [[Farsala]]. 

The older Karagounides still speak the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic dialect]] of the Greek language.

An '''LGBT liaison''' is any individual employed by an organization or institution as a [[point of contact]], serving as both a spokesperson for the organization to a local LGBT demographics as well as a representative of LGBT interests to the leaders of the organization. LGBT liaisons typically play an advisory role to organizations or government branches.

==Liaison Officers in Police Departments==
'''LGBT Liaison Officers''' have been appointed since at least 1962, when [[San Francisco Police Department]] appointed [[Elliott Blackstone]] as the United States' first liaison officer to the "[[homophile]] community".

}}{{History of Latvia}}
'''Latgalians''', sometimes also '''Ancient Latvians''' ({{Lang-la|Lethi, Letthigalli}}, {{lang-nds|Letti, Lethi}}, modern {{Lang-lv|latgaļi, letgaļi, leti}}; variant translations also include '''Latgallians''', '''Lettigalls''' or '''Lettigallians'''), were an ancient [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe. 

They likely spoke the [[Latvian language]], which probably became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' in present-day Latvia during the [[Northern crusades|Northern Crusades]] due to their alliance with the crusaders. Latgalians later assimilated the neighbouring tribes, forming the core of modern [[Latvian people|Latvians]].

==History==
The Latgalians were an [[Balts|Eastern Baltic]] tribe whose origin is little known. In the 5th and 6th centuries they lived in the eastern part of present-day [[Vidzeme]] (westwards from the [[Aiviekste River]]), and later on in nearly all the territory of that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TgIWAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=latgalian+tribe&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=latgalian+vidzeme|title=Humanities and Social Sciences: Latvia|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=University of Latvia|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In written sources they are mentioned from the 11th century. In the first two decades of the 13th century the (Western) Latgalians allied with German (mainly Saxon) [[crusade]]rs. Their lands ([[Eldership of Tālava]], [[Principality of Jersika]], [[Principality of Koknese]]) as vassal states were incorporated into [[Livonia]].

[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|350px|The Latgalians in the context of the other Baltic tribes, [[circa]] 1200 [[Common Era|CE]]. The Eastern Balts are shown in brown hue, while the Western Balts are shown in green. The boundaries are approximate.]]
In the 11th century [[Eastern orthodoxy]] started to spread in Latgalian lands from [[Principality of Polotsk|Polotsk]] and [[Principality of Pskov|Pskov]]. In 12th century Latgalian lands and their rulers paid tribute to dukes of Polotsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w6W2cHgJE2sC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=latgalian+polotsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSlPLD7eDUAhVsLsAKHXM_CToQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=latgalian%20polotsk&amp;f=false|title=A Concise History of the Baltic States|last=Plakans|first=Andrejs|date=2011-02-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521833721|location=|pages=32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 13th century during the [[Livonian crusade]] Latgalian elders changed their Eastern orthodoxy for [[Roman Catholicism]] and became vassals of [[Livonian Order]]. 

Due to crusade many regions of [[Semigallia]] and [[Courland]] were left depopulated so already during the war and also after it part of the Latgalians migrated to those regions. Subsequently between 13th and 16th centuries, they gradually assimilated other Baltic tribes [[Selonians]], [[Semigallians]] and [[Curonians]] who thus became a part of today's ethnic [[Latvians]].

==Archaeological data==
[[File:Araisi.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Āraiši lake dwelling site]] (Ezerpils)]]
In the lands of the Western and the Eastern Latgalians, about 80 flat cemeteries of Western Latgalian origin have been excavated, with more than 2,000 burials uncovered. The first large scale excavations took place in Ludza Odukalns Cemetery in Latgale (1890–1891), where 339 Late Iron Age burials were uncovered. In the excavations at Pildas Nukši Cemetery (in Latgale, 1947–1948), 218 burials were uncovered, dated to the 9th–12th century. 

At the Zvirgzdenes Kivti Cemetery (in Latgale: 1948, 1955–1958) 175 burials from the 7th–12th century were excavated. 315 burials were found at Aglonas Kristapiņi Cemetery (in Latgale; 1928, 1938, 1977–1980, 1984–1987, 1999–2000), in use from the late 8th to 12th century. 

Ērgļu Jaunāķēni Cemetery was totally excavated in 1971–1972, with 89 burials being found. At [[Koknese]] Cemetery 102 burials from the Late Iron Age were uncovered (1986–1989). In the area of [[Gauja]]'s Latgallians two cemeteries, Drabešu Liepiņas and Priekuļu Ģūģeri are well excavated too. 

Archaeological excavations have also been carried out on the hillforts of Ķente, [[Koknese]], Sārumkalns, Tanīskalns, as well as on other Latgalian sites. Only a few (Western) Latgalian settlements have been excavated. Large scale excavations (1960s–1970s) and reconstruction has been done at the [[Āraiši lake dwelling site]] (9th century).

In Latgale, dating from the 6th–7th centuries, there were flat cemeteries as well as barrow cemeteries. In the 9th–10th century the transition started from flat graves to barrows. There are about 15 excavated Eastern Latgalian barrow cemeteries, but usually only a small number of barrows were investigated. 

Archaeologically identified dwelling-sites in [[Latgale]] include [[hill forts]], settlements and [[Lake Dwellings|lake dwellings]]. Among hillforts, well researched is [[Jersika]] Hillfort (excavated in 1939 and from 1990 onwards), forming complex together with Dignāja Hillfort, on the opposite bank of [[Daugava River|Daugava]]. Jersika was occupied in the 10th–14th century, probably after the decline of Dignāja, which had been inhabited since the 6th century.

It is possible that ancestors of the so-called Eastern Latgalians migrated to the territory of present-day Latgale in the 7th and 10th–11th centuries, pushed from their previously inhabited territory by [[Slavic migration]]; some archaeologists also believe that the Eastern Latgalians formed from the most ancient East-Baltic inhabitants of Latvia, who lived in [[Vidzeme|central]] and [[Latgale|Eastern parts of Latvia]] in the "Roman" [[Iron age]] (1st–4th centuries).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">The '''London Anti-Street Harassment campaign''' (or '''LASH campaign''') is a campaign against the [[sexual harassment]] of women on the streets of [[London]].

Founded in 2010 by a 25-year-old named Vicky Simister, the campaign aims to reduce street harassment by calling for a public debate about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastlondonlocal.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/anti-harassment-campaign-to-launch-in-hackney/ News article and example story]&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for the education of the perpetrators and encourages women to stand up for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hackneypost.co.uk/?p=3914 Hackney post article], ''Anti-street harassment campaign launched''&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tool of the campaign is its [[website]] where it asks people to take action by adding their name to the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopstreetharassment.com/resources/online.htm Details of campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604222112/http://www.stopstreetharassment.com/resources/online.htm |date=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upliftmagazine.com/uplift/2010/05/lash-out-at-street-harrasment/ News article - introduction to campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians such as [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour]] [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]], [[Diane Abbott]], have lent their names to the campaign. It has also garnered media attention, including articles in ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/11/sexual-harassment-gay-rights-lohan "Sun, Sweat and Harassment"]. ''The Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[BBC Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p001d7dd Mention on BBC Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marinaleda''' is a [[List of municipalities of Spain|Spanish municipality]] of the [[province of Seville]] that belongs to the region of Sierra Sur, located in the basin of [[Genil]], in the autonomous community of [[Andalusia]]. It has an area of 24.8 km ² and a population of 2,778 inhabitants according to the 2011 census, with a population density of 112.01 hab./km². It belongs to the judicial party of Estepa.

Marinaleda is a predominantly agricultural municipality and this makes up the bulk of its economy. It is noted for its left-leaning principles based on a leftist ideology led by [[Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo]], mayor since 1979 and a member of the [[Unitarian Candidacy of Workers]] (CUT). Local workers and peasants, organised in a common struggle, have achieved a high rate of development and practically full employment for all its people. The development of an alternative economic model to capitalism has achieved notable results, even during the economic [[Great Recession|crisis that began in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/espana/440867/la-economia-segun-sanchez-gordillo|title=La economía según Sánchez Gordillo|access-date=2018-07-25|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that this economic and social progress is due in part to the fact that almost 66% of the income received by the City of Marinaleda is from administrative superiors such as the state, the autonomous community, and the Provincial Council of Seville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811013032/http://www.intereconomia.com/noticias-gaceta/politica/marinaleda-lugar-20120810|title=Marinaleda, ese lugar {{!}} Intereconomía {{!}} 823910|date=2012-08-11|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Marinaleda receives less than the average remittance received by municipalities in Andalusia (in 2011 it received around 6.61% less than the regional average).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laboratoriodenoticias.es/spip.php?article375|title=Un ejemplo de cómo La Sexta arremete contra la izquierda con mentiras: Marinaleda|last=dani|website=www.laboratoriodenoticias.es|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marinaleda is part of the "Network of Municipalities for the Third Republic" and the tricolor flag is present in civil buildings.

== Geography ==
The town is located at an altitude of 205 meters and lies 108 kilometers east of the provincial capital, [[Seville]]. Marinaleda belongs to the [[comarca]] of [[Estepa]] and is situated between this latter town and [[Écija]], in the eastern part of the province of Seville, in the basin of the Genil river. Its geographical coordinates are {{coord|37|22|N|4|57|W}}.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
The first indications of human settlement in the territory now covered by the Marinaleda municipality go back to the late [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] periods, about 5,000 years ago.  Stone tools and traces of seeds and dwelling places have been found.

There was a major [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] presence, and some date the foundation of the village to this period.  The Roman road connecting the villages of Astigi (present-day [[Écija]]) and Ostippo ([[Estepa]]) ran by Marinaleda, and there have been many discoveries from the period.

The [[Arab]] presence is visible in monuments such as the Towers of Gallape and the [[Herrera, Seville#Arab Fort of Alhonoz|fortress of Alhonoz]].  The region was conquered by the Christian monarchs in the 13th century, and Marinaleda came under the rule of the religious [[Order of Santiago]].  [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] granted the village to the first [[Marquess of Estepa]], and it would remain under this ownership until manors were dissolved in the 19th century.

Marinaleda then grew as a population centre due to the influx of day labourers working for large landowners, especially the Marquesses of Estepa.  There is evidence that, in 1751, there were 60 houses lived in by landless labourers, who earned two [[Spanish real|real]]s for a full day's work.

In the 18th century, Marinaleda had three clergymen and a shop belonging to the Marquess of [[Peñaflor, Spain|Peñaflor]], who lived in Écija.  The main economic activity was rain-fed agriculture.

During the 19th century in Marinaleda and neighbouring territories, there were several groups of bandits involving residents of the municipality.  Notable groups include those commanded by José María Hinojosa Cobacho, "[[:es:El Tempranillo|El Tempranillo]]", [[:es:Francisco Ríos González|Francisco Ríos González]] "El Pernales", and Juan Caballero.

In 1931, the population of Marinaleda was 2,318, of whom only 317 were entitled to vote.  The elections of 12 April that year were won by [[monarchist]] supporters, whereas those of 31 May were won by [[Second Spanish Republic|republicans]].  The final elections of the Republican period, on 16 February 1936, were won by the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]].

At the start of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], troops supporting the coup assassinated the mayor, Vicente Cejas Moreno, his son, and at least 30 other residents. In the postwar period, the population suffered great poverty, hunger, and repression.  The poor survived by gleaning olives and acorns from the fields of the [[Estate (land)|estates]].

The industrialization of Spain beginning in the 1960s encouraged emigration from Marinaleda to industrial areas, especially [[Catalonia]], as well as to other countries such as [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Switzerland]].

Upon the death of [[Francisco Franco]] in 1975, the [[dictatorship]] he had established in Spain gave way to a representative [[democracy]].  In 1977, the [[:es:Sindicato de Obreros del Campo|Sindicato de Obreros del Campo]] ([[Trade union|Union]] of Farm Workers) was founded in Marinaleda.  The following year, a struggle for land began with a two-day occupation of the Bocatinaja estate, between [[Osuna]] and [[Los Corrales]].

The first post-Franco municipal elections were held in 1979.  The [[:es:Colectivo de Unidad de los Trabajadores|Colectivo de Unidad de los Trabajadores]] (Workers' Unity Collective) won in Marinaleda, gaining 9 of the 11 council seats.  The new council replaced street names associated with the victors of the Civil War by names of left-wing heroes. For example, [[Agustín Muñoz Grandes|Muñoz Grandes]] street became [[Che Guevara]] street, the Plaza of Spain became the People's Plaza, and the Plaza of Francisco Franco was renamed after [[Salvador Allende]].

In 1980, 700 people staged a 13-day hunger strike, demanding better pay and stricter regulation of the old system of employment.  The success of this action led to intensification of the land struggle, with further occupations of large landowners' estates under the slogan "Land to those who work on it".  In 1984, the Cordobilla marsh was occupied for 30 days to demand irrigation for a farm called [[:es:El Humoso|El Humoso]], property of the Duke of Infantado, facilitating its later expropriation.

In 1985, the occupation of estates increased in number by at least 100, as well as in length, extending to over 90 days. This led to many legal actions.

In 1991, a 1,200-hectare tract of El Humoso farm was handed over to Marinaleda for the use of the population. Demonstrations demanding a life of dignity increased between 1992 and 1994, with many [[occupation (protest)|occupation]]s of government buildings and institutions.

In 1997, irrigation was extended to the whole of the El Humoso, and the Marinaleda S.C.A. A cooperative was founded to cultivate the farm collectively.  Three years later, a food processing plant was set up, supplied by the raw materials of the cooperative: piquillo pepper, beans, artichokes, and olives.  An oil press was also built.  Production continued to increase, and employment along with it.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007-08|economic crisis]] that began in 2008 affected the European Union by 2010, particularly its southern countries.  While 30% of the active population in Andalusia was without work, Marinaleda had full employment.

The social and political system that has been implemented in the community, and the good results obtained in terms of economic development and well-being of the inhabitants, has brought Marinaleda to the attention of the media in Spain and abroad.

The "Social Democracy" tab on the town's website states the following:&lt;ref name="demsoc"&gt;[http://www.marinaleda.com/democraciasocial.htm Marinaleda official website]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And while we were struggling for land, for industry, for employment, we realised that there were other basic rights that had to be won.  And the first necessity we identified was the lack of places to live, but we also realised that there was no place for our elders after so many years of hardship and troubles, nor was there a medical clinic, nor a day nursery, nor sports facilities, and the streets were unpaved and almost unlit.

We have always thought that liberty without equality is nothing, and that democracy without real well-being for real people is an empty word and a way to deceive people into believing they are part of a project when in fact they are not needed at all.

It seemed to us that in this principle there should be no limits; that the people should have a dream of collective welfare and that it should be realized by struggle, because no popular aspirations, no matter how unreachable they may seem, can be rejected either in thought or in action by a genuinely revolutionary Left.

In this way we were able to win each and all of the things that we were clearly lacking.}}

== Local government ==
For over 30 years, the mayor of Marinaleda has been [[Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo]] of the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left Party]].  Gordillo has anointed Marinaleda a "utopia for peace", which has no municipal police (saving $350,000 a year).  Additionally, political murals and revolutionary slogans adorn the town's whitewashed walls and streets are named after Latin American leftists. Every few weeks, the town hall declares a Red Sunday over a bullhorn and volunteers clean the streets or do odd jobs.&lt;ref name="May2009NYT" /&gt;

{{quote|They all thought that the market was God, who made everything work with his invisible hand. Before, it was a mortal sin to talk about the government having a role in the economy.

Marinaleda has a long tradition of [[sociopolitical]] struggle by agricultural [[laborer|labourer]]s, which has decisively influenced the attainment of diverse political and social advances. Marinaleda was ruled by CUT-BAI (Collective for the Unity of Workers - Andalusian Left Bloc) from 1979 until 1986, when CUT-BAI joined [[United Left (Spain)|United Left (IU)]], which has since been the ruling party, although most of the members of IU's local branch are basically members of CUT-BAI.

== Local economy ==
The town operates a farming cooperative with 2,650 workers. Marinaleda is surrounded by sloping olive groves and features a {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm. The farm is located seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) north of Marinaleda, and grows labour-intensive crops like artichokes, hot peppers, broccoli, and broad beans, as well as wheat.&lt;ref name="May2009NYT" /&gt;

== Town planning ==
Marinaleda represents a local exception of the national housing crisis caused by real estate speculation. The municipality was the subject of national news when it became known that one could own a house in this town for no more than 15 euros per month through the self-building program.&lt;ref name="May2009NYT" /&gt;

=== Self-building ===
The Ayuntamiento (local government) of Marinaleda bought and [[Expropriation|expropriated]] thousands of square metres of land, now communal property, for the construction of new houses. Land, building materials, and architectural plans are provided to the self-builder through public grants. Free assistance from professional builders is also provided.&lt;ref name="demsoc" /&gt; The hours spent by the resident on construction (if any) are deducted from the total cost. Prospective owners usually donate about 450 days of their work to the construction. Finally, a monthly payment of up to 15,52 euros is arranged with the contractors and the government for the resident to achieve ownership. To prevent speculation, citizens are prohibited from selling their homes.&lt;ref name="May2009NYT" /&gt;

=== Layout ===
Marinaleda's citizens reside in a colony of neat houses, each with three bedrooms, one bathroom, and a garden of 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, allowing for future expansions. In recent years 350 single-family homes have been built according to this scheme, even though the town has fewer than 3,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="demsoc" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">The '''Rawang''' people are an [[ethnic group]] who inhabit far northern [[Kachin State]] of [[Burma]] (Myanmar). There are  one D'rung family and several Anung families found among Lisu tribe people in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India. However,Nung rawang people and Anung (Lisu) people are two different groups.  Anung people speak and write in their own language. The Anung population mixed with Lisu tribe people in China is estimated about 20000.    According to cultural research and their own oral traditions, the Nung-Rawang are most likely Mongolian descendants who moved south from the Mongolian steppes to the 3 river region (Mekong,Yantzi,Salween)of China. During the second millennium,the Nung-Rawang migrated south west into the Himalayas at the top of Burma, seeking fertile farm lands. They settled in some of the most remote valleys and mountains in all of [[Burma]]. The Nung-Rawang are a proud, peaceful, industrious, agriculturally based mountain people known for their stability, hospitality, and colourful traditions. Living in the beautiful and isolated regions of northern Burma, they have also become prosperous through the plentiful supplies of jade and gold in their region. During the British colonial period, their very existence was thought to be a myth, as incoherent reports of "[[pygmy]] tribes" in the mountains of north Burma surfaced from time to time. The [[D'rung|Drung]], a sub tribe of the Nung-Rawang are short in stature, and are known for their crossbow hunting skills, and an extensive anthropological study has been initiated on this remote ethnic group by Dr. P. Christiaan Klieger of the California Academy of Sciences, since 2001.

{{Ethnic groups in Burma}}
Nung Rawang and Rawang are different, presently. Both the Nung and Rawang have their own dialects. Nung is not usually associated with the Rawang, as they have different cultures.Most of Nung tribe people live closely with Lisu tribe people. There are a few Nung families living in India together with the Lisu tribe people and about 2000 population in Myanmar among Lisu villages. They have no their own churches even thought they now possess their own bible book in their own language.

Under the former [[Taliban]] regime, prostitution existed clandestinely in Kabul, despite being outlawed due to the government following a very strict interpretation of the [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia]] law.

==Legality and consequences==
The practice of prostitution in Afghanistan is illegal, with punishments ranging from 5 to 15 years imprisonment and 80 lashes if unmarried.&lt;ref name="US2008"/&gt; Married prostitutes are considered [[Adultery|adulterers]] under the Afghan penal code and subject to execution. Prostitution was even more strictly prohibited under the rule of the [[Taliban]], with those thought of having [[extramarital sex]] risking [[extrajudicial killing]] by cultural [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] and [[Islamism|Islamists]].

===Extrajudicial risks===
* In July 2008, two Afghan women were accused of running a secret prostitution service and working for the police and killed by the [[Taliban]] in the [[Ghazni Province]], although the local authorities as well as the American military in the area claimed the women were innocent.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7504212.stm |title= Afghan women shot dead by Taleban |accessdate=2010-07-31 |website= |publisher= BBC News |date=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two Afghan women accused of prostitution were shot dead in July 2010.&lt;ref name="Pajhwok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2010/07/07/women-barred-from-venturing-out-of-homes.html |title= Women barred from venturing out of homes |accessdate=2010-11-02 |author=Jafar Tayar |publisher= [[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |date= July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
Prostitution in the country is mostly driven by poverty and displacement.&lt;ref name="Qadiry"/&gt; Prohibition for women to work under Taliban rule meant some street children were forced into the trade in order to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo19990717a2.html |title=Taliban conducts a war against women |author=Cesar Chelala |date=17 July 1999 |website= |publisher=The Japan Times |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report from the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States#Asia|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]], females from Iran, Tajikistan, China, and possibly Uganda and other places are forced into prostitution in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;

Women from Tajikistan are believed to be trafficked through Afghanistan to other countries for prostitution. Trafficked [[Women in Iran|Iranian women]] transit Afghanistan en route to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt; Afghan women as well as boys and girls among recently returned [[Afghan refugees|refugees]] from neighboring countries were reported to be forced into prostitution, a number of children were also reported being sold into it by their family.&lt;ref name="Qadiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UT"/&gt;

The number of prostitutes in Afghanistan is small. A 2007 [[University of Manitoba]] report suggests that there may be about 900 female prostitutes in Kabul,&lt;ref name="UT"/&gt; which is a city with a population of over 3 million. [[UNAIDS]] estimated there were 12,500 prostitutes in the country in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two to three prostitution arrests were made between 2007 and 2008 each week in Afghanistan, according to the [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Afghan Interior Ministry]]'s department of sexual crimes.&lt;ref name="UT"/&gt;

According to Afghan traditions, the shame of prostitution is so intense that sometimes those involved in such activities are assassinated by the many religious extremists found throughout the country&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; or in some cases by family members.{{quote|"Prostitution is in every country that has poverty, and it exists in Afghanistan. But society has black glasses and ignores these problems. Tradition is honor, and if we talk about these taboos, then we break tradition."&lt;ref name="UT"/&gt;|Orzala Ashraf, women's rights activist}}{{quote|"In our culture, it is very, very bad."&lt;ref name="Qadiry"/&gt;|Soraya Sobhrang|Afghan Independent Human Rights Commissioner for women's affairs}}

===Brothels===
[[Brothel]]s, sometimes run by foreigners, sometimes with links to larger criminal networks, manage to exist in several cities of the country by paying [[bribes]] to [[Afghan National Police|police officers]] who come to raid them.&lt;ref name="Qadiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; There are reports of a couple of brothels in northern Afghanistan, in and around the [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] area of [[Balkh Province]].&lt;ref name="Qadiry"/&gt;

The capital Kabul saw an extraordinary number of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] brothels ("Chinese restaurants") opened in the four years following the fall of the Taliban regime.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chinese-prostitutes-arrested-in-kabul-restaurant-raids-466118.html |title= Chinese prostitutes arrested in Kabul 'restaurant' raids |accessdate=2010-05-25 |author=Justin Huggler |publisher= The Independent |date= February 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four years later a series of police raids reduced the brothels to 3 which caters, according to Reuters, to a mainly high-income international clientele as Afghan aren't generally accepted in or, according to USA Today, to mostly Afghan men.&lt;ref name="UT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters_CSWFTWTK"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idINISL12604420080519?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title= Chinese sex workers find their way to Kabul|accessdate=2010-05-25|author=Tan Ee Lyn and Jonathon Burch |website=Reuters |publisher= |date=May 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary marriages===
''[[Nikah mut'ah]]'' is a fixed-term [[marriage]] practiced mainly in [[Shia Islam]], but is rejected by the majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s (see [[misyar marriage]], [[nikah urfi]], [[nikah halala]]).&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; There are also some recent reports about ''Mut'ah'' (''Fegha'' in [[Persian language]]) beginning to be practiced in Mazar-i-Sharif. {{quote|"Nobody would give me their daughters to marry because I didn't have family or money.

==Bacha bazi==
{{Further|Bacha Bazi}} 
Like in many other Islamic countries, it is a major [[taboo]] in [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghan culture]] for women to dance in front of men. Males and females are segregated during weddings and other parties. As a form of [[adult entertainment]], young males dress as females and dance in front of men to make money. "''Bacha bereesh''" (meaning "boys without beards" in [[Persian language]]) occasionally dance to entertain men at certain parties, especially in the north parts of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Ahad&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/12/dancing-boys-afghanistan |title= The dancing boys of Afghanistan |accessdate= 2010-08-03 |author=Ghaith Abdul-Ahad |publisher= The Guardian |date= September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful patrons sometimes [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|sexually exploit]] the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rferl.org/a/afghan-dancing-boys/27510265.html |title= Afghan 'Dancing Boys' Tell Of Rape, Abuse |accessdate=2016-11-14 |publisher= www.rferl.org |date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bereesh&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSISL1848920071119?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title= Afghan boy dancers sexually abused by former warlords |accessdate= 2010-08-03 |publisher= Reuters |date=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "Curse of 39" ==
{{Main|Curse of 39}}

The 'Curse of 39' refers to the belief in some parts of Afghanistan that the number 39 is cursed or a badge of shame as it is purportedly linked with prostitution.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303654804576347201745546630|title=A Symbol of Paid Companionship, No. 39 Is Afghans' Loneliest Number|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the number's undesirability is unclear, but it has widely been claimed to have been associated with a [[pimp]], allegedly living in the western city of [[Herat]], who was nicknamed "39" after the registration plate of his expensive car and the number of his apartment.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The number is said to translate into ''morda-gow'', literally meaning "dead cow" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. Others have blamed corrupt police officials for spreading the rumour in order to  charge between $200–$500 to change a "39" plate.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/aug/afghanistan/| publisher=NPR|title=Re-Creating Afghanistan: Returning to Istalif|date=2002-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vehicle registration plate]]s incorporating the number are seen as so undesirable that vehicles and apartments bearing the numerals are said to be virtually unsellable in the capital, [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/uk-afghanistan-number-idUSLNE75E01T20110615|title=Cursed number "39" haunts Afghan car owners|last=Shalizi|first=Hamid|agency=Reuters|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drivers of such vehicles have reported receiving abuse and derision from pedestrians and other drivers, and some have had their registration plates altered to disguise the numbers. One such driver, Zalmay Ahmadi, told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "When I drive around all the other cars flash their lights, beep their horns and people point at me. All my classmates now call me Colonel 39."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/15/afghanistan-curse-of-number-39|title=The curse of number 39 and the steps Afghans take to avoid it|last=Boone|first=Jon|work=The Guardian|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Some Afghan families knowingly sell their children into sex trafficking, including for bacha bazi, including some government officials and security forces. There are reports that some law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges accept bribes from or use their relationships with perpetrators of bacha bazi to allow them to escape punishment. Afghan returnees from Pakistan and Iran and internally displaced Afghans are vulnerable to exploitation in sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghanistan 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282596.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=25 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men, women, and children in Afghanistan often pay intermediaries to assist them in finding employment, primarily in Iran, Pakistan, India, Europe, or North America; some of these intermediaries force Afghans into prostitution. Afghan women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in Pakistan, Iran, and India. There were reports of women and girls from the Philippines, Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Sri Lanka, and China subjected to sex trafficking in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Afghanistan as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

{{Romani people}}
The [[Roma people]] have a number of distinct populations, the largest being the [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] and the [[Calé|Iberian Calé or Caló]], who reached [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]] about the early 12th century, from a migration out of northwestern India beginning about 600 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Isabel"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212012602 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.039 | volume=22 | issue=24 | title=Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data | year=2012 | journal=Current Biology | pages=2342–2349 | last1 = Mendizabal | first1 = Isabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"&gt;"Genomic Study Traces Roma to Northern India"], ''New York Times'', 11 December 2012. Findings recently reported also in ''Current Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in present-day [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]], [[Moldova]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,]] Hungary and [[Slovakia]], by order of volume, and Spain. From the Balkans, they migrated throughout Europe and, in the nineteenth and later centuries, to the Americas. The Romani population in the United States is estimated at more than one million.&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;Quote: "Today, estimates put the number of Roma in the U.S. at about one million."&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no official or reliable count of the Romani populations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-01-roma-europe_x.htm "European effort spotlights plight of the Roma"], ''USA Today'', 1 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Many Romani refuse to register their ethnic identity in official censuses for fear of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://other-news.info/index.php?p=172#more-172|title=It Now Suits the EU to Help the Roma|date=2004-09-29|first=Marian|last=Chiriac|publisher=Other-News.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are descendants of intermarriage with local populations and no longer identify only as Romani, or not at all.

As of the early 2000s, an estimated 4 to 9 million Romani people lived in [[Europe]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;3.8 million according to Pan and Pfeil, ''National Minorities in Europe'' (2004), {{ISBN|978-3-7003-1443-1}}, p. 27f.; 9.1 million in the high estimate of Liégois, Jean-Pierre (2007). ''Roms en Europe,'' Éditions du Conseil de l'Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; although some Romani organizations estimate numbers as high as 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006045453/http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/romatravellers/Documentation/strategies/statistiques_en.asp |date=October 6, 2009 |title="Roma Travellers Statistics" }}, Council of Europe, compilation of population estimates. Archived from [http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/romatravellers/Documentation/strategies/statistiques_en.asp the original], 6 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Significant Romani populations are found in the [[Balkan peninsula]], in some [[Central Europe]]an states, in Spain, France, Russia, and [[Ukraine]]. The total number of Romani living outside Europe are primarily in the [[Middle East and North Africa]] and in the Americas, and are estimated{{by whom|date=September 2013}} in total at more than two million.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Some countries do not collect data by ethnicity.

The Romani people identify as distinct ethnicities based in part on territorial, cultural and [[dialect]]al differences, and self-designation. The main branches are:&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Ian, 2001, ''Ame sam e rromane džene'' / We are the Romani People, The Open Society Institute, New York, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matras, Yaron, ''Romani: A linguistic introduction,'' Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Names of the Romani People"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Names of the Romani People | url = http://desicritics.org/2007/12/24/012125.php | website = Desicritics.org | accessdate = 2009-01-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080507070621/http://desicritics.org/2007/12/24/012125.php | archivedate = 2008-05-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zigane.pp.ru/history14.htm N.

# [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]], concentrated in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and Italy, they emigrated (mostly from the 19th century onwards) to the rest of Europe, as well as the [[Americas]];
# [[Calé|Iberian Kale]], mostly in Spain (see [[Romani people in Spain]]), but also in [[Portugal]] (see [[Romani people in Portugal]]), Southern France and [[Latin America]];
# [[Finnish Kale]], in [[Finland]], emigrated also in Sweden;
# [[Kale (Welsh Romanies)|Welsh Kale]], in [[Wales]] and the British Isles;

The Romani have additional internal distinctions, with groups identified as Bashaldé; Churari; [[Luri]]; Ungaritza; [[Lovari (Roma)|Lovari]] ([[Lovara]]) from Hungary; [[Machvaya]] (Machavaya, [[Machwaya]], or [[Macwaia]]) from [[Serbia]]; [[Romungro]] from Hungary and neighbouring [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] countries; Erlides (also ''Yerlii'' or ''Arli''); [[Xoraxai]] ([[Horahane]]) from [[Greece]]/[[Turkey]]; [[Boyash]] (Lingurari, [[Ludar]], Ludari, Rudari, or Zlătari) from [[Romania]]n/[[Moldova]]n [[miner]]s; [[Ursari]] from Romanian/Moldovan [[Animal training#Wild animals|bear-trainer]]s; Argintari from [[silversmith]]s; Aurari from [[goldsmith]]s; Florari from [[florist]]s; and [[Lăutari]] from [[singer]]s.

==Population by country==
This is a table of Romani people by country.
The list does include the [[Dom people]], who are often subsumed under "gypsies".

The official number of Romani people is disputed in many countries; some do not collect data by ethnicity; in others, Romani individuals may refuse to register their ethnic identity for fear of discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://other-news.info/index.php?p=172#more-172|title=It Now Suits the EU to Help the Roma|website=Other-news.info|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have assimilated and do not identify exclusively as Romani. In some cases, governments consult Romani organizations for data.

According to Marushiakova and Popov, "The Roma in Bulgaria", Sofia, 1993, the people who declared Romani identity in 1956 were about 194,000; in 1959—214,167; in 1976—373,200; because of the obvious and significant difference between the number of Bulgarian citizens with Romani self-identification and this of the large total population with physical appearance and cultural particularity similar to Romanies in 1980 the authorities took special census of all people, defined as Roma through the opinions of the neighboring population, observations of their way of life, cultural specificity, etc.—523,519; in the 1989 the authorities counted 576,927 people as Roma, but noted that more than a half of them preferred and declared Turkish identity (pages 92–93). According to the rough personal assumption of Marushiakova and Popov the total number of all people with Romani ethic identity plus all people of Romani origin with different ethnic self-identification around 1993 was about 800,000 (pages 94–95). Similar supposition Marushiakova and Popov made in 1995: estimate 750,000&amp;nbsp;±50,000. Some international sources mention the estimates of some unnamed experts, who suggest 700,000–800,000 or higher than figures in the official census, [[UNDP]]'s Regional Bureau for Europe). These mass non-Romani ethnic partialities are confirmed in the light of the last census in 2001—more than 300,000 Bulgarian citizens of Romani origin traditionally declare their ethnic identity as [[Turkish people|Turkish]] or [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]]. Other statistics: 450,000 estimated in 1990 ([http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/25.htm U.S. Library of Congress study]); at least 553,466 cited in a confidential census by the Ministry of the Interior in 1992 (cf Marushiakova and Popov 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;|| [[Yerli]], [[Gurbeti]], [[Kalderash]], [[Boyash]], [[Ursari]]

[[Image:Sclavi Tiganesti.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1852 [[Wallachia]]n poster advertising an auction of Romani slaves]]
A significant proportion of the world's Romanies live in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], often in [[squatter]] communities{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} with very high [[unemployment]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}, while only some are fully integrated in the society.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, in some cases—notably the Kalderash clan in Romania, who work as traditional [[coppersmith]]s—they have prospered. Some Romani families choose to immigrate to Western Europe now that many of the former Communist countries like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria have entered the European Union and free travel is permitted. During the 1970s and 1980s many Romanies from former Yugoslavia migrated to Western European countries, especially to Austria, Germany and Sweden.

===Bulgaria===
{{Main article|Roma in Bulgaria}}
Romani people constitute the third largest [[ethnic group]] (after [[Bulgarians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]) in [[Bulgaria]], they are referred to as "цигани" (''cigani'') or "роми" (''romi''). According to the 2001 census, there were 370,908 Roma in Bulgaria, equivalent to 4.7% of the country's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Alois Schönn - Lagernde Zigeuner (1856).jpg|thumb|Romani nomads, c. 1857]]

===Romania===
{{Main article|Roma in Romania}}
There is a sizable minority of Romani people in [[Romania]], known as ''Ţigani'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and, recently, as ''Rromi'', of 621,573 people or 3.3% of the total population ([[Demographic history of Romania#20 October 2011 census|2011 census]]). There exist a variety of governmental and non-governmental programs for integration and social advancement, including the [[National Agency for the Roma]] and [[Romania]]'s participation in the [[Decade of Roma Inclusion]]. [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], Hungary, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and Spain participate in these programs. As an officially recognized ethnic minority, the Romani people also have guaranteed representation in Parliament.

===Russia===
{{Main article|Ruska Roma}}
[[Image:Roma people 1837.jpg|thumb|A Romani family travelling (1837 print)]]
In [[Russian language|Russian]] the Romani people are referred to as ''tzigane''. The largest ethnic group of Romani people in Russia are the [[Ruska Roma]]. They are also the largest group in [[Belarus]]. They are adherents of the [[Russian Orthodox]] faith.

They came to Russia in the 18th century from [[Poland]], and their language includes [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] words.

The Ruska Roma were nomadic horse traders and singers. They traveled during the summer and stayed in cottages of Russian peasants during the winter. They paid for their lodging with money, or with the work of their horses.

In 1812, when [[Napoleon I]] invaded Russia, the Romani diasporas of [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] gave large sums of money and good horses for the Russian [[army]]. Many young Romani men took part in the war as [[uhlan]]s.

At the end of the 19th century, Rusko Rom [[Nikolai Shishkin]] created a Romani [[theatre]] troupe. One of its plays was in the [[Romani language]].

During [[World War II]] some Ruska Roma entered the army, by call-up and as volunteers. They took part in the war as soldiers, officers, infantrymen, tankmen, artillerymen, aviators, drivers, paramedical workers, and doctors. Some teenagers, old men and adult men were also partisans. Romani actors, singers, musicians, dancers (mostly women) performed for soldiers in the front line and in hospitals. A huge number of Roma, including many of the Ruska Roma, died or were murdered in territories occupied by the enemy, in battles, and in the blockade of Leningrad.

After World War II, music of the Ruska Roma became very popular. [[Romen Theatre]], Romani singers and ensembles prospered. All Romanies living in the USSR began to perceive Ruska Roma culture as the basic Romani culture.

==Western Europe==

===Spain===
{{Main article|Romani people in Spain}}
[[Image:Spanish Gypsy NGM-v31-p257.jpg|thumb|160px|Spanish Romani woman]]
Romanies in Spain are generally known as ''Gitanos'' and tend to speak [[Caló (Spanish Romani)|Caló]] which is basically [[Andalusian Spanish]] with a large number of Romani [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xmission.com/~dderhak/monte/gypsies.htm|title=MY FRIENDS, THE GYPSIES|website=Xmission.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the Spanish Gitano population range between 600,000 and 1,500,000 with the Spanish government estimating between 650,000 and 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/reports/2002/eu/international/sections/spain/2002_m_spain.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626103751/http://www.eumap.org/reports/2002/eu/international/sections/spain/2002_m_spain.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-nomadic [[Quinqui]] consider themselves apart from the Gitanos.

===Portugal===
{{Main article|Romani people in Portugal}}
The Romanies in [[Portugal]] are known as ''Ciganos'', and their presence goes back to the second half of the 15th century. Early on, due to their socio-cultural difference and nomadic style of live, the Ciganos were the object of fierce discrimination and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Serrão, ''Ciganos'', in Dicionário de História de Portugal, Lisboa, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of ''Ciganos'' in Portugal is difficult to estimate, since there are no official statistics about race or ethnic categories. According to data from [[Council of Europe]]'s [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gddc.pt/direitos-humanos/portugal-dh/relatorios-ce/CBCRelatorioPortugal_2002.pdf|format=PDF|date=2002|title=Relatório da Comissão Europeia contra o Racismo e a Intolerância - Segundo Relatório sobre Portugal|website=Gddc.pt|page=23|language=pt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218105506/http://www.gddc.pt/direitos-humanos/portugal-dh/relatorios-ce/CBCRelatorioPortugal_2002.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are about 40,000 to 50,000 spread all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://24.sapo.pt/404|title=SAPO 24|first=|last=SAPO|website=SAPO 24|accessdate=30 August 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Portuguese branch of [[Amnesty International]], there are about 30,000 to 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.pt/Sociedade/amnistia-internacional-alerta-para-marginalizacao-dos-ciganos-em-portugal_1431158 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805061554/http://publico.pt/Sociedade/amnistia-internacional-alerta-para-marginalizacao-dos-ciganos-em-portugal_1431158 |archivedate=2010-08-05 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Diseuse de bonne aventure aux Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.jpg|thumb|Fortune teller in the Romani shrine of  [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]].]]
{{Main article|Romani people in France}}
Romanies are generally known in spoken French as ''Manouches'' or ''Tsiganes''. ''Romanichels'' or ''Gitans'' are considered [[pejorative]] and ''Bohémiens'' is outdated. The French [[National Gendarmerie]] tends to refer to "MENS" ("Minorités Ethniques Non-Sédentarisées"),{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} a neutral [[civil service|administrative]] term meaning Traveling [[Minority Group|Ethnic Minorities]]. Traditionally referred to as ''gens du voyage'' ("traveling people"), a term still occasionally used by the media, they are today generally referred to as Rroms. By law, French [[municipalities]] over 5,000 inhabitants have the obligation to allocate a piece of land to Romani travellers when they arrive.&lt;ref name="Loi Besson, Journal officiel de la République française"&gt;{{cite web |title=Loi n° 2000-614 du 5 juillet 2000 relative à l'accueil et à l'habitat des gens du voyage | url = http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000583573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 500,000 Roma live in France as part of established communities. Additionally, the  French Roma rights group [[FNASAT]] reports that there are at least 12,000 Roma, primarily from Romania and Bulgaria, living in illegal urban camps throughout the country. French authorities often close down these encampments. In 2009, the government returned more than 10,000 Roma illegal immigrants to Romania and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="BBC Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news | title = Q&amp;A: France Roma expulsions | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 August 2010 | accessdate = 22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Summer of 2012, with mounting criticism of their treatment of the Roma, French key ministers met for emergency talks on the handling of an estimated 15,000 Roma living in camps across France. They proposed to lift restrictions on migrants (including Roma) from Bulgaria and Romania who were working in France.&lt;ref name="CNN Focus"&gt;{{cite news | title = Roma in Europe: Persecuted and misunderstood | url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/24/europe/gallery/roma-france/index.html?hpt=hp_c2 | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 24 August 2012 | accessdate = 24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
{{Main article|Romani people in Italy}}
Romani in Italy are generally known as ''[[wikt:zingaro|zingaro]]'' (with the plural ''zingari''), a word also used to describe a scruffy or slovenly person or a tinker. The word is likely of Greek origin meaning "untouchables", compare the modern Greek designations Τσιγγάνοι (Tsingánoi), Αθίγγανοι (Athínganoi).  People often use the term "Rom", although the people prefer ''Romani'' (in Italian ''Romanì''), which is little used. They are sometimes called "nomads," although many live in settled communities.

==Northern Europe==

===Finland===
{{Main article|Finnish Kale}}

The Kale (or ''Kaale'') Romani of Finland are known in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as ''mustalaiset'' ('blacks', cf. {{lang-rom|kalò}}, 'black') or ''romanit''.  Approximately 10,000 Romani live in Finland, mostly in the [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In Finland, many Romani people wear their traditional dress in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elamajavalo.fi/index.php?id=823|title=Elämä ja Valo|website=Elämä ja Valo|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway and Sweden===
{{Main article|Norwegian and Swedish Travellers}}
Romani in Sweden were formerly known as ''zigenare'' for Roma and ''tattare'' for [[Norwegian and Swedish Travellers|Scandinavian travellers]]. More recently the term ''romer'' has been adopted as a collective designation referring to both groups, with ''resande'' (travellers) also referring to the latter only. Approximately 120,000 Romani live in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/romers-ratt-till-skydd-foljs-inte_6073683.svd|title=Romers rätt till skydd följs inte|first=Jessica|last=Balksjö|website=Svd.se|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them descended from [[Finnish Kale]] who immigrated in the 1960s. The latter, particularly the women, often wear traditional dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mirelle |last=Gyllenbäck |title=Därför klär jag mig inte som min mamma |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/article553421.ab |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=25 July 2007 |language=Swedish |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romani in Sweden have periodically suffered discrimination at the hands of the state. For example, the state has taken children into foster care, or sterilised Romani women without their consent. Prejudice against Romanies is widespread, with most stereotypes portraying the Romani as welfare cheats, shoplifters, and con artists. For example, in 1992, [[Bert Karlsson]], a leader of [[Ny Demokrati]], said, "Gypsies are responsible for 90% of crime against senior citizens" in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Bjurwald |title=Vår skuld till romerna |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=577&amp;a=799727 |work=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=1 July 2008 |language=Swedish |accessdate=6 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216023656/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=577 |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier tried to ban Romani from his ''[[Skara Sommarland]]'' theme park, as he thought they were thieves. Some shopkeepers, employers and landlords continue to discriminate against Romani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report faults Sweden for discrimination |url=http://www.thelocal.se/15540/20081107/ |work=[[The Local]] |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is improving. Several Romani organisations promote education about Romani rights and culture in Sweden. Since 2000, [[Romani language|Romani ''chib'']] is an officially recognised minority language in Sweden. The Swedish government has established a special standing Delegation for Romani Issues. A Romani [[folk high school]] has been founded in [[Gothenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victoria invigde romsk folkhögskola |url=http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=113&amp;a=370645 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605162831/http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=113&amp;a=370645 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 June 2009 |work=[[Göteborgs-Posten]] |date=21 September 2007 |language=Swedish |accessdate=6 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Romanichal}}
Romani in England are generally known as ''Romanichals'' or Romani Gypsies, while their [[Wales|Welsh]] equivalent are known as ''[[Kale (Welsh Romanies)|Kale]]''. They have been recorded in the UK since at least the early 16th century. Records of Romani people in Scotland date to the early 16th century. Some emigrated to the British colonies and to the United States during the centuries. They may number up to 120,000. There is also a sizable population of East European Roma, who immigrated into the UK in the late 1990s/early 2000s, and also after EU expansion in 2004.

The first recorded reference to "the Egyptians" appeared to be in 1492, during the reign of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], when an entry in the Book of the Lord High Treasurer records a payment "to Peter Ker of four shillings, to go to the king at Hunthall, to get letters subscribed to the 'King of Rowmais'". Two days after, a payment of twenty pounds was made at the king's command to the messenger of the 'King of Rowmais'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/scotland.html|title=Gypsies in Scotland|accessdate=2007-08-26|year=2004|publisher=The Scottish Gypsies of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Scottish Travellers|Scottish Traveller]] Education Programme, an estimated 20,000 Scottish Gypsies/Travellers live in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtravellered.net/travellers.html|title=Gypsies and Travellers in Scotland|accessdate=2007-08-26|publisher=Scottish Traveller Education Programme|date=2007-02-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811063341/http://www.scottishtravellered.net/travellers.html|archivedate=2004-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many of this number are ethnic Romani, rather than other Travellers. The society and government recognize that there are several ethnic groups, each with different histories and cultures.

The term "gypsy" in the United Kingdom has come to mean anyone who travels with [[no fixed abode]] (regardless of ethnic group). This use has often been synonymous with "[[Wiktionary:pikey|pikey]]" {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, now considered a derogatory term. In some parts of the UK, the Romani are commonly called "tinkers" because of their traditional trade as tinsmiths.

==West Asia==
One route taken by the medieval proto-Romani cut across Persia and Asia Minor to Europe. Numerous Romani continue to live in Asia Minor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Other Romani populations in the Middle East are the result of modern migrations from Europe. Also found in the Middle East are various groups of the [[Dom people]], often identified as "gypsies." They are derived from a migration out of northwestern India beginning about 600 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Isabel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;

===Cyprus===
====History====
Historians estimate that the first immigrants came between 1322 and 1400, when Cyprus was under the rule of the [[Lusignan]] ([[Crusades|Crusader]]) kings. These Roma were part of a general movement from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Europe]]. Those who landed on Cyprus probably came across from the Crusader colonies on the eastern Mediterranean coast (present-day [[Lebanon]] and Israel).&lt;ref name="domresearchcenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domresearchcenter.com/reprints/body4.html|title=Dom Research Center - Reprint Series - Gypsies in Cyprus|website=Domresearchcenter.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence suggesting one cause for the Roma to leave mainland [[Asia]], but historical events caused widespread upheaval and may have prompted a move to the island. In 1347 the [[Black Death]] had reached [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; in 1390 the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Greek kingdom]] in Asia; and ten years later, the [[Battle of Aleppo (1400)|Battle of Aleppo]] marked the advance of the [[Mongols]] under [[Tamerlane]].

The first surviving written record of Roma in Cyprus is from 1468. In the ''Chronicle of Cyprus'' compiled by Florio Bustron, the '''Cingani''' are said to have paid tax to the royal treasury, at that time under [[James II of Cyprus|King James II]]. Later, in 1549, the French traveler Andre Theret found "''les [[Egyptians|Egyptiens]] ou [[Bohemians|Bohemiens]]''" in Cyprus and other [[Mediterranean]] islands. He noted their simple way of life, supported by the production of nails by the men and belts by the women, which they sold to the local population.

During the [[Middle Ages]], Cyprus was on a regular shipping route from [[Bari]], Italy to the [[Holy Land]]. A second immigration likely took place some time after the Turks dominated the island in 1571. Some [[Kalderash]] came in the 19th century.

Currently, Roma in Cyprus refer to themselves as '''Kurbet''', and their language as ''[[Kurbetcha]]'', although most no longer speak it. [[Christian]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking Roma are known as '''Mantides'''.&lt;ref&gt;Trimikliniotis, Nicos, "[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=nicos_trimikliniotis The Cypriot Roma and the Failure of Education]", ''The Minorities of Cyprus'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe there are 1000-1500 (0,16%) Romanis living in Cyprus .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/romatravellers/Default_en.asp|title=Roma and Travellers|website=Coe.int|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Names of Roma in Cyprus====
*''Tsignos'': the official term used in [[Greek language|Greek]] documents and written material. It comes from the term ''Cingani'' (used in the 1468 text), which in turn comes from the archaic word ''Adsincan,'' used in mediaeval Byzantium.
*''Yleftos'': the [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot dialect]] form of mainland Greek ''Giftos''. This is common in speech and comes from earlier ''Aigiptos'', a reference to the earlier belief that the Romanies came from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="domresearchcenter" /&gt;
*''Kurbet'': the local term used by turcophone Cypriots, a Roma group of [[Dom people|Doms]] which is also present in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeastgypsies.com/|title=Middle East Gypsies|website=Middleeastgypsies.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(''For additional names of Roma in Greek-speaking Cyprus, see [[Roma in Greece]]'')

===Israel===
Some Eastern European [[Romani people|Romani]] are known to have arrived in Israel in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Romani community in Israel has grown since the 1990s, as some Roma immigrated from states of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]].

A community anciently related to the Romani are the [[Dom people]]. Some live in Israel, the [[Palestinian territories]] and in neighboring countries.

===Lebanon===
It is estimated that there are 5,000 Romanis or Domaris in [[Lebanon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legacy.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=11597&amp;rog3=LE|title=Romani, Domari in Lebanon|website=Joshuaproject.net|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The language of Romanis is called Domari in Lebanon and neighboring countries&lt;ref&gt;Matras, Yaron. ''Romani in Contact: The History, Structure and Sociology of a Language'' John Benjamins Publishing Company, June 1, 1995, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;. There is evidence that child labor was prevalent in Romani communities in Lebanon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253147.pdf|title=LEBANON 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|website=State.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Turkey===
{{Main article|Romani people in Turkey}}
Romani people in Turkey are generally known as ''Çingene'', ''Çingen'', or ''Çingan'', as well as ''Çingit'' (West Black Sea region), '''Cono''' (South Turkey), ''Kıptî'' (meaning [[Copts|Coptic]]), Şopar ([[Kırklareli]]), ''Roman'' ([[İzmir]]) &lt;ref&gt;Özhan Öztürk. [http://www.karalahana.com/english/archive/folklore.html Karadeniz Ansiklopedik Sözlük] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527165254/http://www.karalahana.com/english/archive/folklore.html |date=May 27, 2012 }}. İstanbul. 2005. {{ISBN|975-6121-00-9}}. p.280-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Gipleri'' (derived from the term "Egyptian"). Since the late twentieth century, some have started to recognize and cherish their Romani background as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cingene.org|title=TÜRKİYE'Lİ ÇİNGENELER|language=Turkish|accessdate=2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, [[blacksmithing]] and other handicrafts are their main occupations.

==Overseas==
Most Romani populations overseas were founded in the 19th century by emigration from Europe.

===North America===

====United States====
{{Main article|Roma in the United States}}
At the beginning of the 19th century, the first major Romani group, the [[Romanichal]] from Great Britain, arrived in [[North America]], although some had also immigrated during the colonial era. They settled primarily in the United States, which was then more established than most English-speaking communities in Upper Canada. Later immigrants also settled in Canada.

The ancestors of the majority of the contemporary local Romani population in the United States, who are [[Eastern European]] Roma, started to immigrate during the second half of the century, drawn by opportunities for industrial jobs. Among these groups were the [[Romani language|Romani]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Kalderash]], [[Machvaya]], [[Lovari (Roma)|Lovari]] and [[Churari]], as well as groups who had adopted the [[Romanian language]], such as the [[Boyash|Boyash (Ludari)]]. Most arrived either directly from Romania after their liberation from [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]] between 1840 and 1850, or after a short-period in neighboring states, such as [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], or [[Serbia]]. The [[Bashalde]] arrived from what is now [[Slovakia]] (then Austria-Hungary) about the same time. Many settled in the major industrial cities of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/gyp/gypstart.html|title="Gypsies" in the United States|accessdate=2007-08-26|work=Migrations in History|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration from Eastern Europe decreased drastically in the post-World War II era, during the years of [[Eastern Bloc|Communist rule]]. It resumed in the 1990s after the fall of Communism. Romani organizations estimate that there are about one million Romani in the United States.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2025316,00.html Kayla Webley, "Hounded in Europe, Roma in the U.S. Keep a Low Profile"], ''TIME Magazine'', 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
According to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]], there were 2,590 [[Canadians]] of full or partial Romani descent.&lt;ref name="statcan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a-eng.htm |title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census) |publisher=statcan.gc.ca |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115234252/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{Main article|Romani people in Mexico}}
According to data collected by the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía]], the Romani in Mexico numbered 15,850,&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite web|title=Gitanos, o como ser invisibles en México|url=http://www.ipsnoticias.net/2010/10/gitanos-o-como-ser-invisibles-en-mexico/|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|accessdate=15 June 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the total number is likely larger.&lt;ref name=IPS /&gt;

===South America===

====Argentina====
The Romani people in Argentina number more than 300,000. They traditionally support themselves by trading used cars, and selling their jewelry, while traveling all over the country.

====Brazil====
{{Main article|Romani people in Brazil}}
Romani groups settled the Brazilian states of [[Espirito Santo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]] primarily in the late 19th century. The Machvaya came from present-day Serbia (then Austria-Hungary), the Kalderash from Romania, the [[Lovari (Roma)|Lovari]] from Italy, and the [[Horahane]] from Greece and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/~Patrin/brazil.htm|title=The Gypsies of Brazil|author=Atico Vilas-Boas da Mota|website=Webcitation.org|accessdate=30 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/~Patrin/brazil.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:36:45|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Romani in Brazil were believed to be descended from ancestors who were exiled in the colony by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] but more has been learned about the peoples. The current population of ethnic Romani is estimated at 600,000. Most are descended from ethnic Kalderash, Macwaia, Rudari, Horahane, and Lovara.

====Chile====
A sizeable population of Romani people live in [[Chile]]. As they continue their traditions and language, they are a distinct minority who are widely recognized. Many continue semi-nomadic lifestyles, traveling from city to city and living in small tented communities. A Chilean [[telenovela]] called ''Romane'' was based on the Romani. It portrayed their lifestyles, ideas and occasionally featured the Chilean-born actors speaking in the Romani language, with subtitles in Spanish.

====Colombia====
The first Romani in Colombia are thought to have come from Spain and were formerly known as ''Egipcios'' settling primarily in the Departments of [[Santander Department|Santander]], [[Norte de Santander Department|Norte de Santander]], [[Atlántico Department|Atlántico]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Sucre Department|Sucre]], [[Bogotá D.C.]] and in smaller numbers in the Departments of [[Bolívar Department|Bolívar]], [[Nariño Department|Nariño]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU7wGlZHpM4|title=Pueblo Rrom o Gitano en Colombia|first=|last=Ministerio de Cultura|date=21 February 2014|accessdate=30 August 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Colombian Government recognized the Romani people as a national ethnic minority, and today, around 8,000 Roma are present in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2017/07/11/colombia-recognizes-roma-people-as-ethnic-minority-group|title=Colombia recognizes Roma people as ethnic minority group|date=12 July 2017|website=CGTN America|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Romani language|language]] has been officially recognized as a minority language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ley de lenguas nativas|publisher=Ministry of Culture of Colombia|location=Bogotá|year=2010|url=http://www.lenguasdecolombia.gov.co/sites/lenguasdecolombia.gov.co/files/Ley_1381_2010_proteccion_lenguas_nativas_0.pdf|accessdate=July 21, 2014|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4765">The [http://www.ruralsociology.org/ '''Rural Sociological Society'''] (RSS), is a professional social science association that promotes the generation, application, and dissemination of sociological knowledge. The Society seeks to enhance the quality of rural life, communities, and the environment.  It was officially established on December 29, 1937&lt;ref&gt;Holik, John S. and Edward W. Hassinger. 1986a. “The Rural Sociological Society: Its Beginnings.” The Rural Sociologist. 6(5):331-340.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote the development of [[rural sociology]] through teaching, research and extension.  Membership in the RSS includes persons professionally employed in the field of rural sociology, or those interested in the objectives of the Society. RSS holds annual meetings in different locations every year.

== What We Do ==
The core activities of the Rural Sociological Society are our peer-reviewed journal, Rural Sociology, our annual conference, and support for communities of scholars concerned with specific rural topics. Through these activities, the RSS has provided leadership in scholarship, policies, and advocacy. Since its founding in 1937, the RSS has traced changes in rural life and livelihoods, demography, community structures and economies, technologies, environmental conditions, and agriculture and food systems.

== History ==
Before the RSS, those interested in the discipline met as the Rural Sociology Section of the American Sociological Society, which later became the [[American Sociological Association]]. The meeting at which the formation of the RSS was approved had not started with that in mind. Rather, a committee of section members appointed previously presented a report that supported continued association with the parent organization, although one of the five members submitted a minority report calling for separation. After substantial discussion, a vote to establish a separate organization carried. That same day, a provisional constitution and by-laws were established by the founding RSS members; they still guide activities, although both have been amended through the years as membership and issues have changed.&lt;ref&gt;Holik, John S. and Edward W. Hassinger. 1986b. “The RSS: Coming to Formalization.”  The Rural Sociologist. 6(6):407-420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to form the Rural Sociological Society in 1937 was not totally unexpected. Discussion of sponsoring an organization of rural sociologists occurred in the 1920s and was widespread in the mid-1930s. Indeed, concerns with opportunities to bring topics related to rural issues before larger audiences led to the publication of the first volume of the quarterly journal, ''[[Rural Sociology (journal)|Rural Sociology]]'', in 1936. This had come about only because of the support of members of the Rural Sociology Section, both in terms of financing and editing; issues in the first two volumes had "Published by the Rural Sociology Section [of the] American Sociological Society" on the covers. That changed in 1938, when Rural Sociology became the official journal of the RSS; it has been published continuously since.

{{Serbs}}
The '''[[Serbs]] of Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Sârbii din România}}, {{lang-sr|Срби у Румунији/Srbi u Rumuniji}}) are a recognized [[Minority group|ethnic minority]] numbering 18,076 people (0.1%) according to the 2011 census. The community is concentrated in western Romania, in the Romanian part of the [[Banat]] region (divided with [[Serbia]]), where they constitute absolute majority in two [[Commune in Romania|communes]] and relative majority in one other.

==History==
===Historical background===
Slavic presence is attested in Romania since the Early Middle Ages. The [[Avar Khaganate]] was the dominant power of the [[Carpathian Basin]] between around 567 and 803.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=2-3}} Most historians agree that [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Bulgars]], together with the remnants of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], and possibly with [[Vlachs]] (or [[Romanians]]), inhabited the [[Banat]] region after the fall of the khaganate.{{sfn|Oța|2014|p=18}} Place names of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin recorded already in the Middle Ages show the early presence of a Slavic-speaking population.{{sfn|Györffy|1987b|pp=306, 470}}

===Early modern period===
From the late 14th- to the beginning of the 16th century a large number of Serbs lived in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]].{{sfn|Cerović|1997}} Following Ottoman expansion in the 15th century, Serb mass migrations ensued into [[Pannonia]].{{sfn|Cerović|1997}} Serbian Orthodox monasteries began to be built in the area from the 15th century, including Kusić and Senđurađ built by ''despot'' [[Jovan Branković]], and in the 16th century including Bezdin and Hodoš built by the [[Jakšić family]].{{sfn|Cerović|1997}} In the Ottoman period, some thirty Serbian Orthodox monasteries were built in the territory of Romania.{{sfn|Cerović|1997}}

[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] pressure traditionally forced members of several [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] communities to seek refuge in [[Wallachia]] - although under Ottoman rule as well, the latter was always subject to less requirements{{clarify|date=September 2016}} than regions to south of the [[Danube]].

The Serbian [[Uprising in Banat]] (1594) included territories that are part of modern Romania. There were reprisals, contemporary sources speaking of "the living envied the dead".{{sfn|Cerović|1997|loc=Oslobodilački pokreti u vreme Turaka}} After the crushing of the uprising in Banat, many Serbs migrated to Transylvania under the leadership of Bishop Teodor; the territory towards [[Ineu]] and [[Teiuș]] was settled, where Serbs had lived since earlier – the Serbs had their eparchies, opened schools, founded churches and printing houses.{{sfn|Cerović|1997|loc=Oslobodilački pokreti u vreme Turaka}}

Serbs-proper probably constituted the vast majority of [[mercenary]] troops known as ''[[seimeni]]'', given that their nucleus is attested to have been formed by "Serb ''seimeni''" (as it was during their revolt in 1655), and that the rule of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Matei Basarab]] had witnessed the arrival of a large group of Serb refugees.

The [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] in 1690 and 1737–39 led to additional settlement of Serbs.

===Modern===
These groups are, however, hard to distinguish one from another in early Wallachian references, as the term "Serbs" is regularly applied to all Southern Slavs, no matter where they might have originated. This only changed in the 19th century, through a transition made clear by an official statistic of 1830, which reads "census of how many Serbs are resident here in the town of [[Ploiești]], all of them [[Bulgarians]]" (Giurescu, p.&amp;nbsp;269).

The [[Bărăgan deportations]] (1951–56) saw minorities (including Serbs) from the Banat region bordering Yugoslavia deported to south-eastern Romania due to the [[Informbiro period|deteriorating Yugoslav–USSR relations]] and the perceived "elements who present a danger through their presence in the area" to the Romanian Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Deletant|title=Communist Terror in Romania: Gheorghiu-Dej and the Police State, 1948-1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRn56_qAwiYC&amp;pg=PA142|date=January 1999|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-386-8|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}
According to the 2011 census, there was 18,076 people of the Serb minority,&lt;ref name="insse3"/&gt; down from 22,561 people in 2002.

In [[Caraș-Severin County]], the Serbs constitute an absolute majority in the commune of [[Pojejena]] (52.09%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&amp;judet_id=1909&amp;localitate_id=1965|title=Structura Etno-demografică a României|website=Edrc.ro|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a plurality in the commune of [[Socol]] (49.54%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&amp;judet_id=1909&amp;localitate_id=1974|title=Structura Etno-demografică a României|website=Edrc.ro|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs also constitute absolute majority in the municipality of [[Svinița]] (87.27%) in the [[Mehedinți County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1407&amp;judet_id=1579&amp;localitate_id=1638|title=Structura Etno-demografică a României|website=Edrc.ro|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region where these three municipalities are located is known as ''[[Clisura Dunării]]'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] or ''Banatska Klisura'' (Банатска Клисура) in [[Serbian language|Serbian]].

[[Emotional intelligence]] (EI) involves using cognitive and emotional abilities to function in interpersonal relationships, social groups as well as manage one's emotional states.

== Emotional intelligence ==
Emotional intelligence (EI) involves using cognitive and emotional abilities to function in interpersonal relationships, social groups as well as manage one's emotional states. A person with high EI ability can perceive, comprehend and express emotion accurately, and also has the ability to access and generate feelings when needed to improve one's self and relationships with others. According to the ability model, there are four abilities that exist for emotional intelligence:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Is the Ability Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) Good for? An Evaluation Using Item Response Theory|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-06-05|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 4046984|pmid = 24901541|volume = 9|issue = 6|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098827|first = Marina|last = Fiori|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last2 = Antonietti|first3 = Moira|last3 = Mikolajczak|first4 = Olivier|last4 = Luminet|first5 = Michel|last5 = Hansenne|first6 = Jérôme|last6 = Rossier|pages=e98827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Perception''' – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifact. Also includes the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceiving and remembering emotional facial expressions — A basic facet of emotional intelligence|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615000227|journal = Intelligence|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 52–67|volume = 50|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2015.02.003|first = Andrea|last = Hildebrandt|first2 = Werner|last2 = Sommer|first3 = Annekathrin|last3 = Schacht|first4 = Oliver|last4 = Wilhelm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Facilitation''' – the ability to use emotions for various cognitive activities such as thinking and problem solving as well as interacting with others. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing moods in order to best fit the task at hand for example using emotions to motivate themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Understanding''' – the ability to process emotion language and understand why they someone or they themselves might feel a certain way.Understanding emotions also encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight changes between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Management''' – the ability to manage one's emotions as well as manage emotional relationship with others. An emotionally intelligent person can also use any type of emotions and apply them in pursuit of a goal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Social cognition''' – Psychological processes that allow individuals to interpret and adapt to a social group. [[Social cognition]] is an important part of emotional Intelligence and incorporates social skills such as processing facial expressions, body language and other social stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social cognition|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2008-06-12|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2375957|pmid = 18292063|pages = 2033–2039|volume = 363|issue = 1499|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0005|first = Chris D|last = Frith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empathy''' – Emotional intelligence includes key aspects of empathy especially that part of empathy having to do with recognizing others’ feelings which falls under the "Perception" facet in the ability model of emotional intelligence&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stolarski in various universities across Poland.&lt;ref name="Śmieja e103484"/&gt; They also found in another study that although genders were equally adept at detecting consistency with basic emotions, women were superior at detecting deception in both basic emotion and inconsistent emotions conditions or in other words complex and subtle emotions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Intelligence and Mismatching Expressive and Verbal Messages: A Contribution to Detection of Deception|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092570|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-03-21|pmc = 3962410|pmid = 24658500|pages = e92570|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0092570|first = Jerzy|last = Wojciechowski|first2 = Maciej|last2 = Stolarski|first3 = Gerald|last3 = Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deviation size differences were 0.32 and the researchers attributed this to women's greater emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Behavioral tests ===
A 2011 study published in the journal ''[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]]'' by researchers Matthew J. Hertenstein and Dacher Keltner found that within a behavioral experiment study of 212 participants, women shared more emotions, felt more prosocial emotions and communicated much more happiness levels in one on one dyadic interaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Results also found that 79% of female decoders accurately identified male emotions and 96% accurately identified female emotions (both ''p''s &lt; .01). For male decoders, 70% (''p'' = .052) correctly identified male encoders and 81% (''p'' &lt; .01) correctly identified female encoded emotions. Results conformed with findings from past literature.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Social cognition ===
A 2012 review published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that women are better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A review on sex differences in processing emotional signals|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212000024|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2012-06-01|pages = 1211–1221|volume = 50|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.022|first = M. E.|last = Kret|first2 = B.|last2 = De Gelder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men were only better at recognizing specific behaviour which includes anger, aggression and threatening cues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2012 study published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychology (journal)|Neuropsychology]]'' with a sample of 3500 individuals from ages 8–21, found that females outperformed males on face memory and all [[social cognition]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Age group and sex differences in performance on a computerized neurocognitive battery in children age 8-21|journal = Neuropsychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1931-1559|pmc = 3295891|pmid = 22251308|pages = 251–265|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0026712|first = Ruben C.|last = Gur|first2 = Jan|last2 = Richard|first3 = Monica E.|last3 = Calkins|first4 = Rosetta|last4 = Chiavacci|first5 = John A.|last5 = Hansen|first6 = Warren B.|last6 = Bilker|first7 = James|last7 = Loughead|first8 = John J.|last8 = Connolly|first9 = Haijun|last9 = Qiu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2014 study published in the journal ''[[Cerebral Cortex (journal)|Cerebral Cortex]]'' found that females had larger activity in the right temporal cortex, an essential core of the social brain connected to perception and understanding the social behaviour of others such as intentions, emotions, and expectations.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex Differences in the Neuromagnetic Cortical Response to Biological Motion|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264642783_Sex_Differences_in_the_Neuromagnetic_Cortical_Response_to_Biological_Motion|journal = Cerebral Cortex|pages = 3468–3474|volume = 25|issue = 10|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhu175|first = Marina A.|last = Pavlova|first2 = Alexander N.|last2 = Sokolov|first3 = Christel|last3 = Bidet-Ildei|pmid=25100856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a meta-analysis of 215 study sample by researcher A.E.

=== Empathy ===
A 2006 meta-analysis by researcher Rena A Kirkland in the ''[[North American Journal of Psychology]]'' found significant sex differences favoring females in "Reading of the mind" test. "Reading of the mind" test is an advanced ability measure of cognitive empathy in which Kirkland's analysis involved 259 studies across 10 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meta-analysis reveals adult female superiority in "Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test"|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260712981_Meta-analysis_reveals_adult_female_superiority_in_Reading_the_Mind_in_the_Eyes_Test|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2014 meta-analysis in ''Cognition and Emotion'', found overall female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition across 215 samples.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1164–1195"/&gt;

In a study published in 2006, neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses are significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD|date = Jan 2006|title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others|url = |journal = Nature|volume = 439|issue = 7075|pages = 466–9|bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S|last2 = Seymour|last3 = O'Doherty|last4 = Stephan|last5 = Dolan|last6 = Frith|doi = 10.1038/nature04271|pmid = 16421576|pmc = 2636868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2014 study by researchers  Chiyoko Kobayashi Frank, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] and Barbara L. Ganzel found that  on average women use networks in the brain associated with both cognitive [[empathy]] ( higher activity in [[Prefrontal cortex|mPFC]]) and emotional empathy (non-activity in the [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|vmPFC]]) more than men, in which they inferred can somewhat explain why women have better performance in [[theory of mind]] or cognitive empathy skills.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in the neural basis of false-belief and pragmatic language comprehension|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914007836|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2015-01-15|pages = 300–311|volume = 105|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.09.041|first = Chiyoko Kobayashi|last = Frank|first2 = Simon|last2 = Baron-Cohen|first3 = Barbara L.|last3 = Ganzel|pmid=25264229}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 analysis from the journal ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females were found to have higher empathy than males at all ages, and children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to possess high empathy throughout development in life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid=25236781|pmc=5110041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who viewed human suffering had higher [[Event-related potential|ERP]] waveforms than males, an indication of greater empathetic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found higher N400 in females in response to social situations which then positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Structural fMRI studies have also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which have been correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s indicated by the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mirror neurons are crucial for many if not most aspects of empathy. Females were also found to have stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are not likely explained by any environmental influences but instead might have some roots in human evolution and sex biased genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children, so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal human expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers and therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Shurugwi Rural Areas''', also known as [[Shurugwi District]], is a [[rural area]] around [[Shurugwi]], [[Zimbabwe]], mainly to the east, beginning {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} from the town centre. The area between the town and the rural areas was mainly occupied by white commercial farmers. It is thought that at one time, these farms were owned by three families who were all related. The total area of these farms is approximately 60&amp;nbsp;km x 40&amp;nbsp;km similar to an area that was occupied by more than 4,000 African families. Most of the black families are [[subsistence farmers]]. [[Maize]] is generally grown by the majority.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
There are a number of primary schools in Shurugwi Rural. Most of them, like [[Vungwi Primary School]], were built as far back as 1905. The list includes: Banga,Bokai, Chekenyu, Chikato, Dombwe, Hanke, Makonde (St Monica),Makotore, Matamba, Mavedzenge (St Peter), Mhangami (St Pius), Ndaora (St Paul), Nhema (St Francis), Pakame,Rusike Shamba, Tumba, Vungwi,Gundura, Banga, Wida,Sibolise, Charles Wreath and Zvishazha.

===Secondary schools===
There are a number of secondary schools in Shurugwi Rural, notably Sibolise Secondary School,Mupangai Secondary School, Chivakanenyanga Secondary School, Batanai Secondary School, Rusungunuko Secondary School, Dombotombo Secondary School, Chironde-Kwagweya Secondary School, and Bokai Secondary School, among others. The academic results from year to year are generally poor and below par which is generally blamed on the teachers.

===High schools===
There are only three [[boarding schools]] in [[Shurugwi]] which are all in [[rural areas]]:

[[Hanke Adventist High School]], a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] school which traditionally offered up to [[0-Levels]] and was called [[Hanke Adventist Secondary School]]. It was recently{{when|date=July 2016|reason="recently" is meaningless in an undated article}} upgraded to offer all levels through [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] and changed its name to reflect that. As it is a mission school, both the primary school and the high school are on the same campus which can cause confusion between them.

[[Tongogara High School]], only 10&amp;nbsp;km from Hanke, is a government-run high school. The boarding facilities are generally reserved for [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] students while the Form 1s to Form 4s are general day-schoolers (although a limited number of lower grade students have been admitted into boarding since 1990).  Tongogara was founded as a secondary school in the early 1980s and A-Level was only introduced in 1989. It is the biggest high school in [[Shurugwi]] by student population.

[[Pakame Mission]], about 40&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest, is a [[Methodist]]-run mission.  Like Hanke, it traditionally offered classes up to form 4 (O-Levels), but was recently upgraded to offer up to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]]. Pakame is considered the best of the three in terms of [[O-Level]] pass rate.Rusununguko is now a high school offering A levels as well.

Rusununguko High School which is 4&amp;nbsp;km was of late upgraded to offer A levels, this is the only non boarding high school  in Shurugwi. This schools caters for talented students from disadvantaged families mainly from its neighboring secondary schools such as Mupangai, Bokai. The pass rate from Rusununguko is not bad, most students walk +/- 15&amp;nbsp;km to and from school. Most students who come through these walls normally fails to progress with their education because of university fees challenges

==Health==
===Hospitals===
[[Zvamavande Rural Hospital]] is the only hospital in Shurugwi Rural. It is located 2&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Cha Cha Cha Township]], 2&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Vungwi Primary School]] and 7&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Rusununguko Secondary School]].

===Clinics===
There are a number of rural clinics in Shurugwi Rural. Notable clinics include Hanke Clinic, on the same campus as Hanke Mission; Saint Francis Clinic, near the residence of [[Chief Nhema]] and facilitated by his politician son, [[Francis Nhema]], about 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Cha Cha Cha Township]] and 20&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Hanke Adventist Secondary School]]; and Tongogara Clinic, situated at Tongogara Shopping Centre. There is also Gundura clinic, about 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Pakame Mission]].There is also Rusike clinic about 15&amp;nbsp;km south of Cha Cha Cha.

Zvamavande Hospital is the referral centre for all other clinics in the region which often transfers  patients to [[Shurugwi Hospital]] in [[Shurugwi]].

People still walk long distances to health centres. Serious cases are sometimes transported up to 10&amp;nbsp;km by ox-drawn carts.  This happens especially to those that are from areas that are not easily accessed by cars such as resettlement areas commonly known as "minda murefu" (literally, "long fields").

===HIV and AIDS===
Like other rural areas, Shurugwi Rural Areas has suffered the wrath of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], partly because of unawareness and poverty. Sex is considered the only form of entertainment in rural areas, given that many families do not have televisions and there are no cinemas to watch movies. Due to an unexpected number of deaths between the middle 1990s and the early 2000s, people have been frightened by the consequences of AIDS and the HIV rate in the area has recently declined.

==Resettlement areas==
There has been considerable resettlement, since 80% of the area around Shurugwi was owned by commercial farmers (generally Caucasians) who lost their farms because of the domestic land policy of President [[Mugabe]].  The people who claimed these farms (mostly black families without land) have struggled to survive due to lack of knowledge regarding good agricultural methods. Most of the beneficiaries are not originally from Shurugwi.

==Politics==
Home to the late freedom fighter and Commander in Chief of Zanla forces, Josiah Magama Tongogara, other notable politicians include late Midland governor and resident minister [[Herbert S.M Mahlaba]], [[Francis Nhema]], the Minister of Tourism in the Mugabe cabinet and an MP of [[Shurugwi]], first Shurugwi MP at independence and now Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, Dr Lucia Matibenga, and Emmerson Mnangagwa, by virtue of marriage to Tongogara's sister and coming from Chirumhanzu, and Dr Frank Mbengo.

[[Frank Mbengo]] is an academic from Mbengo Village, situated 1&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Vungwi Primary School]], 1&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Zvamabande Hospital]], and 1&amp;nbsp;km from [[Cha Cha Cha Township]].  He ran several times as an independent but was not elected. Some reports say he was offered a cabinet post by [[Mugabe]] but declined. Another notable personnel include Dr Anderson Chimusoro who once served as the Midlands Province provincial medical officer and Tinotenda Weiss Chimusoro(son of Charles Chimusoro) who is a journalist by profession and has worked beyond borders particularly in SADC countries(Times Of Swaziland).

Due to patronage, MPs have since independence come from the north (15&amp;nbsp;km north of Cha Cha Cha Township), an area under the guardianship of [[Chief Nhema]], as opposed to the south which is under [[Chief Ndanga]]. [[David Ruzive]], a former MP who has been heavily criticized, was also from Nhema. This has caused more development in the Nhema area than in the Ndanga Area.

[[Cha Cha Cha Township]] is the best-located township in [[Shurugwi]] Rural because it is where major roads meet.  Unfortunately it has been neglected and the growth point was placed at [[Tongogara Township]].

==Natural resources==
The district is located on the mineral-rich belt, commonly known as the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe,known ocally as Chironde Mountain range, making it one of the most mineral-rich areas in the country. Chromite,Platinum, Gold and Nickel are all mined around Shurugwi. This mountain range stretches all the way from Cape Town through to the copper belt regions of Zambia. Places of interest include Wolfshall Pass, commonly known as Boterekwa due to the winding of the road as it negotiates its way up and between mountains. Midway through Boterekwa, there is Dun raven Falls which is about 100m from the road. Boterekwa is very similar to the pass close to Louis Trichardt in South Africa since both were constructed by an Italian firm, the difference only being there are tunnels in Louis Trichardt. It has been a scene of many road accidents with most of them fatal.The most notable of these accidents occurred in 1976 when a bus load of students from Chrome Secondary School overturned. Only three teachers survived the crash. Almost every year, a serious accident do occur at Boterekwa, this is attributted to narrow road, steep slopes and sharp curves.

Another place of interest can be the Guruguru (which means very huge) mountain, the mountain is a bare granite rock which a few kilometers east of Pakame High School. Getting to the top of this mountain can be a mission due to the absence of supporting trees and slippery rock surfaces.

Generally, Shurugwi is very scenic districts which a sizeable hills all over the place, this include Bokai, Chikomo Chirefu, Magomana, Shamba, Rasha close to Chachacha and Gururuguru. Unfortunately due to resettlement in the area, most of wild animals have been driven away or killed.

'''Smuggling in pre-revolutionary France''' was a reaction to the economic hardships and internal taxations throughout the country. Though the trade of contraband was lucrative throughout Europe, it was especially so in France and contributed to national tensions. While tobacco was commonly smuggled, common items such as salt and calico were carried across provincial borders to avoid high taxes. The smuggling trade was very profitable, and it allowed families to increase their income while subverting corrupt tax farmers. The prevalence of smuggling and the economic motivations surrounding the trade helped lead France towards revolution.

Several economic factors contributed to the prevalence of smuggling in the second half of the eighteenth century. Of the twenty-six million people in France, twenty-one million worked within the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most peasants who owned land held less than twenty acres, enough to support a single family. France strongly relied on its agricultural sector, and this over dependence left the population susceptible to draughts and other natural disasters. Urban peasants faced similar problems, as most of Paris’s population served as manual workers. The census of 1791 revealed that there were 118,784 paupers, unskilled laborers, and beggars in Paris, about a quarter of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, most of the urban and rural populations were limited to lower-class occupations. There was also economic disparity between the sexes. A male servant might earn 90 livres a year while a woman earned 35-50 livres.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants dedicated half of their household income to food, leaving little money for other expenses.

Despite this [[wealth inequality]], French foreign trade was widely successful until the beginning of the revolution, as the sugar trade in the West Indies brought great wealth to France’s elite. The [[monarchy]] capitalized on this wealth by imposing trade monopolies with its Caribbean colonies. However, the Eden Treaty with England of May 1787 hindered the French manufacturing sector, as the agreement lowered internal tariffs on English goods.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This trade agreement outraged French merchants because they couldn’t compete with British prices. Such trade agreements contributed to poverty within France and encouraged illicit economic activity.

Smuggling within France was an extremely lucrative business due to high demand for expensive products, specifically tobacco, salt, and calico. Smugglers devised means of subverting the authorities. For example, female smugglers would often stuff salt into their dresses. Smugglers also trained dogs to carry salt, though no records exist on their prevalence or incarceration rates.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many smuggling bands formed; French authorities were aware of at least 38 large smuggling bands in the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2013. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; As indirect taxes were uniform throughout France, certain provinces charged vastly more for some items. For example, 49 kilos of salt cost 31 sous in Brittany but 591 sous in Anjoy.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Crossing he Loire River, which separated the two territories, became a common means of transporting contraband. Salt smuggling was particularly problematic for the authorities, as smugglers abused the gabelle, or salt tax. Many provinces mandated that every citizen buy at least seven pounds of salt per year.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Justin Huntly. The French Revolution, Volume 1. Nabu Press, 2010. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; This salt could only be used for cooking, so many would have been required to buy more. As a result, many relied on purchasing contraband salt to escape these heavy fines. Calico was also a popular contraband item, as the French prized genuine Indian calico. Although calico’s prohibition ended in 1759, calico’s taxation remained high enough to justify smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; France’s public monopoly and internal tax system also upset foreigners. Irish lawmaker Edmund Burke stated that the system was “unwisely, with being ill-contrived, [and] oppressive.”&lt;ref&gt;Hampsher-Monk, Iain. The Impact of the French Revolution: Texts from Britain in the 1790s. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2005. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke’s views show an international disapproval of France’s practices and an awareness that smuggling would be the taxes’ unintended consequence.

Smuggling posed a significant problem for authorities. French law considered smuggling a direct offense against the King; smugglers avoided paying indirect taxes which composed 47% of the government’s income, so it was as if they were stealing from the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Sylvia. A Concise History of the French Revolution. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Smugglers also undermined the ferme générale, or the “Five Great Farms.”&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Sylvia. A Concise History of the French Revolution. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a tax farming institution which collected and profited off indirect taxes. Therefore, the law dealt harshly with offenders to discourage further smuggling. Punishments for smuggling varied across France’s provinces but always worsened with repeat offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Offenders were always fined and often served additional time depending on the region. In Provence, smuggling bands of five and larger received fines of 500 livres and served nine years in galleys for a first offense.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was especially harsh on nobles who dealt in contraband; commonly, those elites who were caught were stripped of their titles and their houses were raised.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The severe punishment of the contraband industry shaped France’s prison infrastructure. From 1685 to 1791, over 100,000 men went to the galleys for illegal trade.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The government needed to build more prisons to meet demands, and this influx of prisoners would lead the French government to create the modern French prison.

French authorities also reacted by imposing increased regulations on the business practices and movements of peasants. Officers viewed travelers with suspicion and demanded that merchants show their paperwork to prove the legitimacy of their wares. The government also increased the Farm police to 20,000 guards which became the largest paramilitary force of the time in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; They patrolled the [[Loire river|Loire River]] and prohibited fishing at night. Officers would also physically search any suspects. For example, they would squeeze women where salt could be hidden, often the padding within their dresses.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the French Revolution 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heightened repression on underground trade, smugglers often played integral roles in inciting armed rebellions against taxation officers. From 1660-1789, tax rebellion was the primary form of revolt within France.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, these rebellions were larger than the bread riots which propelled the beginning of the French Revolution. The most prominent of these revolts occurred from July 11 to 14 in 1789, when smugglers and common workers destroyed forty customs gates.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring before the Storming of the Bastille, this was one of the first demonstrations of popular support for the French Revolution.

Smugglers garnered large public support, and influential revolutionary figures and liberals defended these rebellions. [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], a noble and leader of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], argued that the true antagonist wasn’t the smuggling trade but the Farm; he called these men “vampires” who control a system which “bleeds the people at the throat.”&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; These smuggler’s rebellions also influenced physiocrats, liberal economic supporters for fair trade; they advocated for a completely altered fiscal system which replaced taxes on goods with other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as the President of the Paris “cour des aides” Malesherbes asserted in 1775 that this crime didn’t warrant such severe punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, Suzanne, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson, eds. The French Revolution in Global Perspective. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the King could resolve this form of despotism by calling the Estates General, an institution last seen in 1614. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] would form the Estates General four years later.

'''Southern Malaysia Hokkien''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|南馬福建話}}|s={{linktext|南马福建话}}|p=Nán Mǎ Fújiànhuà|poj=''Lâm-Má Hok-kiàn-oē''}}) is a local variant of the [[Min Nan]] [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] spoken in Central and Southern Peninsular Malaysia as well as in the Eastern Malaysian state of [[Sarawak]]. ([[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]], [[Melaka]], [[Muar (district)|Muar]], [[Tangkak]], [[Segamat]], [[Batu Pahat (city)|Batu Pahat]], [[Pontian, Johor|Pontian]], [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Kuching]]), [[Singaporean Hokkien|Singapore]], [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]].

This dialect is based on the [[Quanzhou]] dialect. It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]].

Similar to the situation in Singapore, the term [[Hokkien]] is generally the used by the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in South-east Asia to refer [[Min Nan]] Chinese (闽南语). [[Southern Malaysia Hokkien]] is based on [[Quanzhou dialect]] with some influence from [[Amoy]].

Southern Malaysia Hokkien is also subjected to influence from various languages or dialects spoken in Malaysia. This is influenced to a certain degree by [[Teochew dialect]] and is sometimes being regarded to be a combined Hokkien-Teochew speech (especially in [[Muar (district)|Muar]], [[Batu Pahat]], [[Pontian, Johor|Pontian]] and [[Johor Bahru]]). It has many [[loan words]] from [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]].

[[Image:spite house NY 1895.jpg|thumb|250px|The Richardson Spite House in 1895]]
A '''spite house''' is a [[building]] [[construction|constructed]] or [[renovation|substantially modified]] to [[irritability|irritate]] neighbors or any party with [[estate in land|land stakes]]. Spite houses may create obstructions, such as blocking out light or blocking access to neighboring buildings, or can be flagrant symbols of defiance.&lt;ref name="answer"&gt;Kelly, John, March 26, 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/25/AR2006032500903.html Answer Man: In Search Of Houses That Spite Built.]" Page C02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Park Service|United States National Park Service]], 1960, [http://memory.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/me/me0000/me0074/data/002.tif Historical American Building Survey: Spite (McCobb-Dodge) House - Page 2.] Retrieved March 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[residency (domicile)|long-term occupation]] is at best a secondary consideration, spite houses frequently sport strange and impractical structures.

Spite houses are considerably rarer than [[spite fence]]s.&lt;ref name="answer"/&gt; This is partially attributable to the fact that modern [[building codes]] often prevent the construction of houses likely to impinge on neighbors' views or privacy, but mostly because fence construction is far cheaper than home construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35366/cold-spots-tylers-spite-house|title=Cold Spots: Tyler's Spite House - Dread Central|work=Dread Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also similar structures known as [[spite wall]] or blinder wall.

*In 1716, Thomas Wood, a sailmaker, built a house in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], that subsequently became known as the Old Spite House. According to one theory, it was inhabited by two brothers who occupied different sections, would not speak to each other, and refused  to sell to the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boston Globe]], October 14, 1984, "The challenge of renovating ''Marblehead's Spite House'', where children and pets live harmoniously with antiques." Section: Special. The Old Spite House is located at Orne St &amp; Gas House Ln, Marblehead, MA 01945.&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that the ten foot (3 meter) wide house, just tall enough to block the view of two other houses on Orne Street, was built because its owner was upset about his tiny share of his father's estate and therefore decided to spoil his older brothers' view.&lt;ref name="living"&gt;Miller, Margo, October 17, 1986, [[Boston Globe]]: "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADEDADCCCC84EF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D Living by the sea - Boston's waterfront homes on tour.]" Section: At home; Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Spite House is still standing and occupied.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:McCobb Spite House July 1960.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The ''McCobb Spite House'' at [[Rockport, Maine|Deadman's Point]] in July 1960.&lt;/center&gt;]]

*[[Image:AlamedaSpiteHouse.jpg|thumb|The ''Alameda Spite House'', July 2008]]At the turn of the 20th century, the city of [[Alameda, California]], took a large portion of Charles Froling's land to build a street.

== In fiction ==
In 1839 or 1840, [[Edgar Allan Poe]], in his story "[[The Business Man]]", wrote the following passage in the voice of Peter Proffit, a man who imagines himself a legitimate businessman although the reader realizes that he is a [[confidence trick|con man]]. Proffit's attempted scam in this passage is to build a spite house and extort his neighbors to pay him to tear it down. (He calls this line of business 'the Eye-Sore trade'.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever a rich old hunks, or prodigal heir, or bankrupt corporation, gets into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows. The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade. As soon, therefore, as a building project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining or tight in front. This done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course, we can't afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can we? I ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be irrational to suppose that we can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Tahitians''', or '''Maohis''', are a [[nation]] and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Tahiti]] and thirteen other [[Society Islands]] in [[French Polynesia]], as well as the modern population of these lands of [[multiracial]], primarily Polynesian-French, ancestry ({{lang-fr|demis}}). The Tahitians are one of the largest indigenous [[Polynesian peoples|Polynesian ethnic groups]], behind the [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Samoans]] and [[Hawaiians]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1976), vol. 25, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-European period and customs==

The first Polynesian settlers arrived in Tahiti around 400AD by way of [[Samoans|Samoan]] navigators and settlers via the [[Cook Islands|Cook]] [[Cook Islands|Islands]]. Over the period of half a century there was much inter-island relations with trade, marriages and [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian]] expansion with the Islands of [[Hawaii]] and through to [[Rapa Nui people|Rapanui]].

The original Tahitian society was unaware of metal as it was based on [[Stone Age]] technology. However, it enabled Tahitians to clear land for cultivation on the fertile volcanic soils and build fishing [[canoe]]s, their two basic subsistence activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ben R. Finney. ''Tahiti: Polynesian Peasants and Proletarians'', Transaction Publishers, 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The tools of the Tahitians when first discovered were made of stone, bone, shell or wood.

The Tahitians were divided into three major classes (or [[caste]]s): ''ari'i'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] has no " l " while [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] has no " r ," otherwise, the Tahitian ''ari&amp;lsquo;i'' and Hawaiian ''[[Ali'i|ali&amp;lsquo;i]]'' have similar connotation.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ra'atira'' and ''manahune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ari'i'' were relatively few in number while ''manahune'' constituted the bulk of population and included some members who played essential roles in the society.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Oliver. ''Polynesia in early historic times'', Bess Press, 2002, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that by the first contact with Europeans in 1767 the population of Tahiti was no more than 40,000 while other Society Islands held probably 15,000-20,000 natives.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahitians divided the day into the periods of daylight (''ao'') and darkness (''pō'').&lt;ref&gt;Robert I. Levy, Pierre Heyman. ''Tahitians: Mind and Experience in the Society Islands'', University of Chicago Press, 1975, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a concept of [[Fear#Fear_of_the_unknown|irrational fear]] called ''mehameha'', translated as uncanny feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Heyman, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; The healers, familiar with herbal remedies, were called ''ta'ata rā'au'' or ''ta'ata rapa'au''. In the 19th century Tahitians added the European medicine to their practice. The most famous Tahitian healer Tiurai, of ''ari'i'', died aged 83 during the influenza outbreak on Tahiti in 1918.

When British Captain [[Samuel Wallis]] "discovered" Tahiti on 18 June 1767, the natives were eager to trade, especially in iron nails unknown to them.&lt;ref&gt;Brij V. Lal, Kate Fortune. ''The Pacific Islands: an encyclopedia'', University of Hawaii Press, 2000, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philibert Commerçon]] (1727–1773) in his ''The Tahitian Savage to the French'' wrote: "They have a fruit instead of bread. Their other foods are equally simple". Commerçon also described the practice of [[public sex]],&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Fagan. ''Clash of cultures'', Rowman Altamira, 1998, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; which he said Tahitians engaged in while being cheered on by applause and musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander H. Bolyanatz. ''Pacific romanticism: Tahiti and the European imagination'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  In the marital relationships Tahitians closely approached the situation where all women were the wives of men and the wife of every man was also the wife of his friend.&lt;ref&gt;''The Popular Science Monthly'', Feb. 1915, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] described a scene, where a young girl came on board, placed herself upon the quarter deck and carelessly dropt the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Antoine de Bougainville. ''A Voyage Round the World Performed by Order of His Most Christian Majesty...'' Da Capo Press, Amsterdam, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] also wrote on Tahitians during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage on the ''Beagle'']]: "There is a mildness in the expression of their countenances, which at once banishes the idea of a savage; and an intelligence, which shows they are advancing in civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Harry Liebersohn. ''The travelers' world: Europe to the Pacific'', Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

The European ships however brought such diseases for which Tahitians had little or no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], such as [[dysentery]], [[smallpox]], [[scarlet fever]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;Finney, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these changes by 1797 the population of Tahiti decreased to 16,000 from estimated 40,000 in 1767, when the first European ship [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] touched on the island.&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt;  The 1881 [[census]] enumerated about 5,960 native Tahitians. The recovery continued in spite of a few more epidemics.

==Modern day==
Three hundred Tahitian volunteers fought in the [[European theatre of World War II]] with the [[Free French Forces]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/minorities/Oceania/Tahitians-of-Polynesia1.html Tahitians of Polynesia] Faqs.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s Tahitian poets Henri Hiro, Charles Manutahi, Vaitiare and Turo Raapoto spearheaded the anticolonial writing in Tahiti. Hiro's ''God of Culture'' implores [[Oihanu]], the Tahitian god of culture and husbandry, to empower the 'new generation'. Three women writers - Michou Chaze, [[Chantal Spitz]] and Vaitiare explore the problems of Tahitian identification in contemporary [[French Polynesia]]. Tahitian peasants and workers call themselves the 'true Tahitians' (''Ta'ata Tahiti Mau'') to distinguish from part-Europeans (''Ta'ata 'afa Popa'a'').&lt;ref&gt;Finney, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time demis quite frequently identify themselves as indigenous people in terms of culture and political affiliation.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; Such Tahitian activists as [[Pouvanaa a Oopa]], Francis Sanford and Charlie Ching and Catholic bishops [[Michel-Gaspard Coppenrath]] and [[Hubert Coppenrath]] are of ''demi'' ancestry.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TahitiChapXII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tahiti 1834-1984 - Chap.

Many natives were painted from life by [[Paul Gauguin]], who gave Tahitian titles to his works. In ''Ea haere ia oe'' (''Where Are You Going?''), for example, a pensive young girl wears the white flower ''[[tiare]]'' behind her left ear, signifying readiness to take a lover.&lt;ref name= "Maurer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin|first= Naomi E.|last= Maurer|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wf_PoXKhggkC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=147|isbn= 9780838637494|year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahitians are French citizens and are represented by two elected deputies to the [[French National Assembly]] and one representative in the [[French Senate]].&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;Victoria S. Lockwood. ''Tahitian transformation'', [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 1993, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Tahitians vote by universal adult suffrage in all major French elections.&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5915">{{Buddhism}}
The '''Three Turnings of the Wheel (of Dharma)''' refers to a framework for understanding the sutra stream of the teachings of the [[Buddhism]] originally devised by the [[Yogachara]] school. It later became prevalent in modified form in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and related traditions.

The distinction is, on the one hand, a historic or quasi-historic scheme by which the Buddha's first sermons, as recorded in the Pali Canon and the [[tripitaka]]s of other early schools, constitute the First Turning, and the later [[Mahayana]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] comprise the Second and Third turnings. The schema appears in the Samdhinirmochana Sutra, a central Yogachara text, although it may predate it.

The model of three turnings of the 'Wheel' is an attempt to categorize the content, philosophical view, and practical application of the whole array of Buddhist [[sutrayana]] teachings. That is to say that the concept of [[three turnings]] exclusively belongs to the Himalayan Buddhist teachings ('Tibetan'). All other Buddhist traditions speak of one turning only, that in Mrigadaye, the Deer Park, in Sarnath, India.

==Contents of the Three Turnings==
The basic content and audience of the three turnings of the wheel can be summarized as follows:

===First Turning===
The first turning is traditionally said to have taken place at Deer Park in [[Sarnath]] near Varanasi in northern [[India]], to an audience of  [[shravaka]]s. It consisted of the teaching of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Sanskrit: ''[[catvāry āryasatyāni]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay (Ed. in Chief)(2005). ''Encyclopedia of Religion''. (2nd Ed.) Volume 14; Masaaki, Hattori (Ed.)(1987 &amp; 2005)"''Yogācāra''": p.9897. USA:  Macmillan Reference.  {{ISBN|0-02-865983-X}} (v.14)&lt;/ref&gt;) and the other elements of the Tripitaka &amp;ndash; the [[Abhidharma]], [[Sutta Pitaka|Sutrapitaka]] and [[Vinaya]]. The Abhidharma referred to is the Abhidharma Pitaka of the [[Sarvastivada]] school, which is a later composition not taught by the Buddha, and contains philosophy which is antithetical, one may say, to the early teachings.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, "Sarvastivada and its theory of sarvam asti." ''University of Ceylon Review'' 24 1966, 94-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Turning===
The second turning is said to have taken place at Vulture Peak Mountain in [[Rajagriha]], in [[Bihar]], India. The audience comprised [[bodhisattva]]s; in some telling there were also shravaka [[arhat]]s there as well, who promptly had heart attacks and died from the shock of the new teachings.  In the second turning, the emphasis is on [[shunyata|emptiness]] (Skt: ''śūnyatā'') as epitomized in the [[Prajnaparamita]] sutras, and on [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (Skt: ''{{IAST|karuṇā}}''). These two elements form [[bodhicitta]], the epitome of the second turning. The [[Madhyamika]] school that [[Nagarjuna]] founded arose from his [[exegesis]] of the early texts and is included under the second turning. Nagarjuna attacked the metaphysics of the Sarvastivada school and a school which broke away from it called [[Sautrantika]], and promoted, among other things, the classical emphasis on the dependent arising of phenomena of the early texts.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Turning===
The third turning was also delivered to an audience of bodhisattvas in [[Shravasti]] and other Indian locations (e.g. in Kusinagara, to Bodhisattvas and onlooking Buddhas, in the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]) &amp;ndash; or even in transcendental Buddhic realms (in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]). The focal point of the third turning is [[Buddha nature]] and particularly the [[Tathāgatagarbha]] doctrine. This was elaborated on in great detail by [[Maitreya]] via [[Asanga]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon#Five treatises of Maitreya|Five Treatises of Maitreya]], which are also generally grouped under the third turning. The [[Yogachara]] school reoriented later refinements, in all their complexity, so as to accord with the doctrines of earliest Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Turning===
The [[Huayan school|Huayen]] school of Chinese Buddhism considered the [[Tathāgatagarbha]] doctrine a fourth turning, with the third turning comprising only the [[Yogachara]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism''. Windhorse Pub. London, 2004. pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Vajrayana]] schools sometimes refer to tantra as the "fourth turning."

==Definitive and provisional==
The schema of the three turnings is found in Yogachara and Tathāgatagarbha texts such as the [[Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]] and the [[Srimala Sutra]] and likely originated in the Yogachara literature. Naturally, they identify themselves as definitive. However, the schema was later adopted more widely, and different sects and schools of Buddhism, as well as individual Buddhist teachers and philosophers give different explanations as to whether the second or third turnings is 'definitive' (Skt: ''nitartha'') or 'provisional' (Skt: ''neyartha'') or requiring interpretation. In the Tibetan tradition, the [[Gelug]] school considers the second turning definitive, as do some scholars in other schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12465">'''Transition scenarios''' are descriptions of future states which combine a future image with an account of the changes that would need to occur to reach that future. These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal ([[backcasting]]). Both these processes can use participatory techniques ([[Paul Raskin|Raskin]] et al., 2002&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, P., T. Banuri, G. Gallopín, P. Gutman, A. Hammond, R. Kates, and R. Swart. (2002). The Great Transition: The Promise and the Lure of the Times Ahead. Boston, MA: [[Tellus Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions.

Transition scenarios are unique in type not only in terms of how they are created (process) but also their content. Their requirements are guided by transition management concepts and consider the "fundamental and irreversible change in the culture, structure and practices of a system" (Sondeijker, 2009:52,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;). Transition scenarios are emerging as a scenario type which is more applicable to the context of sustainable development based on their abilities to capture the complexities of system structure and innovation (Loorbach, 2007; Rotmans, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Loorbach, D.A. (2007), Transition Management: new mode of governance for sustainable development, DRIFT, Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotmans, J. (2005) Societal Innovation: Between Dream and Reality Lies Complexity, Inaugural Speech, Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Scenario types==

There are various types of scenarios that can be used for a range of purposes and are predominantly split between first, second and third generation scenarios.

===First generation===
First generation scenarios are intended to predict the future as accurately as possible, for instance by extrapolating trends. Examples of these scenarios are weather predictions, forecasts for a wide range of topics such as economic growth, population, building volume etc. They are predominantly based on the quantitative / econometric extrapolation of trends. Another part is based on qualitative "trend watching methods" (e.g. fashion).

===Second generation===
Second generation scenarios have a more explorative character. Scenarios can be intended to explore possibilities for the future, without pronouncing upon their probability or desirability. Scenarios can then be defined as "a tool for ordering alternative future environments in which one's decision may be played out" (Peter Schwartz, 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, P. (1991). The art of the long view. Doubleday. New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are based on the presumption that nobody can predict, and therefore should not try to predict the future. "The only relevant discussions about the future are those where we succeed from shifting from the question "whether something will happen" to the question "what will we do IF something happens" (Arie de Geus, 1998,&lt;ref&gt;De Geus, A. (1997). The living company. Longview Publishing Limited, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). An example of this type of scenario was developed by Shell (The Shell scenario method).

===Third generation===
Third generation scenarios focus on long time spans and preferred societal systems which are normative and explorative in nature and reflective of the structural and societal changes required in pursuing sustainability (Sondeijker, 2009; Edquist 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edquist, C. (2005). Systems of innovation: Perspectives and challenges. In J. Fagerberg, D. C. Mowery &amp; R. R. Nelson (Eds.), The Oxford handbook of innovation (pp. 181-208). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are intended to produce a picture of the future we want. The question then is: "what do we actually want the future to look like?", examples of these scenarios are based, amongst others, on the European Awareness method and include the use of energy in urban environments, sustainable production and consumption, and normative "factor 4" studies. These scenarios were devised based on the claim that scenarios active in first and second generation scenario methods cannot live up to the challenge of imagining, contributing and preparing for the dynamic processes of transformative change. Transitions are complex interactions which need system approaches to define paths towards a sustainable future and transition scenarios are set to address these concerns by providing a method to handle these issues.

==Content and process==

The creation of transition scenarios has two basic objectives. To ensure that the scenario created is relevant to the concepts of transition management to allow the system to be systematically analysed and to contribute to social learning. These objectives are encapsulated in the content and process, respectively, of transition scenario creation.

==Content==
Transition scenarios are informed by transition management concepts and theories which it uses as a basis for its contents. In particular, transition scenarios consider long time frames and are both normative and explorative in nature. Their contents are predominantly centred on the following elements (Sondeijker 2009; Geels, F. W, 2002, Kemp et al. 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W. (2002), Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case-study, Research Policy 31(8/9), 1257-1274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R. (1998), Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management, In: Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10(2): 175-195.&lt;/ref&gt;):

===Multi-level criteria===
Multi-level criteria relate to elements of change (weak signals) that can be identified in present structures occurring at different levels of the system. These provide the opportunity to recognise and investigate levers than can be used for long run transitions. Weak signals combined with uncertain developments can produce the appropriate climate for structural change. Anticipation of weak signals is essential if the development of scenarios beyond the scope of current developments is to be reached.

===Multi-pattern criteria===
Multi-pattern criteria describe the interaction between actors and structure of the system being analysed. This includes action derived from bottom-up initiatives which are built up from actor groups which are involved in niche-based innovation activities which infiltrate and eventually change the dominant regimes. Equally important are actors across and between levels which can support and further accelerate change. This ensures that practices and habits in the system are transformed through the replacement of the old dominant regime with the new desired future state.

===Multi-phase criteria===
Multi-phase criteria refer to the different timings of the alternating stages involved in transition management: predevelopment phase, take-off phase, acceleration phase and the stabilisation phase. The nature and speeds of these phases inform the character of the transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified. In the take-off phase the point of no return is reached followed by the acceleration phase where cultural, structural and practice changes occur most visibly.

==Process==
Transition scenarios are also process orientated focusing on the ability of different stakeholders and participants to communicate and imagine their desired future within the discussion groups. Through this participatory process participants are encouraged to change mind set and attitude to think from a long-term perspective. Specific focus on various feasible topics will increase participants' knowledge of the topic area and the alternatives available in its context. These lessons may eventually be internalised within participants resulting in a social learning process (Social Learning Group, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Social Learning Group (2001). Learning to manage global environmental risks. Edited by S.L.Group, Vol 1&amp;2, Cambridge Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Sustainable low-carbon futures==
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2012}}
Europe, along with the rest of the world, is facing the challenge of climate change and its impacts on the environment, economy and society. In order to address these concerns and to adopt a proactive approach in finding solutions, the European Commission launched its Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010 followed by its Roadmap for 2050. The 2020 strategy puts forward a vision of a Europe which has increased employment, invests in research and development, ensures more young people finish school and obtain university degrees, has fewer people threatened by poverty, has a reduced greenhouse gas level of 20% compared with 1990 level, has an increased contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy consumption and has increased efficiency by 20%. The 2050 Roadmap sets forward possibilities to reaching the more stringent 80% reduction target of greenhouse gases in 2050 by considering various scenarios and setting milestones for a 40% reduction by 2030 and 60% by 2040.

It is clear from this strategy and roadmap that Europe needs to transition to a future which is quite different from the one which follows a "business as usual" trajectory. This need formed the basis from which the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Framework Programme 7|EU Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) under its call "Foresight to enhance behavioural and societal changes enabling the transition towards sustainable paths in Europe" was created. Three projects focusing on transition scenarios and management were selected to provide range in application and context. These projects are as follows:

* CRISP (CReating Innovative Sustainability Pathways) aims to identify sustainable low carbon futures and pathways. This intent will allow the project to recommend new policy mixes and innovative cooperation mechanisms that will support and promote transitions. In order to achieve these objectives, it employs transition scenarios and participatory approaches to ensure people of all ages and backgrounds are actively involved in the discourse on sustainable development.
* INCONTEXT (Individuals in Context: Supportive Environments for Sustainable Living) studies both the internal and external contexts in which change occurs. Through the use of multi-disciplinary approaches insights into the role played by social norms, policies and infrastructure (external context) and needs, values and priorities (internal context) can be gauged within the agency-structure debate. The project’s main output is to help inform policies that can support internal changes required for sustainable action.
* LOCAW (Low Carbon at Work: Modelling agents and organisations to achieve transition to a low carbon Europe) aims to gain insight into the drivers and barriers of sustainability practices within the work place across different organizations within the EU. The multi-disciplinary approach is used to create the desirable low-carbon futures, map the alternative pathways and gain insight into how cooperative interaction needs to be supported to encourage sustainable development. This latter point is predominantly investigated through the use of agent based modelling.

The '''Trique''' ({{IPA-oax|triki}}) or '''Triqui''' ({{IPA-es|ˈtɾiki|lang}}) are an [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]] of the western part of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]], centered in the [[Municipio (Mexico)|municipalities]] of [[Juxtlahuaca]], [[Tlaxiaco]] and [[Putla]]. They number around 23,000 according to [[Ethnologue]] surveys. The [[Trique language]] is a [[Mixtecan language]] of [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] genetic affiliation. Trique peoples are known for their distinctive woven [[huipil]]es, baskets, and ''morrales'' (handbags).&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Masako. Mexican Textiles: Spirit and Style. Chronicle Books. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trique people live in a mountainous region, called "La Mixteca Baja", in the southwestern part of the state of [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]]. The elevation within the Trique region varies between {{convert|1,500|-|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This high elevation permits low-lying [[cumulus cloud]]s to envelop entire towns during the afternoons and evenings.

Like many other southern Mexicans, many Trique men travel to [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca City]], [[Mexico City]], or the [[United States]] as [[day labour]]ers or [[migrant worker]]s. As the average daily salary of a rural Oaxacan is less than $5 (U.S.) and La Mixteca is the poorest region of Oaxaca, migration and [[remittance]]s sent back to Oaxaca confer economic benefits to both migrant Triques and their families in Oaxaca.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Arthur D., Stepick, Alex. Social Inequality in Oaxaca: A History of Resistance and Change. Temple University Press. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Seth M. An Ethnographic Study of the Social Context of Migrant Health in the United States. PLoS Med 3(10): e448 {{doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0030448}}. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Trique women are more likely to remain in the Trique region and do not travel as often as Trique men do.

==Custom==

One of the notable customs of Trique people is the practice of [[bride price]]. During pre-colonial and colonial times, this was a common practice amongst Native Americans in [[Mesoamerica]], other groups like the [[Mixtec]]s of Oaxaca continue practicing a [[bride price]] based marriage. It is typical in Trique culture for a man to offer a bride's family money, food, and other products in exchange for the bride's hand in marriage. Generally, the husband and wife know each other prior to this arrangement and there is no arrangement without consent.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Jack. "[http://www.thecalifornian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009901200303 Experts: Triqui dad in Greenfield followed culture's marriage tradition]." ''[[The Salinas Californian]]''. January 20, 2009. Retrieved on March 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Those opposed to this custom argue that it appears to them to be like slavery or prostitution. Those opposed to intervening in this custom argue that consent is required and that this Trique custom is not conceived of as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Grillo, Ioan. "[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1876102,00.html Selling Brides: Native Mexican Custom or Crime?]." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Sunday February 1, 2009. Retrieved on February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
The Trique economic income comes through the cultivation of various crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[bean]]s, [[pumpkin]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[quelite (disambiguation)|quelite]], and [[Phaseolus lunatus|lima beans]] among others. But the most important crops are both the [[banana]], and the [[coffee bean]]. The products are sold in [[tianguis]] (open-air markets) found in Chicahuaztla, Copala, San Martín, Itunyoso, Tlaxiaco, Putla, or Juxtlahuaca.

The Triques practice the [[Slash-and-burn|slash and burn]] cultivation system. Due to the peculiar form of cultivating the earth, the work is done by various families (between 20-30 people) in order to plant [[Milpa]] (corn fields) throughout large terrains. This type of collaborate work is known as «mipa colectiva» or «milpa en compañía»

==Live Stock ==
Another source of income for the Trique families is the raising of animals. Mainly they raise cattle, [[Bovinae|bovines]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s. On a smaller scale, they also raise [[chicken]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[Anatidae|duck]]. In the lower lands, they also practice [[beekeeping]].

==Sports==
The main sport practiced by the Trique people is [[basketball]], and as such, a basketball court can be found in all their surrounding communities. Tournaments are held during local festivals where all the athletes participate. The various institutes of education also hold basketball tournaments among all the surrounding schools. Gaining in popularity, although not widely practiced among the Trique is Soccer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20301">The '''United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force''' (UN ICT TF) was a [[Multistakeholder governance model|multi-stakeholder]] initiative associated with the [[United Nations]] which is "intended to lend a truly global dimension to the multitude of efforts to bridge the [[global digital divide]], foster digital opportunity and thus firmly put ICT at the service of development for all".

[[Image:UN SG Kofi Annan addressing the UN ICT TF in New York March 2004.JPG|right|thumb|400px|UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] addressing the 6th session of the UN ICT Task Force in New York City, March 25, 2004.]]

==Establishment==
The UN ICT Task Force was created by [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in November 2001, acting upon a request by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) dated July 11, 2000, with an initial term of mandate of three years (until the end of 2004). It followed in the footsteps of the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) Global Digital Divide Initiative (GDDI), and the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), established in 2000 by the [[G8]] at their annual summit in [[Okinawa]], Japan. By providing it with a home in the United Nations, this accorded the UN ICT Task Force, in the eyes of many developing countries, a broader legitimization than the previous WEF and G8 initiatives, even if these previous initiatives also included a multi-stakehoder approach with broad participation by stakeholders from industrialized and developing countries.

==Aims and objectives==
The Task Force's principal aim was to provide policy advice to governments and international organizations for bridging the digital divide. In addition to supporting the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) and leading the UN in developing ICT strategies for development, the Task Force's objective was to form partnerships between the UN system and states, private industry, trusts, foundations and donors, and other stakeholders.

==Membership and organization==
The UN ICT Task Force has included the top ranks of the computer industry ([[Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Nokia]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Sun Microsystems]]), together with global NGOs (e.g., the [[Association for Progressive Communications]]), governments and international agencies. Its coordinating body was a multi-stakeholder bureau, assisted by a small secretariat at UN headquarters in New York. Technical advice was provided by a high-level panel of technical advisors.

==Activities==

===United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS)===

Within the [https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/2000/e2000-55.pdf Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology] (22 May 2000) suggesting a UN ICT Task Force, the panel welcomed the establishment of a United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS), suggested by Kofi Annan in "[https://www.un.org/en/events/pastevents/pdfs/We_The_Peoples.pdf We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the 21st century]" (Millennium Report of the Secretary-General). The panel made suggestions on its configuration and implementation strategy, including that [[Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development|ICT4D]] [[volunteering]] opportunities make mobilizing "national human resources" (local ICT experts) within developing countries a priority, for both men and women. The initiative was launched at the [[United Nations Volunteers]] under the leadership of [[Sharon Capeling-Alakija]] and was active from February 2001 to February 2005. Initiative staff and volunteers participated in the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Geneva]] in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unites.org/ |title=UNITeS|access-date=9 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831085541/http://www.unites.org/|archive-date=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenge to Silicon Valley===
In November 2002 [[Kofi Annan]] issued a [[Challenge to Silicon Valley]] to create suitable systems at prices low enough to permit deployment everywhere, whether through international aid programs, [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, charities, or [[microcredit]] support. The call has been answered, but only a few UN programs were actively using computers and communications in developing countries in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] ran a refugee camp in [[Tanzania]] where the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726111601/http://www.global-catalyst.org/resources_online.htm Global Catalyst Foundation] had placed computers and communications equipment for the use of the [[Burundi]]an refugees confined there. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) worked with the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] on a [[Simputer]] project.

===World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)===
The Task Force was active, inter alia, in the process leading to the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Geneva]] in December 2003 and WSIS&amp;nbsp;II in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], in November 2005. In order to participate in the second phase of the WSIS, the Task Force's original three-year mandate was extended by another year and expired on 31 December 2005, with no further extension.

===Working groups===
The Task Force's stakeholders, members and the experts on the panel of technical advisors, were active in working groups organized around four broad themes:

* ICT policy and governance
* Enabling environment
* Human resource development and [[capacity building]]
* ICT Indicators and [[Millennium Development Goals|MDG]] mapping

===Regional networks===
Regional activities were carried out in five regional networks—Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, Arab States, and Europe and Central Asia.

===Meetings===
2002, June 17–18: A session of the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] was devoted to [[information and communication technologies for development]], addressing the digital divide in the context of globalization and the development process. The session promoted coherence and synergies between various regional and international information and communication technologies initiatives. The meeting also contributed to the preparation of WSIS. Many countries were represented by high-level officials responsible for communications and for development.

The Task Force held 10 semi-annual meetings in various places that served as important venues for exchange of best practices, and to bring the various stakeholders together to work on common themes. Most successful, in the eyes of the participants, were those meetings that were held in conjunction with a series of '''Global Forums''':
* 1st meeting: at UN headquarters in [[New York City, NY]], (United States) - November 19–20, 2001.
* 2nd meeting: at UN headquarters in [[New York City, NY]], (United States) - February 3–4, 2002.
* 3rd meeting: at UN headquarters in [[New York City, NY]], (United States) - September 30 - October 1, 2002, focused on ICT for development in Africa. It also reviewed the results of the first year of Task Force activities and agreed on an ambitious strategy for the next two years.
* 4th meeting: at UN in [[Geneva]], (Switzerland) - February 21–22, 2004, with a Private Sector Forum.
* 5th meeting: at [[WIPO]] in [[Geneva]] - September 12–13, 2003, to allow participants to discuss the Task Force's contribution to WSIS.
* 6th meeting: at UN headquarters in [[New York City, NY]], (United States) - March 2004, with a '''Global Forum on [[Internet Governance]]'''.
* 7th meeting: at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in [[Berlin]], Germany - November 18–20, 2004, with a '''Global Forum on an Enabling Environment'''.
* 8th meeting: in [[Dublin]], Ireland - April 13–15, 2005, with a '''Global Forum on Harnessing the Potential of ICTs in Education'''.
* 9th meeting: at [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland - October 1, 2005.
* 10th (final) meeting: at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] - November 17, 2005.

In addition, a '''Global Roundtable Forum on "Innovation and Investment: Scaling Science and Technology to Meet the MDGs"''' was held in New York City, 13 September 2005. The primary focus of the Forum was on the critical role of science, technology and innovation, especially information and communication technologies, in scaling-up grassroots, national and global responses to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

==WSIS II in Tunis==
Parallel to the booth at the ICT4ALL exhibition, a series of events was held under the auspices of the UN ICT Task Force and its members:

===Measuring the Information Society===
The Partnership for Measuring ICT for Development&lt;ref&gt;[http://measuring-ict.unctad.org Welcome to the Measuring ICT Website - new.unctad.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516064114/http://measuring-ict.unctad.org/ |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; involves 11 organizations—[[Eurostat]], the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the United Nations ICT Task Force, the five United Nations Regional Commissions and the [[World Bank]].

===Role of Parliaments in the Information Society===
Key parliament leaders presented their views on the role that national and regional assemblies can play in building the information society at a “High-level Dialogue on Governance, Global Citizenship and Technology”, on 16 November.

===Choosing the Right Technologies for Education===
At this workshop, the Global e-School Initiative&lt;ref name=gesci&gt;[http://www.gesci.org Global eSchools and Communities Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; presented the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator—a framework for identifying and selecting the right ICT for schools by assessing their benefits, feasibility and costs.

===Building Partnerships for the Information Society===
Two high-level round tables on 16 November focused on “Regional Perspectives for the Global Information Society” and on “Women in the Information Society: Building a Gender Balanced Knowledge-based Economy”.

===Putting ICT to Work for the Millennium Development Goals and the UN Development Agenda===
The 17 November round table examined how ICT can be applied to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, and discussed ways to raise awareness of ICT as an enabler of development.

===Achieving Better Quality and Cost Efficiency in Health Care and Education through ICT===
The 17 November panel demonstrated the potential of ICT to improve quality and cost efficiency of key public services, with specific focus on education and health care.

===Bridging the Digital Divide with Broadband Wireless Internet===
The 17 November round table focused on the critical role that broadband wireless infrastructure deployments play in bridging the digital divide.

==Outcomes from WSIS==

===GESCI===
One of the notable outcomes of the work of the UN ICT Task Force was the creation in 2003 of the [[Global_e-Schools_and_Communities_Initiative|Global E-Schools and Communities Initiative (GESCI)]], an international NGO initially located in [[Dublin]], Ireland, to improve education in schools and communities through the use of information and communication technologies.&lt;ref name="gesci"/&gt; GESCI was officially launched during the WSIS.

Today GESCI (www.gesci.org) is located in Nairobi, Kenya. It has evolved into an organization engaging with governments and ministries, development partners, the private sector and communities to provide strategic advice, coordinate policy dialogue, conduct research and develop and implement models of good practice for the widespread use and integration of ICTs in formal education and other learning environments, within the context of supporting the development of inclusive knowledge societies and the achievement of the SDGs.

===ePol-Net===
Another outcome is the Global ePolicy Resource Network (ePol-NET),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.epol-net.org/ |title=Global ePolicy Resource Network |access-date=2005-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105050237/http://www.epol-net.org/ |archive-date=2006-01-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to marshal global efforts in support of national e-strategies for development. The network provides ICT policymakers in developing countries with the depth and quality of information needed to develop effective national e-policies and e-strategies. The network was first proposed by the members of the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), who merged their activities with the UN ICT Task Force in 2002. The ePol-Net was also officially launched during the WSIS.

===Global Centre for ICT in Parliament===
Another outcome of the WSIS is the Global Centre for ICT in Parliament. Launched by the [[UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UNDESA) in cooperation with the Inter-parliamentary Union (IPU) on the occasion of the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis in November 2005, the Global Centre for Information and Communication Technologies in Parliament responds to the common desire to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society, where legislatures are empowered to better fulfill their constitutional functions through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament acts as a clearing house for information, research, innovation, technology and technical assistance, and promotes a structured dialogue among parliaments, centres of excellence, international organizations, the civil society, the private sector and the donor community, with the purpose to enhance the sharing of experiences, the identification of best practices and the implementation of appropriate solutions.

==Follow-up==
The task of bridging the digital divide is yet unfinished. The WSIS has called for an [[Internet Governance Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intgovforum.org Internet Governance Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for a global multi-stakeholder discussion of issues related to the governance of the global resource that the Internet represents. The WSIS also called for a follow-up and implementation process, for which the principles embodied in the multi-stakeholder composition and workings of the UN ICT TF can provide a useful model.

Work is also being carried on by the UN Group on the Information Society (UN GIS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ungis.org Group on the Information Society]&lt;/ref&gt; with a focus on the UN System, and the successor to the UN ICT TF, the [[Global Alliance for ICT and Development]] (GAID),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-gaid.org Global Alliance for ICT and Development]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208214357/http://www.un-gaid.org/ |date=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an international development emphasis.

'''Upward Communication''' is the process of [[information flow]]ing from the lower levels of a [[hierarchy]] to the upper levels.  This type of [[communication]] is becoming more popular in organizations as traditional forms of communication are becoming less popular. The more traditional organization types such as a hierarchy, places people into separate ranks.

Upward [[communication]] helps [[employees]] to express their [[requirements]], ideas, and feelings. For the top management, upward communication is an important source of information for [[Business &amp; Decision|business decisions]]. It helps in alerting top management about the requirement of changes in an organisations. Upward contribution is the core contributor of business process re-engineering in many organisations.

Upward communication is widely used as part of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] policy in many large organisations. Under whistle blowing policy, each employee is permitted to directly communicate with top management about matters requiring examination on vigilance angle. Hence it is used as a [[fraud prevention]] tool as well.

Upward communication keeps managers aware of how employees feel about their jobs, policies and procedures, and the business in general. It consists of methods like Feedback from employees, helps in bringing Mutual Trust and helps the organization to determine, implement or decide upon new policies. It keeps the organization updated or prone to upcoming challenges.

Upward communication is not free from disadvantages too. It suffers from problems like information can be changed during transmission, unwillingness to participate, fear of inefficiency, bypassing and flattery too. Sometimes top level executives discourage the upward flow of information and neglect the constructive suggestions and opinions about the work related issues of the organization. It is a time taking process and is comparatively slow too.

&lt;!--this article uses the BCE/CE formula--&gt;
The '''Victorious Youth''', also known as the '''''Getty Bronze''''' or '''''Atleta di Fano''''', is a [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek bronze sculpture]], made between 300 and 100 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;The consensus is that the sculpture could date anywhere from the late fourth through the second century BCE. [[Carbon-14]] dating does not further narrow the range.&lt;/ref&gt; in the collections of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Pacific Palisades, California]]. On its first rediscovery [[Bernard Ashmole]] and other scholars attributed it to [[Lysippos]], a grand name in the history of Greek art; modern concerns are less with such traditional attributions than with the original social context: where the sculpture was made, for what context and who he might be.

== Discovery ==
The sculpture was found in the summer of 1964 in the sea off [[Fano]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] of Italy, snagged in the nets of an Italian fishing trawler, the ''Ferri Ferruccio''.&lt;ref&gt;Other well-known underwater bronze finds have been retrieved, generally from [[shipwreck]] sites, in the Aegean and Mediterranean: the [[Antikythera mechanism]], the ''[[Antikythera Ephebe]]'' and the portrait head of a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] discovered by sponge-divers at Antikythera in 1900, the [[Mahdia shipwreck]] off the coast of Tunisia, 1907; the ''[[Marathon Boy]]'' off the coast of Marathon, 1925; the standing ''[[Poseidon of Cape Artemision]]'' found off Cape Artemision in northern Euboea, 1926; the ''horse'' and ''Rider'' found off Cape Artemision, 1928 and 1937; the [[Riace bronzes]], found in 1972; the [[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo]], near Brindisi, 1992; and the ''[[Apoxyomenos]]''  recovered from the sea off the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Lošinj]] in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeomedia.net/articolo.asp?strart=2471&amp;cat=Restauri%20e%20Recuperi "Archeologia in rete"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019144117/http://www.archeomedia.net/articolo.asp?strart=2471&amp;cat=Restauri%20e%20Recuperi |date=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After some furtive offering on the antiquities gray market and vigorous competition with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], it was acquired by the Getty Museum in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Though the Greek sculpture is unlikely ever to have touched Italian soil before its modern recovery,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Italian authorities have pressed for its return, as part of Italy's patrimony. In fact, the statue was found by an Italian fishing trawler in international water: the owner of the ship was Italian and the statue was under Italian legislation. But the Italian laws state that every archeological good in Italy belongs to the People and cannot be sold.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture may have been part of the crowd of sculptures of victorious athletes at Panhellenic Greek sanctuaries like [[Delphi]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of fibres from the core reveal that they are [[flax]]; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] noted in the second century CE that the only flax being grown in Greece was to be found around Olympia.&lt;/ref&gt; His right hand reaches to touch the winner's olive wreath on his head. The powerful head has led viewers to see it as a portrait; the head was cast separately from the lithe body. The athlete's eyes were once inlaid, probably with bone, and his nipples are in contrasting copper.

The precise location of the shipwreck, which preserved this object from being melted down like all but a tiny fraction of Greek bronzes, has not been established; it seems most likely that a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ship carrying looted objects was on its way to [[Italy]] when it foundered. The statue has been roughly broken off its former base, breaking away at the ankles.

The Italian government has made claims for the return of the sculpture, which the museum has rejected as unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1593772.ece Saga of the ‘stolen’ gold wreath could loosen British hold on Elgin marbles - Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies with Italy==

The [[Getty Museum]] is involved in a controversy regarding proper title to some of the artwork in its collection. The Museum's previous curator of [[antiquities]], [[Marion True]], was indicted in Italy in 2005 along with [[Robert E. Hecht]] on criminal charges relating to trafficking in stolen antiquities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] on December 18, 2006, True stated that she is being made to "carry the burden" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by the Getty's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-true29dec29,0,3427365.story?coll=la-home-headlines LATimes.com ~ "Getty lets her take fall, ex-curator says"]&lt;/ref&gt; True is currently under investigation by Greek authorities over the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath.

On November 20, 2006, the Director of the museum, [[Michael Brand]], announced that twenty-six disputed pieces were to be returned to [[Italy]], but not the ''Victorious Youth''.

In an interview to the Italian national newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' on December 20, 2006 the Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage declared that Italy would place the museum under a cultural embargo if all the 52 disputed pieces would not return home overseas. On August 1, 2007 an agreement was announced providing that the museum would return 40 pieces to Italy out of the 52 requested, among which the Venus of Morgantina, which was returned in 2010, but not the Victorious Youth, whose outcome will depend upon the results of the criminal proceedings pending in Italy. On the very same day the public prosecutor of Pesaro formally requested that the statue be confiscated as it was unlawfully exported out of Italy, giving rise to a dispute that came to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Giampiero Buonomo, [https://www.academia.edu/16759322/LA_RICHIESTA_DI_PUBBLICITA_DELL_UDIENZA_SULL_APPARTENENZA_DELL_ATLETA_DI_FANO_ {{lang|it|La richiesta di pubblicità dell’udienza sull’appartenenza dell’atleta di Fano}} Diritto penale e processo, 2015, n. 9, p. 1173].&lt;/ref&gt;
