'''Addison Bain''' is a retired [[NASA]] scientist&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/html/e3-menu.html (Expert Interview)&lt;/ref&gt; and founding member of the [[National Hydrogen Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogenassociation.org/advocate/ad82sbb.asp The Station That bain Built] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518150133/http://www.hydrogenassociation.org/advocate/ad82sbb.asp |date=2006-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is credited with postulating the '''[[Incendiary Paint Theory]]''' (IPT), which posits that the [[Hindenburg disaster]] was caused by the electrical ignition of lacquer- and metal-based paints used on the outer hull of the airship. Thus Bain believes that the hydrogen in the airship had no part to play in the initiation of the disaster. This theory, which was proposed in 1997 and recently updated in his 2004 book, ''The Freedom Element: Living with Hydrogen'', has been generally accepted by people interested in promoting hydrogen as a transportation fuel, and generally rejected by people involved with airships and their history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Bain attended [[Flathead High School]], received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in Space Technology from [[Florida Institute of Technology]] (FIT), his [[Master of Science]] in Systems Management from FIT, and his [[Ph.D.]] in Engineering Management from [[California Coast University|CCU]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/about/pab/bio-bain.htm Florida Solar Energy Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary refutation is based on the work of A. J. Dessler, D. E. Overs, and W. H. Appleby.&lt;ref&gt;http://spot.colorado.edu/~dziadeck/zf/LZ129fire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Their work, both theoretical and experimental, has concluded that even if the airship were covered with solid rocket fuel, as the Incendiary Paint Theory claims, it would still have taken 12 hours for the airship to burn had hydrogen not been present. It is worth noting that this refutation misses the point of the theory, which relates only to what started the fire, not how it continued.

The case for the Incendiary Paint Theory is explained in Bain's televised demonstration of the extreme flammability of a piece of the actual skin of the ''Hindenburg'' preserved from the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Secrets of the Dead:'' "What Happened to the Hindenburg?" 60 min., PBS Home Video, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Bain demonstrates the incendiary properties of the ''Hindenburg'' skin and then asks why the bits of skin ejected from the inferno continued to burn brightly on their way down instead of self-extinguishing once removed from the zone of densest hydrogen. This question of "self-extinguishing" is important, since his critics point out that the components of the doping compound used on the skin should put themselves out if removed from any fuel for fire, and should not have burned so quickly if the fire actually started with the skin instead of the hydrogen.

Critics also counter that Bain did not actually ignite the skin with a quick electrical charge but instead uses a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]] with ''continuous'' electrical charge, which required several strikes to ignite. Additionally, Bain was required to correctly position the fabric to allow it to ignite. Another part of the IPT hypothesizes that the mooring cables, which were designed to ground any static electricity on the surface of the airship, worked only partly in this instance; since some of the skin panels still carried an electric charge, at least one of them must have sparked, causing the initial outbreak of fire. Thus it has yet to be proven that an electrical charge could ignite the ''Hindenburg'' skin. The design of the ship would likely exclude the skin being an ignition point due to the properties of the doping process, the insulation from the frame and skin of the grounding drop-lines, and the inability of any experiment to ignite the skin via [[electric spark]] consistent with the conditions of the 1937 disaster.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' also dedicated [[MythBusters (2007 season)#Episode 70 – "Hindenburg Mystery, Crocodile Zig Zags"|the opening episode for their 2007 season]] to Bain's theory. Scale models of the ''Hindenburg'' were built and tested with skin reproductions. One model had no hydrogen while the other did. The only burn that replicated the ''Hindenburg'' burn used hydrogen.

'''Agnes Guppy-Volckman''' (1838–1917) was a British spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland. p. 75. {{ISBN|978-0786427703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

She was born Agnes Elisabeth White in [[Regent's Park]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Noakes, Richard John. (2004). ''Guppy [formerly Nicholl; other married name Guppy-Volckman], (Agnes) Elisabeth (1838–1917), medium''. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; She was known as Miss Agnes Nichol, later becoming the second wife of the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] Samuel Guppy in 1867. After the death of Guppy in 1875, she married William Volckman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (2011, reprint edition). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism, Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 63–95. {{ISBN|978-1-108-07258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guppy-Volckman was discovered by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1866 and managed to dupe him into believing she could communicate with spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1935-alfred-russel-wallace-and-the-medium.html "Alfred Russel Wallace And The Medium"]. James Randi Educational Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Volckman was associated with the fraudulent spirit photographer [[Frederick Hudson (photographer)|Frederick Hudson]].&lt;ref name="Pearsall 1972"&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall|Pearsall, Ronald]]. (1972). ''The Table-Rappers''. Book Club Associates. pp. 82–122. {{ISBN|978-0750936842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotten, Ross A. (2004). ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court: The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace''. Columbia University Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|978-0-231-13010-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2012). ''The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead''. Prometheus Books. pp. 301–302. {{ISBN|978-1-61614-585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was known for producing [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]] and [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]]. Researcher [[Ronald Pearsall]] described the fraudulent techniques that Guppy-Volckman used in her séances.&lt;ref name="Pearsall 1972"/&gt;

[[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] has written that she "was a clever charlatan; her stunts bear all the hallmarks of extravagant stage conjuring tricks."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, John. (2015). ''Spooky Science: Debunking the Pseudoscience of the Afterlife''. Sterling Publishing. p. 13. {{ISBN|978-1-4549-1654-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molly Whittington-Egan]] has written a biography of Guppy-Volckman.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington-Egan, Molly. (2015). ''Mrs Guppy Takes A Flight: A Scandal of Victorian Spiritualism''. Neil Wilson Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-906000-87-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged levitation==

On June 3rd, 1871 it was alleged that Volckman had [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitated]] out of her own house in [[Highbury]] three miles away to a séance room table in [[Lamb's Conduit Street]]. Although this incident was considered genuine by spiritualists such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[A. Campbell Holms]], it was dismissed by skeptics as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle|Doyle, Arthur Conan]]. (1930). ''The Edge of the Unknown''. New York, Putnam's. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847''. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. p. 144. McCabe described the case as a "piece of collusive trickery."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1942). ''Search for Truth: My Life for Psychical Research''. Collins. p. 246. Price suggests the séance sitters "were probably in the plot."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simeon Edmunds|Edmunds, Simeon]]. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''.

'''American-born Chinese''' or '''ABC''' ({{Zh|c=|s=美国出生华裔|t=美國出生華裔|p=Měiguó chūshēng huáyì}}) is a term widely used to refer to American citizens of Chinese descent, excluding first-generation immigrants. It is therefore a sub-category of the term [[Chinese American]], the latter of which also includes those who were born in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan but naturalized as U.S. citizens.

== Contested usage ==

According to some, the term has [[Perpetual Foreigner]] connotations. It has been noted that the term differs from existing patterns of immigrant designation in American English. For example, [[Peter Thiel]] is considered a "German-born American," and [[Elon Musk]] is considered a "South African-born American." In both of these cases, the first demographic word refers to the person's citizenship at birth, and the second refers to his citizenship at present. However, in the case of "American-born Chinese," the first demographic word refers to the subject's citizenship at birth (or at present) and the second to his (or her) race.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sar.network/read/abc-is-derogatory|title=Sino American Reunion (SAR)|last=|first=|date=|website=sar.network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been observed that, in practice, the term American-born Chinese includes hundreds of thousands of Americans of Chinese descent who were, technically speaking, not born in America, but rather, we brought over by their parents at a young age. This indicates that the term may be a [[misnomer]].

== Demographics == 
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
In differing degrees, many ABCs draw together Chinese family culture with American societal culture, developing a transnational life and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtCwzg6sIX0C|title=The Transnational History of a Chinese Family: Immigrant Letters, Family Business, and Reverse Migration|last=Liu|first=Haiming|date=|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780813535975|location=New Brunswick|pages=163-209|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this begins to shift in subsequent generations as families structures change through [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]]. In 2000, approximately 45% of American-born Chinese marry non-[[Chinese Americans]]; this is contrasted with [[Chinese Americans]] more generally, whereby 81.5% of men and 77.9% of women married other Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4D6uiswsnUC|title=Chinese America: Stereotype and Reality: History, Present, and Future of the Chinese Americans|last=Zinzius|first=Birgit|date=|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2005|isbn=9780820467443|location=New York|pages=217-218|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pop culture ==
The term has been used in the 2006 [[comic book]] by [[Gene Luen Yang]], entitled ''[[American Born Chinese]]''. It draws together the stories of three seemingly unrelated characters: Jin Wang, who moves into a new school and neighborhood to find he is the only [[Chinese American]]; the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] of the Chinese fable ''[[Journey to the West]]''; and Danny, who has yearly visits from his Chinese cousin Chin-Kee which ruins his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0Cw-UWd7mEC|title=American Born Chinese|last=Yang|first=Gene Luen|date=2006|publisher=First Second|year=|isbn=9781429969369|location=New York|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.miamioh.edu/aaa201/2015/05/american-born-chinese-4/|title=American Born Chinese|last=Beebe|first=Nathaniel|date=May 9, 2015|website=AAA 201: Introduction to Asian/Asian American Studies, Miami University|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Wilson was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] to a military family. Wilson's father, who passed away from a gunshot wound before Wilson was born, was [[African American]] and their mother is a [[Cherokee|Native American Cherokee]].&lt;ref name="lamont1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/21/angel-haze-interview-my-mum-knew-i-would-tell-everything|title=Angel Haze: 'My mum knew I was going to tell everything'|last=Lamont|first=Tom|date=February 22, 2014|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilson was a young child their mother met a preacher in the [[Apostolic Faith Church|Greater Apostolic Faith]] and she moved into his home with his wife and children, into what Wilson describes as a cult.&lt;ref name="lamont1"/&gt; Growing up in the church, Wilson witnessed [[domestic violence]] and manipulation at a very young age.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Sway's Universe|title=Angel Haze Elaborates on Her Experience in Cult Life and Performs "New York"|date=December 20, 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLxjBTzVqCg|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/her-relationship-with-religion|title=Who is Angel Haze?

You weren't allowed to talk to anyone outside of that, you weren't allowed to wear jewelry, listen to music, to eat certain things, to date people...you weren't allowed to do pretty much anything."&lt;ref name="macphersonguardian2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/31/rapper-angel-haze-religion-rape-survival|title=Rapper Angel Haze on religion, rape, and survival|last=Macpherson|first=Alex|date=January 31, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=June 13, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's family moved around a lot, mainly due to their mother running away from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/growing-up|title=Who is Angel Haze?Growing Up in Multiple Cities|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point Wilson's family was living in a shelter and Wilson was teased at school for it.&lt;ref name="complex2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/her-obsession-with-neurology-other-interests|title=Who is Angel Haze?Her Obsession With Neurology and Other Interests|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also mocked about their clothes at school and had difficulties making friends and connections due to moving around so often switched between [[Homeschooling|homeschool]] and [[State school|public school]] for many years and finished their high school education a year early.&lt;ref name="complex2"/&gt;

After a pastor threatened Wilson's mother, the family left the church and moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York when Wilson was 15 years old.&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/angel-hazes-no-nonsense-hip-hop-journey-20130808|title=Angel Haze's No-Nonsense Hip-Hop Journey|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pastor of their church told Wilson's family that God was going to kill them and Wilson's family lived in fear for years afterward.&lt;ref name="complex1"/&gt;

Wilson began writing as a form of therapy and expressed an interest in [[creative writing]], [[poetry]] and [[journalism]].&lt;ref name="complex3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/personality|title=Who is Angel Haze?Her Unique Personality|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's first poem was published at the age of 13 after winning a school competition.&lt;ref name="complex3"/&gt; As a child Roe took creative writing lessons and wanted to be a songwriter or [[gospel artist]].&lt;ref name="complex3"/&gt; Eventually, Wilson began making [[YouTube]] videos and [[Freestyle rap|freestyle rapping]] at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/taking-rap-seriously|title=Who is Angel Haze?Taking Rap Seriously|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson began distributing music on the Internet through sites like [[Tumblr|Tumblr,]] where a fan base began to form.&lt;ref name="lamont1"/&gt;

In 2012, Wilson recounted the experience of being sexually assaulted as a child in "Cleaning Out My Closet", a song from the mixtape ''Classick'' that uses segments from [[Eminem]]'s [[Cleanin' Out My Closet|song of the same name]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Artistry ==

=== Influences ===
After Wilson moved to New York and began listening to [[secular]] music, they became inspired by artists such as [[Eminem]], [[Kanye West]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Lil Wayne]].&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; "The artists that I identify [with] mostly are the ones who are so uncompromisingly themselves," Wilson said in a 2014 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview. "Like, 'fuck you. I don't care what you think about it. This is who I am. And I can either force-feed you this shit or you can take it as you will.'"&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"/&gt;

=== Public image ===
Wilson raps about themes such as [[homophobia]], [[rape culture]] and [[racism]]. Wilson uses their personal experiences to condemn a culture that breeds the self-harm of queer youth.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed1"/&gt; Wilson has also been open about their experience with [[mental illnesses]] such as [[addiction]], [[Ptsd|PTSD]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/09/17/angel-haze-back-to-the-woods-interview|title=How Angel Haze Turned Tragedy Into Triumph On Back To The Woods|work=The FADER|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their music and in interviews and social media.

Wilson sees their goal as an artist to reach out to people who are similar to them or going through difficult experiences.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed1"/&gt; Wilson has said, "It's not about the Bible. It's not about going to church. It's not about anything other than that we are all energies connected with a force that's greater than us. It's an energy that's omniscient, it covers the whole world and everybody here is created for a reason. Mine happens to be to make the music and inspire the people who are stuck in dark places."&lt;ref name="billboard1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7777007/angel-haze-resurrection-video-premiere-interview|title=Angel Haze's 'Resurrection' Video Premiere: The 'Spiritual' Rapper Talks Upcoming Album and Sampling John Mayer|work=Billboard|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' column, Wilson discussed [[cultural appropriation]] and white artists making hip hop. Wilson stated, "There seems to be this hypocrisy, because people want to appropriate black culture but only when it's cool or beneficial to them... And that's the reason that people don't have a right, to some extent, to use black music to their own gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/rzeekj/angel-haze-on-hip-hop-and-cultural-appropriation-2015|title=Angel Haze: "It Feels Like a Punch To The Gut When Someone Takes Our Culture and Runs With It"|date=January 20, 2015|work=Noisey|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wilson identifies as [[Pansexuality|pansexual]] and as [[agender]] and use the pronoun 'they' for themself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Osorio|title=Angel Haze: What This Up-And-Coming Female MC Says Will Make You Listen|url=http://thesource.com/2012/07/05/angelhazewhatthisup-and-comingfemalemcsayswillmakeyoulisten/|work=''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''|publisher=The NorthStar Group|location=New York City|date=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|first=Shannon|last=Keating|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/shannonkeating/the-evolution-of-angel-haze#.bcWn4ONAX|title=The Evolution Of Angel Haze|date=March 27, 2015|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|publisher=|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson has said "I'm glad there's an actual woman of color representing [[queer]]ness and pansexuality, someone who is like me in the spotlight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexandria|last=Symonds|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2014/02/04/emancipation-angel-haze|title=EXCLUSIVE: Angel Haze on questioning her family, her sexuality &amp; God|work=[[Out Magazine]]|publisher=[[Here Media]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=February 4, 2014|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wilson stated that, "Love is boundary-less. If you can make me feel, if you can make me laugh – and that's hard – then I can be with you. I don't care if you have a vagina or if you're a [[hermaphrodite]] or whatever."&lt;ref name="hermionehobytheguardian2012"/&gt; 

In 2014, they were in a relationship with model [[Ireland Baldwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cavan Sieczkowski, "Angel Haze On Relationship With Ireland Baldwin: ‘We F**k And Friends Don’t F**k’," [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/angel-haze-ireland-baldwin_n_5537001.html HuffPost], 27 June, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The two broke up a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Korn, "did angel haze and ireland baldwin just break up?," [https://nylon.com/articles/angel-haze-ireland-baldwin-break-up Nylon], 5 February, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Wilson noted in an interview with ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' that "I feel like my agenderness and my gender identity have evolved",&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; and a year later explained that "I sound like four people when I get written about as 'they'. It drives me crazy. If you call me 'him' or 'her' it doesn't matter to me. I don’t consider myself of any sex. I consider myself an experience."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Smyth|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/angel-haze-interview-at-home-i-m-dead-but-on-stage-i-m-god-a3157611.html|title=Angel Haze, interview: 'At home, I’m dead.

Wilson covered [[Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis|Macklemore's]] "[[Same Love]]" and opened up about their own struggles with family over sexuality in their own interpretation of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/angel-haze-on-dirty-gold-and-her-hippie-aspirations-20131118|title=Angel Haze Wants to Be a Hippie|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 ''Billboard'' interview Wilson stated, "When I was young . . . I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't understand that I could be attracted to men and women at the same time."&lt;ref name="billboard1"/&gt;

In 2015, Wilson began working on a body image project titled "The Naked Eye," which will incorporate nude photographs and interviews of people with [[body dysmorphia]].&lt;ref name="buzzfeed1"/&gt; The project is aimed at creating a conversation about conventional and mainstream beauty standards.

Wilson is self-taught in [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]] and celebrates their multiracial heritage.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed1"/&gt;

Versluis has published a "trilogy" on American Transcendentalism and the development of western esotericism, namely ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'' (1993), ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' (2001), and ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'' (2014). In these publications, he describes the development of American Transcendentalism and its influence on western esotericism, including the contemporary phenomenon of "immediatist gurus", who promise instant enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt;

In ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'', Versluis describes the influence of Asian religions on European Romanticism and on American Transcendentalism.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} In the early 19th century, these Asian religions were introduced to the western culture, and texts like the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]] had a great impact on the Transcendental movement, and influential members like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]].{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} But Transcendentalism was also influenced by [[western esotericism]], a topic which until recently received little attention in the academia.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|See also Elizabeth De Michelis (2005), ''A History of Modern Yoga'', for this neglected influence on the development of a global spirituality.}}

In ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' Versluis investigates the influence of western esotericism on the mid-19th [[American Renaissance]]. Versluis regards his ''The Esoteric Origins'' as a pioneering study in this discipline.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}

In ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'', Versluis describes the emergence of immediatist gurus: gurus who are not connected to any of the traditional religions, and promise instant enlightenment and liberation.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1,2}} These include [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Adi Da]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]].{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1}} "Immediatism" refers to "a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|"enlightenment"]]."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want "the fruit of religion, but not its obligations."&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt; Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} as far back as [[Platonism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}} and also includes [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=4}} Versluis points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as its key ancestor,{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} who "emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}}

===Christian Theosophy===
Another "trilogy" deals with [[Christian theosophy]], and includes ''Theosophia'' (1994), ''Wisdom’s Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition'' (1999), and ''Wisdom’s Book: The Sophia Anthology'' (2000).&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

==Journals and associations==
Versluis is an editor of the ''Journal for the Study of Radicalism'', and founding editor of ''Esoterica'', which started as a journal, and is now a biannual print book series, ''Studies in Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt; Versluis is also the founding president of the ''Association for the Study of Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

== Bio ==
Barbara was the first woman to graduate with in general engineering with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1946. Additionally, she was the one woman in NASA's engineering team that participated in our achievement to the arrival on the Moon. She conducted significant and important studies on flight dynamics, missile design, wind tunnels, performance analysis, and aerodynamics. Barbara was promoted to the position of chief engineer after only five years. Barbara's noteworthy contribution in the manned space flight programs began with the Apollo Lunar Landing program. In this program she supervised the design and evaluation of the entry monitoring systems for the missions. Barbara represented Rockwell International Space Division in technical meetings with NASA management and astronauts at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. In 1968, she was appointed the highest position ever achieved by a woman in her department: manager of the Apollo Program. In this position, Barbara oversaw the mission and evaluation requirements, as well as supervising over 100 engineers that worked on the Lunar landing mission and Skylab.

Throughout her exceptional career, she received several awards within the world of engineering. After graduating, Barbara worked for North American Aviation. This later became the Space Division of Rockwell International. In 1973, NASA's astronaut Fred Haise Jr. wrote Barbara a letter of commendation. She additionally received a medallion from NASA to commemorate her contribution to the Apollo 11 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloquetech.com/salas-figuras-ocultas-crawford/|title=Figuras ocultas: Barbara Crawford Johnson - BLOQUETECH|date=2018-10-16|work=BLOQUETECH|access-date=2018-11-29|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Biddenden Maids - geograph.org.uk - 220926.jpg|thumb|350px|Wrought iron sign erected in Biddenden in the 1920s|alt=Signpost with the name of Biddenden above a circle enclosing the cut-out and brightly painted figures of two conjoined women]]
'''Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst''' (or '''Chalkhurst'''), commonly known as the '''Biddenden Maids''', were a pair of [[conjoined twins]] supposedly born in [[Biddenden]], Kent, England, in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the '''Bread and Cheese Lands'''. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual [[:wikt:dole#Noun|dole]] of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775, the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard [[biscuit]]s imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.

Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names "Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst" were first used.

[[Edward Hasted]], the local historian of Kent,&lt;ref name="Hasted"&gt;{{citation|last=Hasted|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Hasted|year=1798|title=Parishes: Biddenden|journal=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent|publisher=British History Online|pages=130–141|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63400}}&lt;/ref&gt; has dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was "a vulgar tradition" invented to account for it, while influential historian [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.

In 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.

==Legend==
According to tradition Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=237–238}} or Chalkhurst,&lt;ref name=Alt&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/conjoined_twins.shtml |title=What are conjoined twins? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105070915/http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/conjoined_twins.shtml| archivedate= 5 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; were born to relatively wealthy parents in [[Biddenden]], Kent, in the year 1100.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=237–238}} The pair were said to be [[Conjoined twins|conjoined]] at both the shoulder and the hip.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q Folk Lore"&gt;{{citation|last="Cheverells"|date=22 November 1856|title=Folk Lore|journal=Notes and Queries|publisher=Chappell &amp; Co|location=London|pages=404–405}}&lt;/ref&gt; They grew up conjoined, and are said to have "had frequent quarrels, which sometimes terminated in blows".{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}} At the age of 34, Mary Chulkhurst died suddenly. Doctors proposed to separate the still-living Eliza from her sister's body but she refused, saying "as we came together we will also go together", and died six hours afterwards.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} In their wills, the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around {{convert|20|acre|0}} in total to the local church,{{sfn|Jerrold|1914|p=218}} with the income from these lands (claimed to have been 6 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] per annum at the time of their death) to provide an annual dole of bread, cheese and beer to the poor every Easter.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} Henceforward, the lands were to be known as the Bread and Cheese Lands.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}}

==History==
[[File:Biddenden Church - geograph.org.uk - 221914.jpg|right|thumb|Biddenden church|alt=Stone church surrounded by graves]]
The churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that "on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and [[:wikt:diverse|divers]] barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn" was suspended on account of a visit from [[Charles Fotherby]], the [[List of Archdeacons of Canterbury|Archdeacon of Canterbury]], owing to previous ceremonies having caused "much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} In 1645, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] William Horner&lt;!-- Don't link this unless you write an article on the man; the 'other' William Horner, inventor of the Horner scheme, is unrelated to this one --&gt; claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were [[glebe]] (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the [[Committee for Plundered Ministers]], who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} Horner brought the case before the [[Court of the Exchequer]] in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}}&lt;ref name="Hasted" /&gt; Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women "who grew together in their bodies", but do not give any name for the women.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=258}}

In 1681 the "disorder and indecency" of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}} The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church; it was moved to the church porch.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=238–239}}{{refn|The [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] claims that Biddenden church at one time featured a [[stained glass]] window depicting the Biddenham Maids, citing a purported poem found in "old charity documents" as evidence, which supposedly read ''The moon on the east side oriel shone&amp;nbsp;/ Through slender shafts of shapely stone&amp;nbsp;/ The silver light, so pale and faint&amp;nbsp;/ Shewed the twin sisters and many a saint&amp;nbsp;/ Whose images on the glass were dyed&amp;nbsp;/ Mysterious maidens side by side&amp;nbsp;/ The moon beam kissed the holy pane&amp;nbsp;/ And threw on the pavement a mystic stain''.&lt;ref name="Imaging of the Biddenden Maids"&gt;{{citation|url=http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-imaging-biddenden-maids.html |title=Imaging of the Biddenden Maids |publisher=Pitt Rivers Museum |accessdate=13 October 2010 |location=Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227214628/http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-imaging-biddenden-maids.html |archivedate=27 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in fact an extract from [[Walter Scott]]'s 1805 ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'', describing [[Melrose Abbey]]; the line given as "Shewed the twin sisters and many a saint" reads ''Show'd many a prophet and many a saint'' in the original.{{sfn|Scott|1855|p=24}}|group=note}}

By 1770, it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21|1770|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=239}}&lt;ref group="note" name="CPI note"&gt;[[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|UK CPI]] inflation numbers based on data available from [http://www.measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/ Measuring Worth: UK CPI]. The rural Kent economy in this period was based on [[tenant farmer|tenant farming]] and involved significant amounts of barter and [[in kind|payment in kind]]. Consumer pricing does not translate accurately into modern equivalents; {{CURRENTYEAR}} equivalent prices should be treated as a very rough guide only.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time as well as the dole of bread, cheese and beer, hard bread rolls known as "Biddenden cakes", moulded into an image of the sisters, were thrown to crowds from the church roof.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}}{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}} The Biddenden cakes were flat, hard and made of flour and water,{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}} and were described as "not by any means tempting";{{sfn|Sharpe|1846|p=413}} one writer in 1860 described one as "a biscuit plaque".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=December 1860|title=Leicester Agricultural and Archæological Society|journal=The Ecclesiologist|publisher=Cambridge Camden Society|location=Cambridge|volume=27|issue=66|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the Biddenden Maids legend===
[[File:BiddendenMaidsCake2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The earliest surviving depiction of Biddenden cakes, 1775. The figures are shown as conjoined, but the names, ages and 1100 date are not shown.|alt=Two rectangular cakes, one showing two women apparently conjoined at the shoulder and the other one damaged in such a way that it is not clearly apparent whether the women are conjoined. Each cake has the word "Biddenden" written above the women.]]
Although it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656,&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biddenden.gov.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Biddenden Parish Council |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anonymous article in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}}{{refn|It has been claimed that an account of the Maids was published in 1660, but this is believed to be a later addition which was pasted into the 1660 book.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}}|group=note}} This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=241–242}} The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the "Maids of Biddenden".{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}} The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}} As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a [[Street literature|broadside]] published in 1790.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=242}} ''[[The Antiquarian Repertory]]'' of 1775 says that the sisters had lived "as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=245}} Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.

Historian [[Edward Hasted]], in the third volume of ''The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'' published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been "given by persons unknown").&lt;ref name="Hasted" /&gt;{{refn|No family named Preston is recorded as having lived in or near Biddenden during the period in question. Records exist of a family named Chulkhurst living in Biddenden in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}}|group=note}} Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent "two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction".&lt;ref name="Hasted" /&gt; While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s&lt;!-- Hasted says 20s, not 30s; don't "correct" this even though other sources give an age of 34 --&gt; and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as "a vulgar tradition".&lt;ref name="Hasted" /&gt;{{refn|Hasted was an expert on genealogy and topography but knew little about folklore and local tradition, and later critics have often been sceptical regarding his accuracy, especially regarding social and biographical history.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=242}}{{sfn|Jerrold|1914|p=219}} His contemporary (and Member of Parliament for nearby [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]]) [[Samuel Egerton Brydges]] described him as "a little, mean-looking man, with a long face and a high nose; quick in his movements, and sharp in his manner: he had no imagination or sentiment; nor any extraordinary quality of the mind, except memory."{{sfn|Timbs|1834|p=96}}|group=note}}

Hasted's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]],{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}} and the story was generally treated as a folk myth.{{refn|Although later writers have stated that Chambers accepted Hasted's arguments and dismissed the legend of the conjoined twins out of hand,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=257}} unlike Hasted, Chambers accepted that the legend was potentially true.{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}} He concluded that in the absence of any evidence for the sisters having existed, on the balance of probabilities the figures on the Biddenden cake were more likely to represent "the general objects of a charitable benefaction" and that the story of the twins was likely to be a folk myth created to explain the unusual design of the cakes.{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}}|group=note}} A letter to the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Heaton|first=J.

As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter,&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q Folk Lore" /&gt; the first recorded mention of the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst",{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}}

{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;A Short but Concise account of Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst
who were born joined together by the Hips and Shoulders
In the year of our Lord 1100 at Biddenden in the County of Kent, commonly called
'''The Biddenden Maids'''
The reader will observe by the plate of them, that they lived together in the above state Thirty-four years, at the expiration of which time one of them was taken ill and in a short time died; the surviving one was advised to be separated from the body of her deceased Sister by dissection, but she absolutely refused the separation by saying these words—"As we came together we will also go together,"—and in the space of about Six Hours after her Sister's decease she was taken ill and died also.
By their will they bequeath to the Churchwardens of the Parish of Biddenden and their successors Churchwardens for ever, certain Pieces or Parcels of Land in the Parish of Biddenden, containing Twenty Acres more or less, which now let at 40 Guineas per annum. There are usually made, in commemoration of these wonderful Phenomena of Nature, about 1000 Rolls with their Impression printed on them, and given away to all strangers on Easter Sunday after Divine Service in the Afternoon; also about 500 Quartern Loaves and Cheese in proportion, to all the poor Inhabitants of the said Parish.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q Folk Lore" /&gt;{{refn|A quartern loaf used a quarter of a [[stone (Imperial mass)|stone]] (3½&amp;nbsp;lb; 1.6&amp;nbsp;kg) of flour.&lt;ref name="Hasted" /&gt;|group=note}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In the 1820s, a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector's pew in Biddenden church was the sisters' burial place.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}}{{refn|One source claims that the sisters were taken to the monks at [[Battle Abbey]] and that they were buried in Hastings, but there is no evidence for this.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} (No grave is visible near the rector's pew, but the church organ is situated in the site described and it may cover the grave.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=239}}).|group=note}} In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, "attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity".{{sfn|Hone|1830|p=445}} The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the [[workhouse]], but the crowds continued to cause problems.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=240}} In 1882 Biddenden's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=240}}

In 1900, [[antiquarian]] [[George Clinch]] investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=219}} Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553–1558), a date roughly consistent with the "two hundred and fifty years ago" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=244}}{{refn|The point about the style of dress depicted on the cakes being that of the 16th, not the 12th, century had previously been made by an anonymous contributor to ''Notes and Queries'' in 1856.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q Folk Lore" /&gt;|group=note}} He suggested that the "1100" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read "1500",{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=245}} and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=244}} It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=219}} Writing in the early 1930s, [[William Coles Finch]] explains the confusion over the dates, saying "the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be [[unleavened bread]].{{sfn|Coles Finch|1933|p=92}}

In almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a [[Viability (fetal)|viable]] double fusion has ever been documented.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=246}}

Although Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=250}} This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of [[Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo]] (1617&amp;nbsp;– after&amp;nbsp;1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}}

In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a [[teratology|teratological]] perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been [[pygopagus]] (twins joined at the pelvis).{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}} Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=247}} The pygopagus [[Millie and Christine McCoy]] had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=248}}{{refn|Millie and Christine McCoy, born into slavery in [[Columbus County, North Carolina]] in 1851, lived into their 60s and enjoyed a successful musical career under the stage name of "The Two Headed Nightingale". They were particular favourites of Queen Victoria, who met with them each time they toured England. They retired wealthy in 1900, dying of tuberculosis in 1912.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=248–249}}|group=note}}

[[Jan Bondeson]] (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition,{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}} the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=259}} Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]], the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] and the [[Annals of Clonmacnoise]] of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=221}} He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=249–50}} and agreed with Ballantyne's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=257}} He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the 18th century to fabricate the story.

In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated with other local charities with similar purposes, to form the Biddenden Consolidated Charity,&lt;ref name="Imaging of the Biddenden Maids" /&gt; still functioning as a registered charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209504|Biddenden Consolidated Charity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing,{{refn|The Bread and Cheese Lands are today occupied by housing, known as the Chulkhurst Estate,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}}|group=note}} expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}} (During the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]] of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=An Old Kent Charity |section=News in Brief |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=11 April 1950 |page_number=3 |issue=51662 |column=D |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/590/488/91068812w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS52251275&amp;dyn=4!xrn_5_0_CS52251275&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=wes_ttda }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Cheese Charity Resumed |section=News in Brief |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=27 March 1951 |page_number=2 |issue=51959 |column=C |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/590/488/91068812w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS34819195&amp;dyn=4!xrn_6_0_CS34819195&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=wes_ttda }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;) A [[wrought iron]] [[village sign]] showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}}

The tradition of the dole continues to the present, and every [[Easter Monday]] tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of Biddenden's former workhouse.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=237}} All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors.&lt;ref name="Imaging of the Biddenden Maids" /&gt; The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs;{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out.&lt;ref name="Imaging of the Biddenden Maids" /&gt; Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}}

'''William Royce '''"'''Boz'''"''' Scaggs''' (born June 8, 1944) is an [[United States|American]] [[singing|singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[guitarist]].&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; He is most well-known for his worldwide chart topping albums of the late 1970's and [[hit single]]s including "[[Lido Shuffle]]" and the Grammy award winning "[[Lowdown (Boz Scaggs song)|Lowdown]]" from the critically acclaimed album ''[[Silk Degrees]]'' (1976), which peaked at No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Scaggs continues to write, record music, and tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bozscaggs.com |title=Boz Scaggs Official Website &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Bozscaggs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Scaggs was born in [[Canton, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; the eldest child of a traveling salesman. Their family moved to [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], then to [[Plano, Texas]] (at that time a farm town), just north of Dallas. He attended a Dallas private school, [[St. Mark's School of Texas]], where schoolmate Mal Buckner gave him the nickname "Bosley", later shortened to "Boz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bozscaggs.org/bozography.htm |title=Boz Scaggs Biography by Ben Fong-Torres |publisher=BozScaggs.org |date=1974-03-10 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning guitar at the age of 12, Scaggs met [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] at St. Mark's School. In 1959, he became the vocalist for Miller's band, the Marksmen. The pair later attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] together, playing in [[blues]] bands like [[the Ardells]] and the Fabulous Knight Trains.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt;

Leaving school, Scaggs briefly joined the burgeoning [[rhythm and blues]] scene in London, then traveled on to Sweden as a solo performer, and in 1965 recorded his solo debut album, ''[[Boz (album)|Boz]]'', which failed commercially.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; He also had a brief stint with the band the Other Side with [[Mac MacLeod]] and [[Jack Downing (musician)|Jack Downing]].

Returning to the U.S., Scaggs promptly headed for the booming [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic music]] center of [[San Francisco]] in 1967. Linking up with Steve Miller again, he appeared on the [[Steve Miller Band]]'s first two albums, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]'' and ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'' in 1968. Scaggs secured a solo contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1968, releasing his second album, ''[[Boz Scaggs (album)|Boz Scaggs]]'', featuring the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] and [[session guitarist]] [[Duane Allman]], in 1969. Despite good reviews, this release achieved only moderate sales. He then briefly hooked up with Bay Area band [[Mother Earth (American band)|Mother Earth]] in a supporting role on their second album ''[[Make a Joyful Noise]]'' on guitar and backup vocals. Scaggs then signed with [[Columbia Records]]; his first four albums for Columbia all charted, with his best peaking at No. 81.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt;

==1976–1981: the hit years==

In 1976, using [[session musician]]s who later formed [[Toto (band)|Toto]], he recorded ''[[Silk Degrees]]''.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; The album reached #2 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and #1 in a number of other countries, spawning four hit [[single (music)|singles]]: "It's Over", "[[Lowdown (Boz Scaggs song)|Lowdown]]", "What Can I Say", and "[[Lido Shuffle]]",&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; as well as the poignant ballad "[[We're All Alone]]", later recorded by [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Frankie Valli]]. "Lowdown" sold over one million copies in the US&lt;ref name=roberts2006/&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song]], which was shared by Scaggs and [[David Paich]].

A sellout world tour followed, but his follow-up album in 1977 ''[[Down Two Then Left]]'' did not sell as well as ''Silk Degrees'' and neither of its singles reached the Top 40.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; The 1980 album ''[[Middle Man (album)|Middle Man]]'' spawned two top 20 hits, "Breakdown Dead Ahead" and "Jojo"; and Scaggs enjoyed two more hits in 1980-81: "[[Look What You've Done to Me]]", from ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' soundtrack, and "[[Miss Sun]]", from a [[greatest hits]] set. Both were US No. 14 hits.

==Later career==
Scaggs took a long break from recording and his next album, ''[[Other Roads]]'', did not appear until 1988. "[[Heart of Mine (Boz Scaggs song)|Heart of Mine]]", from ''Other Roads'', is Scaggs' last top-40 hit as of 2018.&lt;ref name=strong2000/&gt; Also in 1988, he opened the San Francisco [[nightclub]] ''[[Slim's]]'', and remained an owner of the venue as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Barmann |url=http://www.grubstreet.com/2011/06/boz_scaggs_loves_bar_tartine_a.html |title=Boz Scaggs Loves Bar Tartine, and Eats Many a Loaf of Acme Bread |publisher=Grub Street |date= |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 1992, Scaggs joined [[Donald Fagen]], [[Phoebe Snow (musician)|Phoebe Snow]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] and others in [[The New York Rock and Soul Revue]]. His next solo release was the album ''[[Some Change]]'' in 1994. He issued ''[[Come On Home (album)|Come On Home]]'', an album of [[rhythm and blues]], and ''[[My Time: A Boz Scaggs Anthology]]'', an anthology, in 1997.

He garnered good reviews with ''[[Dig (Boz Scaggs album)|Dig]]'' although the CD was released on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} In May 2003, Scaggs released ''[[But Beautiful (Boz Scaggs album)|But Beautiful]]'', a collection of [[jazz standard]]s that debuted at number one on the jazz chart. In 2008 he released ''Speak Low'', which he described in the liner notes as "a sort of progressive, experimental effort ... along the lines of some of the ideas that Gil Evans explored." During 2004, he released a [[DVD]] and a live 16-track CD ''[[Greatest Hits Live (Boz Scaggs album)|Greatest Hits Live]]'' that was recorded August 2003 at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco.

After a break in recording, he undertook a series of shows across the US in 2008. Two years later he joined [[Donald Fagen]] and [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] for concerts entitled the [[Dukes of September Rhythm Revue]]. Scaggs's next album ''[[Memphis (Boz Scaggs album)|Memphis]]'' was released in March 2013. It was recorded in that Southern American city at the [[Royal Studios]]. The album included some of his favorite compositions from other artists. A tour of the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]] followed the release. Before the year ended, he added live dates across North America and Australia for 2014. In 2015, he released ''A Fool to Care'', a compilation of mostly covers, including "Whispering Pines" with Lucinda Williams, and one original blues composition, "Hell to Pay," performed with [[Bonnie Raitt]]. The album rose to number one on the ''Billboard'' Blues Album chart and number 54 on the Billboard 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-fool-to-care-mw0002824086/awards |title=A Fool to Care - Boz Scaggs &amp;#124; Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2015-03-31 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and family==

&lt;!--[[Image:Cipitio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cipitio is the most popular character of Salvadoran mythology.]]--&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is a legendary character found in [[El Salvador|salvadoran]] folklore revolving around the [[Siguanaba]] and [[Cadejo]] legends.  He is generally portrayed as an  8- to 10-year-old boy with a big conical wizard hat.  His name is taken from the [[Nahuatl]] word for child: "Cipit" or "Cipote". Some also relate his name to the deity [[Xipe Totec]].

According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La [[Siguanaba]], and "Lucero de la mañana" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair.  When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god [[Teotl]]. Ziguet and ''Cipitio'' were cursed and condemned by [[Teotl]].  Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents.  Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that '''Cipitio''' has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is represented as liking to eat ashes,&lt;ref&gt;Kephart.&lt;/ref&gt; throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies,&lt;ref&gt;Cordova 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and likes to eat a variety of [[banana]] called "Guineo Majoncho". He could also "[[Teleportation|Teleport]]" anywhere he wants.

A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book ''Cuentos de Cipotes'' by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador [[Salarrué]].

In a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons. Each episode features the problems that Salvadoran children find in their communities, families and schools, Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

'''Darkman''' is a [[title character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the 1990 superhero film ''[[Darkman]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Darkman II: The Return of Durant]]'' and ''[[Darkman III: Die Darkman Die]]''. The character originated in a short story written by the film's director, [[Sam Raimi]], titled "The Darkman," and is based on the [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Universal Monsters|movie monsters]] while retaining traits of the DC Comics World War II disfigured hero [[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|the Unknown Soldier]]. He was portrayed by [[Liam Neeson]] in the original film and [[Arnold Vosloo]] in the sequels.

== Fictional character biography ==
In the third film and the un-aired [[television pilot]], his biography is slightly [[retcon]]ned, but the character's canonical history is as such: Peyton Westlake was a mild-mannered and brilliant scientist working on a synthetic "skin" capable of aiding burn victims. He had a good relationship with district attorney Julie Hastings, who indirectly caused his injuries by telling corrupt developer Louis Strack, Jr. that he could not build his "city of the future" without a permission document from Westlake's laboratory. At this, Strack hired sadistic mobster [[Robert G. Durant]] to get the document and in the process, Durant and his gang brutally disfigured Westlake, killed his assistant and destroyed his lab.

Julie believed he was dead and a funeral was held, but Westlake's hideous body was placed in a clinic that was used for various experiments to sever Westlake's [[pain receptors]], which enhances his strength but leaves him unable to feel tactile sensations. The experiments, however, affected Westlake's mental stability and he became an impulsive, bipolar, sarcastic, and violent man. Westlake escaped the clinic and sought refuge in an abandoned building in the film's city. He hid his grotesque appearance with bandages and a [[trenchcoat]] and used his synthetic skin, which only lasts 99 minutes in the light. He managed to rebuild a relationship with Julie, claiming he survived his "accident" and was constantly fleeing so that she does not see his true face. As "Darkman", he begins ruining Durant's illegal activities by framing his gang so Durant kills his own men, including his possible implied lover. After discovering the culprit is Darkman, Durant attempts to kill him from a helicopter using a grenade launcher. Darkman manages to defeat his archenemy by clinging to the helicopter and using his strength to pull it into a tunnel and explode the chopper. Darkman gratifyingly yells "Burn in Hell!".

After this, Darkman poses as Durant in order to infiltrate Strack's new skyscraper, which was the reason the developer hired Durant in the first place. Strack suspects Darkman will come after him and takes Julie hostage. Strack suggests they join forces but when he refuses the battle atop the skyscraper. Darkman has the chance to spare his life but instead throws Strack to his death. Believing he has become too much of a monster to be with Julie, that he abandons her, vowing to become a [[vigilante]] and bringer of [[justice]].

After a year of crimefighting, Darkman is shocked to discover that Durant is alive and back in town and that he must again battle his archenemy. He also wishes to avenge a scientist named Brinkman, who he had been partnering with in order to perfect his synthetic skin so he may lead a normal life. After defeating Durant, Darkman found a new enemy in drug lord Peter Rooker who proved to be his most powerful adversary after going through a process that makes his strength equal to Darkman's. Darkman managed to bring down Rooker by posing as him but felt conflicted as he fell in love with Rooker's wife and children, who he had to abandon as well to resume his life as a vigilante. Beforehand, however, he finally manages to perfect his synthetic skin but uses the only sample to heal Rooker's daughter.

== Powers and abilities ==
Due to clinical experiments, the [[nerve ending]]s connected to Darkman's skin have been severed, [[Congenital insensitivity to pain|rendering him immune to pain]], but unable to feel [[physical sensations]]. Additionally, to compensate for his loss of physical feelings, adrenaline flows unchecked through Darkman's body, enhancing his physical strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability.

Using his synthetic skin, Darkman is able to pose as criminals, imitate their voices, and trick them into engineering their own downfall. He's also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert in the fields of science with a genius-level intellect.

== Personality ==
Darkman possesses similar ethics to those of a [[superhero]], such as not harming the innocent, but has the tenacity and impulsiveness of a psychopath, as demonstrated when he revels in the suffering of criminals. He also has a dangerous temper, as seen in ''Darkman'' when he (disguised as his former self) breaks the fingers of an obnoxious carnival worker for refusing to give Julie Hastings the prized elephant. When Julie refuses the prize, he remarks, furiously, '''''"Take''''' the fucking elephant!" When a cat hisses at him, he is enraged and argues with the cat, and accuses it of thinking he is a "freak of nature." Despite his temper and preference for violence, Darkman also has a morbid sense of humor in sticky situations. For example, Darkman breaks into a business meeting while attached to Durant's chopper. He remarks to the businessman, "Excuse me!" before being pulled off again, and when Strack begs for mercy, stating murder will haunt his conscience. Darkman, after only some hesitation, drops him to his death and remarks, "I'm learning to live with a ''lot'' of things."

It advocates on behalf of Black and Latino people with AIDS and their families and works for prevention of HIV and AIDS.  In 1998, Levy helped pass  [http://www.gobroomecounty.com/files/hd/hiv/pdfs/HIVReportingAndPartnerNotification.pdf HIV Reporting and Partner Notification]. It was the most controversial HIV legislation in New York State history . The legislation changed the way New York State tracked new HIV and AIDS cases i.e. [[Partner notification|Partner Notification]].  Prior to the legislation, the federal government's [http://kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/the-ryan-white-program/ Ryan White Program] allocated money based on the proportion of patients with AIDS in each region. The highest number of AIDS cases was in New York City among white gay men. Consequently, the white gay population received the most money. The new legislation changed this allocation to give more funding to people who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection. A majority of people with  HIV diagnoses were black and Latino heterosexuals.  Assemblywoman [[Nettie Mayersohn]] sponsored a Bill that required people infected with HIV to notify their sexual partners.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/opinion/partner-notification-for-hiv.html|title=Partner Notification for H.I.V.|date=9 June 1998|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Black and Latino AIDS Coalition' was the only AIDS organization in New York State to support Assemblywoman Mayersohn's bill.

Blac NY was modeled after the national direct action advocacy group [[ACT UP]] and received financial assistance and technical help from '[[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC).

The effort ultimately resulted in  over 30 national HIV/AIDS organizations and leaders joining forces in an urgent call for the development and implementation of a comprehensive National AIDS Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blackpoliticsontheweb.com/2008/08/26/aids-crisis-in-communities-of-color-prompts-demand-for-national-plan-to-fight-hivaids/ |title=AIDS crisis in communities of color prompts demand for national plan to fight HIV/AIDS |publisher=Black Politics on the Web |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 13, 2010 the White House released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/white-house-announces-national-hivaids-strategy |title=White House Announces National HIV/AIDS Strategy |website=Whitehouse.gov |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ambitious plan is the nation's first-ever comprehensive coordinated HIV/AIDS roadmap with clear and measurable targets.

For his AIDS, Levy began a regimen that included an [[antiviral therapy]], but the therapy's side effects included disorientation and nausea and caused pain throughout his body. Nothing he tried reduced the side effects. A friend suggested Levy try smoking marijuana. Levy began smoking marijuana on a regular basis and it helped him with his side effects from AIDS medicines - as well as eliminated the incredible headaches he used to get. He discovered many people used marijuana for similar reasons. There is evidence that medical marijuana works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Mike |url=http://www.hightimes.com/read/study-medical-marijuana-works-92-percent-patients |title=Study: Medical Marijuana Works for 92 Percent of Patients |publisher=High Times |date=2014-10-03 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy decided to become an advocate for legal medical marijuana and he founded 'New York State Committee to Legalize Marijuana'.

==Later years==
Dennis Levy and Rick Levy founded the 'New York State Committee To Legalize Marijuana'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivelinks.com/nysctlm.html |title=New York Committee To Legalize Marijuana |website=Positivelinks.com |date=2015-05-02 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Levy became President and Rick Levy was Vice President of Social Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivelinks.com/ |title=Positivelinks |website=Positivelinks.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Levy is the only HIV positive African American President of a legalized marijuana organization in New York State. Levy's daughter Deniece Kinash is the mixed race coordinator. Today, Dennis Levy is one of the most out spoken leaders of the 'New Marijuana Movement'. White people and black people used marijuana in the same amounts. But "Blacks are arrested for marijuana possession at a two and a half times greater rate than whites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norml.org/news/2000/11/02/new-study-reveals-blacks-arrested-for-marijuana-at-more-than-twice-the-rate-for-whites |title=New Study Reveals Blacks Arrested For Marijuana At More Than Twice The Rate For Whites |website=Norml.org |date=2000-11-02 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy says "Marijuana prohibition policy does more harm to our communities than good." Levy has worked with International social and political activist [[Dana Beal]] in advocating for legalization of marijuana. [[Dana Beal]] is an Honorary member of the 'Committee'. Levy is also a member of the [[Green Party of New York]]. Levy ran for the New York State Assembly Seat of convicted speaker [[Sheldon Silver]] in the April 19, 2016 special election (Silver's conviction was overturned by The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan on July 13, 2017[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/nyregion/sheldon-silvers-conviction-is-overturned.html]). Dennis Levy was the Green Party candidate.

In the election, hand picked Democratic candidate [https://nypost.com/2016/04/20/alice-cancel-wins-sheldon-silvers-state-assembly-seat/ Alice Cancel] faced Republican Lester Chang, Green Party candidate Dennis Levy and Working Families Party candidate Yuh-Line Niou, who had out raised Cancel overwhelmingly and was seen as a candidate who could make the race close. In surprisingly closely watched race, Cancel ultimately won the election with 41% of the vote, besting Niou by 1,034 votes, with Chang and Levy together taking 23%.

He served in the [[United States Air Force]] in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Downs, =David|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2014/11/11/why-you-can-thank-a-gay-hippie-vietnam-veteran-for-legal-medical-and-recreational-marijuana-today|title=Why you can thank a gay, hippie Vietnam veteran for legal medical and recreational marijuana today|website=SFGate|date=November 11, 2014|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he moved to the [[Castro District, San Francisco]], where he became an active [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] and organized smoke-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2012/11/15/marijuana-legalization-seeds-planted-long-ago-finally-flower/|title=Marijuana Legalization: Seeds Planted Long Ago Finally Flower|website=SFGate|author=Oscar Pascual|access-date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/dennis-peron-cause-death-marijuana-activist-dies-71-2646402 Dennis Peron Cause of Death: Marijuana Activist Dies At 71], ibtimes.com; accessed May 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported gay activist [[Harvey Milk]], a former Long Island resident,&lt;ref name="FL"/&gt; who won an elected seat on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt;

Peron sold [[cannabis]] from storefronts in the Castro and advocated for [[medical cannabis]], as he saw how patients with AIDS benefited from it. His partner, Jonathan West, whom he met in San Francisco, died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt; In 1991, Peron organized for the passage of San Francisco's Proposition P, a resolution calling on the state government to permit medical cannabis, which received 79% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-01/news/mn-4581_1_dennis-peron|title=Force Behind Proposition 215 Says His Push Began as 'Legacy of Love'|author=Evans, Mark|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 1, 1996|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he co-founded the [[San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club]], the first public cannabis dispensary. His businesses were [[Police raid|raided]] by authorities in 1978 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roberts, Chris|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/news-marijuana-cannabis-sean-parker-auma-dennis-peron-prop-215-medical-marijuana-adult-use-of-marijuana-act/Content?oid=4434974|title=The Cannabis Legalizers Opposing Legalization|publisher=Archives.sfweekly.com|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Peron and [[Brownie Mary]] jointly released a cookbook with recipes for [[cannabis edible]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/us/brownie-mary-fights-to-legalize-marijuana.html|title=Brownie Mary' Fights to Legalize Marijuana|first=Carey|last=Goldberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=July 6, 1996|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Peron coauthored [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|California Proposition 215]], which sought to allow the use of medical cannabis.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; [[Dan Lungren]], the [[Attorney General of California]], ordered a police raid of Peron's club a month before the election, arresting Peron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-12/news/mn-53188_1_cannabis-buyers-club|title=Cannabis Buyers' Club Founder Arrested|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 15, 1997|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 215 was passed soon thereafter, which allowed the club to reopen. Later in 1996, the [[Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis Party]] of Minnesota fielded Peron as their nominee, their first, in the [[United States presidential election, 1996|U.S. presidential election]]. Peron received 5,400 votes.&lt;ref name="BallotAccessNews1996presidentialvotes"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bickford, Bob|author2=Ballot Access News|title=1996 Presidential Votes by State|date=October 7, 1998|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/1996/allvotes96.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Peron ran in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primary for [[California]] governor against Lungren, who won the primary and lost the election to [[Gray Davis]].&lt;ref name=ebar&gt;{{cite web|author=Staver, Sari|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=72343|title=SF honors Peron for medical cannabis work|publisher=Ebar.com|date=February 16, 2017|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peron voiced support for [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization of all marijuana use]], believing that it is [[Medicine|medicinal]]. He opposed medical marijuana use for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Marijuana Policy in the United States|url=https://www.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/wordpress/2012/05/medical-marijuana-policy-in-the-united-states|publisher=Huntington's Outreach Project for Education, at Stanford|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peron opposed [[California Proposition 19 (2010)|California Proposition 19]] in 2010, which would have legalized recreational cannabis, because he did not believe that recreational use exists, as all people who use marijuana are using it medicinally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://missionlocal.org/2010/09/local-marijuana-advocate-says-no-on-prop-19|title=Local Marijuana Advocate Says No on Prop. 19|publisher=MissionLocal|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|California Proposition 64]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-proposition-64-recreational-pot-opponents-20161004-snap-story.html|title=The push to legalize pot for all has deeply divided the medical marijuana community|author=McGreevy, Patrick|website=Latimes.com|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Devlet Hatun was the twelfth&lt;ref name="Daulat"/&gt; and last wife of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Bayezid I]] and the mother of Bayezid's successor, [[Mehmed I]]. Her name in her ''vakfîyya'' is registered as '''Daulât bint-i Abd'Allah.''' This implies that the mother of Mehmed I was of non-Turkish origin.&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt; Although the sign at her tomb (see image in next section) says that ''Devlet'' was the daughter of a Germiyanid (i.e. Turkic) prince, she was ethnically of non-Turkish origin.&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt; Since both ''Devlet Hâtun,'' and  [[Devletşah Hatun|''Devlet-Şâh Hâtun'']] died in 1414, she is frequently confused with ''Devlet-Şâh Hâtun,'' the daughter of [[Süleyman of Germiyan]].&lt;ref name="Daulat Shah"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020616202944/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey2.htm The Imperial House of Osman - 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Devlet Hatun died on 23 January 1414&lt;ref name="Daulat"/&gt; and was buried at the Devlet Hatun Tomb (Türbesi) in [[Bursa]]. 

===Burial place===
[[File:Devlet Hatun Türbesi - Bursa (1).jpg|thumb|Inscription at the entrance of "Devlet [[Hatun|Hātûn]] [[Türbe]]" states that she was a [[Germiyanid]] and her mother was a granddaughter of [[Mawlana Rumi]]. "Devlet Hātûn Türbe" had been constructed by Mehmed I in memory of his mother,&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt; Devlet Hātûn. According to the inscription she died on 1412. She is frequently being confused with [[Devletşah Hatun]].&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt;]]
The tomb of Devlet Hatun stands alone in Bursa neighbourhoods separate from the mosque complexes that contained the tombs of the sultans and other members of the dynasty, following two royal mothers, [[Nilüfer Hatun]] and [[Gülçiçek Hatun]]. It is well tended by the Bursa neighborhood in which it is situated and functions as a local pilgrimage site. The sign outside her tomb gives the following details:
{{verse translation|lang=tr

|It was built by Sultan Mehmed I. Devlet Hatun was the wife of Sultan Bayezid I and the mother of Sultan Mehmed I. She was the daughter of a [[Germiyanid]] prince.&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt;{{efn|According to [[:tr:İsmail Hakkı Uzunçarşılı|İ. H. Uzunçarşılı]] in ''Osmanlı Tarihi;'' İ. H.

Devlet Hatun died in 1412.&lt;ref name="Sakaoglu2008"/&gt;}}

'''Dinah Elizabeth, Lady Pearce''' ({{nee|Sowter}}; 1836–1918) was the daughter of Robert Sowter of Gravesend. She married [[Sir William Pearce, 1st Baronet|William Pearce]], who had at an early age shown himself to be an outstanding ship builder and by 28 was manager of Messrs Robert Napier and Sons. They set up home in [[Govan]] and occupied John Elder's villa for many years which was demolished to make for the Princes Dock. From there they moved to [[Wemyss Bay]] further down the west coast of Scotland. 

As the wife of a successful man she was required to entertain on a regular basis but she did not allow her privileged position to stop her becoming involved in the lives of ordinary Govan people. She believed until her death that [[working people]] had been let down by the government. Her husband became MP for Govan in 1885 and became a [[Pearce baronets|baronet]] two years later. Sir William was at the peak of his career and had by then become owner of [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield Shipyard Company]] which was by then a world leader. She is particularly remembered for her involvement in helping to set up the well-known project 'Fresh-Air-Fortnight' which afforded the opportunity for sick children to have a holiday usually at the seaside but also in the country in order to help their recovery. She was on the school board of Govan Parish from 1873 and during that time argued for female representation on school boards. It was said of Lady Pearce, "Any community was well off where there was a 'Good Angel' in the district, with a liberal heart and a readiness to help forward the best interest of the people and the district".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She had a strong, enduring friendship with [[Margaret Macgregor]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|last=Ewan|first=Elizabeth L.|last2=Innes|first2=Sue|last3=Reynolds|first3=Sian|last4=Pipes|first4=Rose|date=2006-03-08|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748626601|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employed Margaret as the lady superintendent of the [[Fairfield Works Mission]], whose headquarters were in Harmony Row. Lady Pearce became more deeply involved in religion through her friendship with Margaret.  Like Margaret, she was non-sectarian in her approach to her philanthropy and made contributions to all the churches. After Margaret's death, Lady Pearce had a church erected in Margaret's memory, the [[Margaret Macgregor Memorial Church]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Death of Lady Pearce – Govan's Lady Bountiful – A Discerning Philanthropist|last=|first=|date=10 May 1918|work=Govan Press|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Lady Pearce built the [[Pearce Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scotcities.com/cathcart/pearceinstitute_sketch.jpg|title=Sketch of Pearce Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=Scotcities|publisher=|access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearceinstitute.org.uk|title=Home - Pearce Institute|website=Pearce Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a gift to the people of Govan.  It is a beautiful A-listed building containing a public hall, library and other rooms.  She was a generous supporter of the Govan Press fund and was concerned about the wellbeing of soldiers, disabled children and anyone suffering hardship.  To the end she continued to have an interest in the work of the Pearce institute.

She is also known for leaving an endowment in her will to support St Johns College, Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, C.E. (1932) The University of Durham 1832-1932. (London: The Sheldon Press) pp.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; 

She died at the age of 82 in 1918 at St Brandon's Wimbledon, where she had lived for many years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Edward John''' (born July 8, 1949) is a prominent [[First Nations]] political leader in Canada. The son of Louis and Amelia John, he was born in the [[Dakelh|Carrier]] village of Tache, along the north shore of [[Stuart Lake]], about 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Fort St. James, British Columbia]]. He holds the name 'Ukailch'oh (Carrier Linguistic Committee spelling, often spelled ''Akile Ch'oh'') in the Lusilyoo clan. He has three grown children from his first marriage to Susan John: Martin, Damian, and Shendah, and two grandchildren, Aiden and Kieran. He is currently married to former [[Musqueam]] chief [[Wendy Grant-John]].

He attended [[Lejac Residential School]], [[Prince George College]], and [[Notre Dame University College]] in [[Nelson, B.C.]] before receiving a B.A. in sociology (with distinction) from the [[University of Victoria]] in 1974 and an LL.B. from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1979. He practiced law as a solo practitioner in Prince George, British Columbia from 1981 to 1993. In 2004 he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Northern British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unbc.ca/releases/2004/03_18honorary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

John served as an elected Councillor of [[Tl'azt'en Nation]] from 1974 to 1990 and as elected Chief from 1990 to 1992. From 1984 to 1988 he was Chief of the [[Carrier-Sekani Tribal Council]]. From 1992 until 1999 he was Chief Treaty Negotiator for the Carrier-Sekani Tribal Council, a position he resumed in 2006. He is also chairman of the board of Tanizul Timber and Teeslee Forest Products, companies owned by Tl'azt'en Nation. For his service to Tl'azt'en Nation he was awarded the title of Grand Chief of Tl'azt'en Nation.

A fluent speaker of [[Carrier language|Carrier]] and one of the few people considered eloquent public speakers in Carrier, John was the founding President of the [[Yinka Dene Language Institute]]. He was also involved in establishing the [[University of Northern British Columbia]]. He played a prominent role in the Interior University Society, the regional organization whose pressure led to the creation of UNBC, and subsequently served on the Implementation Council and the Interim Governing Council, the predecessor to the Board of Governors.

John was the First Nations representative to the [[First Ministers Conference]] on aboriginal constitutional rights from 1983 to 1987. In 1991, along with the late [[Squamish people|Squamish]] Chief [[Joe Matthias]], he helped to create the [[First Nations Summit]], the organization representing the British Columbia First Nations involved in treaty negotiations with Canada and British Columbia. This group produced the tripartite Task Force Report that led to the current [[British Columbia Treaty Process]].

In June 2016 John was elected to his eleventh term, extending to June 2019, on the Task Group (political executive) of the [[First Nations Summit]], of which he has been a member almost continuously since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://fns.bc.ca/about/executive-staff&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2000 he was appointed to the provincial cabinet as [[Minister of Children and Family Development (British Columbia)|Minister for Children and Families]], serving until the change of government in June 2001. In the election of May 16, 2001 he ran unsuccessfully as the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] candidate for [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the [[Prince George-Omineca]] riding.

John also plays a prominent role at the national level in the [[Assembly of First Nations]]. In October 2005 he represented the AFN at the Second Indigenous Peoples' Summit of the Americas in [[Buenos Aires]]. In January 2011 he began a three-year term as the North American Representative to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccabcconference2010.ca/speakers/grand-chief-edward-john-akile-choh |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823014449/http://nccabcconference2010.ca/speakers/grand-chief-edward-john-akile-choh |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he became Chair in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/05/07/grand-chief-edward-john-elected-chair-of-united-nations-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues-by-acclamation-111795&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to a second three-year term effective January 2014&lt;ref&gt;http://nationtalk.ca/story/national-chief-atleo-congratulates-grand-chief-edward-john-on-re-appointment-to-the-united-nations-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues/&lt;/ref&gt; and served until the end of his membership in the Forum in January 2017.

[[Image:AllenAndThurberPepperbox.jpg|thumb|300px|6 shot .36 caliber percussion pepper-box by Allen &amp; Thurber (Worcester). Barrel flute bears 1837 patent date, hammer is marked "Allen's Patent".]]
'''Ethan Allen''' (September 2, 1808 – January 7, 1871) was a major American [[arms maker]] from [[Massachusetts]]. He is unrelated to the revolutionary [[Ethan Allen]]. His first firearm, the "[[Pocket Rifle]]" was developed in 1836, and his first patent was granted in 1837.

==Early life==
Allen began his career as a cutlery maker in [[Milford, Massachusetts]] in 1831. He gained the knowledge of metalworking and manufacturing processes by producing knives and shoemaking tools before moving his business to [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]].&lt;ref name="Flayderman2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flayderman|first=Norm|title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3lvxNuiMuEC&amp;pg=PA51|date=3 December 2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2422-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on a [[cane gun]] for a doctor, Allen came up with the idea for an underhammer pocket rifle and designed it in 1836. The following year he applied for a patent for a "tube hammer" pocket pistol and went into business with his brother-in-law, [[Charles Thurber (inventor)|Charles Thurber]]. Ethan proved to be a true family man, investing and partnering with a nephew in a New York sporting goods retailer, hiring another brother-in-law Thomas Wheelock who was eventually made a partner, and similarly hiring and later making partner his two sons-in-law Sullivan Forehand and Henry Wadsworth. The latter two continued the business under their own names after Allen's death in 1871.

==Trade names==
[[File:Ethan Allen Six-shooter, 3,5-inch barrel, Rosewood stock.jpg|thumb|Ethan Allen Six-shooter advertisement]]
: 1831–1837: E. Allen (Grafton)
: 1837–1842: Allen &amp; Thurber (Grafton)
: 1842–1847: Allen &amp; Thurber (Norwich)
: 1847–1854: Allen &amp; Thurber (Worcester)
: 1854–1856: Allen Thurber &amp; Co (Worcester)
: 1856–1865: Allen &amp; Wheelock (Worcester)
: 1865–1871: E. Allen &amp; Company (Worcester)

In 1843 the company relocated to [[Norwich, Connecticut]]. In addition to armsmaking, they built prototypes of Thurber's [[typewriter]] designed for the blind, disabled and those “nervous” about writing by hand. Though patented, the typewriter was never manufactured for commercial sale.

In 1847, the company moved to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts, and in 1854 Wheelock became an equal partner with the firm's name changing to Allen Thurber &amp; Co. In 1856, following Thurber's death, the company reorganized as Allen &amp; Wheelock. After the death of Wheelock in 1865, Allen's 2 sons-in-law, Sullivan Forehand and H. C. Wadsworth, began working for him and the company changed names to Allen &amp; Company. Upon Allen's death in 1871 the two operated the company under their own names: [[Forehand &amp; Wadsworth]], until Forehand reorganized the company in 1890 as the Forehand Arms Company after Wadsworth's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collections of the Worcester Society of Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA322|year=1899|publisher=The Society|location=Worcester, Ma|pages=322–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethan Allen's companies made a vast variety of firearms. Most recognized are the Allen &amp; Thurber [[Pepper-box]] revolving pistol—known as the "Gun that won the East". This pistol was actually much more common that the early Patterson Arms revolvers made by Colt. Few records survive, so much is derived from the physical weapons still in existence and by extrapolating from advertisements, patent dates, etc.

==Single-and double-shot percussion pistols==

'''Pocket Rifle'''&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=Paul|title=Ethan Allen and Allen &amp; Wheelock: Their Guns and Their Legacy|year=2006|publisher=Andrew Mobray, Inc.|location=Woonsocket, Rhode Island|isbn=1-931464-23-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

Allen's first firearm was the Pocket Rifle, a single-shot under-hammer percussion pistol. The name likely derives from the fact that most pistols of the day did not have rifled barrels, rather than any claim to extraordinary size. The hammer located on the bottom of the weapon allowed for target sights to be mounted on the top axis of the barrel. Made in .28 to .44 caliber, average barrel length was 12 inches. Typically sold in pairs, the pocket rifle was produced during 1837–1847. Though most of this period was during the Thurber partnership, markings show exclusively 'Ethan Allen', and evidence from an accounting ledger indicate that supply and distribution orders processed separately from other models of firearms. This likely indicates that Allen retained ownership of this model after establishing the partnership with Thurber. A second pocket rifle was produced under the Allen and Thurber name retaining the under-hammer design, but with much smoother lines. The pictures the author has seen show a barrel much shorter than 12 inches, and the caption reads .36 caliber.

'''Tube Hammer Pistol'''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

A single-shot percussion pocket pistol with the hammer in the more usual top position for contemporary pistols. The spectacular innovation was the 'double action' which allowed firing simply be pulling the trigger. Most firearms of the day and for decades thereafter were 'single action', requiring the user to manually cock the firearm prior to pulling the trigger. The barrel had a smooth bore with no rifling. With no sights, this was a close range personal defense weapon used with a 'point and shoot' method rather than careful aiming. This model also introduced a screw barrel, allowing for easy disassembly and cleaning. Judging solely from patent dates, production of this pistol began around 1837 and continued beyond 1844 when a patent reissue was granted.

'''Model 9 Bar Hammer Pistol'''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

The tube hammer was followed shortly by the Bar Hammer single-shot percussion pistol. Produced in a wide variety of calibers and barrel lengths, the Model 9 introduced a bar-shaped hammer on the top of the barrel which would be less likely to catch on clothing when drawn from a coat pocket. Barrel length was typically 2-6 inches with a smooth bore, while the most common calibers were .30-.36. Retaining the double action, single shot, screw barrel design of the tube-hammer, the Model 9 was a success and was produced well into the Allen and Wheelock era. Though made possibly as early as 1837–1838, the bar hammer was eventually marked with an 1845 patent date.

An entire volume could be written about the variations of the Allen and Thurber iconic pepperbox 'revolving pistols'. Often referred to as 'the gun that won the east', the Allen and Thurber pepperbox was a favorite of '49'ers' and other early immigrants to the western United States. Mark Twain famously quipped that these pistols often discharged more than one barrel when fired, and were not much of a danger to the target, but were dangerous to the shooter.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Holding several patents, Allen and Thurber pepperboxes were the most popular multi-shot pistols of the 1830s and 1840s, slowly losing market share in the 1850s to Colt's 1849 Pocket and 1851 Navy revolvers. The later pepperbox revolvers were produced well into Allen and Wheelock era. With the shortage of pistols in the [[American Civil War]], many soldiers on both sides carried an Allen &amp; Thurber pepperbox as a back-up arm. Harley Van Cleve and his son Phillip collected and categorized 22 distinct models/variations of the Allen pepperbox, and were an invaluable early 20th century resource for these interesting pistols. Patent dates of 1837 and 1845 help to demarcate sub-models to a limited extent, but many improvements were incorporated on the fly to reduce manufacturing costs and/or create a more reliable product. The 1845 patent represents several simplifications to the design that likely achieved both of these aims. Pepperbox production did not survive the end of the Allen and Wheelock era (c 1864). Due to the number produced, smaller pepperbox pistols are common on the secondary market in a wide spectrum of condition. The Dragoon model noted below is quite rare, and commands a premium even in scruffy condition. Please see the cited work for extensive descriptions, illustrations, and a wide variety of photographs.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} 

'''6-Barrel PepperBox Pistols'''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

Only six-barrel pepperbox pistols were produced during the Grafton and Norwich periods (1837–1847), and all had smooth barrel external contours until the later Worchester and Allen and Wheelock period, when fluted barrels became the norm. Six-barrel pepperboxes usually had a standard trigger, but some examples have a ring trigger. Most were double-action with the iconic 'bar hammer', but some were single-action with standard hammers. While simplifying shooting (no manual cocking of the hammer), the bar hammer did preclude the inclusion of usable sights. However, this early example of a double-action pistol must have been quite a selling point. As these were considered 'point and shoot' short range defensive weapons or 'belly guns', the market did not seem to object to the limitation of not having sights. Barrel length varied between three and six inches. There were four frame sizes, accommodating various calibers. Most common were .32 and .34 caliber, though the .28 and .30 caliber 'pocket size' have been reported. The 'Dragoon' model was the king, typically sporting six-inch barrels and .36 caliber. Except for early models and later Allen and Wheelock era production, most have beautiful engraving on the frame. 


'''5-Barrel PepperBox Pistols'''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

It was during the Worchester period that the five-shot pepperbox was introduced. Percussion nipples were integrated to the barrels. It would have been expensive to make the machining, but likely reduced production cost significantly. Made with a bar hammer and standard trigger, models have been encountered with or without an integral nipple shield. .32 Was the most common caliber. The five barrel is relatively rare compared to the six barrel models

'''4-Barrel PepperBox Pistols'''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

The four-shot pepperbox was introduced during the Allen and Wheelock era, highlighting that the pepperbox was still an important design through the end of the 1850s. A patent dated 1857 shows that the four-shot barrel assembly attached to the frame in a different manner than the six and five-shot pepperboxes. Standard caliber was .34. All of the pictures this author has seen do not show a nipple shield.

==Percussion revolvers==

'''''Bar-Hammer Percussion Revolver'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} [[File:Allen_and_Wheelock_Bar_Hammer_Revolvers.jpg|thumb|right|Allen and Wheelock Bar Hammer Percussion Revolvers Medium and Large Frame Models]]

The bar-hammer revolver is an interested type. It is uncertain when production began or ended. The 1845 patent on the bar-hammer is the same as on the pepperbox and some single shot pistol models. It is likely some number of years after 1845 before this type was produced. A patent for (oddly enough) Rollin White was issued in 1858 that pictured a modified Allen bar-hammer revolver. This would seem to indicate that production started no later than 1856–1857. However, it is possible that production started several years earlier. Production almost certainly ended before the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864). This is based on no more than the logic of simplifying production. In 1861, it is possible that Allen produced the bar-hammer, side-hammer, and center-hammer percussion revolvers as well as the rimfire and lipfire cartridge revolvers simultaneously! Because demand from the Civil War was consuming just about any arm produced, it would have made sense to cease production of the less advanced models. The lineage of the pepperbox is clear in the cylinder design, grip design, standard-style trigger, and patented bar hammer double-action design. This may represent simple design evolution, as the double action pepperbox 'pocket pistols' were very popular in the market. Allen may have been counting on visual and functional design similarity to help sell these revolvers. The design may also be very thoughtful in regards to avoiding patent issues. By incorporating his unchallenged 1845 patent for the bar-hammer double-action mechanism, Allen may have wished to avoid any patent infringement problems from Colt for his own revolving mechanism IF the revolver was produced before the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. Considering all of the evidence that Allen was a thoughtful and frugal businessman, it may simply demonstrate that using common parts was less expensive than designing new ones. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard, though ivory could be had for an extra cost. The Allen bar-hammer is actually quite advanced in that pulling the trigger advances the cylinder, cocks the hammer and drops the hammer, firing the weapon. The cylinder can be removed for cleaning with the removal of cylinder pin. A separate rammer would be needed for loading. It is likely that the cylinder would be removed for loading, so reloading under duress is not practical. The author finds these revolvers aesthetically pleasing and very practical for a pocket pistol. This style was manufactured and sold in three different sizes.

'''Large Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver''' 

The large frame is a five-shot, .34 caliber revolver. The barrel is 3.5-4 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'belt-size' side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.

'''Mid-Size Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver'''

The mid-sized frame is a five-shot, .32 caliber revolver. The barrel is approximately 3 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'belt-size' side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.

'''Small Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver'''
The small frame is a five-shot, .28 caliber revolver, though some .30 caliber models are known. The barrel is 2.5 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'pocket-size' side-hammer percussion revolver. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.

'''''Side-Hammer Percussion Revolver'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} [[File:Allen_and_Wheelock_Side_Hammer_Revolvers.jpg|thumb|right|Allen and Wheelock Side Hammer Percussion Revolvers Navy and Belt Models]]

The author has found the side-hammer models to be the most interesting of all of the Allen revolvers. Allen's design was clearly influenced by Colt's 1855 'Root' revolver, adopting the top strap above the cylinder for strength, rigidity and thus accuracy, and the side-hammer rather than the center hammer more usual on the Colt models 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1851. Another 'borrowed' feature was that the cylinder pin unscrewed from the rear, which the author finds far superior to the various methods of removing to the fore of the pistol. Though influenced by this near contemporary, Allen attempted to build the 'better mousetrap' by incorporating several unique and patented design features. One change was to retain standard trigger used in the bar-hammer revolvers rather than Root's spur trigger. The most interesting new feature is the combination trigger guard / loading lever. Unlike Colts, Remingtons, and other percussion revolvers that aligned a lever to load the cylinders under the barrel, Allen designed his revolvers to incorporate the trigger guard for this function. A catch is tripped, and the trigger guard and attached arm swing down to push a rammer into the bottom cylinder, thus seating the ball fully into the chamber. This reduced the number of parts, and likely cost of manufacture. This patented, unique feature carried on into the later center-hammer percussion models. There were four distinct cylinders, varying in the machining. All models are single action. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard. Ivory or silver grips could be had for an additional cost. Though manufactured in much smaller numbers than the Colts, Remingtons, Starr and other revolvers of the Civil War, Allen and Wheelock revolvers are clearly visible in many pictures of the era. The dates of manufacture are uncertain, possibly beginning as early as the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. This is supported by a patent granted to Allen in January 1857 covering the loading lever as described. As frugal as Allen was, it is unlikely that production would have ended prior to the consumption of all parts, even though the new center-hammer percussion were also being produced. It is unlikely that production survived the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864)

'''Navy Model Side-hammer Revolver'''

The Navy model is a six-shot, .36 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The Navy model used the first and fourth cylinder type, which is {{frac|1|7|8}} inches long. Barrels were available in six and eight inch lengths. Although there are many small variations, there are no essential design changes. There are no known government contracts, though the Army Ordnance Department did purchase 338 on the open market.

'''Belt Model Side-hammer Revolver'''

The Belt model is a five-shot, .32 caliber weapon. As the patent shows a five-shot pistol, it is likely that the belt model was the first produced. There are some examples in .31 and .34 caliber. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. Standard barrel lengths included 4, 5, 6 and {{frac|7|1|2}} inch. The Belt model used the second, third and fourth cylinder type, which was {{frac|1|11|16}} inches long. Three different model variations are generally accepted.

'''Pocket Model Side-hammer Revolver''' 

The Pocket model is a five-shot, .28 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The pocket model only used the fourth cylinder type, which was 1 9/16 inches long. Standard barrel length is four inches. Three different model variations are generally accepted by collectors.

'''''Center-Hammer Percussion Revolver'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} [[File:Allen_and_Wheelock_Center_Hammer_Revolvers.jpg|thumb|right|Allen and Wheelock Center Hammer Percussion Revolvers Army, Navy, and Providence Police Models]]

The center-hammer percussion models bear a striking resemblance to the larger lipfire revolvers. All were single action. Ethan Allen showed much evidence of being astute and frugal, and the design likely evolved as a way to share between a percussion series and the new lipfire weapons. Why would Allen make percussion arms at all when the more advanced cartridge revolvers were available? The oft-referenced patent lawsuit may have caused Allen to 'hedge his bets' in case he lost, and would have to cease production of cartridge revolvers (as happened in 1863). It may be that cartridge firearms were a new and uncertain technology. A conservative market, as epitomized by the US Army Ordnance Department, were buying the established technology percussion weapons by the thousand. Even Smith and Wesson failed to obtain a government contract during the war for their cartridge revolvers. In any event, the center-hammer percussion revolvers were likely seen as a replacement for the side-hammer and possibly bar-hammer revolvers in production. As with many Allen arms, the start date of manufacture is uncertain. With patent dates including 1857, 1858, 1860, and 1861, many have posed that this revolver was not made until after the settlement of the patent lawsuit in 1863. However, records indicate that the US Ordnance Department purchase about 200 from a Boston merchant in December 1861. Perhaps 1860 or early 1861 is accurate. Advertised and marketed to the military, the center-hammer was designed to be stronger and more rugged than the side-hammer revolver. In addition to the stronger frame, the cylinder pin access was moved to the front of the cylinder. The center-hammer revolvers retained the innovative combination trigger guard/loading lever of the side-hammer models.

'''Army Model Revolver''' 

The Army Model is a six-shot, .44 caliber percussion weapon with a standard {{frac|7|1|2}} inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. Finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen's life. Approximately 750 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridge. A fine 'custom' nickel Army with extensive engraving by Gustav and hand-carved ivory grips is thought to have been the personal weapon of Ethan Allen. This model is pretty beefy, larger and heavier than the contemporary Colt Model 1860 Army.

'''Navy Model Revolver''' 

The Navy Model is a six-shot, .36 caliber percussion weapon with a standard 5, 6 or {{frac|7|1|2}} inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. Detail design of variations would seem to indicated that the Navy followed the Army by some margin of time. Finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen's life. Approximately 500 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridge.

'''Providence Police Model Revolver''' 

This model is an anomaly which has bedeviled collectors for years. It is unmarked, but has some distinctive design features patented by Allen. It is a five-shot .36 caliber weapon with samples including 3, 4 and 5 inch barrels. It is a bit of a throwback, without a loading lever and sporting a spur trigger. Known examples had a blue finish and wood grips. There are records indicating purchase by the Providence Rhode Island police department, hence the name commonly attributed to this model. It is possible that this was a specific contract, and the model was never marketed to the public. This may indicate production very late into the E Allen and Company era shortly before Allen's death. His sons-in-law Forehand and Wadsworth may have deemed an obsolescent percussion pistol unworthy of bringing into the inventory of the company now sporting their names, and discontinued the model after that initial run.

==Cartridge pistols==

Like many other arms makers, Ethan Allen saw the bored-through cylinder allowing for rear loading of self-contained metallic cartridges as the wave of the future. Unfortunately, the patent holder Rollin White, had sold exclusive rights to this innovation to Smith and Wesson, preventing other companies from making firearms leveraging the bored through cylinder. This legal constraint proved no barrier to Ethan Allen, who made two different rimfire revolvers that hit the market possibly as early as 1857—simultaneous to the Smith and Wesson model 1. As a holder of many patents, it is unlikely that Ethan Allen was ignorant of patent law—he simply chose to ignore it. Perhaps, he reckoned that he could outlast the upstart Smith and Wesson in legal maneuvering. He soon invented the 'lipfire' cartridge, a modified rimfire that only held the priming compound in approximately 1/8th of the circumference of the base of the cartridge. This made the cartridge base much stronger, as early rimfire cartridges had a tendency to split at the base, causing extraction malfunction. It was also more economical, as only 1/8th of the expensive fulminate was required. Ethan Allen then invented manufacturing equipment for metallic cartridges that far exceeded the competition in quality and efficiency. Allen was awarded a patent for the lipfire cartridge. Production of lipfire revolvers likely began around 1859. With the coming of the Civil War, Allen likely smelled immense profits for his 'better mousetrap'. However, the conservative procurement agents of the US Government awarded only small contracts—likely not trusting the technology or the supply of cartridges. By 1863, Rollin White finally won his patent infringement lawsuit, and production of all Allen and Wheelock cartridge revolvers ceased.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

'''''Rimfire Revolvers'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} [[File:Allen_and_Wheelock_Rimfire_Revolvers.jpg|thumb|right|Allen and Wheelock Pocket Rimfire Side Hammer Revolvers in .32 and .22 caliber rimfire]]

'''22 Caliber Rimfire Revolver'''

This is the first cartridge revolver made by Allen and Wheelock, and one of the first cartridge revolvers from any manufacturer (competing with the Smith and Wesson model 1). It is a single-action seven-shot revolver in .22 Rimfire (black powder equivalent of the modern .22 Short). It features the side-hammer of the early percussion revolvers and a spur trigger. Empty cases were removed by removing the cylinder, and using the cylinder pin to push the case out of the cylinder. There are many variations typically organized into six models, though all share the size and critical design features. Most were made with a 3-inch barrel. The first through fourth models have engraved cylinders, with crossed rifles, a horse and rider, military articles, an Indian with bow and a sailing ship. Allen obtained a patent granted in 1858, and it is likely that production began in 1857. Production continued until 1863, when production of all cartridge revolvers was halted by the lawsuit described previously. Production resumed upon expiry of the Rollin White patent in 1869, though likely from parts manufactured in the earlier period. After Allen's death in 1871, production continued for some period under the new company name Forehand and Wadsworth.

'''32 Caliber Rimfire Revolver''' 

Following the introduction of the 22 Rimfire, Allen and Wheelock introduced the larger .32 Caliber Rimfire. Stronger to accommodate the more powerful cartridge, the .32 caliber followed the design cues of the .22 in being a single-action, spur trigger revolver. The cylinder accommodated six cartridges, and barrels could be had in either three, four, or five inch lengths. Engraving on the cylinder was a country scenes with dogs chasing a rabbit. There are three 'models' with detail improvements, though the basic design remained unchanged. Cylinder, and consequently frame, length grew from .905 inch to .940 inch to 1.2 inches. Production likely began in 1858, and ceased in 1863 per the patent suit described above. Production, or at least assembly, resumed presumably at the expiration of the Rollin White patent as a catalog from 1871 offers them at $9.25. A patent was granted 1860 to reduce drag on the recoil shield applied to this revolver as well as the lipfire revolvers. A later patent with a simplified action was granted in 1861. With the solid frame design, these revolvers were far stronger than the contemporary Smith and Wesson Model 2. In fact, the author would challenge that the design is much more sophisticated than the contemporary Smith &amp; Wesson. Though it cannot be confirmed, it likely beat the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 2 to market.

'''''Lipfire Revolvers'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} [[File:Allen_and_Wheelock_Lipfire_Revolvers.jpg|thumb|right|Allen and Wheelock Lipfire Revolvers Army and Navy Models]]

Ethan Allen was granted a patent in September 1861 for his .44 caliber lipfire revolver. As this is more than a year since his patent on the lipfire cartridge, it is possible that lipfire revolvers were produced in late 1860 or early 1861. As many incomplete revolvers and parts would have been in existence at the time of the 'cease and desist' court order from the patent infringement in 1863, this inventory was kept and these revolvers were reintroduced when the White patent expired in 1869 until the parts stocks were depleted. All of the Allen and Wheelock lipfire revolvers were single-action. Many of the lipfire weapons were converted to rimfire with the simple machining/removal of just a small amount on the rear face of the cylinder as supplies of the ill-fated lipfire cartridge dwindled. While it is not known for certain, some of these conversions may have occurred at the factory, especially for those assembled in or after 1869. Others were converted by any number of gunsmiths around the country. It should be noted that the Army model was the first 'large bore' (more than .40 caliber) cartridge revolver, and remained so until the Remington cartridge conversions of the model 1858 appeared in 1868—soon followed by the cartridge-designed Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3 in 1869. Similarly, the Navy model was the only .36 caliber cartridge revolver until the similar conversion of Colt models 1851, 1861 &amp; 1862 following the expiry of the Rollin White patent.  

'''44 Caliber Lipfire Revolver'''

The 44 was the first lipfire revolver produced. It sports a six-shot cylinder. Similar in appearance to the center-hammer percussion revolver, the rack and pinion mechanism of the loading level is hijacked to provide a cartridge case removal plunger. Thus the trigger guard pivots to actuate the plunger, as the center-hammer percussion revolver used the trigger guard to ram the load into the cylinder.  Four variants are recognized, with 'narrow' and 'common' width grips and top vs. bottom hinges on the loading gate highlighting the difference. Standard barrel length was a massive 8 inches long, with the breadth and heft of the Army model center hammer percussion pistols.

'''36 Caliber Lipfire Revolver''' 

Very similar in design to the 44 caliber lipfire, this revolver was 'downsized' slightly and chambered in 36 caliber. The cylinder has a six-shot capacity. As with the similar sized center-hammer percussion, barrel lengths were produced in 5, 6, and 8 inch to accommodate different tastes. No significant variants are recognized, which may indicate that the .36 followed the .44 after the .44 design gestation.

'''32 Caliber Lipfire Revolver'''

The 32 lipfire sports a six-shot cylinder in the smaller caliber. The design of the .32 caliber lipfire breaks from its bigger brothers in several important ways. Firstly, it sports a spur trigger rather than using the standard trigger with guard. Secondly, it uses a side-hammer of earlier design. Lastly, it ditches the trigger guard ejector/plunger for a weaker left-mounted plunger with rack and pinion gears to the top and left of the chamber. In design, it seems to be a marriage/compromise between its bigger brothers and the earlier .32 Rimfire revolver. Barrel lengths include 4, 5 and 6 inch.

'''25 Caliber Lipfire Revolver'''

Made without a loading gate or ejection mechanism, the .25 caliber lipfire is still another unique design. To load or unload, this seven-shot pocket gun required the cylinder to be removed to load or unload the cylinder. With just a few exceptions, most of the .25 caliber revolvers carry no markings. It is speculated that these may have been very late to market before the loss of the patent suit as a 'spit in your eye' gesture to Smith and Wesson. A 3-inch barrel was standard.

'''''Single Shot Rimfire Pistols'''''&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

With single-shot percussion pistols still selling well, it was natural that Allen would adopt cartridges to this style of pistol. A single-shot cartridge pistol also did not infringe on the Rollin White patent as described above.

He was a local politician in [[Utrecht]] from 1994 to 2006 and a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] from 2006 to 2012. He has been the [[party chair]] of the Labour Party since 2012.

== Early life and career ==

(Hans) Spekman]" (in Dutch), ''Parlement &amp; Politiek''. Retrieved 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a [[welder]], [[Moving company|mover]], and environmental [[Bookselling|bookseller]].&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

== Politics ==
Spekman has been a member of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] since 1986.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

He was a member of the [[municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] of [[Utrecht]] from 1 April 1994 to 1 January 2001 and an [[alderman]] of Utrecht from 1 January 2001 to 1 May 2006.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

Spekman was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] from 30 November 2006 to 24 January 2012. He focused on matters of [[alien (law)|alien]] and [[right of asylum|asylum]] policy, [[employment]] and [[social assistance]] policy, as well as [[poverty]] and [[benefit fraud]] control.&lt;ref name="parlement"/&gt;

Spekman has been [[Party Chair#Netherlands|chairman]] of the Labour Party since 2 January 2012, when he succeeded [[Lilianne Ploumen]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2699209/hans-spekman-gekozen-als-voorzitter-pvda.html Hans Spekman gekozen als voorzitter PvdA]" (in Dutch), [[NU.nl]], 2011.

In 2016 he organized a battle for the leadership of the Labour Party between the then–party leader [[Diederik Samsom]] and deputy prime minister [[Lodewijk Asscher]].

In 2017 Spekman led the campaign of his party in the parliamentary elections for the House of Representatives. On March 15 the Labour Party suffered a historical defeat of 29 seats in the House. The party ended up with nine seats. After the defeat members of the Labour party called for the resignation as party chairman of Hans Spekman. On March 17 he announced that he would step down in the fall of 2017.

'''Hollis Earl Roberts''' (May 9, 1943 – October 19, 2011) was a Native American politician whose career was highlighted by his 19-year period as chief of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]]. Hollis Roberts was born in [[Hochatown, Oklahoma|Hochatown]] to Laura Beam Roberts and Darrell E. Roberts. He attended Holly Creek Elementary and [[Idabel, Oklahoma|Idabel]] High School, graduating in 1961. Roberts married Helen R. Rodriguez in 1963. They had three children: two boys and one girl.&lt;ref name="Choctaw Nation"&gt;[http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1978-hollis-e-roberts/ Hollis E. Roberts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720034130/http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1978-hollis-e-roberts/ |date=2011-07-20 }} Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Accessed April 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his political career, Roberts died on October 19, 2011 at 68 years of age.&lt;ref name="Roberts Obituary"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2016569578_apusobitroberts.html Former Choctaw Chief Hollis Roberts dies at 68] The Seattle Times, October 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts remains an extremely polarizing and controversial figure among Native Americans. His 19-year reign as Chief of the Choctaw Nation came to end in 1997 amid convictions of sexual contact and sexual abuse. From these convictions (leading to an eleven-year prison sentence and removal from office), to his then-extravagant $120,000 per year salary,&lt;ref name="HRA"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2000/05/24/choctaw-nation-of-oklahoma-4-86197 "Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma"] Indian Country Today, Last modified May 24, 2000. Accessed April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to his alleged corruption; all have led to a negative public opinion of Roberts. Nevertheless, he served for 19 years as chief of the one of the largest Native American tribes in the United States. He governed well over 195,000 members, including over 79,000 in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="American Indians By The Numbers"&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmcensus1.html American Indians By The Numbers] infoplease.com, Accessed April 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Roberts began his political career as a city council person in [[Hugo, Oklahoma|Hugo City]] where he served for 14 years. Hugo is a town within the Choctaw Reservation in Oklahoma. Following his time in Hugo, Roberts served six years in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, representing Choctaw County. Choctaw county was only six per cent Indians, making his dramatic victory that much more captivating. Following his time as a member of the Oklahoma House Representative, Roberts served from 1975-1978 as Choctaw Chief David Gardner’s assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Valerie. Choctaw Nation A Story of American Indian Resurgence. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. Pgs. 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election as chief==
Following the 1978 death of Chief David Gardner, Hollis Roberts was elected chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. His election into office came at the tail end of the [[Red Power movement]]. As a young, energetic, and charismatic leader, Roberts embodied much of the Red Power Movement and became a guiding voice for change at a time when Indian sovereignty was at a countrywide high. Roberts ran against political rival Charles Brown. Brown was a popular, but older politician, who was well respected by Choctaws. Roberts won in a tight election, winning by only 339 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Valerie. Choctaw Nation A Story of American Indian Resurgence. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. Pgs. 86-89 Link text.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
1983 was big year for both Roberts and the Choctaw. Roberts proposed a new constitution to the Choctaw people. A major component of this new constitution was the removal of [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]] for tribal membership, which effectively increased the number of members of the Choctaw tribe. The new constitution did not come without controversy; while there was no minimum blood quantum for tribal membership, there was an enforced blood quantum of ¼ to be elected to tribal office. Additionally, women were given the right to vote with the new constitution. This new constitution was voted in 2,253 to 780 on July 9, 1983. As chief, it was Roberts job to appoint tribal judges. In 1983 Roberts appointed Juanita Jefferson, the first female Choctaw judge.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Valerie. Choctaw Nation A Story of American Indian Resurgence. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. Pgs. 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts was reelected in 1983. 
1992 was another big year: in '92 the Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes signed a compact with State of Oklahoma. This compact equates to Indians paying a fee to the federal government each year instead of paying taxes on tobacco products sold to non-natives on their reservations. The end result was that the Choctaw paid 75% less to the federal government and were thus able to increase their profit on products sold on the reservations.&lt;ref&gt;News From Indian Country, "Tribal Leaders Say Compact is in Best Interest of Tribes." Last modified June 30, 1992., additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Roberts worked to improve health standards, increase the tribe's population, and promote a healthy economy. During his time in charge, tuberculosis and infant mortality rates among the Choctaw decreased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Phoenix and Indian Advocate (1977-1989). "ITC told inflation, not cuts, to swallow program funds." Last modified January 31, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts effectively used his influence and abilities to negotiate federal funding and to set up programs for his people.  
Under his reign, the Choctaw Nation improved health standards, saw an increase in population, and set forth intensive economic growth campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Valerie. Choctaw Nation A Story of American Indian Resurgence. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. Pgs. 86-89, 251-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Today many view Roberts as a criminal, but in his heyday many also viewed him as a charismatic politician who brought much needed change to the Choctaw.

==Controversy==
On June 6, 1997, Roberts’ time as chief came to an end following his conviction in a federal court in Muskogee, Ok. Roberts was convicted on two counts of sexual contact and one count of aggravated sexual abuse involving two female employees of the tribe. The aggravated sexual abuse count carried a possible life sentence; however, he was eventually sentenced to eleven years in prison. The jury acquitted Mr. Roberts on four similar counts, three of them involving a former tribal employee who testified that Mr. Roberts had raped her.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "National News Briefs; Choctaw Nation's Chief Convicted of Sex Abuse."

Accessed April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollis Roberts attempted an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on sexual-abuse convictions and his 11-year prison sentence, but lost both appeals. One of his appeals was that the U.S. District Court lacked jurisdiction where the assaults took place because they happened in Tribal complex property which was trust land and thus not Indian Country nor formally a part of the reservation. The government ruled against this appeal claiming that the federal government owned the land in trust for Indians and it was thus Indian Country. Roberts also argued that he should not have an enhanced sentence for abusing a position of trust.&lt;ref name="HRA"/&gt;

Within the text of the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah himself is referred to as "the prophet",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the exact relationship between the Book of Isaiah and any such historical Isaiah is complicated. The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 686 BCE, separated by approximately 15 years, and includes dramatic prophetic declarations of [[Cyrus the Great in the Bible]], acting to restore the nation of Israel from [[Babylonian captivity]]. Another widely-held view is that parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1–39) originated with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King [[Josiah]] a hundred years later, and that the remainder of the book dates from immediately before and immediately after the end of the [[Babylonian captivity|exile in Babylon]], almost two centuries after the time of the historic prophet.{{efn|See the article "[[Book of Isaiah]]" for an extended overview of theories of its composition.}}

==Biography==
[[File:Isaiah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[icon]] of the Prophet Isaiah, 18th century ([[iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]]).]]
[[File:Antonio Balestra - Prophet Isaiah.jpg|thumb|Painting of Isaiah by [[Antonio Balestra]]]]
The first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of [[Uzziah]] (or Azariah), [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]], [[Ahaz]], and [[Hezekiah]], the kings of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|1:1|HE}}). Uzziah's reign was 52 years in the middle of the 8th century BCE, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the [[740s BCE]]. Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (who died [[690s BCE|698 BCE]]). He may have been contemporary for some years with [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as 64 years.&lt;ref name="Easton1897"&gt;{{eastons|Isaiah|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some modern interpretations, Isaiah's wife was called "the prophetess" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like [[Deborah]] ({{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|HE}}) and [[Huldah]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14–20|HE}}), or simply because she was the "wife of the prophet".&lt;ref name="Easton1897"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, naming one [[Shear-jashub]], meaning "A remnant shall return" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:3|HE}}), and the younger, [[Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz]], meaning, "Spoil quickly, plunder speedily" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}).

[[File:Isaiahwindow.jpg|thumb|Isaiah receives his vision of the Lord's house. A stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]
Soon after this, [[Shalmaneser V]] determined to subdue the kingdom of Israel, taking over and destroying [[Samaria]] ([[720s BCE|722 BCE]]). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was untouched by the Assyrian power. But when Hezekiah gained the throne, he was encouraged to rebel "against the king of Assyria" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:7|HE}}), and entered into an alliance with the king of [[Egypt]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|30:2–4|HE}}). The king of Assyria threatened the king of Judah, and at length invaded the land. [[Sennacherib]] ([[709–700 BC|701 BC]]) led a powerful army into Judah. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14–16|HE}}). But after a brief interval, war broke out again. Again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|36:2–22|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:8|HE}}). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:1–7|HE}}), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he "spread before the LORD" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:14|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Easton1897"/&gt;

{{quote|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: "Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:21–23|HE}})}}

According to the account in 2 Kings 19 (and its derivative account in 2 Chronicles 32) an angel of God fell on the Assyrian army and 185,000 of its men were killed in one night. "Like [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either the Southern Levant or Egypt."&lt;ref name="Easton1897"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayce, Archibald Henry. ''The Ancient Empires of the East''. Macmillan, 1884, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ({{bibleverse|2|Chr|32:23–29|HE}}). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. The time and manner of his death are not specified in either the [[Bible]] or other primary sources.&lt;ref name="Easton1897"/&gt; The Talmud [Yevamot 49b] says that he suffered martyrdom by being [[Death by sawing|sawn in two]] under the orders of Manasseh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8235-isaiah "Isaiah", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to rabbinic literature, Isaiah was the maternal grandfather of Manasseh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7668-hezekiah |title=HEZEKIAH |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers assert that Isaiah was a vegetarian, on the basis of passages in the Book of Isaiah that extol nonviolence and reverence for life, such as Isaiah 1:11, 11:6-9, 65:25, and 66:3. Some of these writers refer to "the vegetarian Isaiah",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Religious Quotes |website= [[Animal Liberation Front]] |url= http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Practical/Shop--ToDo/Religion/ReligiousQuotes.htm |accessdate= 2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the notorious vegetarian Isaiah",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Biblical Basis of Veganism |publisher= The Nazarenes  of  Mount Carmel |location= [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] |url= http://www.essene.com/Bible/BiblicalBasisOfVeganism.html |accessdate= 2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Isaiah, the vegetarian prophet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Braunstein |first= Mark  |title= Vegetarianism in Art |journal= [[Vegetarian Times]] |issue= 40 |year= 1980 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JwcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Isaiah,+the+vegetarian+prophet%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Isaiah%2C%20the%20vegetarian%20prophet%22&amp;f=false |quote= Isaiah, the vegetarian prophet, meant also that humans must sit with the lamb, the kid, the ox—because humans must make peace with the animals before they can make peace with other humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of Isaiah, along with the book of Jeremiah, is distinctive in the Hebrew bible for its direct portrayal of the "wrath of the Lord" as presented, for example, in Isaiah 9:19 stating, "Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire."&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 9:19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
[[File:E-codices sbs-0008 012r Jesaia.TIF|thumb|100px|Representation of the Prophet Isaiah illustrating a 14th-century prose translation of the Gospels]]
The [[Ascension of Isaiah]], a [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudegraphical]] Christian text dated to sometime between the end of the 1st century to the beginning of the 3rd, gives a detailed story of Isaiah confronting an evil false prophet and ending with Isaiah being [[martyr]]ed – none of which is attested in the original Biblical account. 

[[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335–395), believed that the Prophet Isaiah "knew more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel". [[Jerome]] (c. 342–420) also lauds the Prophet Isaiah, saying, "He was more of an Evangelist than a Prophet, because he described all of the Mysteries of the Church of Christ so vividly that you would assume he was not prophesying about the future, but rather was composing a history of past events."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of the Holy Prophets'', Holy Apostles Convent, {{ISBN|0-944359-12-4}}, page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Of specific note are the [[Servant songs|songs of the Suffering Servant]], which Christians say are a direct prophetic revelation of the nature, purpose, and detail of the death of Jesus Christ.

The Book of Isaiah is quoted many times by New Testament writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplybible.com/f591.htm|title=Isaiah in the New Testament - Quotations Chart - In Isaiah Order|first=Ron|last=Graham|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of those references are about the Suffering Servant, how he will suffer and die to save many from their sins, be buried in a rich man's tomb, and be a light to the Gentiles. The [[Gospel of John]] says that Isaiah "saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref||John|12:41|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=November 2015}}

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates [[Saint]] Isaiah the Prophet on [[May 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://oca.org/saints/lives/2018/05/09/101331-prophet-isaiah| title = Prophet Isaiah in the Eastern Orthodox Church | date = | website = Orthodox Church of America | language = en | archive-url = http://archive.fo/RCM4d | archive-date = October 10, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
The [[Book of Mormon]] quotes Jesus Christ as stating that "great are the words of Isaiah", and that all things prophesied by Isaiah have been and will be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/23.1-3?lang=eng#p1|title=3 Nephi 23:1-3|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon and [[Doctrine and Covenants]] also quote Isaiah more than any other prophet from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/isaiah?lang=eng|title=lds.org - Isaiah|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] consider the founding of the church by [[Joseph Smith]] in the 19th century to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 11, the translation of the Book of Mormon to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 29,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Isaiah#Isaiah:_Commentaries_on_Isaiah|title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism, "Isaiah"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building of Latter-day Saint temples as a fulfillment of Isaiah 2:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/youth/topic/temples?lang=eng|title=lds.org - Temples|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
Although Isaiah, or his Arabic name أشعياء (transliterated: ''Ashiʻyā'''), are not mentioned by name in the [[Qur'an]] or the [[Hadith]], [[Muslim]] sources have accepted him as a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim scholars, such as [[Ibn Kathir]] and [[Kisa'i]], reproduced Jewish traditions regarding Isaiah, which were transmitted through early Jewish converts to Islam. Isaiah is mentioned as a prophet in Ibn Kathir's ''Story of Prophet Isaiah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Prophets/isaiah.html|title=Ibn Kathir: Story of Prophet Isaiah (pbuh)|website=islamawareness.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern writers [[Muhammad Asad]] and [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', Note. '''2173''' to '''17:4''': "The Book is the revelation given to the Children of Israel. Here it seems to refer to the burning words of Prophets like Isaiah. For example, see Isaiah, chap, 24. or Isaiah 5:20–30, or Isaiah 3:16–26."&lt;/ref&gt; accepted Isaiah as a true Hebrew [[prophet]], who preached to the Israelites following the death of King [[David]]. Isaiah is well known in [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] and [[literature]], notably for his predictions of the coming of [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Shaya'', Online Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah's narrative in [[Muslim]] [[literature]] can be divided into three sections. The first establishes Isaiah as a [[prophet]] of [[Israel]] during the reign of [[Hezekiah]]; the second relates Isaiah's actions during the siege of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Sennacherib]]; and the third warns the nation of coming doom.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari, ''History of the Prophets and Kings'', i, 638–45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] preserves a tradition parallel to the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 38.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that [[Hezekiah]] was king in [[Jerusalem]] during Isaiah's time. Hezekiah heard and obeyed Isaiah's advice, but could not quell the turbulence in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Isaiah bin Amoz''&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition maintains that Hezekiah was a righteous man and that the turbulence worsened after him. After the death of the king, Isaiah told the people not to forsake [[God]], and he warned [[Israel]] to cease from its persistent sin and disobedience. Muslim tradition maintains that the unrighteous of Israel in their anger sought to kill Isaiah.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In a death that resembles that attributed to Isaiah in ''[[Lives of the Prophets]]'', Muslim exegesis recounts that Isaiah was [[martyred]] by Israelites by being sawn in two.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In the courts of [[Al-Ma'mun]], the seventh [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph, [[Ali al-Ridha]], the great grandson of Muhammad and prominent scholar ([[Imam]]) of his era, was questioned by the High Jewish [[Rabbi]] to prove the prophethood of both [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] through the [[Torah]]. Among his several proofs, the Imam references the [[Book of Isaiah]] , stating "Sha‘ya (Isaiah), the Prophet, said in the Torah concerning what you and your companions say: ‘I have seen two riders to whom (He) illuminated earth. One of them was on a donkey and the other was on a camel.’ Who is the rider of the donkey, and who is the rider of the camel?” to which the Rabbi was unable to answer with certainty. Al-Ridha clarifies that "As for the rider of the donkey, he is ‘Isa (Jesus); and as for the rider of the camel, he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family. Do you deny that this (statement) is in the Torah?” to which the Rabbi responds "No, I do not deny it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The life of Imam ‘Ali Bin Musa al-Ridha|last=al-Qurashi|first=Baqir Shareef|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|year=2001|isbn=978-9644383298|location=Qum|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism==
{{main|Isaiah in rabbinic literature}}
According to the [[rabbinic literature]], Isaiah was a descendant of the royal house of [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ([[Sotah]] 10b). He was the son of [[Amoz]] (not to be confused with Prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]), who was the brother of [[Amaziah of Judah|King Amaziah]] of Judah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8389">'''James Power''' (1788 or 1789 – August 15, 1852) was an Irish-born Texan [[empresario]], politician and signer of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]], known for the land grant he received with partner [[James Hewetson]] that included the coastal area between the mouths of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe]] and [[Nueces River]]s, as well as his founding and service as the first mayor of the [[Aransas City, Texas|Aransas City]] settlement. He often represented [[Refugio County, Texas|Refugio County]] during statewide conventions. Was part of the Mexican national era

==Early life==
[[Image:IMG Ballygarrett1904.jpg|thumb|320px|right|[[Ballygarrett]], Ireland, twinned with [[Refugio, Texas]] in honor of James Power]]
Power was born either in 1788 or 1789 at the small rural village of [[Ballygarrett]] in [[County Wexford, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballygarrett.com/ History of The Texas Connection With Ballygarrett]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, he relocated to [[New Orleans]], where he labored as a merchant for the next twelve years. During his time in New Orleans, Power met with [[Stephen F. Austin]], who notified him of the land grant (empresario) offerings from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government.&lt;ref name="power"/&gt; Hoping to cash in on the opportunity, he moved to [[Saltillo, Mexico|Saltillo]] via [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] in 1821, and became a citizen of Mexico. During his stay in Saltillo, he was employed in the mining equipment industry and entered into a partnership&lt;ref name="power"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo36|title=James Power|last=Welder|first=Mrs. Patrick H.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with merchant and fellow Irishman James Hewetson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhe36|title=James Hewetson|last=Huson|first=Hobart|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empresario==
[[Image:GoliadRefugioSanPatricio Texas2.JPG|left|thumb|Map showing [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]], [[Copano, Texas|Copano]], and the [[Nueces River]].  Fort Lipantitlán was located across the Nueces River from San Patricio.]]
After forming the partnership, Power and Hewetson applied for an empresario with the Mexican government in 1825 to begin a colony on the Texas coast with Mexican and Irish families. The original 1826 application requested for a grant between the Nueces and [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine Rivers]], but in 1828, the Mexican government instead offered the strip of land between the Guadalupe and [[Lavaca River]]s. The next year, Power and Hewetson requested more land and their holdings were extended west to the Nueces River, which included Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission. Ownership disputes with other empresarios forced Power and Hewetson to cede some land east of the Guadalupe River and the new eastern boundary was drawn at [[Coleto Creek]].&lt;ref name="colony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/uep03|title=Power and Hewetson Colony|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, Power returned to Ireland and searched for potential settlers of his colony. He convinced 350 individuals to travel with him to Texas to begin a settlement with promises of large plots of land. The immigrants traveled in two group with the first scheduled to land in New Orleans in April and the next scheduled for May. After the first group arrived in New Orleans, many of the settlers were struck with [[cholera]] and died. An additional lot were infected with cholera during the voyage from New Orleans to Texas, and died at the landing in [[Copano, Texas|Copano]]. These who survived either remained in Copano or traveled to the Refugio Mission, where they formed a settlement with Mexican colonists. In 1835, Hewetson sold his share of the empresario to Power and returned to Mexico. The land claims were eventually deemed invalid by the new [[Republic of Texas]] and designated as property of the state.&lt;ref name="colony"/&gt;

==Texas Independence==
Power became involved in the [[Texas Revolution|struggle for Texas Independence]] around 1835, and was a part of the Lipantitlán expedition that led to the [[Battle of Lipantitlán]]. He also was present at the [[Convention of 1836]] and signed the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] as a representative of [[Refugio County, Texas|Refugio County]]. During the convention, he convinced his fellow members to seat [[Sam Houston]] as President, and helped draft the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]]. Afterwards, he was sent to New Orleans to retrieve supplies for the Texas army, and assisted the ultimate victory.&lt;ref name="power"/&gt;

==Later endeavors==
In 1837, Power partnered with former Texas Governor [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsm23|title=Smith, Henry|last=Steen|first=Ralph W.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish the settlement of [[Aransas City, Texas|Aransas City]] near Power's home on Live Oak Peninsula, just north of present-day [[Fulton, Texas|Fulton]].

In 1832, Power married Dolores de la Portilla,&lt;ref name="power"/&gt; the daughter of Spanish colonizer Felipe Roque de la Portilla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo21|title=Felipe Roque de la Portilla|last=Welder|first=Mrs. Patrick H.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had two children.

'''John Hemphill''' (December 18, 1803 – January 4, 1862) was an American politician and jurist who served as [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas]] from 1841 to 1846 and of the [[Supreme Court of Texas]] until 1858, and a [[United States senator]] from [[Texas]] from 1859 to 1861. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was one of the signatories of the [[Confederate States Constitution]].

==Early life==
Hemphill's father was a Presbyterian minister, The Reverend John Hemphill, who emigrated to the United States from [[County Londonderry]], northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt; His mother, Jane Lind, was also Scots-Irish but was born in [[Pennsylvania]], where they met and married. John Hemphill the younger was born in [[South Carolina]]. He was educated at [[Washington and Jefferson College|Jefferson College]], graduating in 1825. He studied or "read the law" with David McCloud and was admitted to the bar in [[South Carolina]] in 1829. Several years later, in 1838 Hemphill moved his practice to Texas after it became an independent republic. Realizing that it was strongly influenced by Spanish law, he learned Spanish and studied its laws in order to be successful in this new environment.&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;Hart, James P. "John Hemphill - Chief Justice of Texas." ''Southwestern Law Journal'' 3 (fall 1949): pp. 395-415&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A friend of [[Sam Houston]], Hemphill was appointed and served as Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas]] from 1841 to 1846 and of the [[Supreme Court of Texas]] from 1846 to 1858, serving as the top jurist in the Republic of Texas and then in the State of Texas.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/nash.html Gary Nash, "Forbidden Love" (excerpted from his book, ''Forbidden Love:  The Hidden History of Mixed-Race America,'' (1999)], at Frontline: ''Jefferson's Blood''/Mixed-Race America, PBS, 2000, accessed 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Texas was an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]] and then a state in the United States before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

He was called the '[[John Marshall]]' of Texas for the role he played in the development of Texan law from the republic's early years, "laying the foundation of its judiciary system."&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/john-hemphill "John Hemphill"], ''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'', at answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; The challenges were far beyond the law; Hemphill became known for an incident in which he fought [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] warriors who had attacked him in a courtroom while his court was in session.

Hemphill was considered an expert on Spanish and [[Mexico|Mexican]] law, and he considered Spanish civil law to be superior to common law in many areas, especially in relation to property. He is remembered for expanding [[women's rights]] so that women could inherit equally. He also supported [[Homestead principle|homestead]] rights in an adoption of principles of Spanish civil law.&lt;ref name="hart"/&gt; Hemphill was elected in 1858 to replace [[Sam Houston]] as United States senator from Texas when Houston would not support the right of states to secede from the United States. He served from 1859 to 1861.

As Texas was one of the first seven states to secede from the Union, Hemphill was among the fourteen [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|United States senators expelled]] by Congressional resolution in 1861. He was subsequently chosen as a Texas delegate to the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]], a position he held until his death in [[Richmond, Virginia]].

==Personal life==
Hemphill never married.&lt;ref name="hndbk"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=fhe13|name=John Hemphill}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his slave Sabina for more than a decade and had two daughters with her.

'''Saint Mariam Baouardy, O.C.D.''' ({{lang-ar|مريم بواردي}}, or '''Mary of Jesus Crucified''', 5 January 1846 – 26 August 1878), was a [[Discalced Carmelite]] [[nun]] of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]. Born to [[Greek Catholic]] parents from Syria and Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmel.asso.fr/Sa-Vie,430.html|title=Sa Vie|author=dauplay|work=carmel.asso.fr|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was known for her service to the poor. In addition, she became a [[mysticism|Christian mystic]] who suffered the [[stigmata]], and has been [[canonized]] by the [[Catholic Church]].

Her path to canonization solidified on 6 December 2014 with the recognition of a final miracle needed for her canonization. In the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 14 February 2015, [[Pope Francis]] announced that she would be canonized on 17 May 2015; she was canonized at the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

==Life==
===Early life===
She was born on 5 January 1846 (the eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]) in the [[Galilee|Galilean]] village of [[I'billin]], the region of [[Southern Syria]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], now in [[Israel]], to Giries (George) Baouardy and his wife, Mariam Chahine, both of [[Damascus|Damascene]] ancestry. Mariam was their 13th child and first daughter, and none of her preceding brothers had survived infancy. She was born after the couple made a [[pilgrimage]] on foot to [[Bethlehem]], some 70 miles away, out of desperation after the loss of their children. When they were later blessed with the birth of a daughter, they named her after the [[Virgin Mary]], out of gratitude. She was joined by a new brother, Boulos, two years later.&lt;ref name=DCN&gt;{{cite journal|work=Sophia|title=The Little Arab|url=http://www.melkite.org/sa33.htm|last=Neger|first=Doris C., [[Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites|O.C.D.S.]]|volume= 31|number=No. 1|date=January–February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariam was not yet three years old when both her parents died from an illness in 1848, only a few days apart. The siblings were then each taken in by relatives on different sides of her family living in different villages, she being taken in by a paternal uncle who lived in the same village, and her brother went to live with a maternal aunt. The brother and sister would never see one another again. She was raised in a loving home in comfortable circumstances. As a child she had a marked spirit of religious fervor, and at the age of five began to fast on Saturdays in honor of the Blessed Virgin.&lt;ref name=csi&gt;[http://carmelitesisters.ie/blessed-mary-of-jesus-crucified-miriam-baouardy/ "Sister Mary of Jesus Crucified" Carmelite Sisters of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Baouardy was eight, her uncle and his wife moved to [[Alexandria, Egypt]], to improve their situation. Five years later, in 1858 when she was aged 13, in keeping with tradition, she was engaged by her uncle to his wife's brother, who lived in Cairo. The night before the wedding, she had a religious experience in which she felt called not to marry but to offer her life to God. Upon being told this the following morning, her uncle flew into a rage and beat her severely. Despite this, and the subsequent ill treatment she began to experience from her uncle, she stayed firm in her decision.

Nonetheless, Baouardy felt depressed and alone. She wrote her brother, then living in [[Nazareth]], asking him to visit her. The young male servant she asked to deliver the letter drew out of her the cause for her sadness. Upon learning of this, he attempted to woo her for himself, inviting her to convert to [[Islam]]. She rejected his proposal, which caused the young man to fly into a rage, in which he drew a knife and cut her throat. He then dumped her body in a nearby alley.&lt;ref name=csi/&gt;

Baouardy then experienced what she was convinced was a miracle. As she related later, a "nun dressed in blue" brought her to a grotto which she could never identify, stitched her wounds, and took care of her.&lt;ref name=csi/&gt; Her voice was affected for the rest of her life as a result of the cut, which a French doctor later measured as being 10&amp;nbsp;cm. (nearly 4 inches) wide.  After being cared for by this mysterious figure for a month, she recovered enough to leave and find work as a domestic servant in the home of an Arab Christian family in the city.&lt;ref name=eparchy&gt;[https://melkite.org/faith/faith-worship/maram-baouardy "Maram Baouardy", Melkite Eparchy of Newton]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a year, Baourardy decided to try to meet her brother and traveled by caravan to [[Jerusalem]]. There she felt inspired to make a vow of perpetual virginity at the [[Holy Sepulchre]]. She then took a boat in [[Jaffa]] with the intention of heading to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Due to poor weather, however, the boat had to stop at [[Beirut]]. Taking this as a sign from God, she disembarked and found work as a maid. After working there she suddenly became blind, a condition that lasted for 40 days, when just as suddenly she recovered her vision. Not long after that, she had a serious fall which seemed to leave her for dead. Her employer cared for her for a month until she recovered, completely healed.

===France and Carmel===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
In May 1863 a generous patron made it possible for Baouardy to move to [[Marseille]], France, where she became the cook for an Arab family. While there, she felt called to enter a religious order. Rejected by the first groups to which she sought admission, in May 1865 she was accepted as a [[postulant]] by the [[congregation (Catholic)|Congregation]] of the [[Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition]], who had communities in the [[Holy Land]] and already had several Palestinian candidates. It was at this point that she received the [[stigmata]] of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=AEI|title=Bethlehem Community Book|year=1999|publisher=Arab Education Institute|location=Bethlehem|pages=110, 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last month of this period of candidacy, the [[Mistress of novices]], Mother Honorine who had drawn Baouardy's life story from her, was replaced by [[Mother Veronica of the Passion]]. After two years as a postulant, Baouardy was up for a vote by the community regarding her admission to the congregation. To her dismay, she was rejected by the Sisters charged with making the decision.&lt;ref name=eparchy/&gt;

At that point, Mother Veronica had just received permission to transfer to the Discalced Carmelite monastery at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] to prepare for her forming a new congregation of [[Religious Sisters]] serving in India, the [[Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel]]. She invited Baouardy to go with her, writing to the [[prioress]] of that community and recommending that they accept the young Arab woman. The prioress accepted Mother Veronica's advice and, in June 1867, both women went together to Pau, where they received the Carmelite [[religious habit]] and Baourdy was given the [[religious name]] of '''Mary of Jesus Crucified'''.

In 1870, Mariam went with the first group of Carmelite Apostolic Sisters to [[Mangalore]], India.&lt;ref name=eparchy/&gt; She served there for two years before returning to Pau. It was there she made her profession of [[solemn vows]] as a member of the Order in November 1871. In September 1875 she helped to found a new monastery in [[Bethlehem]], the first of the Order in that region, where she lived until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bl. Mary of Jesus Crucified|work=Order of Carmelites|url=http://ocarm.org/en/content/liturgy/bl-mary-jesus-crucified-ocd-virgin-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her whole life, she experienced periods of [[religious ecstasy]] frequently throughout the day.

In April 1878 Mariam played an important role in the identification of the Biblical [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]] thanks to a private [[revelation]]. She died on 26 August 1878 in Bethlehem, from a cancer which had developed in her bones as a result of the fall she had while working in the monastery, which led to [[gangrene]] that spread to her lungs.&lt;ref name=DCN /&gt;

==Veneration==
The cause of canonization started on 18 May 1927 and would culminate with the decree of heroic virtue on 27 November 1981. Sister Mary of Jesus Crucified was [[beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 13 November 1983 and was canonized on 17 May 2015 by [[Pope Francis]]. She became the second [[Greek Catholic]] to be canonized a saint of the [[Catholic Church]], the first being [[Saint]] [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]] in 1867.

In I'billin a kindergarten, the [[Mar Elias Educational Institutions#Miriam Bawardi Elementary School|Miriam Bawardi Elementary School]] and a junior high school are named after Mariam Baouardy.

'''Moses Lapham''' (October 16, 1808 – 1838) was a soldier in the Texas Army during the [[Texas Revolution]], noted for a daring action during the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] that helped seal the decisive [[Texian]] victory.

==Early years==
{{Texas History}}
Moses Lapham was born near the town of [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]] on October 16, 1808 to Amos and Marcy Aldrich Lapham. He moved to [[Mechanicsburg, Ohio]] with his father and attended college at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for a few years.&lt;ref name="frantz1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moses Lapham: His Life and Some Selected Correspondence, I|author=Joe B. Frantz| journal= The Southwestern Historical Quarterly| volume=54|issue=3|year=1951|pages=324{{endash}}332| jstor=30237584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lapham arrived in Texas in the middle of 1831, and he taught school at [[San Felipe, Texas]]. He lived in the household of Thomas H. Borden, while assisting Borden with surveying work for about a year. Lapham spent three years in Ohio. However, by December 1835, he had returned to Texas and resumed work as a surveyor.&lt;ref name="frantz1" /&gt;

Lapham enlisted in the Texas Army on February 23, 1836 and served as a scout.&lt;ref name="frantz1" /&gt; When General Sam Houston evacuated his troops from [[Gonzalez, Texas]], Lapham one one of three sentinels who did not receive the orders. At one point, he was close enough to the advancing Mexican forces to be seen. Eventually he abandoned his post and fled to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Stephen L.|title=Eighteen minutes: the battle of San Jacinto and the Texas independence campaign|publisher=Republic of Texas Press|year=2004|ISBN=1-58907-009-7|page=118|location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836 he enlisted in the Texas army, was a member of Captain [[Moseley Baker]]'s "San Felipe Company", and fought at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], where he was one of the men who destroyed [[Vince's Bridge]]. The others who were with him on that mission were [[Deaf Smith]], [[John Coker]], [[Dimer W. Reaves]], [[Young Perry Alsbury]], [[John T. Garner]] and [[Edwin R. Rainwater]].

After his release from the Army in the fall of 1836, Lapham rejoined Gail and Thomas Borden to work as a surveyor. He helped to lay out the new town of [[Houston, Texas]] in October 1836.&lt;ref name="frantz1" /&gt;

==Death==
Lapham was later employed as a deputy surveyor by [[Samuel Maverick]] of San Antonio to survey land for him. The party of five, (Mr. Maverick, the sixth member had returned home was on October 20, 1838) was attacked by [[Comanche]] Indians on Leon Creek about four miles from [[San Antonio, Texas]] and Moses Lapham, Cornelius Skinner, a Mr. Jones, and one other of the party were killed. The surviving members returned to town and spread the news.  Thirteen prominent men headed by Benjamin Franklin Cage, a San Jacinto veteran, hurriedly left San Antonio and went to the place where the massacre had occurred. The Indians, estimated at a hundred or more, surrounded the Texans and killed Captain Cage, Dr. Henry G. McClung, R. M. Lee, a Mr. O'Blye, Peter Conrad, John Pickering and a Mr. Green, and badly wounded General Richard Dunlap and Major William H. Patton.  The next day a search party brought in the remains of the dead. On the following day, their remains were interred in a single grave just outside the Catholic Cemetery.  Judge Robinson delivered the funeral oration.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7446">'''Deborah Gardner''' was a 23-year-old American [[Peace Corps]] volunteer who was murdered by another volunteer in the South Pacific Kingdom of [[Tonga]] in 1976. The handling of the subsequent trial of the killer brought much criticism upon the Peace Corps.

==Background==
Gardner was a recent graduate of [[Washington State University]] when she joined the Peace Corps. After completing training, she was assigned to teach science and home economics to high school students in [[Nuku'alofa]], the capital city of Tonga. There she met Dennis Priven, a Peace Corps volunteer who had come to Tonga the previous year.  

Priven became infatuated with Gardner, but she did not return his feelings. This became evident when Gardner accepted a dinner invitation from Priven. He had envisioned a romantic evening, but after he attempted to give Gardner an expensive gift, she left, saying she felt uncomfortable. Despite this, Priven continued to pursue her. Gardner tried to avoid him, going as far as requesting a transfer to another island. Priven, on the other hand, tried to get his Peace Corps service extended for another year so he could stay near Gardner. Tonga's Peace Corps director denied both requests.

A few months before Priven's two-year Peace Corps service was completed, a party was held for all the volunteers on Tonga. Both Priven and Gardner attended.  Many volunteers became intoxicated, including Gardner. She left the party with a male volunteer, who escorted her to her house. This was witnessed by Priven, who became jealous. Less than a week after the party, on October 14, 1976, Priven killed her.

==Murder==
A local man heard screams coming from Gardner's house and rushed to the scene.  He reported seeing Priven attempting to drag Gardner out of the house.  As soon as Priven noticed the Tongan, he released Gardner and fled on bicycle. Gardner later died from 22 stab wounds, but not before she was able to name her assailant.  Priven attempted [[suicide]] by taking [[Darvon]] and cutting his wrists, but changed his mind and sought out a friend to accompany him to the police to turn himself in.  He was charged with [[murder]] and tried in Tonga.

==Trial ==
The prosecutor claimed that Priven killed Gardner in anger over his rejection.  At the trial Priven was represented by [[lawyer]] [[Clive Edwards (Tonga)|Clive Edwards]], who would later become deputy Prime Minister of Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taimionline.com/articles/1042 "New Cabinet lineup: 1 woman, 2 Demo Party members, 2 nobles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423034810/http://www.taimionline.com/articles/1042 |date=2012-04-23 }}, Taimi Media Network, December 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A [[psychiatrist]] hired by the Peace Corps testified that Priven was [[schizophrenic]], claiming to be Gardner's [[Jesus Christ]] and that Gardner was [[possessed by the devil]]. Priven was found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]].    

Despite the verdict, the Tongan justice system was reluctant to release Priven. After receiving a letter from the [[U.S. State Department]] promising he would be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, Tonga handed him over to the U.S. government. When he arrived in the U.S., however, Priven requested to be released and he was, as the government discovered it had no legal grounds to hold him.  

Under pressure from his family and the Peace Corps, Priven ultimately agreed to a psychiatric evaluation. He was interviewed by a psychiatrist associated with the hospital where the government had intended him to serve his commitment. His diagnosis fit the prosecution's theory; Priven had suffered a "[[situational psychosis]]" after being rejected by Gardner. Since the diagnosis determined that Priven was not [[schizophrenic]], he could not be committed. 

Priven returned to New York City after he was released and worked for the [[Social Security Administration]] until his retirement.

==Criticism ==
The Peace Corps has been criticized for its handling of the murder, particularly since a book on the case was published in 2005, acquainting a wider public with the details.  Criticisms include that Priven's defense in Tonga was supplied by the Peace Corps, that the Peace Corps allegedly went to great efforts to bury the incident, and that Priven was not suffering from a psychiatric disorder that would have allowed him to mount a successful psychiatric defense in an American court.

In 2005, the U.S. Attorney's office in [[Seattle]] looked into the possibility of bringing charges against Dennis Priven for the murder of Deborah Gardner but concluded that Priven could not be tried in any [[jurisdiction]] in the United States. Although a 1994 law allows prosecutors to bring charges against an American citizen who kills another American citizen while overseas, and the [[PATRIOT Act]]  allows US Courts to try Americans for crimes they may have committed while overseas, neither of these laws were in effect at the time the murder occurred in 1976 and they cannot therefore be applied retroactively to the Gardner murder case, the US Attorney's office concluded.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Les Blumenthal.

Although Priven's psychiatrist at his trial in Tonga testified that Priven suffered from latent [[paranoid schizophrenia]], a panel of psychiatrists who discussed the murder as a case study in 2005 concluded that Priven was probably suffering from  [[narcissistic personality disorder]], which manifests itself as an obsessive involvement with one’s own interests and a lack of [[empathy]] for others.  They further concluded that had he been charged in an American court, he would not have been able to mount a successful defense "by reason of insanity."&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;Philip Weiss.[http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/467/2032824.html "American Taboo: A Peace Corps Tragedy,"] PeaceCorpsOnline.org, June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Blinko''' (born 4 September 1961) is a British musician and artist, best known as the lead singer, lyricist, and guitar player for the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Rudimentary Peni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathrock.com/rudimentarypeni/main.html|title=The Cacophony of Rudimentary Peni|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=deathrock.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for being an [[outsider art|"outsider" artist]], whose pen-and-ink drawings and paintings have been shown in galleries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsiderart.co.uk/blinko.htm|title=Nick Blinko profile at Henry Boxer Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=outsiderart.co.uk|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blinko also creates all the drawings used by the band for its artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/lists/Nick-Blinko-Art/15073|title=Discogs.com Collection of albums &amp; EPs featuring artwork by Nick Blinko|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109205128/http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=114|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-09|title=Kinz and Tillou Fine Art 2006 Gallery profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ktfineart.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Music===
Blinko's first recorded musical project was the Magits, who formed in 1977 and were primarily electronic. This band's only record, the 1979 7" EP ''Fully Coherent'', was the first release on Blinko's Outer Himalayan Records label, and received occasional airplay by [[John Peel]] on Radio 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodbadmusic.com/2008/02/12/magits-fully-coherent-7ep-outer-himmilayan-records-uk-1979/|title=The Magits Fully Coherent 7" review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=goodbadmusic.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most well-known and longest running band, Rudimentary Peni, formed in 1980 and would go on to release three albums and six EPs spanning 1981-2009. A full-length collection of the first two EPs was also released in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rudimentary+Peni|title=Discogs.com listing for Rudimentary Peni|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pissinapod.com/#/plan-b-interview/4529919697|title="Somewhere Out There", 2008 Article/interview in Plan B Magazine by Noel Gardener|last=|first=|date=|website=pissinapod.com|publisher=Plan B Magazine|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary Peni's concept album ''[[Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric]]'' was allegedly written while Blinko was being detained in a psychiatric hospital under Section 3 of the UK [[Mental Health Act 1983]]. The subject matter of the album was purported to be based on the delusions Blinko was experiencing at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.southern.com/rudimentary-peni-pope-adrian-37th-psychristiatric-vinyl/|title= Southern Records listing for ''Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric'' |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Blinko has written and illustrated three books. The first, ''The Primal Screamer'', was a fictionalized semi-autobiographical novel with [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. It was published in 1995 by Spare Change Books and received a second printing in 2002. The book is written as a series of journal entries made by the therapist of "Nathaniel Snoxell" (who starts a band which is never named but is similar to Rudimentary Peni in many ways).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9aQmEBVFEYC |title=The Primal Screamer |via=[[Google Books]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was reprinted in 2011 by [[PM Press]], and collected artwork used for several previous editions under one cover for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipgbook.com/the-primal-screamer-products-9781604863314.php|title=Primal Screamer on Independent Publishers Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ipgbook.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 edition was distributed by the [[Alternative Tentacles]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/product.php?product=511|title=Primal Screamer listing on Alternative Tentacles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=alternativetentacles.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blinko's second book, ''Haunted Head'', was published in 2009 by [[David Tibet]] via Coptic Cat, in a limited edition of approximately 350 copies. An exclusive micro-edition of 60 copies was also published, featuring an original piece of art, while all copies of the book contained a postcard with a handwritten excerpt from the book. The edition size reflected the number of Blinko's handwritten postcards, from which the text of the book was transcribed, and which were included in the book. The book also included a one-track CD of a song by Rudimentary Peni called "[[Wilfred Owen]] The Chances" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copticcat.greedbag.com/buy/the-haunted-head-by-nick-blinko/|title=The Haunted Head by Nick Blinko archived on copticcat.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=copticcat.com|accessdate=2013-11-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109234840/http://copticcat.greedbag.com/buy/the-haunted-head-by-nick-blinko/|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/c93/htdocs/books/thhbook.php?site=c93|title=brainwashed.com listing - Haunted Head|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=brainwashed.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His third book was titled ''Visions of Pope Adrian 37th''. It was published in 2011, again by Coptic Cat, in two extremely limited editions which both included a small piece of original art by Blinko, drawn directly onto a page of the book. The "standard edition" was limited to 370 copies, while the "special edition" was limited to 37.  The book included 87 drawings, an introduction by outsider art specialist Colin Rhodes and a brief introduction by Blinko. The artwork in this book was reproduced in its original A5 size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticcat.com/news/259/56/Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|title=Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=copticcat.com|accessdate=2013-11-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110001623/http://www.copticcat.com/news/259/56/Nick-Blinko-Visions-of-Pope-Adrian-37th-now-available-for-order|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacularoptical.ca/2011/09/nick-blinko-%E2%80%98visions-of-pope-adrian-37th%E2%80%99-limited-edition-art-book/|title=Visions of Pope Adrian|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=spectacularoptical.ca|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blinko also contributed to a collection of punk fiction short stories, ''Gobbing, Pogoing and Gratuitous Bad Language!: An Anthology of Punk Short Stories by Stewart Home (1996-04-06)'', published in 1996 by Spare Change Books. His story, "Punk Alice" (a reference to Rudimentary Peni's song "Alice Crucifies the Paedophiles"), is written in a sketchbook style of doodles and scribbled phrases referencing the death of [[punk subculture|punk]], [[chess]], Catholicism, depression, [[goth subculture|goth]], Rudimentary Peni lyrics and drug chemicals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishoutsiderart.com/artists/nick_blinko.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=Blinko profile at British Outsider Art.net|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=britishoutsiderart.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
Blinko has contributed album artwork to several musical projects aside from his own. Among these are Part 1's 1985 release ''Pictures of Pain'', released on [[Pushead]]'s label Pusmort;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Part-1-Pictures-Of-Pain/release/803196|title=Part 1 Pictures of Pain at Discogs.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coil (band)|Coil]]'s 1997 release, ''[[Unnatural History III]]'', released on [[Threshold House]];&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Iron Lung (band)|Iron Lung]]'s 2007 [[Prank Records]] release ''Sexless//No Sex'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Iron-Lung-Sexless--No-Sex/master/118227|title=Iron Lung Sexless-No Sex at Discogs.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omaniescum Aorisum's 2013 Solitude Records release ''Mademoiselle Hélène'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Omaniescum-Aorisum-Mademoiselle-H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne/release/4917139|title=Omaniescum Aorisum Mademoiselle Hélène" at Discogs.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fire in the Head's 2010 release ''Confessions of a Narcissist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.special-interests.net/forum/index.php?topic=364.0|title=specialinterests.net listing of F/I/T/H "Confessions of a Narcissist"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=special-interests.net|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed musically to two releases by Fire in the Head.

Blinko's artwork has been shown internationally and featured in books and magazines related to the field of outsider art. An exhibition at the [[Rethink Mental Illness|National Schizophrenia Fellowship]] in 1994 first brought his art to public attention; he is now represented in the [[Collection de l'art brut]] in [[Lausanne]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawvision.com/articles/nick-blinko-devil-detail|title= The Devil is in the Detail, article by Tony Thorne in Raw Vision Magazine, issue 17 Winter 1996/97  |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a show at Kinz + Tillou Gallery in New York City in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109205128/http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=114|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-09|title=Nick Blinko Viewing Gallery May 11 - July 8, 2006|date=|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Blinko's artwork was featured at the [[Portland, Oregon]] art exhibit "Entartete Kunts" in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dennisdread.blogspot.com/2009/04/entartete-kunts-2009_04.html|title= ENTARTETE KUNTS returns to Portland in June 2009! |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he had a solo exhibit titled "Visions of Pope Adrian 37th" at [[Pallant House Gallery]] in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardenthare.org.uk/archive/blogs/67-colin-reviews-nick-blinkos-visions-of-pope-adrian-37th-on-show-at-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-until-14-august|title= Colin reviews Nick Blinko's 'Visions of Pope Adrian 37th' on show at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester until 14 August |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the unrelated British telescope manufacturer, go to [[Orion Optics]]''

'''Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars''' is an [[United States|American]] retail company that sells [[telescopes]], [[binoculars]] and accessories online and in-store for [[astronomy]] and [[birdwatching]]. It was founded in 1975 and has corporate offices in Watsonville, [[California]] with a retail store in Cupertino, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/index.php?page=sf-bay-area-telescope-stores San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers - SF Bay Area Telescope Stores - Orion Telescopes and Binoculars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orion Telescope Center - Corporate Office|url=http://watsonville.cylex-usa.com/company/orion-telescope-center---corporate-office-1896118.html|publisher=Cylex|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of its products are manufactured by the Chinese company [[Suzhou Synta Optical Technology|Synta]] for the Orion brand name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/targets-of-opportunity-crazy-cheap-scopes-on-amazon/ 10 minute astronomy - Targets of opportunity: crazy cheap scopes on Amazon May 11, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars ships its products to the United States and over 20 other countries. Orion puts out a semi-quarterly mail-order catalog as well as email catalogs. The company is a prominent advertiser in North American astronomy magazines such as Sky &amp; Telescope and Astronomy.

==History==
Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars was founded in a garage in Santa Cruz, California in 1975 by Tim Gieseler, who served as its only president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Gieseler|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-gieseler/7/548/69b|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, it was acquired by [[Imaginova]], the U.S. conglomerate founded in 1999 by [[CNN]] business anchor [[Lou Dobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Imaginova Corp.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5844068|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the mid-1990s and 2005, Orion only sold binoculars, telescopes and accessories under the "Orion" brand, but with the Imaginova acquisition, Orion started to sell non-Orion brand products as well, including [[Televue|Tele Vue]] eyepieces, [[Celestron]] 8 and {{convert|11|in|mm|sing=on}} [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]] telescopes. In November 2017, Orion was purchased by its employees, and remains independent and American-owned.

==Products==
[[Image:ED120.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Orion ED120 apo refractor on Orion's Sirius EQ-G "GoTo" and [[GPS]] equipped German equatorial mount with portable 12 volt power supply]]
Orion sells a range of telescopes that they characterize as "beginner", "intermediate" or "advanced", including [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonians]], [[Maksutov telescope|Maksutov]]s, [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]]s, [[Ritchey-Chrétien]]s and [[refractor]]s with or without (sold as optical tube assemblies or "OTA") a variety of mounts. Orion also sells a series of [[Dobsonian telescope]]s that come in "Classic" and "IntelliScope" versions, the latter with upgraded accessories and the ability to indicate astronomical objects to the observer aided by a computerized object database. Orion also sells Dobsonians with GoTo and tracking capabilities.

In late 2005 Celestron (which had recently been purchased by [[Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan]]) announced an agreement that would allow Celestron 8, 9.25, and {{convert|11|in|mm|sing=on}} Schmidt-Cassegrain optical tube assemblies (OTA), painted in metallic gray and using the "Orion" brand (Celestron OTAs are painted either gloss black or semi-gloss matte orange), to be sold with Orion branded German [[equatorial mount]]s (also made by Synta)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2lIwU313wgkC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=orion+telescopes+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JubyUpbUNqessQTWpIDYBw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=orion%20telescopes%20business&amp;f=false Philip S. Harrington, Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories,  John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, page 147]&lt;/ref&gt; and eyepiece accessories.

At the high performance end of their range, Orion has a series of two element [[apochromatic]] (apo) refractors manufactured by Synta&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacegazer.com/index.asp?pageid=97158 Antony McEwan, Sky-Watcher ED100, Highlands Astronomical Society 2014, spacegazer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; featuring "extra low [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]" [[fluorite]] [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] in one element of the [[objective lens]]. These are marketed as the ED80 (80&amp;nbsp;mm or {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} objective at f/7.5), ED100 (100mm or {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on}} at f/9) and ED120 (120mm or {{convert|4.7|in|mm|sing=on}} at f/7.5).

Orion also sells binoculars for astronomical and terrestrial observing, [[microscope]]s and monocular spotting scopes of the type used by birdwatchers and [[Shooting|marksmen]].

(née Erramouspe) Gosar. His paternal grandparents were [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] and his maternal grandparents were [[Basque people|Basque]] immigrants from [[Banca, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Banca]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/gosar.htm|title=Paul Anthony Gosar, D.D.S.|publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar is one of ten children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

He is the older brother of [[Pete Gosar]], a former [[Wyoming Cowboys|college football]] player at the [[University of Wyoming]], who is a former chairman of the [[Wyoming Democratic Party]] and was a candidate for [[governor of Wyoming]], in [[Wyoming gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribtown.trib.com/post/wypolitics/at_least_one_gosar_was_elected_this_year.html Profile contrasting Paul and Pete Gosar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717095940/http://tribtown.trib.com/post/wypolitics/at_least_one_gosar_was_elected_this_year.html|date=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/mead-wins-re-election-bid-in-wyoming-republican-primary/article_b3deb13f-fbc9-5859-b3b4-b0511f698bb7.html|title=Mead wins GOP primary for Wyoming governor|date=August 19, 2014|publisher=''[[Wyoming Tribune-Eagle]]''|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar received his [[B.A.]] from [[Creighton University]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], and later, his [[D.D.S.]] from the [[Creighton University School of Dentistry|Boyne School of Dentistry]] at Creighton. He owned his own dentistry practice in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] for twenty-five years. He was the [[Arizona Dental Association]]'s "Dentist of the Year" in 2001, and was inducted into the ADA Hall of Fame, also serving as its president. He was also president of the Northern Arizona Dental Society and vice-chair of the ADA council on governmental affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gosarforcongress.com/article/arizonas-former-dentist |title= Arizona's Former Dentist of The Year Launches Robust Bid to Unseat Ann Kirkpatrick in Congressional District One |author= |date= October 14, 2009 |work= Gosar for Congress |publisher= |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2010#District 1}}
In 2009, Gosar – who had never run for elected office before – announced he would challenge [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Ann Kirkpatrick]] in the 1st district in the 2010 elections. Gosar has been identified as a [[Tea party movement|Tea Party candidate]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' because the Arizona Tea Party featured Gosar on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/10/15/us/politics/tea-party-graphic.html|title=Where Tea Party Candidates Are Running |publisher=The New York Times|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar won the Republican primary. He was endorsed by [[Sarah Palin]] and three Arizona county sheriffs: Maricopa County Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]], Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards, and Pinal County Sheriff [[Paul Babeu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosarforcongress.com/endorsements|title=Endorsements |publisher=Gosar For Congress|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick challenged him to five debates across the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prescottenews.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3884|title=Paul Gosar Finds Easy Victory in CD1 Primary|publisher=Prescott eNews|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2010/08/26/kirkpatrick-wants-5-debates-with-gop-challenger|title=Arizona Capitol Times Blog Archive » Kirkpatrick wants 5 debates with GOP challenger|publisher=Azcapitoltimes.com|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar initially agreed to one debate but later withdrew. Gosar released a statement explaining the decision to withdraw from the debate was based on the long drive to and from [[KAET]] in Phoenix, which organized the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdailysun.com/news/local/article_1b2c982f-ebef-52d6-891b-24f7ee485fb5.html|title=Gosar pulls plug on televised debate|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|date=2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A producer at KAET said Gosar's staff told the station the candidate could not participate in the debate because he would be attending a fundraiser instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prescottdailycourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=86518|title=Gosar backs out of today's TV debate in favor of fundraiser|publisher=Prescott Daily Courier|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar defeated Kirkpatrick in the November 2010 general election, taking 49.7 percent of the vote.

;2012
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 4}}
Following changes made in [[redistricting]], Gosar was going to seek re-election in the 1st district, which was made less favorable to Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|title=House Democrats Gain With New Arizona Map|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Jessica|last=Taylor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163330/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with Kirkpatrick priming for a rematch, Gosar changed his mind and announced in January 2012 he would run in the newly created [[Arizona's 4th congressional district|4th district]]. The 4th had absorbed much of the western portion of the old 1st, and was heavily Republican.  As part of the move, he bought a second home in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], which he claimed as his official residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Reid|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/01/gosar-will-swit.php|title=Gosar Will Switch Districts|publisher=National Journal|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar initially faced a tough primary fight against Babeu. However, Babeu pulled out in May 2012 due to allegations of abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/05/11/sheriff-babeu-abandons-race-for-arizona-congressional-seat/ Sheriff Babeu Abandons Race for Arizona Congressional Seat]. Fox News Latino. 2012-05-11. Retrieved 2012-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar defeated former [[Arizona Senate|state senator]] [[Ron Gould (politician)|Ron Gould]] and businessman Rick Murphy in the Republican primary, all but assuring him of a second term. In the November general election, he defeated Democratic challenger Johnnie Robinson, with 67 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/results/election.php|publisher=Azcentral.com|accessdate=2012-12-18|title=Election 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2018
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2018#District 4}}
In September 2018, six of Gosar's nine siblings released a political campaign ad against their brother and supporting his Democratic opponent, David Brill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/21/politics/paul-gosar-siblings-ad/index.html|title=Rep. Paul Gosar's siblings in new ad: Don't vote for our brother|last=CNN|first=Eric Bradner,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar took to twitter to respond to the advert. He described his siblings as "disgruntled Hillary supporters" who "put political ideology before family".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45611403|title=Siblings savage congressman in attack ad|date=2018-09-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar defeated Brill in the November 2018 general election, taking 68.2% of the vote.

===Tenure===

====Abortion====
Paul Gosar describes himself as [[pro-life]]. On abortions, Gosar states, "These procedures undeniably rob the world of a human life in a most cruel fashion... The right thing to do is to ban these procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gosar.house.gov/press-release/dr-gosar-condemns-abortion-genocide-disgusted-congress%E2%80%99-failure-protect-unborn-and-ban |title=Dr. Gosar Condemns Abortion Genocide: Disgusted at Congress' Failure to Protect the Unborn and Ban Pain Capable Abortions |publisher=Gosar.house.gov |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar cosponsored the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]], a bill that would make permanent restrictions on federal funding of abortions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR00003:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status – 112th Congress (2011 – 2012) – H.R.3 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar also cosponsored the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, an act placing restrictions on abortions in the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03803:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status – 112th Congress (2011 – 2012) – H.R.3803 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar was given a 100% rating by the [[National Right to Life Committee]], a pro-life interest group, and a 0% rating by [[NARAL]] (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League), a pro-choice interest group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/123491/paul-gosar#.UKrGv4eUZH4 |title=Paul Gosar – Ratings and Endorsements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempt to impeach EPA Administrator====
On September 2015, Gosar submitted articles of impeachment against [[EPA]] administrator [[Gina McCarthy]], asserting that she had committed "high crimes and misdemeanors:" and "lied to the American people in order to force misguided and overreaching regulations, which have no scientific basis, down our throats."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steven [http://gosar.house.gov/press-release/rep-gosar-files-articles-impeachment-against-epa-administrator-gina-mccarthy, "Rep. Gosar Files Articles of Impeachment against EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy"], House.gov Press Release, September 11, 2015. Retrieved September 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; An EPA spokeswoman said Gosar's resolution "has zero merit and is nothing more than political theater" while fellow Republican and House majority leader, [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] confirmed that "There's no plan to impeach Gina McCarthy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/15/gop-lawmaker-moves-to-impeach-epa-chief-mccarthy/, "GOP lawmaker moves to impeach EPA chief McCarthy"], Fox News, September 15, 2015, Retrieved September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boycott of Pope Francis====
On September 17, 2015, in an [[op-ed]] on the conservative website [[Townhall.com]], Gosar announced that he would not attend [[Pope Francis's 2015 visit to North America|Pope Francis' planned address]] to a [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress|joint meeting of Congress]], unless the Pope spoke about issues such as "violent Islam" or [[Planned Parenthood]], instead of [[climate change]]. Gosar wrote that he would treat the Pope the same way he believes "leftist politicians" should be treated.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Gosar|title=Why I Am Boycotting Pope Francis's Address to Congress|url=http://time.com/4040743/paul-gosar-pope-francis-congress|accessdate=2015-09-18|first=Paul Gosar|publisher=Town Hall (republished on Time.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar accused Francis of having "adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into 'climate justice' and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies."&lt;ref&gt;Viebeck, Elise, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/21/who-is-paul-gosar-the-congressman-boycotting-pope-francis/ "Who is Paul Gosar, the congressman boycotting Pope Francis?"], ''Washington Post'', September 21, 2015; retrieved September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar condemned climate science as "questionable" and criticized ''[[Laudato si']]'', Francis's encyclical on the environment.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Gosar did not attend Pope Francis's September 24 address, the only member of Congress not to do so.&lt;ref name=fundraising&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-news/27036260-story|title=Gosar goes after Pope; uses boycott to raise campaign money|last1=Flores|first1=Jessica|date=September 30, 2015|website=fox10phoenix.com|publisher=[[KSAZ-TV]]|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/30/arizona-congressman-raises-funds-off-his-boycott-of-pope-francis|title=Arizona congressman raises funds off his boycott of Pope Francis|last1=Weigel|first1=Dave|date=September 30, 2015|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Pope's visit, Gosar used his opposition to Francis's addresses as a fundraising tool.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundraising/&gt; A fundraising email for Gosar used his Townhall.com op-ed's catchphrase, "When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one" and positioned Gosar as the victim of "unprecedented attacks" from "the liberals, the left-wing media and the Obama political machine."&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

==== Cannabis ====

Gosar is against the legalization of marijuana and expressed concerns about public safety, children, and the commercial industry. He voted against the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which allows veterans to access [[medical marijuana]], if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation. He has an "F" rating from [[NORML]] regarding his voting record on [[cannabis]]-related matters.&lt;ref name="NORML"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Scorecard - NORML.org - Working to Reform Marijuana Laws|url=http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/arizona|website=norml.org|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Charlottesville "false flag" theory ====
In October 2017, Gosar promoted the [[theory]] that the [[Unite the Right rally]], that occurred earlier that year was a left-wing plot to stoke racial discord and to undermine President Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="Bogus"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/06/arizona-congressman-repeats-bogus-claim-that-charlottesville-violence-was-left-wing-plot/|title=Arizona congressman repeats claim that Charlottesville violence was left-wing plot|last=Hawkins|first=Derek|date=2017-10-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar's statements echoed claims that were circulating among the right-of-center and promoted by [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] of ''[[Infowars]]''.&lt;ref name="Bogus"/&gt; Gosar further believes the Charlottesville rally may have been funded by [[George Soros]], who Gosar said "turned in his own people to the Nazis" despite being 13 years old in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/story/paul-glosar-charlottesville-soros|title=Congressman suggests Charlottesville was George Soros–backed conspiracy|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of Gosar's own siblings wrote an open letter to the Kingman (Arizona) [[The Kingman Daily Miner|''Daily Miner'']] newspaper denouncing Gosar's claims about Soros as "despicable slander...without a shred of truth", saying the congressman "owes George Soros a personal apology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://kdminer.com/news/2017/oct/24/letter-gosar-siblings-do-not-support-rep-paul-gosa/?http://m.kdminer.com/news/2017/oct/24/letter-gosar-siblings-do-not-support-rep-paul-gosa/? "Gosar Siblings Do Not Support Rep. Paul Gosar’s Statements on George Soros"], ''Daily Miner'', October 24, 2017, Retrieved October 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment====
In 2015, Gosar scored 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the [[League of Conservation Voters]]. On January 30, 2017 Gosar introduced House [[Joint Resolution|Joint resolution]] 46 which would repeal the authority of the [[National Park Service]] to decline private drilling for oil, gas and minerals in 40 [[List of national parks of the United States|U. S. National Parks]] if the Park Service determines that the mining operation would threaten the environment. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said Gosar was "no friend of environmentalists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This lawmaker wants to ease rules on drilling in national parks, and conservationists aren't happy |first=Darryl |last=Fears |date=February 1, 2017 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/01/this-lawmaker-wants-more-drilling-in-national-parks-and-he-just-became-more-powerful/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/paul-gosar |title=Representative Paul Gosar (R) |work=National Environmental Scorecard |publisher=[[League of Conservation Voters]] |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/46 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |title=H.J.Res.46 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the National Park Service relating to "General Provisions and Non-Federal Oil and Gas Rights" |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
In 2010, Gosar signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Gosar_Paul.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601132755/http://www.americansforprosperity.org/files/Gosar_Paul.pdf |archivedate=June 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosar voted in support of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].&lt;ref name="Almukhtar122117"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gun law====
Gosar has stated that the "[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] is one of the most important rights set forth by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" and has stated he will "continue to oppose efforts to restrict, infringe, or remove this constitutionally protected right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gosar.house.gov/issue/second-amendment-gun-rights |title=Second Amendment Gun Rights |publisher=Gosar.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] (National Rifle Association) and given a rating of 92%. He was also endorsed by [[Gun Owners of America]], and given a rating of 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/123491/paul-gosar |title=Paul Gosar – Ratings and Endorsements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' describes Gosar as "one of the staunchest opponents in Congress to legalizing undocumented dreamers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2018/01/29/rep-paul-gosar-misstates-crime-statistics-daca-aged-immigrants/1070070001/|title=Rep. Paul Gosar misstates crime statistics about 'Daca-aged' immigrants|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar stated, "I strongly believe we need to immediately secure our border and oppose [[amnesty]] for anyone who blatantly violates our law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosarforcongress.com|title=Gosar for Congress|publisher=gosarforcongress.com|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosar has cosponsored legislation to repeal the 14th Amendment, thus eliminating [[birthright citizenship]] for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h140/show|title=H.R.140: Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011 – U.S. Congress|publisher=OpenCongress|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2017/09/06/does-president-trumps-elimination-daca-dreamers-create-crisis-congress/634166001/|title=Trump's elimination of DACA creates a crisis for 'dreamers.' Is it a crisis for Congress?|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in May 2018, he accused immigration attorneys providing legal advice to undocumented immigrants of committing a crime: "What we need to do is also hold those that are actually helping — what they're saying is help, but assisting in a crime — to be prosecuted as well." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/arizona-congressman-warns-attorneys-helping-refugees/75-550200555|title=Arizona congressman warns attorneys helping refugees|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given an "A" rating by [[NumbersUSA]], an organization in support of immigration reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.numbersusa.com/content/elections/races/southwest/arizona/2012-arizona-04th-congressional-district.html |title=2012 Arizona 04th Congressional District &amp;#124; NumbersUSA – For Lower Immigration Levels |publisher=NumbersUSA |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Native Americans====
In December 2014, Gosar drew controversy when he referred to American Indians as "wards of the federal government".  He was responding to concerns from members of the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]] in eastern Arizona when he made the comment that stunned people at the round-table talk in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The topic had addressed the proposal to swap 2,400 acres of southeastern Arizona's [[Tonto National Forest]] for about 5,300 acres of environmentally sensitive land.  The proposal, which was attached as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the 2015 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], would give land sacred to the Apache in Arizona to [[Resolution Copper]] Mine, a joint venture owned by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] and [[BHP Billiton]].  [[Troy Eid]], a Republican and former U.S. Attorney in Colorado, responded to Gosar's comments and said: "In the heated context of what this represents, it's especially inappropriate to be resorting to what amounts to race baiting."  A Gosar spokesperson said his comments were misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/paul-gosar-native-americans_n_6305738.html |title=Rep. Paul Gosar Calls Native Americans 'Wards Of The Federal Government' |newspaper=Huffington Post |first1=Felicia |last1=Fonseca |date=December 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treason accusations against the FBI and DOJ ====
In February 2018, Gosar posted on his Facebook page that the so-called Nunes memo shows "clear and convincing evidence" certain members of the FBI and Justice Department committed treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/nunes-memo-proves-fbi-committed-treason-gop-lawmaker-says-798828|title=Nunes memo proves FBI committed "treason," GOP lawmaker says|date=2018-02-02|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/372072-republican-rep-on-memo-fbi-conduct-constitutes-treason|title=GOP lawmaker on memo: FBI conduct 'constitutes treason'|last=Delk|first=Josh|date=2018-02-02|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Gosar specifically characterized conduct by James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates and Rod Rosenstein as "not just criminal but constitutes treason."  In what Gosar referred to as "My full statement on the declassified memo", Gosar reported he would be "leading(sic) a letter to the Attorney General seeking criminal prosecution against these traitors to our nation."
====Tommy Robinson====
In July 2018, Gosar spoke at a rally in London in support former English Defence League leader [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]]. Gosar also used his speech to attack "disgusting and depraved" Muslim immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/congressman-condemned-over-backing-for-uk-farright-activist-robinson-37134177.html|title=Congressman condemned over backing for UK far-right activist Robinson - Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-news/rep-paul-gosar-criticized-for-support-of-far-right-british-activist|title=Rep.

He was expected to get a visa despite his criminal convictions and use of fraudulent passports to enter and depart the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tommy-robinson-jail-free-congress-us-republican-event-trump-visa-washington-speech-gosar-a8601866.html Tommy Robinson invited to address US Congress members in Washington by Republican supporters], ''[[The Independent]]'', Lizzie Dearden,   October 25, 2018.

'''Philomena Frances Ryan'''  (28 February 1895 – 19 November 1983) was an Irish chemist and nationalist.

==Background ==
Born to John Ryan and his wife, Elizabeth (née Sutton), farmers in Tomcoole, near [[Taghmon]], [[County Wexford]], Ryan was the youngest and had six sisters and five brothers. They were a nationalist family. Her brother [[James Ryan (Irish politician)|James Ryan]] was a senior [[Fianna Fáil]] minister. Her sisters married [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], [[Richard Mulcahy]], and [[Denis McCullough]]. Ryan was educated in the small nearby national school at Caroreigh and in the Loreto Abbey in [[Gorey]]. For third level she went to [[University College, Dublin]] where she graduated with a B.Sc. in [[chemistry]] in 1916 followed by her master's degree the following year. She was the only woman in her year and only the fifth woman scientist to have graduated from the [[National University of Ireland]] since it began. During her time in college, the [[Easter rising]] took place. She reported for duty at the [[General Post Office, Dublin]] with her sisters, where they acted as messengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Witness Dr. Nancy Vyse-Power, |url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0541.pdf#page=29|publisher=Bureau of Military history}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Ryan sisters also attempted to get the British army to stop firing on Red Cross locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Military history|title=Witness Right Rev. Monsignor M. Curran, P.P |url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0687.pdf#page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead up to the events she and her sisters had acted as cover for the men meeting up. They would accompany them to make it look like men out with their girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Witness His Excellency, Seán T. O'Kelly |url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS1765%20PART%202.pdf#page=94 |publisher=Bureau of Military history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later between 1919 and 1921, during the [[war of independence]] she divided her time between her work and both political and military activities. Ryan was a member of, and at one point a captain in Cumman na mBan, though she did not join in the very beginning. She escaped arrest. She also worked with the organisations supporting those who did get arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Witness Miss Brighid O'Mullane, |url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0485.pdf#page=2 |publisher=Bureau of Military history}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dib.cambridge.org|title=The Dictionary of Irish Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Explore: Letters of 1916 |url=http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/explore/letters/159 |website=letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Explore: Letters of 1916 |url=http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/explore/letters/165 |website=letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Explore: Letters of 1916 |url=http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/explore/letters/169 |website=letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Seán T.

When the [[Irish Civil War]] began Ryan agreed with the anti-treaty side and wrote to her sister Min severing ties with herself and [[Richard Mulcahy]] for the duration.&lt;ref name="NLI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nli2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irc"/&gt;

==Career==

Ryan worked with Professor Hugh Ryan and published papers. Some of their research was funded by [[Dynamit Nobel|Nobels Ltd]]. Ryan went to [[London]] to train as a public analyst. When she came back to Dublin she worked in the college laboratory. Then in 1925 she started a private practice as a public analyst. She chose to hire women graduate chemists. Eventually Ryan was the public analyst for twelve county councils. For many years she was the only woman public analyst in Ireland.&lt;ref name="dib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nli2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irc"/&gt;
Ryan was a founder member of the [[Institute of Chemistry of Ireland|Irish Chemical Association]] (1922–36). She was on the committee of the Irish Chemical Association (1936–7), and then vice-president (1938–40) and president (1940–41). In 1934 Ryan became a member of the first industrial research council.&lt;ref name="dib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nli2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irc"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In September 1936, Ryan married Séan T. O'Kelly. He was the widower of her sister Mary Kate. The couple needed, and received, a papal dispensation. They had no children. She was known as Mrs Phyllis O'Kelly or Phyllis Bean Úi Cheallaigh from then on. Her husband became [[President of Ireland]] in 1945 at which point Ryan gave up business and turned to trees and plants. Her hobbies included flower arranging and bridge.&lt;ref name="dib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nli2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irc"/&gt;
Her husband retired as President in 1959 at which point they moved to [[Roundwood]], Co. Wicklow. He died in 1966, and she died 19 November 1983 in the hospice at [[Harold's Cross]], Dublin and is buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.&lt;ref name="dib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nli2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irc"/&gt;

'''Ramón Dionisio José de la Sagra y Peris''' (8 April 1798 – 23 May 1871) was a [[Galician people|Galician]] anarchist, politician, writer and botanist, who founded the world's first anarchist journal,&lt;ref name="DYKref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/539321/Ramon-de-la-Sagra-as-discussed-in-anarchism|title=Ramón de la Sagra|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Porvenir'' (Spanish for "The Future").

==Biography==
Ramón de la Sagra was born on 8 April 1798 in [[A Coruña]], a province of Spain. His father Lorenzo Martínez de la Sagra came from a noble merchant family, which became wealthy through trade with the Spanish colonies in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropology of the Enlightenment |author=Wolff, Larry; Cipolloni, Marco (editors)|year=2007|page=316|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-5202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Antonia Rodríguez Perís, who met his father in Saint Augustine. His brother migrated to [[Uruguay]] to start a business there, when Sagra was three years old.

Ramón de la Sagra studied physics for one year in Nautical School of A Coruña. Afterwards he attended the military college of Santiago de Compostela until reaching adulthood. Afterwards he joined the local university, where he studied anatomy, medicine, mathematics and pharmaceuticals. There he started spreading liberal ideas. For these actions the [[Inquisition]] started threatening him, until he was transferred at the University of Madrid.&lt;ref name="elizabeth fey"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fey, Ingrid Elizabeth; Racine, Karen (editors)|title=Strange Pilgrimages: Exile, Travel, and National Identity in Latin America, 1800-1990's |year=2000|page=43|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-8420-2694-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he contributed to the newspaper ''El Conservador''. In 1821 he migrated to [[Cuba]] as an assistant of Agustìn Rodriguez. One year later he was appointed to the position of Professor of Natural History of Cuba. 
In 1822 he married Manuela Turnes del Rìo. For the next ten years he would travel in the [[Americas]], until settling in Paris in 1835.&lt;ref name="elizabeth fey"/&gt; He traveled to the United States from April 20th to September 23rd of 1835 and the following year published ''Five Monthes in the United States of North America'' in Paris based on his experiences there. He also accumulated several volumes of pamphlets and economic and scientific reports while traveling in the United States. 

In Paris he became a disciple of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. He returned to Spain in 1837 and was elected a member of the parliament four times (1838, 1840, 1845, 1854) as a representative of the Liberal Party. At the same time he began publishing a thirteen volume history on the political and natural history of Cuba which he would complete in 1857. In 1939 he published ''Voyage en Hollande et en Belgique sous le rapport de l’instruction primaire, des établissements de bien faisance et des prisons, dans les deux pays'' (published in Paris, 1939 in French and in Spanish in 1844). In 1845 he founded the world's first anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'', which was closed by [[Ramón María Narváez]], Duke of Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Anarchism: a history of libertarian ideas and movements|year=2004|page=299|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=1-55111-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[French Revolution of 1848]], he created with Proudhon the Peoples' Bank of France. In Brussels he met Heinrich Ahrens, disciple of Krause, whose doctrines he proclaimed in Spain before Julian Sanz del Rio. He continued to publish economic, geographic, political, social, and prison reform studies. In 1849 he was expelled from France, because he was spreading Socialist ideas. In 1856 he was expelled from Spain to France by Ramón María Narváez, because he was spreading radical ideas. In Paris he met [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. There he worked as the consul of Uruguay. He returned to Cuba between 1859 and 1860 and published numerous studies and essays there. At the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870 he went to Switzerland, where he died on 23 May 1871 at the age of seventy-three.

'''Rinchingiin Elbegdorj''' ({{lang-mn|Ринчингийн Элбэгдорж}}; {{lang-ru| Элбе́к-Доржи́ Ринчино}}, ''Ėlbek-Dorzhi Rinchino''; May 16, 1888 –June 10, 1938) was a [[Buryat people|Buryat]] revolutionary who played leading roles in the [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921]] and the early political development of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="sanders"&gt;Alan J. K. Sanders Historical dictionary of Mongolia. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-4434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Elbegdorj was born on May 16, 1888 into a herding family in [[Barguzinsky District]], [[Transbaikal]]. He became a communist around 1910 while studying at [[Saint Petersburg State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baabar|title=History of Mongolia|year=1999|publisher=Monsudar Publishing|location=Cambridge|isbn=9992900385|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then moved to [[Troitskosavsk]] where he wrote for a local newspaper and traveled throughout Mongolia, becoming involved in clandestine Mongolian revolutionary activities. Elbegdorj befriended a young [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] in [[Irkutsk]] between 1914 and 1918 and became a strong early influence on future Mongolian leader.&lt;ref&gt;Baabar 1999, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution of 1921==

By 1920, Elbegdorj's connection to Mongolian revolutionary groups and his expertise on Mongolian affairs made him an indispensable part of Soviet efforts to steer Mongolia's early revolutionary development. In 1920 he organized the first meetings between Mongolian revolutionaries and members of the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Fifth Red Army and acted as the group's Russian interpreter.  He also accompanied delegates [[Soliin Danzan]] and [[Dambyn Chagdarjav]] to [[Moscow]] where they met Russian communist leader [[Nikolay Bukharin]].  He was also a guiding presence at the first secret meeting of the [[Mongolian People's Party]] held in Troitskosavsk from March 1–3, 1921 (later known as the First Party Congress of the MPRP) where the provisional revolutionary government of Mongolia was established.

Following the [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921]] Elbegdorj was appointed head of the Mongolian army training and education department. Along with Choibalsan, he established the radicalized Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL), through which he exerted a strong influence on the political orientation of Mongolian revolutionary policy in its early years.  By this time he was recognized as one of the leading figures of Mongolia's revolutionary government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bawden|first=C.R.|title=The Modern History of Mongolia|year=1989|publisher=Kegan Paul International Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-7103-0326-2|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the backing he enjoyed from Moscow, he came to dominate the political scene in [[Ulan Bator]], often emerging as victor from party infighting.&lt;ref&gt;Baabar 1999, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he successfully collaborated with Soliin Danzan and [[Damdin Sükhbaatar]] to eliminate Prime Minister [[Dogsomyn Bodoo]] in a power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Baabar 1999, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third Party Congress of 1924==
[[File:Danzan.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Soliin Danzan]]
After the purge of Bodoo, a rivalry developed between Elbegdorj and Danzan that came to a head at the Third Party Congress in 1924. Danzan had angered Elbegdorj and the [[Comintern]] when he sought to reduce the number of Soviet advisers in Mongolia, attempted to bring the radicalized Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL) under party control, and resisted Soviet advice that Mongolia bypass capitalism and move directly to socialism. Recognized as leader of the party's leftist faction, Elbegdorj joined with rightists under [[Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj]] to orchestrate Danzan's the arrest and execution.  At the Third Party Congress Danzan was Officially accused of representing bourgeois interests and engaging in business with Chinese firms.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2003, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a day Danzan and several colleagues were arrested and executed, sending a shock wave through the party that solidified Soviet dominance of Mongolian politics.

In the wake of the Third Party Congress, Rightists under Dambadorj assumed control and, during a period later referred to as the “Right Opportunism” (1925-1928), promoted rightist policies mirroring Lenin’s [[New Economic Policy]] in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lattimore|first=Owen|title=Nomads and Commissars: Mongolia Revisited|year=1962|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=1258086107|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elbegdorj helped draft the country's 1924 Constitution (based largely on the Soviet constitution),&lt;ref&gt;Baabar 1999, p 270&lt;/ref&gt;  but soon thereafter saw his influence wane with the appointment of [[Turar Ryskulov]] as the new chief [[Comintern]] adviser in Ulaanbaatar in 1924.

By 1925 Elbegdorj was accused of being a ''bourgeois'' nationalist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rupen|first=Robert|title=How Mongolia Is Really Ruled|year=1979|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=081797122X|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose pan-Mongolian sentiments, expressed at the Third Party Congress in 1924, were seen as contrary to communist policy.  The power struggle between Ryskulov and Elbegdorj eventually resulted in both being recalled to Moscow in 1928.  He then taught at the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]] training many of the young MPRP members who attended the school. Elbegdorj was arrested in 1937 during the [[Great Purge]], sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court on June 4, 1938 and executed on June 10, 1938.

He was rehabilitated in 1957.

Historically, [[Mongolia]] had royal families such as [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] of the [[Göktürks]], the [[Borjigin]] of the [[Mongols]] and the [[Choros]] clan of the [[Oirats]], etc. Most Mongol rulers since the 13th century were descendants of [[Genghis Khan]], or tried to trace their lineage to him.

The term '''Mongolian Royal Family''' refers to the family of Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], the puppet ruler of [[Mengjiang]], a part of [[Inner Mongolia]] controlled by the Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

* [[Demchugdongrub]], Mongol prince and ruler of Mengjiang
* [[Namuzilewangchuke]], Demchugdongrub's father and the chief of the [[Xilinguole Alliance]]
* Taijide princess, Demchugdongrub's wife

'''Sayyed Ajami''' (سيد عجمي) was arrested in September 1998 in the United Kingdom, and accused of membership in [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|al-Jihad]].&lt;ref name="csisJaballah"&gt;[[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], [http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/Jaballah.pdf Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Mahmoud Jaballah], 22 February 2008.

Suharto was born in a small village, [[Kemusuk]], in the Godean area near the city of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], during the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Soeharto, as related to G.

During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], Suharto served in Japanese-organised Indonesian security forces. [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesia's independence struggle]] saw his joining the newly formed Indonesian army. Suharto rose to the rank of major general following Indonesian independence.

Support for Suharto's presidency was strong throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, the New Order's [[authoritarianism]] and widespread corruption&lt;ref&gt;estimates of government funds misappropriated by the Suharto family range from US$1.5 billion and US,5 billion.({{cite news |last=Ignatius |first=Adi |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1660967,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-sidebar |title=Mulls Indonesia Court Ruling |work=Time |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2009 }}); Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece "Suharto dead at 86"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; were a source of discontent and, following a [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis#Indonesia|severe financial crisis]], led to [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|widespread unrest]] and [[Fall of Suharto|his resignation in May 1998]]. Suharto died in 2008 and was given a state funeral.

The legacy of Suharto's 31-year rule is debated both in Indonesia and abroad. Under his "[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]" administration, Suharto constructed a strong, centralised and military-dominated government. An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the [[Cold War]]. For most of his presidency, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialisation,&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Main article|Early life and career of Suharto}}
Suharto was born on 8 June 1921 during the [[Dutch East Indies]] era, in a plaited-bamboo-walled house in the hamlet of [[Kemusuk]], a part of the larger village of Godean. The village is {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} west of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], the cultural heartland of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]].&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O2IYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260 Historical Dictionary of U.S. Diplomacy since the Cold War]''. Scarecrow Press; 10 September 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-6432-0}}. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Born to ethnic Javanese parents, he was the only child of his father's second marriage. His father, Kertosudiro, had two children from his previous marriage, and was a village irrigation official. His mother, Sukirah, a local woman, was distantly related to [[Hamengkubuwana V]] by his first concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Tempo'' (Jakarta), 11 November 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suharto and Ibu Tien.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Official portrait of Suharto and First Lady Siti Hartinah.]]

Five weeks after Suharto's birth, his mother suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and he was placed in the care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 10"&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 10" /&gt; In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 11"&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquinted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' ("shaman") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ELSON1"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 1–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].&lt;ref name=globe&gt;Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece "Suharto dead at 86"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called "[[Hajji|Haji]]" or "el-Haj Mohammed Suharto" but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling "Suharto" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was "Soeharto" but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in [[anti-colonialism]], or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.&lt;ref name="ELSON1"/&gt;

==Military career==
{{Main article|Early life and career of Suharto}}

===World War II and Japanese occupation===
{{See also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}

Suharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1980), pages 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, pages 13"&gt;McDonald (1980), pages 13&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].&lt;ref name="ELSON2"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, pages 13" /&gt; In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or "way of the warrior", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.&lt;ref name="ELSON3"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta, until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February [[1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].

===Indonesian National Revolution===
{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}

Two days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]], and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment in accordance with orders from the Japanese command, and returned to Yogyakarta.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 14"&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. On the basis of his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 14" /&gt; Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around [[Magelang]] and [[Semarang]], and was subsequently appointed head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.&lt;ref name="ELSON4"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 14–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T ("Tiger") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.&lt;ref name="ELSON5"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 15–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the "[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for defence of the west and southwest of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet [[Musso]], chairman of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the [[Madiun Affair|communist uprising in Madiun]].&lt;ref name="ELSON6" /&gt;

[[File:Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947]]

In December 1948, the Dutch launched "[[Operatie Kraai|Operation Crow]]", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital [[Yogyakarta]]. Suharto was appointed to lead the ''Wehrkreise III'', consisting of two battalions, which waged guerilla warfare against the Dutch from the hills south of [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref name="ELSON6"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 20–25, 28–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto's forces and local militia recaptured the city, holding it until noon.&lt;ref&gt;Soeharto, G. Dwipayana &amp; Ramadhan K.H. (1989), pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto's later accounts had him as the lone plotter, although other sources say Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] of Yogyakarta, and the Panglima of the Third Division, ordered the attack. However, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Abdul Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the "General Offensive" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 29–38, 42–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Revolution, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati ("[[Titiek Suharto]]", born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce{{clarify|date=April 2014}} to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role. The commercial dealings{{clarify|date=April 2014}} of Tien, her children and grandchildren became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto's presidency.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

===Post-Independence military career===
[[File:Suharto family.jpg|thumb|Suharto with his wife and six children in 1967]]
In the years following Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian National Army]], primarily in [[Java]]. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the [[Makassar Uprising]], a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established [[State of East Indonesia]] and its federal entity, the [[United States of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =24–25 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his year in [[Makassar]], Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son [[Jusuf Habibie|BJ Habibie]] was later Suharto's vice-president, and went on to succeed him as President. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the [[Klaten]] area of [[Central Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | page =25 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the [[Mount Merapi]] area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops. His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 52–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suharto as the commander of Kostrad.jpg|256px|left|thumb|In his office as the head of the Strategic Reserve, 1963]]
Between 1956 and 1959, he served in the important position of commander of Diponegoro Division based in [[Semarang]], responsible for Central Java and [[Yogyakarta]] provinces. His relationship with prominent businessmen [[Sudono Salim|Liem Sioe Liong]] and [[Bob Hasan]], which extended throughout his presidency, began in Central Java, where he was involved in a series of "profit generating" enterprises conducted primarily to keep the poorly funded military unit functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =30–31 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army anti-corruption investigations implicated Suharto in a 1959 smuggling scandal. Relieved of his position, he was transferred to the army's Staff and Command School (''Seskoad'') in the city of [[Bandung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =31–32 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Bandung, he was promoted to brigadier-general, and in late 1960, promoted to army deputy chief of staff.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; On 6 March 1961, he was given an additional command, as head of the army's new Strategic Reserve (''Korps Tentara I Cadangan Umum AD'', later [[KOSTRAD]]), a ready-reaction air-mobile force based in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sejarah : Kostrad |url=http://kostrad.mil.id/sejarah/|language=id |website=Kostrad |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1962, Suharto was promoted to the rank of [[major general]] and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in [[Makassar]]. This formed the military side of the campaign to win [[western New Guinea]] from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that ''Konfrontasi'' would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, [[Ali Murtopo]], to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==
{{Main article|Transition to the New Order}}

===Background===
{{See also|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}

Tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI’s proposal for a "fifth armed force" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army’s leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the "[[Gilchrist Document]]" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he mentioned repeatedly during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes, and warned the Army not to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;Dake, Antonie (2006). Sukarno Files. Yayasan Obor&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled.  Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared imminent establishment of communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had 3 million members, and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. PKI has become the strongest political party in Indonesia.

===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===
{{Main article|30 September Movement|Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966}}

[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals, 5 October 1965.]]

Before dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 281&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre. At 7:10&amp;nbsp;am [[Untung Syamsuri|Untung bin Sjamsuri]] announced on radio that the "[[30 September Movement]]" had forestalled a coup attempt on [[Sukarno]] by "CIA-backed power-mad generals", and that it was "an internal army affair". The 30 September Movement never made any attempt on Suharto's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), page 156&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto had been in Jakarta army hospital that evening with his three-year-old son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] who had a scalding injury. It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of [[30 September Movement]] and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist, hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.&lt;ref name="Friend-2003_p104"&gt;Friend (2003), page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilized [[KOSTRAD]] and RPKAD (now [[Kopassus]]) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm that six generals had been kidnapped by "counter-revolutionaries" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto issued an ultimatum to [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Air Force Base]], where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander [[Omar Dhani]] and PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the air base on 2 October after short fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; With the failure of the poorly organised coup,&lt;ref name="Ricklefs-1991_p281-282"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pages 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.

Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the [[Orde Baru|"New Order"]], was that the PKI was solely responsible. A propaganda campaign by the army, and Islamic and Catholic student groups, convinced both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup attempt, and that the killings were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes.&lt;ref name="Vickers-2005_p157"&gt;Vickers (2005), page 157&lt;/ref&gt; The army in alliance with religious civilian groups led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government, and armed forces of the communist party and leftist organisations.&lt;ref name="Vickers-2005_p157" /&gt; The purge spread from Jakarta to much of the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 287&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966]]). The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Power struggle===
{{See also|Supersemar}}

Sukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, page 160"&gt;Vickers (2005), page 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966, university students under the banner of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pages 288 - 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966).&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages = 130–135"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 130–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]] in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&amp;nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see ''[[Supersemar]]'') that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, page 160" /&gt;

Using the ''Supersemar'' letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day, and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each services.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages = 130–135"/&gt;

In June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[Marxism–Leninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002, pages 267-270" &gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267-270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002, page 107" &gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among certain elements of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1992), p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto [[Acting presidency of Suharto|acting president]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukarno was placed under house arrest in [[Bogor Palace]]; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1994, page 2"&gt;Schwartz (1994), page 2&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto for the first of his five-year terms as President.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "New Order" (1967–1998)==
{{See also|New Order (Indonesia)}}

===Ideology===
Suharto promoted his "New Order", as opposed to Sukarno's "Old Order", as a society based on the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] ideology. After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as basic principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as "anti-Pancasila".&lt;ref name="epress.anu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |title='2 Soeharto’s Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto’s New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &amp;#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Order also implemented the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' ("Dual Function") policy enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.

===Consolidation of power===
{{See also|Acting presidency of Suharto}}

[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto is appointed President of Indonesia at a ceremony, 27 March 1968]]

Having been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his "Office of Personal Assistants" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Having successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]], [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed "New Order Radicals") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant [[North Sumatera]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''Angkatan '66'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections ("''Golput''" movement), the costly construction of the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures [[Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti]], Adnan Buyung Nasution, Hariman Siregar, and Sjahrir), and even sending  troops to occupy the campus of ITB ([[Bandung Institute of Technology]]) from January–March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing decree on "Normalization of Campus Life" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;Wanandi, 2012, pp. 60–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aspinal (1999), p.ii&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in [[Jakarta]] during a visit by Japanese prime minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General [[Sumitro]], deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilize the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred as the [[Malari incident|Malari Incident (''Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari'' / Disaster of 15 January)]]. However, Suharto also disbandedAspri to appease popular dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025707/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm|date=7 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]] which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.&lt;ref&gt;Wanandi, 2012, pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic politics and security===
{{seealso|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Papua conflict}}
To placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1982), p.76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p.184–186&lt;/ref&gt;

To participate in the elections, Suharto realized the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto decided to take-over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called [[Golkar]] ("Functional Group") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[Indonesian legislative election, 1971|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of "development", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, [[Golkar]] managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1992), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into [[United Development Party|PPP]] (''Partai Persatuan Pembangunan''/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]] (''Partai Demokrasi Indonesia''/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the "re-call" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the "[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1992), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition.  For all intents and purposes, he held all governing power in the nation.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Suharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized "floating mass" supportive of the national mission of "development", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the [[Indonesian National Civil Service Corps]] (''Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia'' or ''Korpri'') in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organized the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimilation of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of so-called "Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were encouraged to take-up [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful family-planning program (''Keluarga Berentjana / KB'') to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (1994), page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the [[Santa Cruz massacre]] of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].]] 
Suharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organized by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' ("Dual Function") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorized ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in [[Blitar]] area in 1968, and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy (2003), p. 262–265&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

To comply with [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organizing for a so-called "[[Act of Free Choice]]" scheduled for July–August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organized militia (''[[Papuan Volunteer Corps|Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK]]'') at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channeled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p. 178–279&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Präsident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]

To stabilize the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto’s administration enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the "[[Berkeley Mafia]]", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments in 1967 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, "The New Order and the Economy," Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] / [[International Nickel Company]]. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].&lt;ref name="Robinson 2012, p. 178-203"&gt;Robinson (2012), p. 178–203&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt; With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun'') I to VI from 1969 to 1998.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson 2012, p. 178-203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheridan-theaustralian"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organizations ("''yayasan''") run by the military and his family members, which extracted "donations" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits. While some proceeds were used for charitable purposes, much of the money was re-cycled as slush fund to reward political allies and to maintain support for the New Order.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

In 1975, the state-owned oil company, [[Pertamina]], defaulted on its foreign loans as a result of mismanagement and corruption under the leadership of Suharto’s close ally, [[Ibnu Sutowo]]. The government bail-out of the company nearly doubled the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Schwatrz (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
[[File:SuhartoNAMLusaka1970.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto attends 1970 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka]].]]

Upon assuming power, Suharto government adopted policy of neutrality in the [[Cold War]], but was nevertheless quietly aligned with the Western bloc (including Japan and [[South Korea]]) with the objective of securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with [[Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organization is designed to establish peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as ongoing [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

In 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the left wing populist [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford]] and Australian prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorized full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The "encirclement and annihilation" campaigns of 1977–1979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerilla resistance caused the government to maintain strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974–1999)]]; namely, 17,600–19,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]] during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Socio-economic progress and growing corruption===
[[File:Soeharto as President of Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Suharto's official portrait from 1983–1988. As President, Suharto was dubbed, "The Father of Development" due to his many development projects.]]
Real socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites); consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalize on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of "Father of Development".&lt;ref&gt;Rock (2003), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrollment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Rock (2003), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labor-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialization was mostly undertaken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] companies which evolved into immense conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his "regime maintenance" activities.&lt;ref name="Deepblue.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40018/wp632.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Politics of Development Policy and Development Policy Reform in New Order Indonesia |publisher=Deepblue.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the "October Package of 1988" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' program to the populace. The [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded a "bull run", due to a spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPOs]] and an influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fueled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf|title=Bank Indonesia|publisher=Bi.go.id|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the economy coincided with rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] ("Tutut"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra ("Tommy")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was monopolized by Tutut, the national car project monopolized by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolized by [[21 Cineplex]] (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000&amp;nbsp;km² of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&amp;nbsp;m² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish "strategic partnerships" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in "donations" from the public and private sectors each year.&lt;ref name="BBC_20040325"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings |publisher=BBC News | date= 25 March 2004 | accessdate=4 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Corruption Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen USD, the highest ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion – $35 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4450/26759/file/GCR_2004_press_release_FINAL.pdf|title=Plundering politicians and bribing multinationals undermine economic development, says TI|publisher=Transparency International|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s===
[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]

By the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p.457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see "[[Petrus Killings]]"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The [[Tanjung Priok massacre]] saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of [[Borobudur]], led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (later leader of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by a resurgent [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license (''SIUPP'') which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinal (1999), pp. ii–iii&lt;/ref&gt;

Western concern over communism waned with end of [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p.510–511&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani’s criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the President dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly "de-militarize" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Pour (2007), p.242–264&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suharto and wife after hajj.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Suharto and his wife in Islamic attire after performing hajj in 1991]]
In an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto begin courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protégé [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].&lt;ref name="Elson 2001, p.211-214"&gt;Elson (2001), p.211-214&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as [[Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Janet|title=Wars Within: The Story of Tempo, an Independent Magazine in Soeharto's Indonesia|date=2005|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9793780088|page=234-235 |edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development, were becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fueling demands for "[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p. 284-287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic crisis and resignation===

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the [[Indonesian rupiah]] to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.&lt;ref name="CountryBrief"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data &amp; Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.

In December 1997, Suharto for the first time did not attend an [[ASEAN]] presidents' summit, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. [[Golkar]] won the rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|1997 MPR elections]] and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] became Minister of Social Affairs). The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability,&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 314"&gt;Friend (2003), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 314; Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v&lt;/ref&gt; The Government increased the fuel prices further by 70% on May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in [[Medan]].&lt;ref&gt;Purdey (2006), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]], spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Elson (2001), p.267&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]]. [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities]] over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Prabowo]], and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.&lt;ref&gt;Purdey (2006), p.148-150&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of [[DPR/MPR Building|the parliament building]]. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.&lt;ref&gt;Wiranto (2003), p.67-69&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, pp. 203–207"&gt;Vickers (2005), pp. 203–207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Aspinall, H. Feith, and G. Van Klinken (eds) The Last Days of President Suharto, Monash Asia Institute, pp.iv-vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently-released documents from the United States Department of State indicate that the Clinton Administration sought to maintain close ties with the Indonesian military in the aftermath of Suharto's fall from power. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Promoted Close Ties to Indonesian Military as Suharto’s Rule Came to an End in Spring 1998|editor=Brad Simpson|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/indonesia/2018-07-24/us-promoted-close-ties-indonesian-military-suhartos-rule-came-end|accessdate=August 2, 2018|date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
{{See also|Corruption charges against Suharto}}
After resigning from the presidency, Suharto reclused himself in his family compound in the [[Menteng]] area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family spend much of their time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President [[BJ Habibie|Habibie]] and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minihub.org/siarlist/msg02067.html |title=Rekaman Habibie-Ghalib |publisher=Minihub.org |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116055010/http://www.minihub.org/siarlist/msg02067.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1999, [[Time (magazine)|''Time Asia'']] estimated Suharto's family fortune at US$15 billion in cash, [[shares]], corporate assets, real estate, jewellery and fine art. Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than $US 27 billion in damages for [[libel]] over the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=From correspondents in Jakarta |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22396808-5005961,00.html |title=News.com.au, Suharto wins $128&amp;nbsp;m in damages |publisher=News.com.au |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017221608/http://news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C22396808-5005961%2C00.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2007, Indonesia's Supreme Court awarded Suharto [[damages]] against ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Asia]]'' [[News magazine|magazine]], ordering it to pay him one trillion [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the [[judgment (law)|judgement]] of an [[appellate court]] and [[Central Jakarta]] [[district court]] (made in 2000 and 2001).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Suharto was placed highest on [[Transparency International]]'s list of corrupt leaders with an alleged misappropriation of between US $15–35 billion during his 32-year presidency.&lt;ref name="BBC_20040325" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Corruption Report"/&gt;

On 29 May 2000, Suharto was placed under [[house arrest]] when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of a number of foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110&amp;nbsp;m (£55&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7315976.stm |title=Suharto charity told to pay $110&amp;nbsp;m| publisher=BBC News | date=27 March 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Suharto's son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]], was sentenced to 15 years' jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession and fleeing justice. In 2006, he was freed on "conditional release".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6098010.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Tommy Suharto freed from prison |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Suharto's half-brother [[Probosutedjo]] was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the "judicial mafia" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on 30 November 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 9 July 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto, to recover state funds ($440&amp;nbsp;m or £219&amp;nbsp;m, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).&lt;ref name="BBC_9July"&gt;{{cite news | title= Civil suit filed against Suharto | date= 9 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6283322.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health crises===
After resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial.  Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial. One physician, Brigadier-General Dr Marjo Subiandono, stated his doubts about by noting that "[Suharto] has two permanent cerebral defects."&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news | title=Former Indonesian dictator unfit to stand trial&amp;nbsp;— doctor | date= 23 April 2006 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/former-indonesian-dictator-unfit-to-stand-trial--doctor/2006/04/22/1145344319571.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later ''[[Financial Times]]'' report, Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re-examination, and called it part of a "last opportunity" to prosecute Suharto criminally. Attorney General Abdurrahman left open the possibility of filing suit against the Suharto estate.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news | last=Donnan | first=Shawn | title=Jakarta makes final attempt to pursue Suharto charges | date=28 April 2006 | work=[[Financial Times]] | url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/9bd74ff6-d652-11da-8b3a-0000779e2340.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070521050607/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/9bd74ff6-d652-11da-8b3a-0000779e2340.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=21 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 4 January 2008, Suharto was taken to the [[Pertamina]] hospital, [[Jakarta]] with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/client/pagesdetails.asp?nid=10341&amp;ccid=18 |title=Indonesia's ailing Suharto 'getting worse': doctors |work=The Times |location=UK |date=5 January 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His health fluctuated for several weeks but progressively worsened with [[anaemia]] and low [[blood pressure]] due to heart and kidney complications, internal bleeding, fluid on his lungs, and blood in his faeces and urine which caused a [[haemoglobin]] drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7176176.stm |title=Suharto condition 'deteriorating' |publisher=BBC News |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January, Suharto's health worsened further, as a [[sepsis]] infection spread through his body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejakartapost.com/detailgeneral.asp?fileid=20080123111200&amp;irec=5 Jakarta Post, ''Suharto's health deteriorates, infection spreads'', 24 January 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131225724/http://thejakartapost.com/detailgeneral.asp?fileid=20080123111200&amp;irec=5 |date=31 January 2008 }}; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080131235505/http://news.okezone.com/index.php/ReadStory/2008/01/27/1/78448/soeharto-kritis-100-pernafasan-pakai-ventilator OkeZone.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His family consented to the removal of life support machines, and he died on 27 January at 1:10&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7211565.stm |title=Indonesia ex-leader Suharto dies |publisher=BBC News |date=27 January 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2008/01/2008525125442432751.html |title=Asia-Pacific&amp;nbsp;— Suharto has multiple organ failure |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minutes after his death, then former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a news conference declaring Suharto as one of Indonesia's "best sons" and invited the country to give the highest respect and honor to the ex-president.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2008/01/27/055116274/soeharto-meninggal-sby-batalkan-kunjungan-ke-bali | title=Soeharto Meninggal, SBY Batalkan Kunjungan Ke Bali  | publisher=Tempo  | date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto's body was taken from Jakarta to the [[Giri Bangun]] mausoleum complex near the Central Java city of [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]. He was buried alongside his late wife in a state military funeral with full honours, with the [[Kopassus]] elite forces and [[KOSTRAD]] commandos as the honour guard and pallbearers and Commander of Group II Kopassus Surakarta Lt.

'''William Henry Channing''' (May 25, 1810 – December 23, 1884) was an American Unitarian clergyman, writer and philosopher.

==Biography==
William Henry Channing was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Channing's father, Francis Dana Channing, died when he was an infant,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and responsibility for the young man's education was assumed by his uncle, [[William Ellery Channing]], the pre-eminent [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theologian of the early nineteenth century. The younger William graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] in 1829 and from [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1833. He was ordained and installed over the Unitarian church in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in 1835. He became warmly interested in the schemes of [[Charles Fourier]] and others for social reorganization. He moved to Boston about 1847, afterward to [[Rochester, New York]] and to New York City, where, both as preacher and editor, he became a leader in a movement of [[Christian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Channing, William Ellery|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an early supporter of the [[socialism|socialistic movement]] in the United States, he was editor of the ''Present'', the ''Spirit of the Age'' and the ''Harbinger''. In 1848 he presided over The Religious Union of Associationists in Boston, a socialist group which included many members of the [[Brook Farm]] commune.

Channing took active part in the early years of the woman’s rights movement. He signed the call for and attended the first [[National Woman's Rights Convention]] in 1850, where he was appointed to the National Women’s Rights Central Committee.&lt;ref name=million/&gt;  As minister of the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]] in 1852, he influenced [[Susan B. Anthony]], a member of his congregation who was a young schoolteacher on the threshold of her career as a women's rights activist.  [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], Anthony's close friend and co-worker, said in her autobiography that, "She [Anthony] first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eighty years and more (1815-1897): Reminiscences of Elizabeth Cady Stanton |last= Stanton |first= Elizabeth Cady |year=1898 |publisher= European Publishing Co. |location=New York |isbn= |pages=160–161 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xooEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing wrote the call for and played a leading role in the Women's Rights Convention that Anthony organized in Rochester in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony |last=Harper |first=Ida Husted | year=1898–1908|publisher=Hollenbeck Press |location=Indianapolis|pages=104–105 |url= https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n155/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention launched a petition campaign for equal legal and voting rights for women, for which Channing wrote the petitions and, with [[Ernestine Rose]], addressed a select committee of the New York Senate in February 1854.&lt;ref name=million&gt;Million, Joelle (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement''], Praeger {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 106, 293 note 26, 167-168, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1854-1857, Channing was minister at [[Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel]] in [[Liverpool]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Further Letters of Mrs. Gaskell |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Chapple |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Shelston |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-71906-771-6 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZaNtFTA6LAC&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, he succeeded [[James Martineau]] as minister of the [[Hope Street Unitarian Chapel]], Liverpool, England. At the commencement of the American Civil War, he returned (1862) and took charge of the Unitarian church in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D. C.]] William Henry Channing, along with the younger [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]], was a [[Transcendentalist]].  He was a prolific writer, contributing to the ''[[North American Review]]'', the ''[[The Dial|Dial]]'', the ''[[The Christian Examiner|Christian Examiner]]'', and other serials, a member of the [[Transcendental Club]], a close friend of [[Henry David Thoreau]] and corresponded with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Among his inspirational writings, one piece, his "Symphony", is well-known:

:''To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly,  talk gently, await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common — this is my symphony.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Octavius Brooks Frothingham]] (1886) [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6vpuBiZ5MgC&amp;pg=PA166 ''Memoir of William Henry Channing'', p. 166], Houghton, Mifflin and Company, New York and Boston&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Channing was, in 1863 and 1864, the [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives]].  He died in London.

In 1988, he claimed to invest RMB$1.2 million in a [[knitting]] factory in his hometown, but he intended to build a hotel instead, although investments in [[Privately held company|private]] hotels were forbidden at that time. However, as soon as the construction was completed, the government policy was changed to allow private owners to have their hotels. Then Xu became the owner of the first private three-star hotel in China. He then started to invest into developing residential complexes and resorts in Fujian.

In the 1990s, he pushed his [[real estate]] business into [[Beijing]] and Shanghai. He undertook several property ventures in Australia in the 1990s. In 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported he had moved his family to {{NTcity|Darwin}}, Australia.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-selfmade-australian-billionaire-that-nobody-knows-20140708-zt08r.html|title=The self-made Australian billionaire that nobody knows|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his [[Master of Business Administration]] via distance-learning from an [[Adelaide]] university&lt;ref name=smartcompany/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; and invested in real estate in the early 1990s. During the 2003-04 year, Xu was the largest individual donor to the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|NSW branch]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref name=smartcompany/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

In the 2000s (decade), he expanded his business by acquiring [[Listing (finance)|listed companies]] including Shimao Holdings (listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]]) and Shimao International (previously listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]), while the latter was privatized by him in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notice.singtao.com/ADMA/00813/epdf/813.pdf MAJOR AND CONNECTED TRANSACTION] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520040238/http://notice.singtao.com/ADMA/00813/epdf/813.pdf |date=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shimao Property was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29titans.html?pagewanted=all|title=Billionaire Builder of China|work=New York Times|date=29 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other investments===
In 2008 it was rumoured that Xu was interested in buying [[Newcastle United F.C.]] from under fire owner Mike Ashley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1055615/EXCLUSIVE-Newcastle-sale--fans-protest-Ashley-slump-defeat.html|title=Newcastle up for sale|work=Daily Mail|location=United Kingdom|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1461">'''Zacharias Longuelune''' (1669—November 30, 1748) was a [[France|French]] architect and master builder who worked in the second half of his life for the royal court in [[Dresden]]. His design style was [[French Baroque and Classicism]].

Longuelune was born in [[Paris]]. After working in [[Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]] for [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and travelling to [[Italy]], he settled in Dresden in 1713 where he became Senior State Architect (''Oberlandbaumeister'') in 1731 for the Elector of Saxony, [[Augustus II the Strong]]. His works include the park at Grosssedlitz (1719–1732), the Riverside Palace and the water stairs at [[Pillnitz Castle]] (1720–1725) and part of the [[Japanisches Palais]] (from 1729 with court architect [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Löffler, ''Das Alte Dresden: Geschichte seiner Bauten'',  16th ed.

He died in [[Dresden]] in 1748.
