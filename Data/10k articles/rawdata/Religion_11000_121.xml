'''''A Scientific Theology''''' is a set of three books by [[Alister McGrath]] that explores the parallels between the working assumptions and methods of [[Christian theology]] and those of the [[natural sciences]].  ''Scientific Theology'' is also the "running title" of the project which gave rise to the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McGrath | first = A | authorlink = Alister McGrath | url = http://asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2004/PSCF12-04McGrath.pdf | title = On Writing a Scientific Theology: A Response to Ross H. McKenzie | journal = [[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | year = 2004 | format = pdf | pages =  255–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is preceded by three volumes that McGrath describes as "landmarks" in the development of his [[scientific theology]]: ''The Genesis of Doctrine: A Study in the Foundations of Doctrinal Criticism'', ''The Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion'' and ''[[Thomas F. Torrance]]: An Intellectual Biography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mcgrath/scitheo.html Scientific Theology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831133425/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mcgrath/scitheo.html |date=August 31, 2009 }}, [[Alister McGrath]]&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy was later summarised in ''The Science of God.'' McGrath is working on a "scientific [[dogmatics]]" which will deal with the content of Christian theology following the method developed in the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-c) p.297&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of "scientific theology"==

===Overview===
Since at least the time of the 2nd century apologists&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert McQueen. ''Greek Apologists of the Second Century''. London: SCM Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian theology has sought to relate itself to major intellectual trends. In earlier periods this meant engagement with Platonism and Aristotelianism. But as these philosophical systems waned under the increasing influence of natural philosophy (later "science") so Christian theology increasingly tended to focus on engagement with the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Ferngren, Gary B, ed. ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

This engagement would eventually lead to the idea that Christian Theology itself should be "scientific" and by the earlier part of the 20th century calls were being made for a "scientific theology."&lt;ref&gt;See, for example{{cite journal | last = Ackerman | first = H.C. | title = A Plea for a Scientific Theology | journal = The Biblical World | volume = 52 | issue = 2 |date=September 1918 | pages =  195–199 | doi = 10.1086/476116}}; {{cite journal | last = Slosson | first = Edwin E. | title = A Plea for a Scientific Theology | journal = The Scientific Monthly | volume = 17 | issue = 6 |date=December 1923 | pages =  621–622}}&lt;/ref&gt; This call has been answered in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;See particularly {{Cite book | last= Sharpe | first=Kevin J. | title=Science of God: Truth in the Age of Science | year=2006 | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location=Lanham, MD
|isbn=978-0-7425-4266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These various approaches to "scientific theology" may be loosely categorised as "methodological" or "doctrinal" depending upon their primary focus. These concerns, however, are by no means mutually exclusive.

A "methodological" approach is concerned with practicing theology in a "scientific" manner and focuses on clearly articulating the assumptions, methods, and related thought-forms to be taken into account in the construction of dogmatic formulations.

A "doctrinal" approach is concerned with the inter-relationship of scientific and doctrinal content and focuses on formulating Christian theology against a framework of specific scientific theorems.

===McGrath's approach to "scientific theology"===

By a “scientific theology” McGrath does not mean an attempt to reconcile particular Christian beliefs with particular scientific theorems. Such efforts are regarded by him as pointless because they become outdated with scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2004), pp.27-31&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, McGrath seeks to draw upon the proven assumptions and methods of the natural sciences in order to inform the practice of Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-a), p.48. cf. McGrath (2001-b), pp.165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an approach is grounded in the fundamental belief that Christian theology seeks to describe the same God who (in whatever way) created the natural order which the natural sciences seek to describe.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-b), p.227&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that a theological investigation of reality can be informed by the approach taken in a scientific investigation of reality.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, (2004), p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

It is critical to distinguish levels of reality so that each level is investigated according to its appropriate methods.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-b), pp.219-26, p.227. McGrath (2004), p.22, pp.27-31&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the reality of God and the contingent reality of the created order are taken as distinct although still related levels of reality. It is important to note that this is not regarded as a self-evident truth, but acknowledged to be a claim of Christian theology which is based in revelation.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the nature and place of revelation in a scientific theology see McGrath (2004), pp.209-10, pp.219-221&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the Christian understanding of revelation as disclosure of an objective reality that justifies, in McGrath's view, claims of a correspondence between the assumptions and methods of Christian theology and those of the natural sciences. He argues that just as the natural sciences are an investigation of the objective reality of the natural order, so Christian theology is an investigation of the (revealed) objective reality of God.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-b), pp.247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theology and the natural sciences, therefore, are both a response to reality and so must proceed ''a posteriori''-that is from observations (i.e. of revealed or natural data respectively) to dogmas/theorems.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-b), pp.123-124, pp.272-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, neither discipline confuses its theoretical constructs with the reality it seeks to describe. Both should be critical of their dogmas/theorems and constantly put them to the test. For Christian theology this means continually assessing Christian faith and practice against the revelation of God in Jesus Christ “the incarnate word.”&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-b), p.227, pp.297-313&lt;/ref&gt;

In this work McGrath commits himself to an approach that seeks to avoid the use of contemporary views of religion as found in the work of the distinguished [[Ian Barbour]] and [[Arthur Peacocke]], keeping instead to a classic Christian theological formulation (i.e., traditional [[Creed|credal]] Christian orthodoxy), which is a position closer to [[John Polkinghorne]] according to McGrath.&lt;ref&gt;"The Approach to Be Adopted" (pp.35-38). ''A Scientific Theology (Volume 1): Nature''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also when relating Christianity and science, the three volumes stress the ''provisionality''&lt;ref&gt;(italics are those of McGrath's from p. 47 of ''Nature (Volume 1)'')&lt;/ref&gt; of scientific understanding, findings, and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyLhKnPWOjEC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;vq=provisionality&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1#PPA45,M1 ''A Scientific Theology: Nature'' (p.45)] [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyLhKnPWOjEC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;vq=provisionality&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 ''A Scientific Theology: Nature'' (p.47)] [https://books.google.com/books?id=r3CTAtE3rjkC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;vq=provisionality&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 ''A Scientific Theology: Reality'' (p.166)]&lt;/ref&gt; This sort of provisionality makes relating Christianity to science very different from relating Christianity to fairly settled views such as [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyLhKnPWOjEC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;vq=provisionality&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1#PPA45,M1 ''A Scientific Theology: Nature'' (p.45)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Commenting that "[w]riting on method is a bit like clearing your throat before beginning a lecture. You can only go on so long before the audience starts to get a little restless." McGrath makes clear that the methodological concerns of ''A Scientific Theology'' constitute an extensive preliminary to the development of a systematic theology constructed according to the trilogy's methodological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-c), p.296&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Scientific Theology'' is intended by McGrath to be ecumenical in approach and valuable to Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and evangelical readers.&lt;ref&gt;"The specific form of scientific theology which this project advocates is based upon the affirmation of the intellectual resilience of traditional credal Christian orthodoxy, whose fundamental ideas are stated in the classic creeds of Christianity, and defended as living experienced realities by the great traditions of Christian theology - Catholicism, Orthodoxy and evangelicalism." (McGrath (2001-a), p.35)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to both McGrath's creedal commitments, ''A Scientific Theology'' is "a systematic work ''of theology''".&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-a), p.xix), emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt;

Due precisely to the scope of the work, McGrath felt led to prepare a short volume ''[[The Science of God]]'' which "is designed to introduce the distinctive themes and emphasis of this scientific theology to a wider readership"&lt;ref&gt;Alister McGrath, ''The Science of God'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2004), p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

In intent, the trilogy is a very ambitious project which seeks to lay a methodological groundwork for further theological reflection. In execution, McGrath himself acknowledges that it falls somewhat short of its goal. Writing in the conclusion to the third volume he explains;

{{quote|The process of unfolding what seemed like a bright idea back in 1976 has proved to be far more difficult than I had imagined, and its execution less satisfactory than I had hoped. Initially, it seemed to me that the vast spaciousness offered by these three volumes would be more than adequate to deal with the issues I knew had to be addressed in articulating a coherent and plausible vision of 'a scientific theology'. ... [however] What I had hoped might be extensive discussions of central methodolgical questions have ended up being rather shallow; what I had hoped to be close readings of seminal texts seem to have turned out to be little more than superficial engagements...I have certainly not achieved real closure on the issues which it aimed to address.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2001-c), p.295&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other Works of Relevance to the Scientific Theology Project==
&lt;!-- section added 5/06/07 to cater for works specifically related to the scientific theology project --&gt;
The three volumes of ''A Scientific Theology'' form part of a broader project which has issued in a number of other books by McGrath. The contents of these books, and their relation to the scientific theology project, are briefly described in this section.

===''The Science of God'' (2004)===
'''''The Science of God''''' is a small book prepared by McGrath to introduce the themes and emphases of ''A Scientific Theology'' to a wider readership.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief discussion see McGrath (2004), pp.x-xii&lt;/ref&gt; Four considerations guided its preparation;
#''Level:'' is less academic, assuming less about the reader's background knowledge in science, theology and philosophy.
#''Style:'' is popular rather than scholarly, with new sections prepared with a different audience in mind.
#''Length:'' is greatly reduced with many scholarly footnotes and extended discussions omitted.
#''Case Studies:'' in historical science and theology are no longer discussed in detail. Rather they are briefly noted and their relevance explained.
Fleming, noting the impact of McGrath's project, describes ''The Science of God'' as ''"an accessible place to begin following what is likely to become one of the most influential areas in the science-religion dialogue."''&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Fraser F., review of Alister E. McGrath, ''The Science of God: An Introduction to Scientific Theology'' in ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' (September 2005). http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Book%20Reviews2005-/9-05.html#McGrath.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume 1: Nature===
&lt;!-- Please place reviews in alphabetical order by reviewer name --&gt;

'''Willem B. Drees''', Leiden University, The Netherlands, offered a lengthy review of ''Volume 1: Nature'' in which he followed a summary of the work with a solid critique. There are three points at which Drees critiques McGrath throughout the review;

*''Theological Commitments:'' Drees is critical of McGrath’s focus on Christianity specifically rather than religion generally because although “defining religion(s) may be highly difficult...such difficulties are no excuse to dismiss the challenge of alternative worldviews or ways of being in the world.” Here, McGrath’s ‘Christian Orthodox’ theological orientation is seen as too narrow - it “works well for those who stand within a particular tradition” but it “communicates less convincingly with outsiders, or the potential outsider within the churches” - as well as somewhat artificial - is it “sufficiently coherent to count as a well defined position?” Furthermore, Drees suggests, McGrath's orthodoxy “covers up tensions” between Evangelical and Roman Catholic approaches in particular. McGrath’s critique (and hence rejection) of the “transient” theologies of an earlier generation is turned back upon McGrath’s own conservative position which “might be transient as well; “whatever it is, transience is not an argument.” McGrath’s appeal to ‘Scripture’ as normative is judged naïve and “McGrath’s problem awareness with respect to appeals to ‘nature’ is not matched by a similar care in his appeals to Scripture.” Although McGrath allows for dynamic in the ‘reception of doctrine’ this leaves unanswered the question as to which modifications are legitimate and which are not.
*''Method vs Content:'' Given that McGrath’s primary interest is avowedly methodological, Drees finds “somewhat surprising” that he offers criticism of those whose interests are primarily in the content of science (e.g. Ian Barbour, Arthur Peacocke) rather than engaging with those contemporary writers who focus primarily on method (e.g. Philip Clayton, Nancey Murphy, Mikael Stenmark, J. Wentzel van Huyssten). The idea that method is unchanging whilst content is highly provisional is criticised. In respects of the ''content'' of science Drees suggests that a threefold distinction between the increasingly provisional “consolidated knowledge,” “current research,” and “speculative reaches” of science would be helpful. In respects of the ''methods'' of science, Drees rejects a claim of stasis arguing that history shows that “ideas about method have changed as well.” On the content of scientific knowledge Drees remarks that "''Even though knowledge is in principle provisional, it seems unlikely that we will ever get rid of a spherical Earth, the Periodic Table, the million year long time scales of biologists and geologists, or the insight that humans are evolutionary close relatives of chimps and bonobo’s. Science is open ended in metaphysics, but consolidated in many substantial domains of knowledge.''" McGrath’s criticism of theologies grounded in the content of the natural sciences” is thus misplaced at two levels. First, grounding theology in science is not, in fact, what others in the field (Peacocke, Barbour) are doing. Second, a theology which avoids all engagement with the consolidated findings of contemporary science risks irrelevance.
*''Accuracy of representation of opposing views:'' McGrath’s claim that process theology (under the influence of Barbour) has become almost the “establishment” position is seen as curious given the widespread criticism of process theology by major thinkers associated with major institutions (Oxford, Cambridge, Berkley, the Zygon centre). Dree’s responds to McGrath’s critique of his own work strongly. Noting that he has already offered reply to one of McGrath’s primary sources (Griffin, ''Religion and Scientific Naturalism'', 1996), Drees acknowledges certain of McGrath’s criticisms in relation to his own “purely naturalistic approach to religion” but objects to McGrath’s citation of his claim that “a completely independent justification of naturalism is impossible” without citing the preceding passage which qualifies this remark. Citing further issues with McGrath’s engagement with his own work, Drees concludes that “given his theological interest, McGrath is right to disagree with me, but accurate analysis and criticism – of my writings and those of various others – is not the strength of his book.”

Drees concludes; “McGrath’s book is rich in historical detail and in footnotes (I wish they had been covered by the index as well) and very outspoken in its judgments … [but] I find the book falling short in the accuracy with which it deals with other positions and with complex issues such as the philosophical arguments pro and contra scientific realism...and theological realism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem B. Drees]], [http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000058/index.html Review of ''A Scientific Theology, Volume 1: Nature''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172042/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000058/index.html |date=December 1, 2008 }} in ''[[Ars Disputandi]]: The Online Journal for Philosophy of Religion'' '''2'''(2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Larry L. Rasmussen''', Reinhold Niebuhr Emeritus Professor of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary, considered ''A Scientific Theology: Volume 1, Nature'' to be “immensely learned and instructive.” After giving a brief summary of the volume’s themes and contents he concludes that McGrath is "in full command of the English and German language sources within what he calls 'the western intellectual community.'" However, Rasmussen finds “unsettling” McGrath's failure to move outside that community to engage with recent Christian sources – feminist and Two-Thirds World in particular – which in recent decades have challenged both McGrath’s streams of theology, and the epistemologies and philosophy of science. Thus, although McGrath sees his project as “a public theology,” Rasmussen considers that this “does not mean engagement with voices that dissent from his canon.” He concludes: “Given the ferment in both theology and science...this is an unfortunate omission in an otherwise learned undertaking.”&lt;ref name="Larry L 2003. pp. 292-293"/&gt;

'''Gregory Snyder''' in the ''Anglican Theological Review'' considered Volume 1 "a magisterial historical, philosophical, theological, and biblical treatise on "nature." By its end, I felt as if I had completed a seminary course in natural theology. It is well written, erudite, at times even provocative, and humorous. However, it is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a book to consume slowly and savor in one's study, notepad in hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3818/is_200407/ai_n9459407 | work=Anglican Theological Review | title=A Scientific Theology.

{{Religious text primary|date=October 2011}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Aaron''' was a [[Nephite]] missionary and one of the sons of [[Mosiah II|King Mosiah]].  He was also brother to the prophet [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]].  As related in the Book of Mormon narrative, Aaron and his three brothers (Ammon, [[Omner]], and [[Himni]]), left their father, and his people, to travel to the land of the [[Lamanite]]s in order to preach the gospel to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=17|verse=6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their sojourn there, Aaron was imprisoned and beaten,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=21|verse=13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually aided in the conversion of thousands of Lamanites, who later became the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|Anti-Nephi-Lehis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=23|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu i'''&lt;ref&gt;El-Leithy, ''Painted Wooden Stelae From Thebes'' in ''Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists'' by Jean Claude Goyon, Christine Cardin, published by Peeters Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|90-429-1717-2}}, {{ISBN|978-90-429-1717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''ꜥnḫ-f-n-ḫnsw''), also known as '''Ankh-af-na-khonsu''', was a priest of the Egyptian god [[Mentu]] who lived in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] during the 25th and 26th dynasty (c. 725 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;"To the same (man) belong sarcophagi Cairo 41001, 41001''bis'' and 41042 (Dyn. XXV-XXVI)". Abd el Hamid Zayed, "Painted Wooden Stelae in the Cairo Museum," ''Revue d'égytologie'' 20 (1968), pp. 149-152.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Bes-en-Mut I and Ta-neshet. Among practitioners of the modern religion of [[Thelema]], he is best known under the name of ''Ankh-af-na-khonsu'', and as the dedicant of the [[Stela of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|Stele of Revealing]], a wooden offering stela made to ensure his continued existence in the [[Duat|Netherworld]] now located in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.

==Meaning of the name==
Sr. Lutea, writing in ''The Scarlet Letter'', explains some of the words in his name:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A translation of the name might be close to the following: [[Ankh]] is both a tool and a symbol meaning 'new life.' The hyphen af is always part of another word that lends exclamatory force.&lt;ref&gt;''sic''; in fact the ''=f'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] is nothing more than the singular masculine suffix pronoun "he." It does not carry any "exclamatory force."&lt;/ref&gt; The word, na is generally used as a preposition, such as 'to, for, belonging to, through, or because.' Khonsu was the adopted son of Amun and Mut from the Theban triad. His name comes from a word meaning, 'to cross over' or 'wanderer' or 'he who traverses.' So, his entire name may be translated as 'the truth that has crossed over.'"&lt;ref&gt;Sr. Lutea. (2002). "[http://www.scarletwoman.org/scarletletter/v7n1/v7n1_egyptian.html Who And What Are Those Egyptian References In Liber Resh?]". ''The Scarlet Letter,'' Vol. VII, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lutea's interpretation is a free one that Egyptologists would tend to reject. A modern Egyptological approach would translate the name Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu (''ꜥnḫ-f-n-ḫnsw'') as "He lives for [[Khonsu]]"; the name is particularly common during the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Ranke. 1935.

==The Stela of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu==
{{Thelema}}
{{Main|Stela of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu}}
The [[Stela of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]] ([[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]] A 9422 [formerly Bulaq 666])is a painted, wooden offering [[stele]], discovered in 1858 at the [[mortuary temple]] of [[Hatshepsut]] at [[Dayr al-Bahri]] by [[Auguste Mariette|François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette]].&lt;ref&gt;In general, see Cynthia May Sheikholeslami. 2003. “The burials of the priests of Montu at Deir el-Bahari in the Theban necropolis.” In ''The Theban necropolis: Past, present and future'', edited by Nigel C. Strudwick and John H. Taylor. London: British Museum Press. 131–137.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one translation of the stela done in the [[Thelema|Thelemic]] perspective, it says of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...has left the multitudes and rejoined those who are in the light, he has opened the dwelling place of the stars; now then, the deceased, Ankh-af-na-khonsu has gone forth by day in order to do everything that pleased him upon earth, among the living."&lt;ref&gt;"Boulaq Museum translation" in ''[[The Holy Books of Thelema]]'', [[Samuel Weiser, Inc.]] (1983) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

or by a 1982 analysis,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"deliverer of those who are in the sunshine, open for him the netherworld; indeed the Osiris Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu shall go forth by day to do that which he desires, all, upon earth, among the living."&lt;ref&gt;"A modern analysis" in ''The Holy Books of Thelema'', [[Samuel Weiser, Inc.]] (1983) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Thelema==
''[[The Book of the Law]]'' (I,36) says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit|Ra-Hoor-Khu-it]]."&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Liber AL vel Legis'', I,36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on this, [[Aleister Crowley]] used the "magical" name "Ankh-f-n-khonsu" (from the "Stele 666" translation prepared in 1904 for Crowley by [[Egyptologist]] [[Émile Brugsch]]) to sign "[[The Book of the Law#The Comment of Ankh F N Khonsu|The Comment]]" of ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', and also used it sometimes when referring to himself as the prophet of [[Thelema]] and the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon of Horus]]. [[Kenneth Grant]] wrote that "Crowley claimed to have been a re-embodiment of the magical current represented by the priesthood to which Ankh-af-na-Khonsu belonged".&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Kenneth (1977). ''Nightside of Eden'', p. 133, n. 9. London: Frederick Muller Limited. {{ISBN|0-584-10206-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''book of hours''' is a Christian [[prayer book|devotional book]] popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. It is the most common type of surviving medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]. Like every manuscript, each manuscript book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a similar collection of texts, [[prayer]]s and [[psalm]]s, often with appropriate decorations, for [[Christian]] devotion.  Illumination or decoration is minimal in many examples, often restricted to decorated capital letters at the start of psalms and other prayers, but books made for wealthy patrons may be extremely lavish, with full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]. Books of hours were usually written in Latin (the [[Latin language|Latin]] name for them is ''horae''), although there are many entirely or partially written in [[vernacular]] European languages, especially Dutch.  The [[English language|English]] term ''primer'' is usually now reserved for those books written in English.  Tens of thousands of books of hours have survived to the present day, in [[library|libraries]] and private collections throughout the world.

The typical book of hours is an abbreviated form of the [[breviary]] which contained the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] recited in [[monastery|monasteries]]. It was developed for lay people who wished to incorporate elements of [[monasticism]] into their devotional life. Reciting the hours typically centered upon the reading of a number of [[psalm]]s and other prayers. A typical example contains the [[Calendar]] of [[Liturgical year|Church feasts]], extracts from the [[Four Gospels]], the Mass readings for major feasts, the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], the fifteen [[Psalms of Degrees]], the seven [[Penitential Psalms]], a [[Litany of Saints]], an  [[Office for the Dead]] and the [[Hours of the Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chd.dk/tutor/HSCruce.html Danish Royal Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224090922/http://www.chd.dk/tutor/HSCruce.html |date=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most 15th-century books of hours have these basic contents. The Marian prayers ''Obsecro te'' ("I beseech thee") and ''O Intemerata'' ("O undefiled one") were frequently added, as were devotions for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and meditations on the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Christ]], among other optional texts.

==History==
[[File:BLRoyal2BXVFol066vMinPatron.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Even this level of decoration is richer than those of most books, though less than the lavish amounts of illumination in luxury books, which are the ones most often seen reproduced.]]
The book of hours has its ultimate origin in the [[Psalter]], which monks and nuns were required to recite.  By the 12th century this had developed into the [[breviary]], with weekly cycles of  psalms, prayers, hymns, antiphons, and readings which changed with the liturgical season.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Duffy, "A Very Personal Possession: Eamon Duffy Tells How a Careful Study of Surviving Books of Hours Can Tell Us Much About the Spiritual and Temporal Life of Their Owners and Much More Besides." History Today 56.11 (Nov 2006): 12(7).&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually a selection of texts was produced in much shorter volumes and came to be called a book of hours.&lt;ref&gt;John Harthan "The Book of Hours: With a Historical Survey and Commentary by John Harthan.: New York: Crowell, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many books of hours were made for women. There is some evidence that they were sometimes given as a wedding present from a husband to his bride.&lt;ref name="John Harthan"&gt;John Harthan&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently they were passed down through the family, as recorded in wills.&lt;ref name="John Harthan" /&gt;

Although the most heavily illuminated books of hours were enormously expensive, a small book with little or no illumination was affordable much more widely, and increasingly so during the 15th century.  The [[William de Brailes|earliest surviving English example]] was apparently written for a laywoman living in or near [[Oxford]] in about 1240.  It is smaller than a modern paperback but heavily illuminated with major initials, but no full-page miniatures. By the 15th century, there are also examples of servants owning their own Books of Hours.  In a court case from 1500, a pauper woman is accused of stealing a domestic servant's prayerbook.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Duffy&lt;/ref&gt;

Very rarely the books included prayers specifically composed for their owners, but more often the texts are adapted to their tastes or sex, including the inclusion of their names in prayers. Some include images depicting their owners, and some their [[coats of arms]].  These, together with the choice of saints commemorated in the calendar and suffrages, are the main clues for the identity of the first owner.  [[Eamon Duffy]] explains how these books reflected the person who commissioned them. He claims that the "personal character of these books was often signaled by the inclusion of prayers specially composed or adapted for their owners." Furthermore, he states that "as many as half the surviving manuscript Books of Hours have annotations, marginalia or additions of some sort. Such additions might amount to no more than the insertion of some regional or personal patron saint in the standardized calendar, but they often include devotional material added by the owner." Owners could write in specific dates important to them, notes on the months where things happened that they wished to remember, and even the images found within these books would be personalized to the owners- such as localized saints and local festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, E. (January 01, 2006). A VERY PERSONAL POSSESSION - Eamon Duffy tells how a careful study of surviving medieval Books of Hours can tell us much about the spiritual and temporal life of their owners and much more besides. ''History Today, 56,''11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; By at least the 15th century, the Netherlands and Paris workshops were producing books of hours for stock or distribution, rather than waiting for individual commissions.  These were sometimes with spaces left for the addition of personalized elements such as local feasts or heraldry.

The style and layout for traditional books of hours became increasingly standardized around the middle of the thirteenth century.  The new style can be seen in the books produced by the Oxford illuminator [[William de Brailes]] who ran a commercial workshop (he was in [[minor orders]]).  His books included various aspects of the Church's breviary and other liturgical aspects for use by the laity. "He incorporated a perpetual calendar, Gospels, prayers to the Virgin Mary, the Stations of the Cross, prayers to the Holy Spirit, Penitential psalms, litanies, prayers for the dead, and suffrages to the Saints. The book’s goal was to help his devout patroness to structure her daily spiritual life in accordance with the eight canonical hours, Matins to Compline, observed by all devout members of the Church. The text, augmented by rubrication, gilding, miniatures, and beautiful illuminations, sought to inspire meditation on the mysteries of faith, the sacrifice made by Christ for man, and the horrors of hell, and to especially highlight devotion to the Virgin Mary whose popularity was at a zenith during the 13th century."&lt;ref&gt;Webb, M., &amp; Albers, M. J. (January 01, 2001). The Design Elements of Medieval Books of Hours. ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 31, ''354.&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was maintained over the years as many aristocrats commissioned the production of their own books.

By the end of the 15th century, the advent of [[printing]] made books more affordable and much of the emerging middle-class could afford to buy a printed book of hours, and new manuscripts were only commissioned by the very wealthy.  The ''[[Kitab salat al-sawai]]'' (1514), widely considered the first book in Arabic printed using [[moveable type]], is a book of hours intended for Arabic-speaking Christians and presumably commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref name="Krek"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/372742 | author= M.

==Decorations==
[[File:Simon Bening - Mai.jpg|thumb|right|A full-page miniature of May, from a calendar cycle by [[Simon Bening]], early 16th century.]]
As many books of hours are richly illuminated, they form an important record of life in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as the [[iconography]] of medieval Christianity. Some of them were also decorated with jewelled covers, portraits, and [[heraldry|heraldic]] emblems.  Some were bound as [[girdle book]]s for easy carrying, though few of these or other medieval bindings have survived.  Luxury books, like the ''Talbot Hours'' of [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], may include a portrait of the owner, and in this case his wife, kneeling in adoration of the Virgin and Child as a form of [[donor portrait]]. In expensive books, miniature cycles showed the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] in eight scenes decorating the eight ''Hours of the Virgin'', and the [[Labours of the Months]] and signs of the zodiac decorating the calendar.  Secular scenes of calendar cycles include many of the best known images from books of hours, and played an important role in the early history of [[landscape painting]].

From the 14th century decorated borders round the edges of at least important pages were common in heavily illuminated books, including books of hours. At the beginning of the 15th century these were still usually based on foliage designs, and painted on a plain background, but by the second half of the century coloured or patterned backgrounds with images of all sorts of objects, were used in luxury books.

Second-hand books of hours were often modified for new owners, even among royalty. After defeating [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave Richard's book of hours to his mother, who modified it to include her name. Heraldry was usually erased or over-painted by new owners.  Many have handwritten annotations, personal additions and marginal notes but some new owners also commissioned new craftsmen to include more illustrations or texts. Sir Thomas Lewkenor of [[Trotton]] hired an illustrator to add details to what is now known as the ''Lewkenor Hours''.  Flyleaves of some surviving books include notes of household accounting or records of births and deaths, in the manner of later family bibles. Some owners had also collected autographs of notable visitors to their house.  Books of hours were often the only book in a house, and were commonly used to teach children to read, sometimes having a page with the [[alphabet]] to assist this.

Towards the end of the 15th century, printers produced books of hours with [[woodcut]] illustrations, and the book of hours was one of the main works decorated in the related [[metalcut]] technique.

==The luxury book of hours==
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|right|The lavish illusionistic borders of this Flemish book of hours from the late 1470s are typical of luxury books of this period, which were now often decorated on every page. The butterfly wing cutting into the text area is an example of playing with visual conventions, typical of the period.&lt;br&gt;(Among the plants are the [[Veronica (plant)|''Veronica'']], ''[[Vinca]]'', ''[[Viola tricolor]]'', ''[[Bellis perennis]]'', and ''[[Chelidonium majus]]''. The butterfly is ''[[Aglais urticae]]''. The Latin text is a devotion to [[Saint Christopher]]).]]

In the 14th century the book of hours overtook the psalter as the most common vehicle for lavish illumination.  This partly reflected the increasing dominance of illumination both commissioned and executed by laymen rather than monastic clergy.  From the late 14th century a number of [[bibliophile]] royal figures began to collect luxury illuminated manuscripts for their decorations, a fashion that spread across Europe from the [[House of Valois|Valois]] courts of France and the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], as well as [[Prague]] under [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and later [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]].  A generation later, Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was the most important collector of manuscripts, with several of his circle also collecting.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this period that the [[Flanders|Flemish cities]] overtook Paris as the leading force in illumination, a position they retained until the terminal decline of the illuminated manuscript in the early 16th century.

The most famous collector of all, the French prince [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) owned several books of hours, some of which survive, including the most celebrated of all, the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''.  This was begun around 1410 by the [[Limbourg brothers]], although left incomplete by them, and decoration continued over several decades by other artists and owners.  The same was true of the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'', which also passed through Berry's ownership.

By the mid-15th century, a much wider group of nobility and rich businesspeople were able to commission highly decorated, often small, books of hours. With the arrival of printing, the market contracted sharply, and by 1500 the finest quality books were once again being produced only for royal or very grand collectors.  One of the last major illuminated book of hours was the ''[[Farnese Hours]]'' completed for the Roman [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]] in 1546 by [[Giulio Clovio]], who was also the last major manuscript illuminator.

The '''Cemetery of Confucius''' ({{zh|c=孔林|p=Kǒng lín|l=Kong Forest [of gravestones]}}) is a [[Chinese cemeteries|cemetery]] of the Kong clan (the descendants of [[Confucius]]) in Confucius' hometown [[Qufu]] in [[Shandong]] [[province (PRC)|province]]. Confucius himself and some of his disciples are buried there, as well as many thousands of his descendants.

Since 1994, the Cemetery of Confucius has been  part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] "Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu". The two other components of the site are the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Temple of Confucius]] dedicated to the memory of the philosopher and the [[Kong Family Mansion]], where his descendants lived. The three sites are collectively known in Qufu as ''San Kong'' (三孔), i.e. "The Three Confucian [sites]".

==History==
In 1331 construction work began on the wall and gate of the cemetery. In total, the cemetery has undergone 13 renovations and extensions. Eventually, by the late 18th century, the perimeter wall reached a length of {{convert|7.5|km}}, enclosing an area of {{convert|3.6|km2}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In this space, the tombs of more than 100,000 descendants of Confucius, who have been buried there over a period of about 2,000 years, can be found. The oldest graves date back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the most recent of which belong to descendants in the 76th and 78th generation.

The cemetery suffered serious damage in November 1966, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when it was visited and vandalized by a team of [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] from [[Beijing Normal University]], led by Tan Houlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Cemetery of Confucius is located north of the historic walled city of Qufu, about two kilometers north of the Temple and Mansion of Confucius (which are in the south-central part of the walled city), and 1.5&amp;nbsp;km north of the [[Temple of Yan Hui]], dedicated to the sage's [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|favorite student]] (which is just inside the northern gates of the city wall). The main north-central axis of the walled city, Gulou Jie ("Drum Tower Avenue"), becomes Beiguan Jie ("North Gate Avenue") after passing through the north gate of the city wall. The avenue runs north for 1266&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] as a wide boulevard decorated with the  ''Wan gu chang chun'' (Traditional Chinese:萬古長春, Simplified Chinese:万古长春) ''[[paifang|memorial arch]]'' and lined by [[Cupressaceae|cypress]]es and [[pine]] trees, finally arriving at the main (southern) gates of the cemetery.&lt;ref name=ib&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=b8&amp;A=1&amp;rec=974&amp;run=13 第三十二篇文物名胜 - 　第一章孔孟古迹 - 第三节林墓 - 孔林] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331184958/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=b8&amp;A=1&amp;rec=974&amp;run=13 |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery occupies 183.33 [[hectare]]s, and is surrounded by a perimeter wall 5,591 m long.&lt;ref name=ib/&gt;

The oldest graves found in this location date back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The original tomb erected here in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an [[axe]]. In addition, it had a brick platform for sacrifices. The present-day tomb is a cone-shaped hill.  Tombs for the descendants of Confucius and additional stelae to commemorate him were soon added around Confucius' tomb.

Since Confucius' descendants were conferred noble titles ([[Duke Yansheng]]) and were given imperial princesses as wives, many of the tombs in the cemetery show the status symbols of noblemen. Tombstones came in use during the Han Dynasty. Today, there are over three thousand stone tablets (mostly, tombstones)  dating from China's imperial period still standing in the cemetery. According to an official count, among them there are 22 tablets from the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Dynasty, 6 from [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]], 45 from [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], 506 from [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and 2626 from [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]]  still standing in the cemetery.  There are also 568 tablets from the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] period and 50 modern ([[PRC]]-era) tablets, as well as 180 tablets whose age cannot be determined; this brings the total to 4003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=504&amp;run=13 孔林 - 石刻] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221041116/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=504&amp;run=13 |date=December 21, 2013 }} (''Kong Lin'' - sculptures)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming burials are primarily found in the western part of the cemetery, and those from the Qing era, in the eastern part. In the Ming section, particularly notable is a comparatively small area located about 1&amp;nbsp;km to the northwest of the Tomb of Confucius, where about a dozen of Dukes of Yansheng, from the 55th to the 64th generation, have been buried. The dukes' tomb sites in this area are arranged more or less chronologically in rows from the south to the north, and, within each row, from the east of the west. Each duke has his own [[spirit way]], oriented from the south to the north, which typically includes (in the south-to-north order) the following sculptures: three pairs of animals (felines, sometimes winged; rams; horses); a memorial arch; a ''[[bixi (tortoise)|bixi]]'' with a stele; two guardian figures (a warrior on the west side of the path, and a civil official on the east side); and a stele in front of the small [[tumulus]] under which the duke is buried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=448&amp;run=13 孔林 - 墓葬 - 第二辑 嫡孙墓] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221041116/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=448&amp;run=13 |date=December 21, 2013 }} (Kong Lin - Burials - [Confucius'] Main-line descendants), and the entries about individual graves. See also [[:commons:Category:Tombs of the Ming Dukes of Yansheng|photos]] on Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller subsidiary area with late Ming - early Qing spirit ways, is located about 500 m northeast of this main area.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the entry for Kong Shangtan (孔尚坦) in [http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=476&amp;run=13 孔林 - 墓葬 - 族孙墓] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221041116/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=476&amp;run=13 |date=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 10,000 mature trees give the cemetery a forest-like appearance.

A '''declaration of faith''' is a phrase that is said by a member of any [[religion]] to show either to themselves, their [[God]] or other members of the religion their belief and faith in the religion. Notable declarations of faith include the [[Sign of the Cross]] in [[Christianity]], the [[Shahadah]] in [[Islam]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] in [[Judaism]].

There are numerous other declarations of faith, typically performed during religious rituals in many faiths. Often, the declaration of faith is led by the leader of the congregation and followers respond in kind.

'''Demonic possession''' is believed by some to be the process by which individuals are [[spirit possession|possessed]] by malevolent [[preternatural]] beings, commonly referred to as [[demon]]s or [[devil]]s. Symptoms of demonic possessions often include erased [[memories]] or [[personalities]], [[convulsion]]s (i.e. [[epileptic seizure]]s or “fits”) and [[fainting]] as if one were dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferber |first=Sarah |title=Demonic Possession and Exorcism in Early Modern France |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |pages=25, 116 |isbn=0415212642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural origins==

Many cultures and [[religion]]s contain some concept of demonic possession, but the details vary considerably. The oldest references to demonic possession are from the [[Sumer]]ians, who believed that all diseases of the body and mind were caused by "sickness demons" called ''gidim'' or ''gid-dim''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumerian.org/sumlogo.htm Sumerian "gidim"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[priest]]s who practised exorcisms in these nations were called ''ashipu'' (sorcerer) as opposed to an ''asu'' (physician) who applied bandages and [[salve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/meso.HTM Indiana Univ: ''MEDICINE IN ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet]]s contain prayers to certain gods asking for protection from demons, while others ask the gods to expel the demons that have invaded their bodies.

[[Shamanic]] cultures also believe in demon possession and shamans performing exorcisms. In these cultures, diseases are often attributed to the presence of a [[vengeful ghost|vengeful spirit]] (or loosely termed ''demon'') in the body of the patient. These spirits are more often the spectres of animals or people wronged by the bearer, the exorcism rites usually consisting of respectful offerings or [[sacrificial offering]]s.

[[Christianity]] holds that possession derives from the [[Devil]], i.e. [[Satan]], or one of his lesser demons. In Christianity, Satan and his demons are actually [[fallen angel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"An Exorcist Tells his Story" by Fr. [[Gabriele Amorth]] translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie, [[Ignatius Press]], San Francisco, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern medicine, it is now suspected that an underlying cause of what sometimes appears to be demonic possession is actually [[anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniela J. Lamas, "[https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/05/26/when-brain-attacks-newly-discovered-disease-can-mimic-psychosis/dyixxnwdHJJIUITsNYJC3O/story.html When the brain is under attack]", ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 27 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/165115921/a-young-reporter-chronicles-her-brain-on-fire A Young Reporter Chronicles Her 'Brain On Fire']", [[NPR]], 14 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==

Obsessions and possessions of the devil are placed in the rank{{explain|date=July 2018}} of apparitions of the [[evil spirit]] among humans.{{explain|date=July 2018}} It is [[Obsession (Spiritism)|obsession]] when the demon acts externally against the person whom it besets, and possession when it acts internally, agitates them, excites their ill humor, makes them utter blasphemy, speak tongues they allegedly have never learned, reveals allegedly unknown secrets to them, and apparently inspires them with obscure knowledge of philosophy or theology.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

Other claims include access to hidden knowledge and foreign languages ([[xenoglossy]]), drastic changes in vocal intonation and facial structure, the sudden appearance of injuries (scratches, bite marks) or [[lesion]]s, and [[superhuman strength]]. Also odd odors and lack of pain density and self-mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarchie|first1=Ralph|last2=Cool|first2=Lisa Collier|title=Beware the Night: A New York City Cop Investigates the Supernatural|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466834217|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Ralph_Sarchie_Beware_the_Night?id=t0mvKP22yTkC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]], the subject has no control over the possessing entity and so it will persist until forced to leave the victim, usually through a form of [[exorcism]].

Additionally, there is a form of [[monomania]] called demonomania or demonopathy in which the person believes that he or she is possessed by one or more demons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Noll|Noll, Richard]]. (2006). ''The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders''. Facts On File Inc. p. 129. {{ISBN|0-8160-6405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Christian Bible==
===The Old Testament===
The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' says that there is only one apparent case of demonic possession in the Old Testament, of [[King Saul]], but it relies on an interpretation of the Hebrew word "rûah" as "evil spirit", an interpretation that is doubted by the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Demoniacal Possession}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others theologians such as Ángel Manuel Rodríguez say that [[Mediumship|mediums]] like the ones mentioned in Leviticus 20:27 were possessed by demons.&lt;ref&gt;Ángel Manuel Rodríguez, "Old Testament demonology." ''Ministry: International Journal for Pastors'' 1998 (7:6), pp. 5-7. https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1998/06/old-testament-demonology&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The New Testament mentions several episodes in which [[Miracles of Jesus#Exorcisms|Jesus drove out demons from persons]]. The 1902 work ''Demonic possession in the New Testament'' by Rev. [[William Menzies Alexander]] attempted to explain accounts of possession in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], outlining their historical, medical and theological aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1QralN_4CcC&amp;dq |title=Demonic Possession in the New Testament |author=Alexander, William Menzies |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
[[Antoine Augustin Calmet]],  a French Benedictine monk writing in the 18th century, commented that the Jews attributed the greater part of their maladies to the works of demons and were persuaded that demonic torments were a punishment for some crime either known or unrevealed.&lt;ref group="A" name="p.127"&gt;p.127&lt;/ref&gt; He also states:&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Although the Jews were sufficiently credulous concerning the operations of the evil spirit, they at the same time believed that in general the demons who tormented certain persons were nothing else than the souls of some wretches, who, fearing to repair to the place destined for them, took possession of the body of some mortal whom they tormented and endeavored to deprive of life''- Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Christianity==
{{further|Exorcism in Christianity|Exorcism in the Catholic Church}}

===Catholicism===
[[Catholic exorcists]] differentiate between "ordinary" Satanic/demonic activity or influence (mundane everyday ''temptations'') and "extraordinary" Satanic/demonic activity, which can take six different forms, ranging from complete control by Satan or some demon(s) to voluntary submission:&lt;ref name="amorth"&gt;p. 33, ''An Exorcist Tells his Story'', by Fr. Gabriele Amorth, translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie; Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Possession, in which Satan or some demon(s) takes full possession of a person's body without their knowledge or consent, so the victim is therefore morally blameless.
#Obsession, which includes sudden attacks of irrationally obsessive thoughts, usually culminating in [[suicidal ideation]], and typically influences dreams.
#[[Oppression]], in which there is no loss of consciousness or involuntary action, such as in the biblical [[Book of Job]] in which Job was tormented by a series of misfortunes in business, family, and health.
#External physical pain caused by Satan or some demon(s).
#Infestation, which affects houses, things, or animals; and
#Subjection, in which a person voluntarily submits to Satan or some demon(s).

In ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Hostage_to_the_Devil.html?id=vYw8PgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Hostage to the Devil]'', [[Malachi Martin]] also mentions a type of demonic attack called "familiarization".  He writes:

{{Cquote|''The possessing spirit in "familiarization" is seeking to "come and live with" the subject. If accepted, the spirit becomes the constant and continuously present companion of the possessed. The two "persons", the "[[Familiar spirit|familiar]]" and the "possessed", remain separate and distinct. The "possessed" is aware of his "familiar"''.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi Martin, ''Hostage to the Devil'', Harper, San Francisco, 1992, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

True demonic or satanic possession has been characterized since the [[Middle Ages]], in the [[Roman Ritual]], by the following four typical characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;p.25, ''The Vatican's Exorcists'' by [[Tracy Wilkinson]]; [[Hachette Book Group#Current imprints|Warner Books]], New York, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist]]'' by [[Matt Baglio]]; [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/prayer/roman2.txt The Roman Ritual] Translated by [[Philip T. Weller]], [[S.T.D.]]; Copyright 1964&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Manifestation of God|Manifestation]] of [[superhuman strength]].
#[[Speaking in tongues]] or languages that the victim cannot know.
#[[Revelation]] of [[knowledge]], distant or hidden, that the victim cannot know.
#[[Blasphemy|Blasphemous]] rage, obscene hand gestures, using [[Profanity]] and an [[wikt:Special:Search/aversion|aversion]] to holy symbols or [[relics]].

The Bible indicates that people can be possessed by demons but that the demons respond and submit to Jesus' authority:

{{Cquote|''In the [[synagogue]], there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,  34 “Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 35 “Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. 36 All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!”  37 And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area''. (Luke 4:33-35 NIV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luke 4:33-37 (New International Version)|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/passage.aspx?q=luke+4:33-37|publisher=By ''[[Biblestudytools.com]]''|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It also indicates that demons can possess animals as in the [[exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac]]:

{{Cquote|''When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from [[Gadara|the town]]. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” 29 For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. 30 Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" [[Legion (demon)|“Legion,” he replied]], because many demons had gone into him. 31 And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. 32 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. 33 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into [[Sea of Galilee|the lake]] and was drowned''. (Luke 8:27-33 NIV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luke 8 - The Healing of a Demon-possessed Man|url=http://www.tobechristian.org/luke_8__the_healing_of_a_demon.htm|publisher=By ''[[www.tobechristian.org]]''|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Official [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine affirms that demonic possession can occur as distinguished from [[mental illness]], but stresses that cases of mental illness should not be misdiagnosed as demonic influence. Catholic exorcisms can occur only under the authority of a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] and in accordance with strict rules; a simple exorcism also occurs during [[Baptism]] (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]]'' 1673).

Since Jesus is reported (in the New Testament) to have encountered people who were demonized and to have driven the "evil spirits" out of these demoniacs, Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] of the 4th century asserted that demons entered the bodies of humans to use them as if they were theirs, and also proposed that the same could happen with animals.

===Protestantism===
The literal view of demonization is held by a number of Christian denominations. In [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christianity, [[Deliverance ministry|deliverance ministries]] are activities carried out by individuals or groups aimed at solving problems related to demons and spirits, especially possession of the body and soul, but not the spirit as ministries like [[Ellel Ministries International]],  Don Dickerman Ministries and [[Neil T. Anderson]] explicitly teach that a Christian can not have demons in their spirit because the Holy Spirit lives there, though they can have demons in their body or soul due to inner emotional wounds, sexual abuse, [[satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dondickerman.net/id70.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723102814/http://www.dondickerman.net/id70.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually known as partial possession or demonic infestation, as opposed to outside demonic oppression which does not reside in any of the 3 parts of a person: [[Human body|body]], [[soul]], [[spirit]].

The New Testament's description of people who had evil spirits includes a capacity for hidden knowledge (e.g., [[prediction|future events]], [[Telepathy|innermost thoughts of the people around them]]) (Acts 16:16) and great strength (Act 19:16), among others, and shows those with evil spirits can speak of Christ (Acts 19:16, Mark 3:11). According to [[Catholic]] [[theology|theologian]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, demonic assault can be involuntary&lt;ref name="amorth"/&gt; and allowed by [[God]] to test a person (for more details about God's tests on persons see [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]). Involuntary demonic assault, according to these theologians, cannot be denied because this would imply the negation of the cases mentioned in the New Testament (12, some of them repeated in more than one [[Gospel]]). However, in the overwhelming majority of cases of alleged demonic possession in modern times, the victim can suffer due to any of a number of personal initiatives: occult practices, [[mortal sin]], loss of faith, or psychological trauma, among others.  Furthermore, Malachi Martin goes as far as to say "...no person can be Possessed without some degree of cooperation on his or her part," and "The effective cause of Possession is the voluntary collaboration of an individual, through his faculties of mind and will, with one or more of those bodiless, genderless creatures called demons."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Malachi, Hostage to the Devil (San Francisco, Harper, 1992, preface p.xx.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous centuries, the Christian church offered suggestions on safeguarding one’s home. Suggestions ranged from dousing a household with [[holy water]], placing wax and herbs on thresholds to “ward off witches occult,” and avoiding certain areas of townships known to be frequented by witches and Devil worshippers after dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Hans Peter Broedel |last=Broedel |first=Hans Peter |title=The [[Malleus Maleficarum]] and the Construction of Witchcraft |location=Great Britain |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |year=2003 |pages=32–33 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barajo |first=Caro |title=World of the Witches |location=Great Britain |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1964 |page=73 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. B. Joshua]], a Nigerian pastor, has one of the most prominent 'deliverance' ministries, releasing hundreds of videos on YouTube and his Christian television station, [[Emmanuel TV]], purporting to show individuals being 'delivered' from apparent 'demonic possession'.

== Islam ==
According to [[islam]]ic belief, [[supernatural]] creatures like [[Jinn]] and [[satan#Islam|devils]] can cause possession or change the behavior of humans. While a particular [[Devil (Islam)|devil]] tempts humans mind to follow lower desires and causing therefore suffering, disobience to [[God in Islam|God]] or reduction of their own state of [[Nafs|soul]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Anthony Sells ''Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qurʼan, Miraj, Poetic and Theological Writings'' Paulist Press, 1996  {{ISBN|978-0-809-13619-3}} page 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Tamer ''Islam and Rationality: The Impact of al-Ghazālī. Papers Collected on His 900th Anniversary, Band 1'' BRILL 2015 {{ISBN|978-9-004-29095-2}} page 103&lt;/ref&gt; an evil Jinn (also called a satan or devil, because of its devilish behavior)&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Yawar Baig, Understanding Islam - 52 Friday Lectures: Keys to Leveraging the Power of Allah in Your Life'' (Standard Bearers Academy 2012 {{ISBN|9781479304189}}), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be able to enter humans bodies.

===Possession by Satan===
Satan (identified with [[Iblis]]) is according to Islam allowed trying to incite humans and Jinn to do evil. Therefore, he and his subordinate [[Shaitan|demons]] whispers to the [[Qalb|hearts]] of beings with free will, trying to lead them astray from Allah  and their spiritual development or hunts them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sultan Ahmad ''Islam In Perspective'' Author House 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-449-03993-6}} page 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|114|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not possess humans physically. If a person feels depressed or feels being trapped in a doubtful situation, the person should tell others about what happened, because otherwise Satan could abuse this situation and will whisper to the lonely heart.&lt;ref&gt;ʻUmar Sulaymān Ashqar''The World of the Jinn and Devils'' Islamic Books 1998 page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possession by Jinn===
Even though the [[Quran]] does not mention physical possession by Jinn, in folklore it is believed a Jinn can haunt or possess a human being, causing illness, hallucinations or aggression. Such a possession is believed to be caused by harming a Jinn (even unintentionally), summoning them or when a Jinn falls in love with a human, wanting to become his/her husband/wife.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Bulkeley, Kate Adams, Patricia M. Davis ''Dreaming in Christianity and Islam: Culture, Conflict, and Creativity'' Rutgers University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-813-54610-0}} page 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ʻUmar Sulaymān Ashqar''The World of the Jinn and Devils'' Islamic Books 1998 page 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Hussein Rassool''Islamic Counselling: An Introduction to theory and practice''Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-317-44124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereupon it requires an [[Exorcism in Islam|exorcism]] to get rid of the jinn.

== Buddhism ==

In traditional Buddhism, four metaphorical forms of "māra" are given:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S.

* ''Kleśa-māra'', or Ma̋ra as the embodiment of all [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|unskillful emotions]], such as greed, hate and delusion.(the Demons of delusions/defilement and unwholesome states)
* ''Mṛtyu-māra'', or Māra as [[Mrtyu|death]]. (the Demons of the Lord of death) 
* ''Skandha-māra'', or Māra as [[metaphor]] for the entirety of conditioned existence.(the Demons of contaminated aggregates) 
* ''Devaputra-māra'', the [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] of the sensuous realm, who tries to prevent Gautama Buddha from attaining liberation from the [[Samsara|cycle of rebirth]] on the night of the Buddha´s enlightenment.(the Demons of sons of deva Gods/desire and temptation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lamayeshe.com/glossary/term/four-maras |title=4 Maras |work= LAMA YESHE WISDOM Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in the [[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]], 50 types of [[skandha]] related demons ([[Fifty skandha-māras]]) been mentioned that can possess practitioners. Also flying demons from Devaputra-[[Mara (demon)|Mara]] that can be casted to the practitioner in order to confuse them, make them and their students believe they have achieved [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], then mislead them to wrong doings, wrong teachings, dangers, crisis and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/surangama.pdf|title=Surgangama Sutra|author=Translated by Upasaka LuK'uan Yu (Charles Luk)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], a demon can either be a being suffering in the hell realm&lt;ref name="Demons and the Demonic in Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinich Sutherland|first1=Gail|title=Demons and the Demonic in Buddhism|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0171.xml|website=Oxford Bibliographies|accessdate=30 April 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0171}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it could be a delusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Psychology and Psychotherapy|url=http://www.tibetanmedicine-edu.org/index.php/psychology-and-psychotherapy/34-tibetan-buddhist-psychology-and-psychotherapy|website=Tibetan Medicine Education center|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioner will go to the local Buddhist healer for treatment.  The healer will commonly take their pulse and urine while offering counsel - the aim being to divine the origins of the patient's suffering.  In the case possession they will also prescribe actions to appease the demon, like giving away food and clothing in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plakun|title=Psychiatry in Tibetan Buddhism: Madness and Its Cure Seen Through the Lens of Religious and National History|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis &amp; Dynamic Psychiatry|date=2008|volume=36|issue=3|pages=415–430|issn=1546-0371}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterward, it is believed that the demon will depart to a different realm.&lt;ref name="Demons and the Demonic in Buddhism"/&gt;

==Medicine and psychology==
According to Augustine Calmet, several obsessions and possessions noted in the New Testament were simple maladies or fantastic fallacies which made it believed that such persons were possessed by the devil. The ignorance of the people maintained this prejudice, and their being totally unacquainted with physicians and medicine served to strengthen such ideas.&lt;ref group="A" name="p.127"/&gt;

Those who profess a belief in demonic possession have sometimes ascribed to possession the symptoms associated with physical or mental illnesses, such as [[hysteria]], [[mania]], [[psychosis]],&lt;ref&gt;Maniam, T. (1987). ''Exorcism and Psychiatric Illness: Two Case Reports''. Medical Journal of Malaysia. 42: 317-319.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tourette syndrome]], [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, S. (1994).

''Dissociation and symptoms of culture-bound syndromes in North America: A preliminary study''.

[[The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]] 27: 129-134.&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-5 indicates that personality states of dissociative identity disorder may be interpreted as possession in some cultures, and instances of spirit possession are often related to traumatic experiences--suggesting that possession experiences may be caused by mental distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3402/ejpt.v6.29126|pmid=26589259|pmc=4654771|title=Global mental health and trauma exposure: The current evidence for the relationship between traumatic experiences and spirit possession|journal=European Journal of Psychotraumatology|volume=6|pages=29126|year=2015|last1=Hecker|first1=Tobias|last2=Braitmayer|first2=Lars|last3=Van Duijl|first3=Marjolein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have expressed concern that belief in demonic possession can limit access to health care for the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10943-014-9910-7|pmid=25056667|title=Concerns About Schizophrenia or Possession?|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1691–1692|year=2014|last1=Karanci|first1=A.

Since they only have simple, private vows they are not technically religious.

== History ==

The [[Dominican Order#Nuns|Dominican Nuns]] came into existence 800 years ago (1206) when [[Saint Dominic]] began his Order of Preachers by first establishing a cloistered monastery of women in [[Prouille]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinnebusch |first=William A. O.P., D.Ph.

Shortly after her solemn profession of vows there, this exemplary young religious was chosen to be one of the foundresses of the Dominican Monastery of the Infant Jesus in Lufkin, Texas (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opnuns-fh.org/html/century_of_adoration.html#PartVI |title=Century of Adoration |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107224724/http://opnuns-fh.org/html/century_of_adoration.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty-six years later, the Reverend Mother Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P., set out to found the Dominican Monastery of the Heart of Jesus in Lockport, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reverend Mother Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P..|title=Brief History of the Dominican Monastery of the Heart of Jesus, Lockport, Louisiana|year=2003|location=Lockport, LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hospitality ==

There is also a guesthouse on the monastery grounds with accommodations for individuals or groups.  There are openings available year round.  Discernment-based days consist of sharing in the liturgical prayer life of the Dominican Nuns within a balanced schedule that includes a daily series of personal/group interviews and question sessions in the grille parlor.  It is during this time that a particular vocation to the Community may be explored.  Private or silent retreats are an option generally exclusive to priests and religious.  However, arrangements may be considered for others such as seminarians, [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|tertiaries]],&lt;ref&gt;Official Newsletter of the Lay Dominicans of the Southern Province: http://luminaria.infodat-llc.com/Luminaria%2063.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or single women.  Advance reservations are required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">In the [[Orphic religion]], '''Erikepaios''' ({{lang-grc|Ἠρικεπαῖος}}; {{lang-la|Ericepaeus}}) was a title for the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], mentioned in [[Orpheus#Orphic_poems_and_rites|Orphic poetry]] and the associated [[Bacchic mysteries]], a non-Greek name for which no certain interpretation has been found.

Scholars have long been perplexed by the name ''Erikepaios'', and naturally, most of them have attempted to derive it from Greek etymology, however this seems questionable linguistically. The name has also been thought to have Hebrew origins because of its resemblance to ''erekh appayim''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Liebes|authorlink=Yehuda Liebes|date=1993|title=Studies in Jewish Myth and Messianism|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=73|isbn=0791411931}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, even in antiquity, that the name ''Erikepaios'' was an Oriental import. Thus, [[John Malalas]], the 6th century AD [[Antioch|Antiotian]] [[historian]], derives the name from the language spoken in his region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Liebes|date=1993|title=Studies in Jewish Myth and Messianism|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=74|isbn=0791411931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is first mentioned with certainty in the Orphic papyrus from Gurôb, a [[Dionysian mysteries]] text of the late 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;Graf, Fritz (Columbus, OH). "[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/ericepaeus-e401490 Ericepaeus]." ''Brill’s New Pauly''. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and , Helmuth Schneider. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 26 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mythographer [[Otto Gruppe]] suggested the Phanes-myth appeared in its original form in [[Babylonia]]. Thence it spread over the Near East, and took root particularly in [[Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]]. The gods of Babylon themselves were not imported, but the myth was attached to the local deities of the districts to which it spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. K. C. Guthrie|date=1935|title=Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erikepaios became important in various [[Neoplatonic]] writings of the so-called "Rhapsodic Theogony",&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt; now lost, it was composed in the [[Hellenistic period]], incorporating earlier works. It is known through summaries in later [[neo-Platonist]] authors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">'''Ferrand of Carthage'''  is a  [[Christian]] [[theologian]] of the [[Roman province of Africa]], modern day [[Tunisia]] ,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrologia Latina]] , vol.  67, col.  877-962 ( Vita Fulgentii , vol 65, col 117-150). &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scriptorum veterum nova collectio'' , III, 2, p. 183 sq. &lt;/ref&gt;who died in 546 or 547. 
==Biography==
Little is known of his early life.  At the end of his life, he was a [[deacon]] of the [[Church of Carthage]], and a renowned [[theologian]], consulted in 546 by the Roman deacons [[Pope Pelagius I|Pelagius]] and [[Anatolius (deacon)|Anatolius]] on the affair of the [[Three Chapters]] which had just broken out.  Ferrand's reply was retained, but Facundus of  Hermiane, writing in the winter of 546/47 &lt;ref&gt;Facundus d'Hermiane, Pro defensione trium capitulorum , IV, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; recounts this consultation by referring to Ferrand as " [...] laudabilis in Christo memoriæ Ferrando Carthaginiensi diacono scripserunt ". 
==Writing==
===Life of Fulgence of Ruspe===
Since Pierre Pithou wrote in 1588 he was generally considered the author of the [[Fulgentius of Ruspe#Vita|Life of Fulgence of Ruspe]].  However, this attribution is not based on any indication of the many manuscripts.  Two letters of Ferrand about Fulgence are preserved, where he questions him on points of religion, and there are corresponding answers from Fulgence.  At the end of a letter to the Abbe Eugippe , written just after the death of Fulgence ( 532 ), Ferrand evokes the projected drafting of a Life, but without positively saying the author.  If Ferrand is the author of this Life, we learn in the prologue that he lived in the little [[monastery]] which [[Bishop]] Fulgence had founded during his relegation to Sardinia .

'''Freedom of religion in Taiwan''' is provided for by the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], which is in force on Taiwan. The Government on [[Taiwan]] generally respects [[freedom of religion]] in practise, with government policies continuing to contribute to the generally free practise of religion.

Taiwan's strong human rights protections, lack of state-sanctioned discrimination, and generally high regard for freedom of religion or belief earned it a joint #1 ranking alongside [[The Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in the 2018 [[Freedom of Thought Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/best-and-worst-countries-atheist-4310703-Oct2018/|title=These are the best and worst countries in the world to be an atheist|work=journal.ie|accessdate=2 November 2018|date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==

{{Main|Religion in Taiwan}}

Taiwan has an area of {{convert|13800|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 23 million. The 2006 Government Information Office Yearbook, the [[Religious Affairs Section]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] (MOI) states that 35 percent of the population consider themselves [[Buddhist]] and 33 percent [[Taoist]]. While the overwhelming majority of religious adherents are either Buddhist or Taoist, many people also consider themselves both Buddhist and Taoist .{{citation needed|date= September 2012}}

In addition to practicing [[organized religion]], many persons also followed a collection of beliefs deeply ingrained in [[Culture of China|Chinese]] culture that can be termed "traditional Chinese folk religion." These beliefs may include some aspects of [[shamanism]], [[ancestor worship]], belief in [[ghosts]] and other spirits, and [[animism]]. Researchers and academics estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population believes in some form of traditional [[folk religion]]. Such folk religions may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, [[Confucianism]], or other traditional Chinese religions.

Traditional Chinese religions with adherents constituting less than 5 percent of the population include: [[I Kuan Tao]], [[Tien Ti Chiao]] (Heaven Emperor Religion), [[Tien Te Chiao]] (Heaven Virtue Religion), [[Li-ism]], [[Hsuan Yuan Chiao]] (Yellow Emperor Religion), [[Tian Li Chiao]] (Tenrikyo), [[Universe Maitreya Emperor Religion]], [[Hai Tze Tao]], [[Confucianism]], [[Zhonghua Sheng Chiao]] (Chinese Holy Religion), [[Da Yi Chiao]] (Great Changes Religion), [[Pre-cosmic Salvationism]], and [[Huang Chung Chiao]] (Yellow Middle Religion).

There also may be an overlap between practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions with those of [[Falun Gong]], which is registered as a civic, rather than religious, organization. In Taiwan, Falun Gong is generally considered a spiritual movement and not a religion. The leading proponent of Falun Gong in Taiwan reports that membership exceeds 500,000 and continues to grow rapidly.

In addition to traditional Chinese religions, small percentages of the population consider themselves [[Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic]], or [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]. Several foreign missionary religious groups are also present. The [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Baha'i]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Mahikari]] Religion, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) and the [[Unification Church]] are registered. Other Christian denominations present include [[Presbyterians]], the [[True Jesus Church]], [[Baptists]], [[Lutherans]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]]. Approximately 70 percent of the indigenous population of 475,000 Aborigines is Christian. There are also a small number of adherents of [[Judaism]] in Taiwan, mainly expatriates.

While the Taiwanese authorities do not collect or independently verify statistics on religious affiliation, they maintain registration statistics voluntarily reported by religious organizations. Officials from the MOI Religious Affairs Section believe these voluntarily reported statistics significantly understate the number of people in Taiwan who adhere to religious beliefs and participate in some form of religious activities. The MOI Religious Affairs Section estimates that approximately 50 percent of the population regularly participates in some form of organized religious practice, as distinguished from "traditional Chinese folk religions," and an estimated 14 percent of the population is atheist.

Religious beliefs cross political and geographical lines. Members of the political leadership practice various faiths.

===Legal and policy framework===

Taiwan's constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice. Authorities at all levels protect this right in full, and do not tolerate its abuse, either by official or private actors. There is no state religion.

Although registration is not mandatory, 26 religious organizations have registered with the MOI's Religious Affairs Section. Religious organizations may register with the central authorities through their island-wide associations under the [[Temple Management Law]], the [[Civic Organizations Law]], or the chapter of the Civil Code that governs foundations and associations. While individual places of worship may register with local authorities, many choose not to do so and operate as the personal property of their leaders. Registered religious organizations operate on a tax-free basis and are required to submit annual reports of their financial operations. The only ramification for nonregistration is the forfeiture of the tax advantages that are available for registered religious organizations. There were no reports that the authorities have sought to deny registration to new religions.

Religious organizations are permitted to operate schools, but compulsory religious instruction is not permitted in any public or private elementary, middle, or high school accredited by the Ministry of Education (MOE). High schools accredited by the MOE, while not allowed to require religious instruction, may provide elective courses in religious studies, provided such courses do not promote certain religious beliefs over others. Universities and research institutions may have religious studies departments. Before 2004, legislation barred religious schools and theological institutes from applying for MOE accreditation, and the MOE did not recognize university-level degrees granted by these types of schools. In March 2004, the Legislative Yuan revised the Private Schools Act authorized the MOE to establish an accreditation process for university-level religious education institutions supported by religious organizations or private funds. In April 2006, the MOE promulgated regulations governing the accreditation process. In August 2006, the MOE accredited its first seminary, the Dharma Drum Buddhist College.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===

Taiwan's policies and practices contribute to the generally free practice of religion.

There are no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in Taiwan.

===Forced religious conversion===

There are no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]].

===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===

The MOI promotes interfaith understanding among religious groups by sponsoring symposiums or helping to defray the expenses of privately sponsored symposiums on religious issues. The MOI also publishes and updates an introduction to major religious beliefs and groups based on material provided by the groups. This introduction is also available on the internet. In May 2006, the MOI invited some 100 leaders from religious organizations to participate in a two-day tour of outstanding social services organizations operated by religious charities, to foster cooperation among organizations with similar social welfare goals. The MOI holds an annual ceremony to honor religious groups for their contributions to public service, social welfare, and social harmony. Some 170 different organizations and individuals are recognized.

On 23 January 2007, [[President Chen]] personally congratulated local [[Muslims]] who had completed a pilgrimage to Mecca, and praised Taiwan's Muslim Association ([[Chinese Muslim Association]], an organization that is fully independent from the government) for promoting frequent exchanges between Taiwan and the Islamic world. President Chen also credited practicing Muslims on Taiwan for helping to create a richer, more diverse culture on the island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13332&amp;ctNode=1937&amp;mp=999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==

There have been no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Prominent societal leaders have taken positive steps to promote religious tolerance. For instance, the Taiwan Council for Religion and Peace, the [[China Religious Believers Association]], and the [[Taiwan Religious Association]] are private organizations that promote greater understanding and tolerance among adherents of different religions. These associations and various religious groups occasionally sponsor symposiums to promote mutual understanding. The Taiwan Conference on Religion and Peace sponsors summer seminars every year to help college students understand the practice of major religions in Taiwan.

'''Gaudiya Vaishnavism''' (also known as '''(Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition,''' '''Bengali Vaishnavism,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De|first1=Sushil K.|title=Early History of the Vaishnava Faith and Movement in Bengal|date=1942|isbn=|pages=703}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Chaitanya Vaishnavism'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html Hindu Encounter with Modernity, by Shukavak N. Dasa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154723/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html |date=11 May 2008 }} "&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] religious movement inspired by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534) in [[India]]. "Gauḍīya" refers to the [[Gauḍa region]] (present day [[Bengal]]/[[Bangladesh]]) with Vaishnavism meaning "the worship of [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]]". Its theological basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gītā]] and [[Bhāgavata Purāṇa]] as interpreted by early disciples of Chaitanya such as Sanātana Gosvāmin, Rūpa Gosvāmin, Jīva Gosvāmin, Gopala Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Edwin|title=Bhakti yoga : tales and teachings from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa|date=2017|isbn= 9780865477759|pages=650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holdrege|first1=Barbaraga|title=Bhakti and Embodient: fashioning divine bodies and devotional bodies in Kṛṣṇa Bhakti|date=2017|isbn=1138492450 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as "[[Hari|Hare]]", "[[Krishna]]" and "[[Rama]]", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. The movement is sometimes referred to as the [[Brahma Sampradaya|Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya sampradaya]], referring to its traditional origins in the succession of spiritual masters ([[guru]]s) believed to originate from Brahma. It classifies itself as a [[monotheistic]] tradition, seeing the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.

==Philosophical concepts==

===Living beings===
According to Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, [[consciousness]] is not a product of [[Prakrti|matter]], but is instead a symptom of the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/consciousness_the_symptom_of_the_soul.htm Consciousness the Symptom of the Soul] by Stephen Knapp&lt;/ref&gt; All living beings ([[jiva]]s), are distinct from their current body - the nature of the soul being [[eternity|eternal]], immutable, and indestructible without any particular beginning or end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/2/20/en1 |title=Bhagavad Gita 2.20 |publisher=Bhagavadgitaasitis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211352/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/2/20/en1 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Souls which are captivated by the illusory nature of the world (''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'') are repeatedly [[reincarnation|reborn]] among the various (8,400,000 in number) species of life on this planet and on other worlds in accordance to the laws of [[karma]] and individual desire. This is consistent with the concept of ''[[samsara]]'' found throughout [[Hinduism|Hindu]] belief.

Release from the process of ''samsara'' (known as ''[[moksha]]'') is believed to be achievable through a variety of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices. However, within Gaudiya Vaishnavism it is ''[[bhakti]]'' in its purest state (or "pure love of God") which is given as the ultimate aim, rather than liberation from the cycle of rebirth.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Supreme Person (God)===
{{see also|Svayam Bhagavan}}
One of the defining aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is that Krishna is worshiped specifically as the source of all [[Avatar]]ic incarnations of God. This is based on quotations from the [[Bhagavata Purana]], such as "''krsnāstu bhagavan svayam''", literally "Krishna is God Himself".{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Inconceivable oneness and difference===
{{main|Achintya Bheda Abheda}}
A particularly distinct part of the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy espoused by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is the concept of ''[[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]'', which translates to "inconceivable oneness and difference" in the context of the soul's relationship with Krishna,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 Caitanya-Caritamrita Ml 20.108-109] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153501/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 |date=11 May 2008 }} "It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Krishna because he is the marginal energy of Krishna and a manifestation simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire."&lt;/ref&gt; and also Krishna's relationship with his other energies (i.e. the material world).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/7/8/en1 |title=B-Gita 7.8 |publisher=Vedabase.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719230711/http://vedabase.net/bg/7/8/en1 |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''quality'', the soul (''jiva'') is described as being identical to God, but in terms of ''quantity'' individual ''jivas'' are said to be [[infinitesimal]] in comparison to the [[Infinity|unlimited]] Supreme Being. The exact nature of this relationship (being simultaneously one and different with Krishna) is inconceivable to the human mind, but can be experienced through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]].

This philosophy serves as a meeting of two opposing schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], pure [[Monism#Hinduism|monism]] (God and the soul as one entity) and pure [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] (God and the soul as absolutely separate). This philosophy largely recapitulates the concepts of qualified nondualism practiced by the older Vedantic school [[Vishishtadvaita]], but emphasizes the figure of Krishna over Narayana and holy sites in and around Bengal over sites in Tamil Nadu. In practice Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy has much more in common with the dualistic schools especially closely following theological traditions established by [[Madhvacharya]]'s [[Dvaita]] Vedanta.

==Devotional activities==

===Bhakti Yoga===
{{main|Bhakti Yoga}}
The practical process of devotional life is described as ''bhakti'' or ''bhakti-yoga''. The two main elements of the ''bhakti-yoga'' process are ''vaidhi bhakti'', which is devotional service through practice of rules and regulations (''[[sadhana]]'') and ''raganuga bhakti'', which is taken as a higher stage of more spontaneous devotional service based on a selfless desire to please one's chosen ''[[Ishta-deva]]'' of Krishna or his associated expansions and avatars. Practicing ''vaidhi-bhakti'' with a view to cultivate ''[[prema (love)|prema]]'' creates eligibility for ''raganuga-sadhana''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://www.swami.org/pages/sanga/1999/1999_13.php Learn to Think Differently]'', ''Sanga'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''vaidhi'' and ''raganuga bhakti'' are based on the chanting or singing of Krishna's names. Attainment of the raganuga stage means that rules of lifestyle are no longer important and that emotions or any material activities for Krishna should not be repressed. Vaidhi-bhakti's purpose is to elevate the devotee to raganuga; something which generally takes a long time.

Within his ''[[Siksastaka]]'' prayers, Chaitanya compares the process of ''bhakti-yoga'' to that of cleansing a dirty place of dust, wherein our consciousness is the object in need of purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lordcaitanya.com/mission/en1 |title=Teachings of Lord Caitanya - Sikshashtakam |publisher=Lordcaitanya.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203073845/http://lordcaitanya.com/mission/en1 |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This purification takes place largely through the [[japa|chanting]] and [[bhajan|singing]] of Radha and Krishna's names. Specifically the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]] is chanted and sung by practitioners on a daily basis, sometimes for many hours each day. Famously within the tradition, one of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's close associates, [[Haridasa Thakur]], is reported to have chanted 300,000 holy names of God each day.&lt;ref&gt;Caitanya Caritamrita 1.10.43, 3.3.100, 3.3.176, 3.4.101, 3.7.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet and lifestyle===
Gaudiya Vaishnavas follow a [[Lacto vegetarianism|Lacto vegetarian]] diet, abstaining from all types of animal flesh, including fish and eggs. Onions and garlic are also avoided as they are believed to promote a more ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]ic'' form of consciousness in the eater when taken in large quantities. Gaudiya Vaishnavas also avoid the intake of caffeine, as they believe it is addictive and an intoxicant. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buxton|first1=Julia|title=The Politics of Narcotic Drugs: A Survey|date=17 December 2010|isbn=1857437594|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Gaudiya Vaishnavas will live for at least some time in their life as monks (''[[brahmacharya]]'').

==History==
[[File:Mahaprabhu 103.jpg|thumb|A ''[[murti]]'' of Chaitanya in [[ISKCON]] temple, [[Mayapur]]]]

===Chaitanya Mahaprabhu===
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (also transliterated '''Caitanya''', [[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Caitanya Mahāprabhu}}''; 18 February 1486 – 14 June 1534&lt;ref name="gaudiyahistory.com"&gt;[http://gaudiyahistory.com/caitanya-mahaprabhu/]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] spiritual teacher who founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism. He is believed by his devotees to be [[Krishna]] himself who appeared in the form of His own devotee in order to teach the people of this world the process of Bhakti and how to attain the perfection of life. He is considered as the most merciful manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya was the proponent for the [[Vaishnava]] school of [[Bhakti yoga]] (meaning loving devotion to God), based on ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam (Introduction)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203633/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 |date=25 May 2013 }} "Lord Caitanya not only preached the Srimad-Bhagavatam but propagated the teachings of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as well in the most practical way."&lt;/ref&gt; Of various incarnations of Vishnu, he is revered as Krishna, popularised the chanting of the ''[[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]]'' [[mantra]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scsmath.com/docs/chaitanya_mahaprabhu.html Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu] "He spread the [[Yuga Dharma|Yuga-dharma]] as the practice for attainment of pure love for [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]]. That process is Harinam-Sankirtan, or the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of Krishna "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare"&lt;/ref&gt; and composed the ''[[Siksastaka]]m'' (eight devotional prayers) in [[Sanskrit]]. His followers, [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s, revere him as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin E. Zeller (2010), Prophets and Protons, New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814797211}}, pages 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early growth===
Over the three centuries following the disappearance of [[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition evolved into the form in which we largely find it today in contemporary India. In the early years of the tradition, the followers of [[Nityananda]] Prabhu, [[Advaita Acharya]] and other companions of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu educated and initiated people, each in their own locales across [[Bengal]].

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu requested a select few among his followers, who later came to be known as the [[Six Gosvamis of Vrindavan]], to systematically present his [[theology]] of bhakti in their writings. This theology emphasized the devotee's relationship to the Divine Couple, Radha and Krishna, and looked to Caitanya as the embodiment of both Radha and Krishna. The six were [[Rupa Goswami]], [[Sanatana Goswami]], [[Gopala Bhatta Goswami]], [[Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami]], [[Raghunatha dasa Goswami]] and [[Jiva Goswami]]. In the second generation of the tradition, Narottama, Srinivasa and Shyamananda, three students of [[Jiva Goswami]], the youngest among the six Goswamis, were instrumental in spreading the theology across [[Bengal]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].

The festival of Kheturi (approx 1574),&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:VqATTY2a2uMJ:www.gaudiya.com/pdf/Women_Saints_in_Gaudiya_Vaishnavism.pdf+festival+kheturi+date&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4&amp;gl=uk Women Saints in Gaudiya Vaishnavism] "The event at which this took place was the famous Kheturi festival already mentioned above, the date of which is still a matter of conjecture, but likely took place in the 1570s."&lt;/ref&gt; presided over by [[Jahnava Thakurani]], the wife of [[Nityananda|Nityananda Rama]], was the first time the leaders of the various branches of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's followers assembled together. Through such festivals, members of the loosely organized tradition became acquainted with other branches along with their respective theological and practical nuances. That notwithstanding, the tradition has maintained its plural nature, having no central authority to preside over its matters. The festival of Kheturi allowed for the systemization of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology as a distinct branch of [[Vaishnava theology]].

===17th-18th century===
[[File:Panca-tattva Altar.jpg|thumb|[[Pancha Tattva (Vaishnavism)|Pancha-Tattva]] deities: [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Nityananda]], [[Advaita Acharya]], [[Gadadhara]] and [[Srivasa]], installed in a Gaudiya Vaishnava temple]]

[[Gaudiya Matha]] historians assert that in the 17th–18th century, there was a period of general decline in the movement's strength and popularity characterized by decreased preaching and appearance of persons following and promoting degraded teachings and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|śuna haridāsa ei līlā saṃgopane viśva andhakāra karibeka duṣṭa jane}}, Harinama Cintamani 15.108&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are called ''apasampradayas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.gaudiyakutir.com/Apasampradaya gaudiya kutir - Asampradaya] {{Failed verification|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Vishvanath Chakravarti|Vishvanath Chakravarti Thakur]] held great merit in clarifying core doctrinal issues over the practice of ''raganuga-bhakti'' through works such as ''Raga-vartma-chandrika''. His student [[Baladeva Vidyabhushan]] wrote a famous commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras|Vedanta-sutra]] called [[Govinda Bhashya]].

The 18th century saw a number of luminaries headed by Siddha Jayakrishna Das Babaji of Kamyavan and Siddha Krishnadas Babaji of [[Govardhan hill|Govardhan]]. The latter, a widely renowned teacher of the mode of internal worship (''raga-bhajan'') practiced in the tradition, is largely responsible for the current form of devotional practice embraced by some of the traditions based in [[Vrindavan]].

From the very beginning of Chaitanya's ''bhakti'' movement in Bengal, [[Haridasa Thakur]] and others [[Muslim]] by birth were the participants. This openness received a boost from [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]'s broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalized by [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur]] in his [[Gaudiya Matha]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sherbow2004&gt;{{cite journal

===20th century renaissance===
{{main|Gaudiya Math}}
This period was followed by a renaissance which began at the start of the 20th century. This change is believed to have happened largely due to the efforts of a particularly adept preacher known as [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]], who also held the position of a deputy magistrate with the British government. Bhaktivinoda Thakur's son grew up to be both an eminent scholar and highly influential Vaishnava preacher, known in his later life as Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur]]. In total, Bhaktisidhanta Sarasvati Thakur founded in 1918 [[Gaudiya Math]] and later sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe. The first European preaching center was established in [[London]] in 1933 (London Glouster House, Cornwall Garden, W7 South Kensington) under the name 'Gaudiya Mission Society of London'.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages. Page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's death (1 January 1937), a dispute began and the original Gaudiya Math mission divided into two administrative bodies which continued preaching on their own, up to the present day. In a settlement they divided the 64 Gaudiya Math centers into two groups. '[[Sri Chaitanya Math]]' Branch were headed by Srila Bhakti Vilasa Tirtha Maharaj. '[[Gaudiya Mission]]' were headed by Ananta Vasudev Prabhu, who became known as Srila Bhakti Prasad Puri Maharaj after accepting [[sannyasa]] for short duration.{{sfn|Broo|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Bryant, Ekstrand|2004|p=}}{{sfn|Rosen|1994|p=}}

Many of the disciples of [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] did not agree with the spirit of these newly created two fractions, or were simply inspired to expand the mission of their guru on their own enthusiasm, started their own missions. His disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west in order to spread Gaudiya-Vaishnavism. The society he established, the '[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]]' (ISKCON) still functions today and continues its preaching mission.

==Gaudiya and other Vaishnava schools==
Although sharing a common set of core beliefs, there are a number of philosophical differences which distinguish Gaudiya Vaishnavism from other Vaishnava schools:
* In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, [[Krishna]] is seen as the original form of God, i.e. the source of Vishnu and not as His avatar. This is based primarily on verse 1.3.28 of the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (''krsnas tu bhagavan svayam'')&lt;ref name="Bhagavata Purana 1.3.28"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 |title=Bhagavata Purana 1.3.28 |publisher=Srimadbhagavatam.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123024056/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other scriptures. This belief is shared by the [[Nimbarka]] and [[Vallabha]] [[sampradaya]]s, but not by the [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhva]] schools, who view Krishna as an avatar of [[Vishnu]].
* As Krishna's [[Marriage|consort]], [[Radha]] is similarly viewed as the source of all other [[Shakti]]s, including [[Lakshmi]] and [[Sita]].
* [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] is worshiped as the most recent [[Avatar]] of Krishna to descend in the current [[yuga]], or age. Other ''sampradayas'' view Chaitanya as a devotee of Krishna only, and not Krishna himself or a form of avatar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} According to his biographies, Chaitanya did not display himself as Krishna in public,{{Dubious|date=November 2008}} and would in fact avoid being addressed as such. In this regard A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami states, "[When] addressed as Lord Krishna, He denied it. Indeed, He sometimes placed His hands over His ears, protesting that one should not be addressed as the Supreme Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.net/tlc/17/en1 |title=Teachings of Lord Chaitanya |publisher=Vedabase.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However at times Chaitanya would exhibit a different mood and would welcome worship of himself as the Supreme Lord, and at a few occasions, is said to have exhibited his Universal form. [[Rupa Goswami]], when first meeting with Chaitanya, composed the following verse showing his belief in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's divinity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"O most munificent incarnation! You are Krishna Himself appearing as Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. You have assumed the golden colour of Srimati Radharani, and You are widely distributing pure love of Krishna. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/madhya/19/53/en1 |title=Caitanya Caritamrita 2.19.53 |publisher=Caitanyacaritamrta.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214205744/http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/madhya/19/53/en1 |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this viewpoint outside of the Gaudiya tradition was disputed, Chaitanya's followers prove it by pointing at verses throughout the Puranic literatures as evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/11/5/32/en1 Bhagavata Purana 11.5.32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208145107/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/11/5/32/en1 |date=8 February 2007 }} "In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the names of Krishna. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Krishna Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://absolutetruth.in/docs/madhva/sastras_caitanya.htm |title=Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu predicted |publisher=Veda.harekrsna.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological sources===
Gaudiya Vaishnava theology is prominently expounded by [[Jiva Goswami]] in his ''[[Sat-sandarbhas]]'', six elaborate treatises on various aspects of God. Other prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava theologians are his uncles, [[Rupa Gosvami]] author of ''Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu''&lt;ref&gt;Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu-bindu, {{ISBN|978-81-86737-16-3}} {{ISBN|978-81-208-1861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sanatana Gosvami]], author of ''Hari-bhakti-vilasa'',&lt;ref&gt;Hari-bhakti-vilasa, {{ISBN|81-87812-86-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visvanatha Chakravarti]] author of ''Sri Camatkara-candrika''&lt;ref&gt;Sri Camatkara-candrika, {{ISBN|81-86737-33-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]], author of ''[[Govinda Bhashya]]'', a famous commentary on [[Vedanta Sutra]].

The '''Hindu milk miracle''' was a phenomenon which occurred on 21 September 1995, in which statues of the Hindu deity [[Ganesha]] were thought to be drinking milk offerings.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Suzanne Goldenberg, ''"India's gods milk their faithful in a brief 'miracle'"'', [[The Guardian]], 22 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGirk|first1=Tim|title=Hindu world divided by a 24-hour wonder|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hindu-world-divided-by-a-24-hour-wonder-1602382.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=Independent|date=22 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The news spread very quickly in various Indian and American cities, as Indians everywhere tried to "feed" idols of Ganesha with milk and spread the news through [[telephones]] and [[word of mouth]], mostly in large cities and towns. It attracted great attention from people and the media particularly in India.&lt;ref name="IE_2006science"&gt;{{cite news |title=Idols 'drinking' milk is pure science |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=72699 |work= |publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]'' |accessdate=25 November 2012 |author= |date=Aug 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific explanation for the incident, attested by Indian academics, was that the material was pulled up from the offering bowls by [[capillary action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/10/world/india-s-guru-busters-debunk-all-that-s-mystical.html|title=India's 'Guru Busters' Debunk All That's Mystical|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=1995-10-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most cases, it appeared to have been caused by a mix of surface tension, [[capillary effect]], [[confirmation bias]] wherein people believed what they wanted to believe, in addition to what is termed [[group think]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Das|first1=Subhamoy|title=15 Years of the Ganesha Milk Miracle|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-ganesha-milk-miracle-1770392|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=Thought Co|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenon==
Before dawn on 21 September 1995, a worshipper at a temple in south [[New Delhi]] made an offering of milk to a statue of Ganesha. When a spoonful of milk from the bowl was held up to the trunk of the statue, the liquid appeared to disappear, apparently taken in by the idol. Word of the event spread quickly, and by mid-morning it was found that statues of the entire [[Hindu deities|Hindu pantheon]] in temples all over India were taking in milk.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

By noon the news had spread beyond India, and Hindu temples in the United Kingdom, Canada, [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], and [[Nepal]] among other countries had successfully replicated the phenomenon, and the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (an Indian Hindu nationalist organisation which provides social services to Hindus in India and across the world) announced that a [[miracle]] was occurring. In the United States, it was said to have been observed at the [[Hindu Temple Society of North America]] (Ganesh Temple)&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;David Wooding, ''"Cow do they do that?"'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]{{siadn|date=April 2018}}'', 22 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported miracle had a significant effect on the areas around major temples; vehicle and pedestrian traffic in [[New Delhi]] was dense enough to create a [[gridlock]] lasting until late in the evening. Many stores in areas with significant Hindu communities saw a massive jump in sales of milk, with one [[Somerfield|Gateway]] store in England selling over 25,000 [[pint]]s of milk,&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; and overall milk sales in New Delhi jumped over 30%.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;Tim McGirk, ''"India's thirsty statues drink the nation dry"'', [[The Independent]], 22 September 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Many minor temples struggled to deal with the vast increase in numbers, and queues spilled out into the streets, reaching distances of over a mile. Cable television channels in Mumbai started to stream scenes at temples live, while the popular Sidhi Vinayak temple decided to close its gates, with a large notice stating that its Ganesha idol did not drink milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ganesha drinking milk again|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ganesha-drinking-milk-again/articleshow/1910537.cms|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=Times of India|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==
Seeking to explain the phenomenon, Ross McDowall from [[Ministry of Science and Technology (India)|India's Ministry of Science and Technology]] travelled to a temple in New Delhi and made an offering of milk containing a [[food coloring|food colouring]]. As the level of liquid in the spoon dropped, the scientists hypothesised that after the milk disappeared from the spoon, it coated the statue beneath where the spoon was placed. With this result, the scientists offered [[capillary action]] as an explanation; the [[surface tension]] of the milk was pulling the liquid up and out of the spoon, before gravity caused it to run down the front of the statue.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; [[Prabir Ghosh]] was one of the people to demonstrate how the Hindus were coaxed into believing the miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/10/world/india-s-guru-busters-debunk-all-that-s-mystical.html|title=India's 'Guru Busters' Debunk All That's Mystical|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=1995-10-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believed in the miracle, further proof was offered when the phenomenon seemed to cease before the end of the day, with many statues refusing to take more milk even before noon.&lt;ref name="Asian Age"&gt;Meenhal Baghel, ''"Awed devotees witness Shiva miracle across country"'', [[The Asian Age]], 22 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of temples outside of India reported the effect continuing for several more days, but no further reports were made after the beginning of October. However, skeptics hold the incident to be an example of [[mass hysteria]]. The story was picked up, mostly as a novelty piece, by news services around the world, including [[CNN]], the [[BBC]], the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.

==Similar incidents==
The miracle allegedly occurred again on 20–21 August 2006 in almost exactly the same fashion, although initial reports seem to indicate that it occurred only with statues of [[Ganesh]], [[Shiva]], and [[Durga]]. The first reported occurrence was on the evening of the 20th in the city of [[Bareilly]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], from where it quickly spread throughout India, but this time was not believed by many.&lt;ref&gt;Shaveta Bansal, ''[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7004605758 "Devotees Throng Temples To See Hindu Deities Drinking Milk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206084637/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7004605758 |date=6 February 2007 }}'', All Headline News, 21 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incident was again attributed to [[capillary action]] by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/science-behind-milk-drinking-gods/19175-11.html "Milk-drinking gods just plain science"], [[Press Trust of India]], 21 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon had reappeared only days after reports of [[2006 Mumbai "sweet" seawater incident|sea water turning sweet]] that led to [[mass hysteria]] in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jayaraman|first1=T|title=Obscurantism vs Science -  behind the milk drinking miracle|url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~jayaram/Articles/milkb.html|website=imsc.res.in|publisher=The Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the phenomenon also occurred in Trinidad; milk was accepted by both [[murti]]s and religious pictures. The phenomenon occurred in Hindu temples as well as at the homes of Hindus in Trinidad. ''[[Trinidad Express]]'' newspaper reported on 22 September 2010 that statues of Ganesh "drank" or accepted milk at Om Shanti Mandir, Cunjal Road, Princes Town, [[Trinidad]] on 21 September 2010 on the occasion of the holy period of [[Ganesh Utsav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Ganesh_murtis__drink__milk_-103591304.html|title=Ganesh murtis 'drink' milk|newspaper=[[Trinidad and Tobago Express|Trinidad Express]]|date=Sep 22, 2010|author=Ariti Jankie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">'''Hugh of Eu''' '''(Hugues, Hugo)''' ({{floruit|1049}} - d. 17 July 1077) was [[Bishop of Lisieux]] from 1049 to 1077.

==History==

Hugh was the son of [[William I, Count of Eu]], and his wife Lesceline.

[[William of Poitiers]] and [[Orderic Vitalis]] both depict him with a flattering light. He became bishop of Lisieux at a very young age in 1049. Under his episcopacy he completed the reconstruction of the cathedral and proceeded his dedication according to the Neustria Pia on 8 July 1060 and brought the relics of [[Arcadius of Bourges]] to [[La Chapelle-Saint-Ursin|Saint Ursin's]]. He organized the cathedral chapter, composed of a dean, a treasurer and a cantor.

In 1050, Hugh, together with his brother and mother, founded the abbey of [[Saint-Désir|Saint-Désir de Lisieux]], composed of nuns from [[Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives]] and later Benedictine monks. On October 7, 1050, he blessed Thierry de Mathonville, the first abbot of the [[Abbey of Saint-Evroul|abbey of Saint-Évroult]] since its restoration and later Osberne in 1061 and Mainier d'Échauffour, in 1066.

He attended the [[Council of Lillebonne]], where the expedition of [[William the Conqueror]] to England was approved. He was present at the dedication of [[Jumièges Abbey]] of on July 1, 1067, as well as to the dedications of the cathedrals of Bayeux and Évreux and that of the [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen]] in 1077.

Hugh fell ill at [[Pont-l'Évêque, Calvados|Pont-l'Évêque]] and died on his return trip on July 17, 1077. He was buried at the Saint-Désir Abbey. His tomb was discovered by François Cottin in the 1950s in the center of the sanctuary of the first abbey church.

{{Hinduism}}

'''Ishvara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईश्वर, [[IAST]]: Īśvara) is a concept in [[Hinduism]], with a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt; In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, ''Ishvara'' can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen  or husband.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt; In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, ''Ishvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]].&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73/&gt;

In [[Shaivism]], ''Ishvara'' is synonymous with "[[Shiva]]", sometimes as ''Maheshvara'' or ''Parameshvara'' meaning the "Supreme lord", or as an [[Ishta-deva]] (personal god).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=235, 379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vaishnavism]], it is synonymous with [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In traditional [[Bhakti]] movements, Ishvara is one or more deities of an individual's preference from Hinduism's polytheistic canon of deities. In modern sectarian movements such as [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]], Ishvara takes the form of a monotheistic  God.&lt;ref name=rkpr/&gt; In [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, it is any "personal deity" or "spiritual inspiration".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt; In [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.&lt;ref name=lance&gt;Lance Nelson (1996), Living liberation in Shankara and classical Advaita, in Living Liberation in Hindu Thought (Editors: Andrew O. Fort, Patricia Y. Mumme), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791427064}}, pages 38-39, 59 (footnote 105)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller/&gt;

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ishvara comes from ''īś-'' (ईश, Ish) which means "capable of" and "owner, ruler, chief of",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]] (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately cognate with English ''own'' (Germanic ''[[:wikt:agnian|*aigana-]]'', PIE ''*aik-''). The second part of the word ''Ishvara'' is ''vara'' which means depending on context, "best, excellent, beautiful", "choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift", and "suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; The composite word, ''Ishvara'' literally means "owner of best, beautiful", "ruler of choices, blessings, boons", or "chief of suitor, lover".

As a concept, ''Ishvara'' in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Soul, lord, king or ruler, rich or wealthy man, god of love, deity Shiva, one of the [[Rudra]]s, prince, husband and the number eleven.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apte Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Īśvara'' never appears in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt; However, the verb ''īś-'' does appear in Rig veda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is "capable of, able to".&lt;ref name=madhav&gt;Madhav Deshpande (1991), Sense and Syntax in Vedic (Editors: Joel Brereton and Stephenie Jamison), Volumes 4-5, Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004093560}}, pages 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; It is absent in [[Samaveda]], is rare in [[Atharvaveda]], appears in [[Samhita]]s of [[Yajurveda]]. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian [[Pāṇini]] explains, is neither god nor supreme being.&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt;

The word ''Ishvara'' appears in numerous ancient [[Dharmaśāstra#Principal Root Texts|Dharmasutra]]s. However, [[Patrick Olivelle]] states that there ''Ishvara'' does not mean God, but means [[Veda]]s.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; Deshpande states that ''Ishvara'' in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that "the Dharmasutras are as important as ''Ishvara'' (the king) on matters of public importance".&lt;ref name=patrick&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2006), Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE: Society in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195305326}}, page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Saivite]] traditions of [[Hinduism]], the term is used as part of the compound "[[Maheshvara]]" ("great lord") as a name for [[Shiva]].  In [[Mahayana Buddhism]] it is used as part of the compound "[[Avalokiteśvara]]" ("lord who hears the cries of the world"), the name of a [[bodhisattva]] revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in [[Shaktism]], the feminine ''{{IAST|Īśvarī}}'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
Among the six systems of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa]] do not consider the concept of ''Ishvara'', i.e., a supreme being, relevant. [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Desmarais states that Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=mmd&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (''[[Bhakti]]''), nor does it give ''Ishvara'' characteristics typically associated with a deity.&lt;ref name=mmd/&gt; In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt; Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term ''Ishvara'' as the "Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings".&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knut"/&gt; Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, ''Isvara'' is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.&lt;ref&gt;A Malinar (2014), Current Approaches: Articles on Key Themes, in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, {{ISBN|978-0415462327}}, pages 242-243, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] movement considers Krishna as the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710492}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]] movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord.&lt;ref name=rkpr&gt;RK Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, {{ISBN|978-8171417803}}, pages 5-6, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] of Ramanuja and [[Dvaita|Dvaita Vedanta]] of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the ''Prakriti'' (material world) and ''Purusa'' (soul, spirit).

Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in ''Isvara'' concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of "personal God" where the "ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed".&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 37-39, 401-403, 498-503&lt;/ref&gt; Riepe, and others,&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; state that schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Isvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of "deity of one's choice" or "formless [[Brahman]] (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)".&lt;ref name=riepe&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, {{ISBN|978-0836206111}}, pages 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1966), Hinduism, Oxford University Press, 1980 edition: pages 126-129, Reprinted in 1983 as {{ISBN|978-0198880127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Samkhya school of Hinduism===
[[Samkhya]] is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars.&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Garbe (2013), Die Samkhya-Philosophie, Indische Philosophie Volume 11, {{ISBN|978-1484030615}}, pages 25-27 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Jacobsen]], Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Isvara is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Yoga school of Hinduism===
The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, uses the term ''Ishvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Isvara''? These commentaries range from defining ''Isvara'' from a "personal god" to "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of ''Isvara'' in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali defines ''Isvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n33/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|क्लेश कर्म विपाकाशयैःपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष '''ईश्वरः''' ॥२४॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of ''Isvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali's concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=knut&gt;[[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]] (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaisesika school of Hinduism===
[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on ''Ishvara'' for its [[atomism|atomistic]] naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and ''paramāṇu'' (atoms) were eternal, they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal ''adrsta'' (अदृष्ट, invisible) laws of nature.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and modern science, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-0865902787}}, pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Ishvara'', among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in 1st millennium AD.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674001879}}, page 836&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called "atoms" have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vaiśeṣika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do its thing.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt; Thus, Vaisheshika's Ishvara mirrors [[Deus otiosus]] of [[Deism]]. Vaisheshika school's ''Ishvara'', states [[Klaus Klostermaier]], can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He "winds up the clock, and lets it run its course".&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, page 337&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Nyaya school of Hinduism===
Early [[Nyaya]] school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including ''Ishvara''. Verses 19-21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;

Centuries later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by [[Udayana]], who in his text ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'', interpreted "it" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as "human action" and "him" as "Ishvara", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt; In developing his arguments, he inherently defined ''Ishvara'' as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the [[karma]] doctrine work.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VR Rao (1987), Selected Doctrines from Indian Philosophy, {{ISBN|81-70990009}}, pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Mimamsa school of Hinduism===
[[Mīmāṃsā]] scholars of Hinduism questioned what is ''Ishvara'' (God)?&lt;ref name=fxc3&gt;FX Clooney (1997), What’s a god? The quest for the right understanding of devatā in Brāhmaṅical ritual theory (Mīmāṃsā), International Journal of Hindu Studies, August 1997, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 337-385&lt;/ref&gt; They used their ''[[pramana]]'' tools to cross examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God's creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara's love to human beings because this world – if Ishvara created it – is imperfect and human souls are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises, deconstructed justifications offered, and considered Ishvara concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).&lt;ref name=fxc3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2001), Hindu doubts about God: Towards Mimamsa Deconstruction, in Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 4, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3611-2}}, pages 87-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vedanta school of Hinduism===

====Advaita Vedanta====
[[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiShamya NairgghruNya doSha vihInaH).  Ishvara is that which is "free from ''avidya'' (ignorance), free from ''ahamkrti'' (ego-sense), free from ''bandhana'' (bondage)", a Self that is "pure, enlightened, liberated".&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
Having accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as 'saguNa' or with attributes from the empirical existence and 'nirguNa' from the absolute sense.  This oneness is accepted only at the level of 'mukti' or ultimate realization and not at the 'vyavahara' or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between ''Jiva'' (living being) and ''Ishvara'', and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101-109 (in German), also pages 69-99&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
ईश्वरः अहम् &lt;br&gt;
Ishvara, I am.
|[[Adi Shankara]]| Upadesasahasri 2.3.1, 2.10.8 &lt;ref name=lance/&gt;}}

Other Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the [[monism|monist]] views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is "above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself – he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, page 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 547-551&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-------------Commenting out these sentences as all of it failed verification. If alternate reliable source(s) with page numbers can be cited, please re-add

[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitism]] holds that when human beings think of [[Brahman]], the Supreme Cosmic Spirit is projected upon the limited, finite human mind and appears as ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}"&gt;See generally, Sinha, H.P. (1993), ''Bhāratīya Darshan kī rūprekhā'' (Features of Indian Philosophy). Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} Therefore, the mind projects human attributes, such as personality, motherhood, and fatherhood on the Supreme Being. An interesting metaphor is that when the "reflection" of the Cosmic Spirit falls upon the mirror of ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' (''{{IAST|Māyā}}''; the principle of illusion, which binds the mind), it appears as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}"/&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} Brahman is not thought to have such attributes in the true sense.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}"&gt;See generally, Swami Bhaskarananda, ''The Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 1994) {{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} However it may be helpful to project such attributes onto Brahman.
------------&gt;

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====
''Ishvara'', in [[Vishishtadvaita]] Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or "non-dualism with differentiation".&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;McCasland et al. (1969), Religions of the world, Random House, {{ISBN|978-0394303840}}, page 471&lt;/ref&gt; Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century [[Ramanuja]] state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Chari1988p212"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. M. Srinivasa Chari|title=Tattvamuktākalāpa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0266-7|pages=212, 231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equated with Vishnu in Vishishtadvaita or one of his [[avatar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. M. Srinivasa Chari|title=Tattvamuktākalāpa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0266-7|pages=18, 228, 340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is both the material and efficient cause, transcendent and immanent.&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; Ishvara manifests in five forms, believe Vishishtadvaitins: ''para'' (transcendent), ''vyuha'' (emanations), ''vibhava'' (incarnations), ''antaryamin'' (dwells inside), and ''arca'' (icons).&lt;ref name=johngrimes/&gt; According to this sub-school, states John Grimes, Ishvara possesses six divine qualities: ''jnana'' (knowledge), ''bala'' (strength), ''aisvarya'' (lordship), ''sakti'' (power), ''virya'' (virility) and ''tejas'' (splendor).&lt;ref name=johngrimes&gt;John Grimes (1996), A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by [[Sri Aurobindo]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; and has been suggested as having influenced Basava's [[Lingayatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 243-244&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dvaita Vedanta====
The Dvaita ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines ''Ishvara'' as creator God that is distinct from ''Jiva'' (individual souls in living beings).&lt;ref name=rajpra&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narayana]] (Vishnu) is considered to be ''Ishvara'', and the [[Vaishnavism]] movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.&lt;ref name=olilea&gt;Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvara'' (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta.&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In [[Dvaita]] sub-school, ''Jiva'' (individual soul) is different, yet dependent on ''Ishvara'' (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual soul is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of ''Jiva'' struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

Madhva states there are five permutations of differences between ''Jiva'' (individual souls) and ''Ishvara'' (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative.&lt;ref name=tompad/&gt; Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, to the state of [[moksha]] in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The world, called ''Maya'', is held as the divine will of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; ''Jiva'' suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of "ignorance and incorrect knowledge" (''ajnana''). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of ''sattva'' [[Guṇa|guna]] (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a [[Dharma|dharmic]] life while constantly remembering, deeply loving ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
{{IAST|Acintya bhedābheda}} is a sub-school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference'', in relation to the power creation and creator, Ishvara, ([[Krishna]]).&lt;ref name=Kaviraja&gt;{{cite book | author = Kaviraja, K.G. | year = | title =  Sri Caitanya-caritamrita. Bengali text, translation, and commentary by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada | publisher = [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] | isbn =}}[http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 ''Madhya'' 20.108-109] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153501/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 |date=11 May 2008 }} "It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Krishna because he is the marginal energy of Krishna and a manifestation simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa Upaniṣad}} 1.25: ''{{IAST|...na bhinnam. nā bhinnamābhirbhinno na vai vibhuḥ}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable', ''bheda'' translates as 'difference', and ''abheda'' translates as 'one-ness'. Spirit souls are considered part of God and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Dialectics|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|publisher=Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=96|quote=Hence, he called his philosophy Achintya Bhedabhed vad, or Inconceivable Simultaneous Oneness and Difference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caitanya's philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva completed the progression to devotional [[theism]]. [[Rāmānuja]] had agreed with [[Śaṅkara|{{IAST|Śaṅkara}}]] that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the [[Jiva|Jīva]]: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jīvas are "inconceivably, simultaneously one and different" (acintya-bheda-abheda).&lt;ref name = SDG&gt;{{Cite book| first = dasa Goswami| last = Satsvarupa| author-link = Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| title =Readings in Vedit Literature: The Tradition Speaks for Itself|   publisher = Assoc Publishing Group| year = 1976| pages = 240 pages | isbn = 0-912776-88-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Carvaka school of Hinduism===
[[Cārvāka]], another atheist tradition in Hinduism, was materialist and a school of [[philosophical scepticism]]. They rejected all concepts of ''Ishvara'' as well as all forms of supernaturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flint, {{Google books|7es0AQAAIAAJ|Anti-theistic theories|page=463}}, Appendix Note VII - Hindu Materialism: The Charvaka System; William Blackwood, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Raman (2012), Hinduism and Science: Some Reflections, Zygon - Journal of Religion and Science, 47(3): 549–574, Quote (page 557): "Aside from nontheistic schools like the [[Samkhya]], there have also been explicitly atheistic schools in the Hindu tradition. One virulently anti-supernatural system is/was the so-called Carvaka school.", {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 67, Quote: "Of the three heterodox systems, the remaining one, the Caravaka system, is a Hindu system."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===

Later they formed another band called Raze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-prettyboyfloyd-chas.html|title=Interview: Vinnie Chas (Pretty Boy Floyd)|publisher=RockEyez|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in Dallas, Cantrell met an early incarnation of [[Pantera (band)|Pantera]] and started a long friendship with brothers [[Dimebag Darrell]] and [[Vinnie Paul]].&lt;ref name="RS 2018"/&gt;

In 1985 or 1986, Cantrell moved back to Tacoma and began a band called Diamond Lie, which included singer Scott Damon, drummer Bobby Nesbitt and bassist Matt Muasau.&lt;ref name="Untold"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUonBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Matt+Muasau,+Bobby+Nesbitt+and+Scott+Nutter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9zq8nxvM3Q&amp;sig=bHHGcJb-KHPoW1KB5zxlI4Ms51g&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV-PC-0vjUAhVCHJAKHYnFB_0Q6AEIGTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Matt%20Muasau%2C%20Bobby%20Nesbitt%20and%20Scott%20Nutter&amp;f=false|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band started playing concerts in Tacoma and Seattle with the goal of getting a record deal and also recorded a four-song demo at [[London Bridge Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=1250048079|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cantrell was 20 years old, he was working several part-time jobs to pay his rent, one of which involved throwing boxes of frozen fish in a warehouse.&lt;ref name="Guitar World 2013"/&gt; He spent his time outside of work playing guitar and jamming with any band he could find.&lt;ref name="Guitar World 2013"/&gt;

Three weeks after his mother's death on April 11, 1987, Cantrell went to see the band [[Alice N' Chains]] perform at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by the voice of the lead singer, [[Layne Staley]].&lt;ref name="pages 60-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0WLlAx6PpE&amp;t=10m02s|title=Intimate interview with Alice in Chains|date=20 April 2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond Lie played their last concert in July 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=1250048079|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantrell wanted to form a new band and Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer [[Sean Kinney]], so that Cantrell could talk to him.&lt;ref name="page 68"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=1250048079|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney.&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt; Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them and he had someone in mind: [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]], with whom Cantrell had played in a band called Gypsy Rose in [[Burien]].&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt; Kinney pointed at his girlfriend and said: "that's weird cause that's his sister".&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt; Kinney called Starr and a few days later he jammed with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank.&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt; But they didn't have a singer.&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIC origin"/&gt;

Staley was already starting up another band, but Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted him to be their lead singer.&lt;ref name="AIC origin"/&gt; They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that.&lt;ref name="Jerry and Sean"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJW77uMEHdI|title=Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney about Layne Staley|work=YouTube|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staley, who was Cantrell's roommate at the time, agreed to join on the condition that Cantrell join his [[funk]] project (which ended shortly after),&lt;ref name="RS 1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alice-in-chains-through-the-looking-glass-19921126|title=Alice in Chains: Through the Looking Glass|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=26 November 1992|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="page 68"/&gt; The band had names like "Mothra", "Fuck" and "Diamond Lie",&lt;ref name="Jerry and Sean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bacus.net/alice/images/diamond.htm|title=Diamond Lie Press Kit|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being the name of Cantrell's previous band.&lt;ref name="Jerry and Sean"/&gt;

Diamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley's previous band, ''Alice N' Chains'', then renamed [[Alice in Chains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvNvExYKj4A|title=Jerry Cantrell explains who is Alice and why is she in Chains |work=YouTube|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerry and Sean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link With Brutality|author=Kleidermacher, Mordechai|date=July 1990|publisher=[[Circus Magazine|Circus]] magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice in Chains' final demo, ''The Treehouse Tapes'', was completed in 1988 and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle bands [[Mother Love Bone]] and [[Soundgarden]], respectively. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref name="page 110"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Sola|first1=David|title=Alice in Chains: The Untold Story|date=August 4, 2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=1250048079|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three months of negotiations, Alice in Chains signed to Columbia Records on September 11, 1989.&lt;ref name="page 110"/&gt;

====Layne Staley era (1987–2002)====
Jerry Cantrell served as the lead guitarist, co-lyricist, co-vocalist and main composer of [[Alice in Chains]] until the group's near-permanent hiatus beginning in the late 1990s and leading through the death of lead singer [[Layne Staley]] in April 2002.&lt;ref name="PopMatters2002"/&gt; Cantrell's guitar contribution gave a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] edge to the band's unique [[grunge]] style.&lt;ref name=Marsicano2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/music/what-the-hell-happened-to-03-31-08-jerry-cantrell-degradation-trip/|publisher=411mania.com|title=What The Hell Happened To… 03.31.08: Jerry Cantrell – Degradation Trip|last=Marsicano|first=Dan|access-date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell also played bass on the track "Love Song", from the 1992 ''[[Sap (EP)|Sap]]'' EP.&lt;ref name="sap"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Alice-In-Chains-SAP/release/9810458|title=Alice In Chains – SAP|work=Discogs|access-date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, "I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of you like you took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't know how to deal with it then, and I still don't.

The band reformed in 2005 when drummer Sean Kinney had the idea to reunite the surviving members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1496882/ex-alice-in-chains-members-enlist-damageplan-singer-others-for-benefit/|title=Ex-Alice In Chains Members Enlist Damageplan Singer, Others For Benefit |work=MTV News|date=February 11, 2005|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform a benefit concert for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster]] that struck South Asia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/music/article/Kinney-drums-up-enthusiastic-response-for-tsunami-1166652.php|title=Kinney drums up enthusiastic response for tsunami benefit |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 17, 2005|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2005, Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in 10 years as Alice in Chains at the ''K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert'' in Seattle.&lt;ref name="Benefit concert"&gt;{{cite news| author=Hay, Travis |date=February 21, 2005 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/212872_alice21q.html |title=Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises |publisher=Seattlepi.com|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band featured [[Damageplan]] vocalist [[Pat Lachman]], as well as other special guests including [[Maynard James Keenan]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Wes Scantlin]] from [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]].&lt;ref name="Benefit concert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIC guests"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10518215/latest_news_jayz_the_strokes_r_kelly_and_more |title=Metallica man joins Alice in Chains |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=June 9, 2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613024237/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10518215/latest_news_jayz_the_strokes_r_kelly_and_more |archivedate=June 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after that concert, the band called their former manager Susan Silver and Cantrell's manager [[Bill Siddons]] and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pollstarpro.com/live2010/panelband.htm|title=Putting The Band Back Together |work=PollstarPro|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2006, Cantrell, Inez and Kinney performed at [[VH1]]'s [[Decades Rock Live]] concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]] of Heart. They played "[[Would?]]" with vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] of [[Pantera]] and [[Down (band)|Down]] and bass player [[Duff McKagan]] of [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Velvet Revolver]], then they played "[[Rooster (song)|Rooster]]" with Ann Wilson and [[Comes with the Fall]] vocalist [[William DuVall]].&lt;ref name="AIC guests"/&gt; The band followed the concert with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour in Japan. To coincide with the band's reunion, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, ''[[The Essential Alice in Chains]]'', a [[double album]] that includes 28 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/essentials.aspx| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024536/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/essentials.aspx| archivedate=October 11, 2007 |title=The Essential Alice in Chains |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantrell explained the band's reunion saying, "We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [Staley's] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the [[Led Zeppelin]] approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to take a chance on it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on."&lt;ref name="MTV reunion article"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524813/02232006/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Remaining Alice in Chains Members Reuniting for Summer Gigs |publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]] |date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, "To put all that weight on Will’s shoulders is unfair. We’re just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, and it always has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here", Cantrell said pointing to his heart.&lt;ref name="Classic Rock 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2009-09-16/alice-in-chains-through-the-looking-glass |title=Alice In Chains: "It hurts and you miss them, but you still have to live" |work=Classic Rock|date=16 September 2009|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I had these mystery migraines, intense physical pain, and I'd even gotten a [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]] to test for certain things. They never could find anything wrong with me. I felt I was puking up all this undigested grief in losing Layne." Once Cantrell started writing the song and the rest of the album, his mystery illness disappeared.&lt;ref name="Guitar World 2013"/&gt; Cantrell, [[Mike Inez]] and [[Sean Kinney]] also thanked Staley in the album's liner notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encartespop.com.br/2011/10/encarte-alice-in-chains-black-gives-way.html |title=Encarte: Alice in Chains - Black Gives Way To Blue |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Solo career===
Cantrell's career outside Alice in Chains has consisted of two solo albums, as well as many appearances with other musicians and on film soundtracks. His first solo material was the song "[[Leave Me Alone (Jerry Cantrell song)|Leave Me Alone]]", released exclusively on ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' [[The Cable Guy#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] in 1996, featuring Alice in Chains drummer [[Sean Kinney]] on drums and Cantrell on lead vocals, guitar and bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Cable-Guy-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/8912581 |title=Various – The Cable Guy (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) |website=Discogs |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a music video, which was included as a bonus feature on the 15th anniversary edition Blu-Ray of ''The Cable Guy'' in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/48111/cable-guy-15th-anniversary-edition-the/ |title=The Cable Guy - 15th Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray) |date=February 18, 2011 |website=DVD Talk |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the song reached No. 14 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jerry-cantrell/chart-history/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks/song/44327 |title=Jerry Cantrell "Leave Me Alone" Chart History |website=Billboard |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Cantrell covered [[Willie Nelson]]'s "I've Seen All This World I Care to See" for the album ''Twisted Willie: A Tribute to Willie Nelson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-27/entertainment/ca-29172_1_willie-nelson|title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP: 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 27, 1996|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the activity of Alice in Chains slowed and the band's future came into question, Cantrell reluctantly began work on his first full-length solo record.

The same year of ''Boggy Depot'', Cantrell began writing a follow-up album.

Cantrell started recording a follow-up to ''Boggy Depot'' in 2000. He was also living in San Francisco during that period.&lt;ref name="MBM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igfYH8LlhlY|title=Alice Chains' Jerry Cantrell at The Million Band March (2000)|work=YouTube|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell had to sell his Seattle house to fund the album and produced it himself.&lt;ref name="seattlepi.com 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Finally in June 2002, Cantrell issued his second solo album, ''[[Degradation Trip]],'' with [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s then live rhythm section, [[Mike Bordin]] (drums) and [[Robert Trujillo]] (bass). Released on [[Roadrunner Records]], ''Degradation Trip'' hit shelves two months after Layne Staley's death and was dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="Roadrunner Cantrell"/&gt; The songs on the album ranged from [[doom metal]] to pop-based [[hard rock]].&lt;ref name=Marsicano2008/&gt; The album, which received better critical reception than its predecessor, featured two singles, "[[Anger Rising]]" and "[[Angel Eyes (Jerry Cantrell song)|Angel Eyes]]", and the track "She Was My Girl" was included on the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' [[Music from and Inspired by Spider-Man|soundtrack]].&lt;ref name="spider-man"/&gt;

''Degradation Trip'' has sold 100,000 copies in the U.S. as of December 2002.&lt;ref name="100k"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Gerry|title=Retail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPzr8f3lVW8C&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33&amp;dq=jerry+cantrell+scanned+100k&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M8Eo8d8FB9&amp;sig=9GXiKnQVP3KNCHbLpG1yIp4dy1E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jerry%20cantrell%20scanned%20100k&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=CMJ New Music Report|accessdate=November 4, 2017|date=December 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live show was well received by audiences on a national tour that helped build upon the solo album's success. ''Degradation Trip'' was [[Degradation Trip Volumes 1 &amp; 2|re-released]] in November 2002 as a [[double album]], featuring eleven additional tracks that were made for the album as Cantrell originally intended.&lt;ref name="Roadrunner Cantrell"/&gt;

In Spring 2004, Cantrell opened a slate of shows on [[Kid Rock]]'s U.S. tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jerry-cantrell-to-open-for-kid-rock/|title=JERRY CANTRELL To Open For KID ROCK|work=Blabbermouth|date=April 8, 2004|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantrell has been rumored to be working on his third full-length solo album for several years, for a supposedly planned release in 2006. However, this album still has not been released. Subsequent work with the revamped Alice in Chains may have stalled this release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-alice-in-chains-guitarist-you-can-t-replace-a-guy-like-layne-staley/ |title=Former ALICE IN CHAINS Guitarist: 'You Can't Replace A Guy Like LAYNE STALEY' |date=June 15, 2005 |website=Blabbermouth |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about releasing another solo album, he issued this statement in 2010:

{{quote|Not for a while. My first and foremost love has been this band and always has been. The only reason I did those two records is because we weren’t working as a band.

In November 2014, during an interview on radio [[95.5 KLOS]], Cantrell was asked if he had any plans on doing more solo work, to which he replied: "I don't know. Maybe somewhere down the road. The only reason I ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn't really doing anything. My band has been doing things lately, so I don't really have time to do anything.

==Style==
Cantrell's early influences made Alice in Chains' heavy metal tones stand out among their fellow grunge/alternative rock-oriented bands of the [[Grunge|Seattle music scene]]. However, his musical range also extends into elements of [[blues]] and [[country music|country]] as heard on his solo debut album. Cantrell's guitar playing is known for its unique use of [[wah pedal]] as well as odd [[time signature]]s. In a 1998 interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'', he was asked about the latter quality:

{{quote|I really don't know where that comes from; it just comes naturally to me. I could sit down and figure it out, but what's the use? Off-time stuff is just more exciting – it takes people by surprise when you shift gears like that before they even know what the hell hit 'em. It's also effective when you slow something down and then slam 'em into the dash. A lot of [[Alice in Chains|Alice]] stuff is written that way – "[[Them Bones]]" is a great off-time song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/archive-jerry-cantrell-his-first-solo-album-and-state-alice-chains|publisher=''[[Guitar World]]''|title=Jerry Cantrell on His First Solo Album and the State of Alice In Chains|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Equipment==
[[File:Jerry06.jpg|thumb|220px|Jerry Cantrell with the original "Blue Dress" G&amp;L guitar during an Alice in Chains concert in 2006.]]
Cantrell has been most famously seen playing a [[G&amp;L Musical Instruments|G&amp;L Guitars']] Rampage model. The two models most closely identified with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Cantrell’s Guitars and Gear|url=https://www.groundguitar.com/jerry-cantrell-gear/|website=GroundGuitar|access-date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony fingerboard. The bridge is a [[Kahler Tremolo System|Kahler Tremolo]] as opposed to a [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G&amp;L Guitars Exclusive Interview with Jerry Cantrell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6T9tY1ioKQ|work=YouTube|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker wired to a volume control.

G&amp;L Guitars makes two Jerry Cantrell Signature guitars available to the general public for purchase. The first is a Rampage model which is very similar to the instrument most closely identified with Cantrell, known as the "Blue Dress Rampage" for having  an image of a vintage pin-up girl wearing a blue dress, which Cantrell taped to the top of his first guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glguitars.com/instruments/usa/customcreations/blue-dress-signature-rampage.asp|title=Jerry Cantrell "Blue Dress" Rampage|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705134639/http://glguitars.com/instruments/usa/customcreations/blue-dress-signature-rampage.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2011|deadurl=yes|work=G&amp;L Musical Instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is a guitar called the 'Superhawk'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rampage™ Jerry Cantrell|url=http://www.glguitars.com/instruments/TributeSeries/guitars/Rampage/index.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guitar features a fixed bridge and the addition of a neck pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: G&amp;L Tribute Series Jerry Cantrell Signature Superhawk Guitar|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/magazine-electrics-gear-news/review-gl-tribute-series-jerry-cantrell-signature-superhawk-guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Cantrell did the harmonies with Layne, and they were haunting, especially on ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]''. Those two guys really had their thing figured out. Guitar-wise, Jerry's playing was always exciting and interesting. ‘[[Them Bones]]’ is a heavy f---ing song. Jerry's tone on that one is insane. The title track has a really ominous intro that sets the mood for the rest of the song. So many great guitar riffs and solo performances on this record. Jerry's a really solid blues-rock guitarist, very tasteful and emotive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/slayer-kerry-king-five-essential-guitar-albums/ |title=Slayer's Kerry King Reveals Five of His Essential Guitar Albums |date=August 19, 2015 |website=Loudwire |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy.

But fuck, I guess we're going to be talking about this for awhile".&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt; "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [''The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here''] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in".&lt;ref name="noisecreep"/&gt; Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".&lt;ref name="noisecreep"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://noisecreep.com/alice-in-chains-religion-album-title/ |title=Alice in Chains on How a ‘Ridiculous’ Religious Claim Inspired Their New Album Title (EXCLUSIVE) |publisher=Noise Creep |date=9 April 2013|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgeries===
During his independent tour for ''[[Degradation Trip]]'' before the album was released, Cantrell broke his left hand while playing football after a concert at the [[Kentucky Derby]]&lt;ref name="broken hand"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyng2mDZ8yg |title=Jerry Cantrell Recalls How He Broke His Hand While Playing Football In 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/archive-news-may-06-2001/ |title=Archive News May 06, 2001 |date=May 6, 2001 |website=Blabbermouth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001082857/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/archive-news-may-06-2001/ |archive-date=October 1, 2013 |dead-url=no |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cantrell was running full speed, his guitar player at the time, Bryan Kehoe, was also running full speed towards him and Cantrell got his pinky finger caught in Kehoe's t-shirt sleeve. Cantrell went to the E.R but they could not do anything for him there, since the bone had slipped back in his hand and he would need a reconstructive surgery, but he had to wait for a couple of weeks for that to happen. Cantrell wanted to continue the tour, and although he was in a lot of pain, he played his first concert as a frontman without a guitar opening for [[Cheap Trick]] in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="broken hand"/&gt; Cantrell needed a Titanium plate and four screws to put the bones back together.&lt;ref name="broken hand"/&gt; Cantrell told that breaking his hand was the worst physical pain he ever had.&lt;ref name="broken hand"/&gt; The injury caused the remainder of Cantrell's solo tour to be postponed. His first concert after the surgery was at the Key Club in West Hollywood on July 1, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/archive-news-may-25-2001/ |date=May 25, 2001 |website=Blabbermouth |title=Archive News May 25, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019174627/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/archive-news-may-25-2001/ |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |dead-url=no |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantrell underwent shoulder surgery twice. In December 2005, a surgery in his left shoulder removed bone fragments and repaired cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/guitarist-jerry-cantrell-recovers-from-shoulder-surgery |title=GUITARIST JERRY CANTRELL RECOVERS FROM SHOULDER SURGERY |publisher=Bravewords |date=12 December 2005|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-in-chains-guitarist-jerry-cantrell-on-the-mend-after-surgery/ |title=ALICE IN CHAINS Guitarist JERRY CANTRELL On The Mend After Surgery |publisher=Blabbermouth |date=12 December 2005|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a chat at [[ESPN.com]] on November 29, 2011, Cantrell revealed that he had another surgery earlier that year, this time in his right shoulder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/jerry_cantrell_if_you_cant__play_you_shouldnt_be_onstage.html |title=Jerry Cantrell: 'If You Can't Play You Shouldn't Be Onstage' |publisher=Ultimate Guitar |date=1 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was in the tail end of the rehabilitation process.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN chat"/&gt; The surgery postponed the recording sessions of ''The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here'' as Cantrell could not play guitar for eight months while he was recovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsQp6_PWqOk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m09s |title=Jerry Cantrell takes over the KLOS airwaves with Melissa Maxx PT1 (November 12, 2014) |date=November 12, 2014 |website=YouTube |access-date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell explained the surgery saying, "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [and] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now.

===Substance abuse===
Cantrell is a recovering addict and alcoholic and has been sober since 2003.&lt;ref name=surgery/&gt;&lt;ref name="speech Musicares"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2yLU8JXvvM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m30s |title=Jerrys Speech 5-31-12 |publisher=YouTube |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2012 [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] Award from [[MusiCares]], for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [Kinney] was at the door with my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush at the bottom of a cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, "We really miss Layne [Staley] and Mike [Starr], and we carry them with us in our hearts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alice-in-chains-jerry-cantrell-honored-with-stevie-ray-vaughan-award-20120601 |title=Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell Honored with Stevie Ray Vaughan Award |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="speech Musicares"/&gt;

{{NewThought}}
'''Joel Solomon Goldsmith''' (March 10, 1892 – June 17, 1964) was an [[United States|American]] spiritual author, teacher, [[spiritual healer]], and modern-day mystic. He founded [[The Infinite Way]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, R.S. and Alles, G.D. (2007) ''The encyclopedia of world religions.''
Infobase Publishing. p 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinkler, L. (1992) '' The Spiritual Journey of Joel S. Goldsmith'', Valor Foundation, {{ISBN|978-0-9629119-2-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

Joel S. Goldsmith was born in [[New York City]] on March 10, 1892.&lt;ref name="Religious Leaders of America"&gt;Melton, J.G. (1999) ''Religious leaders of America: A biographical guide to founders and leaders of religious bodies, churches, and spiritual groups in North America.'' Gale Research. p 219.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were non-practicing Jews, who were married in New York City in 1891. Joel was their first child. They had another son two years later, followed by a daughter two years thereafter.

In 1915, Joel's father became critically ill while in England and word was sent to the Goldsmith family to come for the body. However, according to Joel, his father was healed by a [[Christian Science practitioner]] in London.&lt;ref name="Religious Leaders of America"/&gt; From his early adulthood, Joel Goldsmith had many spiritual experiences. 

He was a healer who spent many years in spiritual studies, reading original scriptures of Aramaic, Greek and Sanskrit origins. His first book, ''The Infinite Way'', was published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Joel S. Goldsmith Family Archives 1948 to 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the Marines during [[World War I]], Goldsmith returned to work in the garment district of New York City, where he owned his own business. While on a return trip from Europe, he developed pneumonia. As was his father before him, Goldsmith was healed by a Christian Science practitioner who happened to be on board his ship at the time. 

In 1928, strangers began approaching Goldsmith on the street, asking for prayer and healing. He had no religious training whatsoever, but these people allegedly were healed. To seek answers about this phenomenon, Goldsmith first entered the Christian Science Church and worked at Rikers Island prison as a First Reader. After 16 years, he left the Church and moved to Boston, where he set up his own office. He moved to California before World War II and maintained a successful healing practice there. 

In 1948 Goldsmith wrote the book ''The Infinite Way'', which came to the attention of Willing Publishers. The book's title also became the name associated with his spiritual message and work.&lt;ref&gt;The Taped Lectures of Joel S. Goldsmith 1950-1964&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Infinite Way'' ==
{{main|The Infinite Way}}

Goldsmith self-published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Joel S.|title=The Infinite Way|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TBwyXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22joel+goldsmith%22+infinite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2uOlU9DRMsua0AXR7oDQAg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ|website=Google Books|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; his most famous work, ''The Infinite Way'', in 1947, which was based on letters to patients and students. He also published ''The Spiritual Interpretation of Scripture''.

The writings which followed were transcriptions of his lectures which had been recorded on the first wire recorders in the late 1940s. These were distributed by Goldsmith Publishing. They were: ''The Master Speaks'', ''The First, Second, Third San Francisco Lecture Series'', ''Consciousness Unfolding'', ''God the Substance of All Form'', and ''Metaphysical Notes''. These original books were later republished during Goldsmith's lifetime by publishers in various countries, making over fifty books.

As Goldsmith was approached by large publishing houses around the world to produce books of his talks, he enlisted the help of [[Lorraine Sinkler]] and her sister Valborg to edit his books, which were generally compiled from various lecture transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Infinite Way|url=http://www.valorfoundation.com/|website=The Valor Foundation|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith's insistence on "no organization" insured that his message remained a personal journey with leaders naturally evolving from new generations. There is no service, ritual, dogma, or ceremony in the practice of the Infinite Way. Goldsmith students can be found in all walks of life, in all religions. His message is one that can be read and heard for a lifetime, always allowing new understandings to unfold in each individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is Joel Goldsmith?|url=http://www.acropolisbooks.com/learn/who-is-joel-goldsmith/|website=Acropolis Books|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith stressed "contemplative meditation" practice in his teaching. The method he generally taught involved short frequent meditation periods throughout the day. He told his student of 18 years, Walter Starcke, that the main reason to meditate was that through reaching the inner silence one could hear the still small voice and receive its intuitive guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Starcke, Walter. ''Joel Goldsmith and I: The Inside Story of a Relationship with a Modern Mystic''. Boerne, TX.: Guadalupe, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching also stressed spiritual healing through conscious contact with God.

After writing the work, Goldsmith expected to retire to a life of contemplation. However, the work prompted people to seek him out as a spiritual teacher, leading to the extension of his career, teaching and writing.

== Death ==

Joel Solomon Goldsmith died on June 17, 1964, at the Piccadilly Hotel, Westminster, [[London]] W1, England. His body was cremated at Golders Green in London on June 18, 1964, and his ashes and effects were released to his widow, Emma Goldsmith, who took them back to their home in [[Hawaii]]. Both were interred in Sun City, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Death of an American Citizen Abroad, Repository Name: National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), NARA Series #: RG59-Entry 5166, Roll/Box #: 13, NARA Box Description: 1964 GL - JK&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">'''Judah ben Yakar''' (d. between 1201 and 1218), talmudist and kabbalist, teacher of [[Nahmanides|Naḥmanides]]. Judah was born in Provence, but in his youth he moved to northern France where he studied under [[Isaac ben Abraham of Dampierre|Isaac b. Abraham]], the tosafist. Subsequently he went to Barcelona where his signature is found on a document of 1175. From other documents signed by Abraham b. Judah of Narbonne, who was apparently his son, the years of Judah's death can be established as between 1201 and 1218. Judah was also a kabbalist, having studied under [[Isaac the Blind]]. In his lifetime Judah was famous for two large works. One – which has been completely lost – was a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud and was one of the earliest systematic commentaries on it. It is frequently quoted by the early authorities and covered at least a large part of the orders of Mo'ed and Nezikin. His other work is the Ma'yan Gannim, a rational commentary on the liturgy and blessings, though the esoteric element is by no means absent. His aim in this work was to show the scriptural and rabbinic versions and sources of the prayers and to detail the various laws connected with them. The commentary was published on the basis of a number of manuscripts by S. Yerushalmi (1968). The work is frequently cited by the rishonim, among them Jacob ha-Kohen of Lunel and David Abudarham. The latter quotes him literally in almost every halakhah, without, however, mentioning his name. Judah's main claim to fame in subsequent generations was that he was one of the teachers of Naḥmanides, who refers to him in his works. It seems that he was one of the channels through which Naḥmanides became acquainted with the literature and methods of study of the tosafists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judah ben Yakar|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/judah-ben-yakar|publisher=Encyclopaedia Judaica|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law of consecration''' is a commandment in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in which adherents promise to dedicate their lives and material substance to the church. It was first referred to in 1831 by [[Joseph Smith]].

== Origins ==
On February 4, 1831, Smith received a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] calling [[Edward Partridge]] to be the first [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, on February 9, 1831, Smith received another revelation detailing the law of consecration.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As practiced by the Latter Day Saints in Smith's day, the law of consecration was for the support of the poor and to ensure that all members would be "equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] 42:30; 51:3.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents were asked to voluntarily [[deed]], or [[Consecration#Latter Day Saints|consecrate]], their property to the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], and the church then would assign to each member a "stewardship" of property "as much as is sufficient for himself and family".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|42|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; If consecrated property became more than was sufficient for the assigned steward, the "residue" was "to be consecrated unto the bishop" kept for the benefit of "those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|42|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Smith, members attempted to implement the law of consecration through the establishment of the [[United Order]], but it was never fully instituted due to conflict and disagreements.

== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==
During the 1850s, [[Brigham Young]], leader of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), attempted to revive the law of consecration. The US Congress used this practice to delay granting land ownership to [[Utah Territory]]. Under scrutiny from the national press and facing advancing federal troops, the church dropped the plan in 1857 in favor of the [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|law of tithing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arrington |first1=Leonard J. |title=Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830-1900 |date=1993 |publisher=University of Utah Press |location=Salt Lake City |isbn=0874804205 |pages=145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the LDS Church has not asked its members to give all of their property to the church: leaders of the church have taught that members "are not now required to live the law of consecration".&lt;ref&gt;[[Marion G. Romney]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/02/living-the-principles-of-the-law-of-consecration "Living the Principles of the Law of Consecration"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', February 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; However, adherents [[covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] with God to accept the law of consecration as part of the [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] ceremony. 

In the 1970s, LDS Church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Bruce R. McConkie]] stated that "[t]he law of consecration is that we consecrate our time, our talents, and our money and property to the cause of the Church: such are to be available to the extent they are needed to further the Lord's interests on earth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce R. McConkie]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1975/05/obedience-consecration-and-sacrifice "Obedience, Consecration, and Sacrifice"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than fully living the United Order to keep the law of consecration, members are asked to [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithe]] their income to support the church, to pay a generous monthly [[fast offering]] to care for the poor, and to donate their time and talents in assisting in the operation of the church.

Adherents believe that the law of consecration will be fully practiced in the future, including during the thousand-year millennium after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/new-era/1979/05/qa-questions-and-answers "Q&amp;A: Questions and Answers: 'Will the righteous members of the Church be asked to live the law of consecration?'"], ''[[New Era (LDS magazine)|New Era]]'', May 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mormon fundamentalism ==
In some [[Mormon fundamentalist]] sects, including the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] and the [[Apostolic United Brethren]], adherents live the law of consecration by deeding their homes and other personal property to the church, which then administers it to the members as needed.

'''Louise Lateau''' (born 29 January 1850 at Bois-d'Haine, in [[Belgium]], died on 25 August 1883 at Bois-d'Haine) was a [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[stigmatist]].&lt;ref name="Lachapelle 2004"&gt;Lachapelle, Sofie. (2004). ''Between Miracle and Sickness: Louise Lateau and the Experience of Stigmata and Ecstasy''. ''[[Configurations]]'' 12: 77-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of Louise Lateau is one of the best documented of those who received the [[stigmata]]. She was famous in the 1860s because of her mystical [[trance]]s and between 1868 and 1883 she was observed by many physicians, members of the clergy and visitors.&lt;ref name="Lachapelle 2004"/&gt;
 
== Life ==

The historian [[David Blackbourn]] has pointed out in his study, that in the life of Louise Lateau a number of features are found similar to other [[Mysticism|Mystics]] such as [[Anna Katharina Emmerick]] and to the experiences of visionaries such as [[Bernadette Soubirous]] and [[Catherine Labouré]]. All suffered similarly from harsh treatment, early separation from family or the loss of family members and in general, a life of dependency and poverty.
 
Louise Lateau’s father died when Louise was still a toddler. Her father died of [[smallpox]] ten weeks after her birth. Louise also contracted the disease and was saved with much difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Lateau. Rapport médical sur la stigmatisée de Bois d’Haine, fait à l’Académie royale de médecine de Belgique au nom d’une commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Baillière et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 10&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother gave her out to work from her 11th year as a housemaid. Shortly thereafter, she was brought back again by her mother and had to work as a dressmaker. During a [[cholera]]-[[epidemic]] in Bois-D’Haine in 1866, the sixteen-year-old Louise Lateau nursed six of the epidemic victims. The following year she became seriously ill herself. The disease lasting until 1868. On April 15, 1868, she was so ill that she received the [[last rites]]. Ten days later she had her first experience of the stigmata.&lt;ref&gt;Blackbourne , p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stigmata==

From 24 April 1868, pain recurred every Friday and blood began to flow from her left side and feet;&lt;ref&gt;Louise Lateau. Rapport médical sur la stigmatisée de Bois d’Haine, fait à l’Académie royale de médecine de Belgique au nom d’une commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Baillière et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 15&lt;/ref&gt;
on 8 May, blood came from both hands as if from nail wounds; on 25 September, the stigmata was completed by the appearance on the breast of four small spots of blood as if coming from four pinpricks to the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatisée de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palmé, 1873, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these wounds appeared without apparent cause on the night of Thursday to Friday and disappeared the next night. It would do this every Friday until her death in 1883. For the rest of the week, Louise Lateau continued to work hard for her family.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Guelff, ''Curieuse histoire d'une stigmatisée'', Jourdan, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her claims of stigmata were disputed by [[Donovan Rawcliffe]] who suggested they were self-inflicted, caused by "extreme emotional or other psychogenic factors following intense concentration on the crucifixion."&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe|Rawcliffe, Donovan]]. (1988). ''Occult and Supernatural Phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 245. {{ISBN|0-486-25551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecstasies==

On July 17, 1868, the phenomenon of the bleeding of the stigmata was accompanied by an ecstasy, which returned every Friday in the form of a trance-like state, which lasted for a total of 8 hours. The first ecstasy took place in the morning at 6:00, after the distribution of Communion, a second occurred around 2 PM.&lt;ref&gt;↑ Louise Lateau. Rapport médical sur la stigmatisée de Bois d’Haine, fait à l’Académie royale de médecine de Belgique au nom d’une commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Baillière et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]. p 25&lt;/ref&gt;
During the ecstasy she was completely absorbed, She no longer had the slightest perception of events occurring in her surroundings. She could stay in contemplation for hours, usually her face expressed the joy but also the fear and sadness of the Passion of Christ. She changed position and was moving in the room. The Ecstasy ended after the mime of the Crucifixion and the Agony of Christ held in the parish church.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatisée de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palmé, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

She was insensitive to pain and noises, but she could briefly exit the ecstasy, following a request of the parish priest of Bois-d'Haine or some clergymen.
Louise kept in memory what she saw: visions of the [[passion of Christ]], of the [[Virgin Mary]] and saints.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, Louise Lateau la stigmatisée de Bois d'Haine, Paris, V. Palmé, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the week, there was nothing but the very ordinary in the life of Louise Lateau. She continued to live with her mother and sisters and to work for her family. These phenomena however began to be known and to attract attention especially from 1871.

It was alleged that Lateau could abstain from food. However, this claim was investigated and proven false (see below).&lt;ref name="Evans 1955"&gt;[[Bergen Evans|Evans, Bergen]]. (1955). ''The Spoor of Spooks: And Other Nonsense''. Purnell. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical and Scientific Enquiries==

At the end of the year 1868 the [[Bishop of Tournai]], Gaspar-Joseph Labis, opened a canonical investigation. The commission was made up of clerics, a lay person who was the Minister of State ([[Adolphe Dechamps]]) and a physician (Dr. Lefebvre of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]]). It acknowledged the sincerity of the person and the authenticity of the facts and concluded that science could find no rational explanation to what had happened to Louise Lateau.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Imbert-Gourbeyre, ''Louise Lateau la stigmatisée de Bois d'Haine'', Paris, V. Palmé, 1873, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium opened an investigation in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Lateau. Rapport médical sur la stigmatisée de Bois d’Haine, fait à l’Académie royale de médecine de Belgique au nom d’une commission, par le Dr Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Baillière et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446].&lt;/ref&gt;

For 5 months, Lateau was observed by experts appointed by the Academy. The conclusions of the Commission were published in 1875. Their conclusion was that there was no conscious deception in the stigmata and the [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasies]]. A physician Evariste Warlomont suggested attributing the phenomena to "double consciousness" (later termed [[dissociative identity disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. (1995). ''Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory''. Princeton University Press. p. 166. {{ISBN|1-4008-0327-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Tony. (2005). ''Dream, Creativity, and Madness in Nineteenth-Century France''. Oxford University Press. pp. 237-238. {{ISBN|0-19-815188-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French neurologist [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]] argued that all of Lateau's phenomena were symptoms of [[hysteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Hustvedt, Asti. (2011). ''Medical Muses: Hysteria in Nineteenth-Century Paris''. Bloomsbury. p. 279. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-2235-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; German psychiatrist [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] suggested that a "natural explanation of the facts is possible, because such things can be induced by [[suggestion]] in a suitable mental state. The conditions resemble each other; the ecstasy of Lateau has a great likeness to the hypnotic state. Ecstasy and hypnosis have many points in common."&lt;ref&gt;Moll, Albert. (1891). [https://archive.org/stream/hypnotism00molluoft#page/117/mode/2up ''Hypnotism'']. London: Walter Scott. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstention from food and the cessation of sleep were not medically attested by the commission. The latter had not been possible as they were unable to carry out permanent monitoring in the family home. Experts from the commission advocated an observation of several days in a hospital, but this was not done.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Lateau. Rapport médical sur la stigmatisée de Bois d’Haine, fait à l’Académie royale de médecine de Belgique au nom d’une commission, par le {{Dr}} Warlomont, Bruxelles, C. Mucquardt, 1875 (Paris, J. P. Baillière et fils, 1875), 195 p. [BNF M-36446]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Vercelletto, Réflexions sur les stigmates, L'harmattan, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Food was however, found. According to skeptic [[Bergen Evans]] "Dr Warlomont, an uncouth and discourteous fellow who was sent to investigate her claims by the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, unexpectedly wrenching upon a cupboard in her room, found a cache of food, and got Miss Lateau to admit that, while she never slept, she was subject to nocturnal periods of forgetfulness."&lt;ref name="Evans 1955"/&gt;

== Death ==

Louise died on August 25, 1883.

On March 5, 2009, the Vatican gave a negative answer to an enquiry wishing to further the cause for her possible beatification.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Guelff, Curieuse histoire d'une stigmatisée, Jourdan 2011. p144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor-Beauchamp was the fourth son of Sir Thomas William Brograve Proctor-Beauchamp, 4th Baronet, and his wife the Hon. Catherine Esther, daughter of [[Granville Waldegrave, 2nd Baron Radstock]]. He was educated at [[Repton School|Repton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= BCM879MH |name=&lt;nowiki&gt;Beauchamp [Proctor-Beauchamp], Montagu Harry [Proctor]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proctor-Beauchamp was one of the [[Cambridge Seven]], students from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], who in 1885 decided to become missionaries in China. He served with the [[China Inland Mission]] during the late [[Qing Dynasty]] in [[China]].  He was evacuated from China during the [[Boxer Rising]] in 1900, but was back in China again from 1902 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollock.  The Cambridge Seven.  IVP 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to England Beauchamp was ordained and had a few years parish work.  He was a chaplain to the forces in the [[First World War]], service in Egypt and Greece, and as a senior chaplain in [[Murmansk]] in northern Russia.

Proctor-Beauchamp married Florence, daughter of Robert Barclay, in 1892. They had several children.  He succeeded in the [[Proctor-Beauchamp Baronets|Proctor-Beauchamp baronetcy]] in 1915 when his elder brother Horace was killed in the [[First World War]]. He died in October 1939, aged 79, and was succeeded in his title by his third but eldest surviving son, Ivor. Lady Proctor-Beauchamp died in May 1955.

'''Pan Junshun''' ({{zh|t=潘均順|s=潘均顺|p=Pān Jūnshùn|first=t}}; 1889 – 1974), was the first [[China|Chinese]] national to be awarded the title [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for hiding and sheltering a [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] girl during the occupation of part of the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]].

==Life==
Pan Jun Shun moved to Russia in 1916 looking for work. He settled in [[Moscow]] where he found work as a laborer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As an enthusiastic communist, he decided to stay in the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name = "Gilbert-p20"&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

P. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He married and had two sons while living in Moscow, after which he moved to [[Kharkov]], [[Ukraine]] in 1936. His wife died before the outbreak of World War II

His two sons were drafted into the [[Red Army]] at the beginning of the war; they never returned home and were presumed to have been killed during the war.

He survived the war and continued to live there until his death in 1974.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
The modern academic study of the '''psychology of religious conversion''' can be tracked back to 1881 when a series of lectures was delivered by early psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]].&lt;ref name=Scobie&gt;Scobie, G. E. W. (1973). Types of religious conversion. ''Journal of Behavioral Science, 1,'' 265–271.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its early stages the psychology of religious conversion mainly addressed [[Christianity]] and to this day is dominated by studies of North American [[Protestant Christianity]],&lt;ref name=Gorsuch&gt;Gorsuch, R. L. (1988). Psychology of religion. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 39'', 201–221.&lt;/ref&gt; although other varieties of religion are addressed in the field of [[psychology of religion]].

== Theories of conversion ==
=== Rambo's Integrative Model ===
Rambo &lt;ref name=Rambo&gt;Rambo, L. R. (1993). ''Understanding religious conversion.'' New Haven: CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a model for [[conversion (religious)|conversion]] that classifies it as a highly complex process that is hard to define.  He views it as a process of religious change that is affected by an interaction of numerous events, experiences, [[ideology|ideologies]], people, institutions, and how these different experiences interact and accumulate over time.  From his research Rambo created an integrative model for conversion that occurs over seven stages.&lt;ref name=Rambo/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage of process !! Factors that must be assessed in this stage
|-
| Stage 1: Context || Factors that facilitate or hinder conversion
|-
| Stage 2: Crisis || May be personal, social, or both
|-
| Stage 3: Quest || Intentional activity on part of potential convert
|-
| Stage 4: Encounter || Recognition of other R/S option
|-

|-

|-
| Stage 7: Consequences|| Transformation of beliefs, behaviors, or identity as result of new commitment
|}

=== Classic paradigm ===
The classic religious paradigm for conversion is highly dependent on the idea of sudden conversion.  The prototypical sudden conversion is the Biblical depiction of the [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|conversion of Paul]] on the road to Damascus.  Sudden conversions are highly emotional but not necessarily rational.  In these instances the convert is a passive agent being acted upon by external forces, and the conversion entails a dramatic transformation of self.  Emotion dominates this dramatic, irrational transformation leading to a shift in self and belief, with behavior change to follow.  For sudden converts conversion is not a back and forth drawn out process, but rather happens in one single instance and is permanent thereafter.  Typically sudden conversions occur in childhood and are exceptionally emotional experiences.  Often sudden conversions are the result of overwhelming anxiety and guilt from sin that becomes unbearable, making conversion a functional solution to ease these emotions.&lt;ref name=Spilka&gt;Spilka, B. et al. (2003). The psychology of religion, an empirical approach. (3 ed.). New York, Ny: Guilford Pubn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional factors have been found to correlate with sudden conversions.  Coe &lt;ref name=Coe&gt;Coe, G. A. (1916). ''The psychology of religion.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; maintains these correlations seem to suggest causation, citing his work in which 17 sudden converts who had dominant emotional factors affecting their conversion.  However, Spellman, Baskett, and Byrnes &lt;ref name=Spellman&gt;Spellman, C. M., Baskett, G. D., &amp; Byrne, D. (1971). Manifest anxiety as a contributing factor in religious conversion. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 36'', 245–247.&lt;/ref&gt; data suggest not.  In their work they found that sudden converts only scored high on levels of [[emotionality]] following conversion, not prior to.  No [[experimental study|experimental]] or [[longitudinal studies]] have demonstrated a true [[causal relationship]] between emotion and sudden conversion.

=== Contemporary paradigm ===
In the contemporary paradigm of conversion we view the conversion process as a highly intellectual, well thought out gradual process.  This contemporary model is a contrast to the classic model, and gradual conversion has been identified by Strickland &lt;ref&gt;Strickland, M. P. (1924). ''Psychology of religious experience.'' New York: Abingdon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as a contrast to sudden conversion.  Scobie &lt;ref name=Scobie/&gt; terms it an "unconscious conversion".  Typically gradual conversions do not occur following a single, impactful event but rather are distinguished empirically and thoughtfully over a length of time.  A gradual conversion can be identified by consciously striving toward the goal with no decisive point where conversion is initiated or converted.  The process occurs cognitively and is much less emotional with no emotional crisis, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], or [[sin]].

== Age of conversion ==
Average age at the time of conversion has been examined by Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. E. (1959). ''Psychology of religion (rev.ed.).'' New York: Abingdon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, F. J. (1965). Some psychological factors in religious conversion. ''British Journal of Social and Religious Psychology, 4,'' 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gillespie &lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, V. B. (1991). ''The dynamics of religious conversion: Identity and transformation.'' Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been found to be between the ages of 15-16, a consistent finding over 40 years.  These findings are consistent with Erikson's &lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E. H. (1968). ''Identity: Youth and crisis.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; conclusion that this is the age where individuals are testing the world around them and forming an [[identity (psychology)|identity]].  However, it has been pointed out by Silverstein &lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, S. A. (1988). A study of religious conversion in North America. ''Genetic, Social, and General Psychological Monographs, 114,'' 261–305.&lt;/ref&gt; that sampling is generally biased as participant age rarely exceeds the early 20s.  Spilka and others &lt;ref name=Spilka/&gt; suggest that better sampling is needed as generally study participants are college-age students and thus are not truly representative.  Finally, in Western countries females typically convert one to two years before males.

== Deconversion ==
Research of conversion is paralleled to a lesser extent by research on deconversion.  Research on deconversion has been divided into two subgroups, new religious movements (NRM) and mainstream groups.

=== New religious movements ===
There are many reasons why people deconvert from [[new religious movement]]s.  A key factor to consider is that many times a NRM occurs in isolation from the outside world; when this isolation is broken deconversion may occur. {{fact|date=July 2013}} NRM typically regulate [[interpersonal relationship]]s, as the development of unregulated interpersonal relationships may lead to deconversion. {{fact|date=July 2013}} Followers of a NRM may become frustrated when their efforts produce no success or social change and eventually abandon the movement.  Finally, followers may become disillusioned with the movement or its leader and leave the movement. 

Deconversion may occur suddenly or be a gradual process.  Generally deconversion will be a quiet process for those who have only been a member of the NRM for one year or less.  However, for those who have been a follower for longer than a year tend to go through confrontational, emotional, and dramatic deconversion processes.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

=== Mainstream ===
A minority of mainstream religious followers truly reject their faith and deconvert.  [[Apostate]]s make up just 7% of deconversions from mainstream religion.  However, 80% will withdraw and later return.&lt;ref&gt;Roozen, D. A. (1980). Church dropouts: Changing patterns of disengagement and re-entry. ''Review of Religious Research, 21,'' 427–450.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Generally there are two disengagement measures for the mainstream religious.  In the first, behavioral, followers will go one month or longer without attending a [[Church service|religious service]].  The second type of disengagement, belief, sees followers go for a year or longer without religion being a part of their life.

== Closely related phenomena ==
=== Apostasy ===
[[Apostasy]] is an individual's abandonment of their religious commitment and acceptance of a [[nonreligious]] lifestyle or joining a different movement of belief.

=== Deconversion ===
Deconversion is the process by which converts leave their faith.

=== Intensification ===
A revitalized commitment to a religion.  This may be to a religion that one was brought up in or has only casually followed.  Also referred to as "[[born again (Christianity)|born again]]" or a "rebirth".  In some religions the faithful follow procedures designed to induce experiences of intensification.&lt;ref name=Scobie/&gt;

=== Switching ===
Changing religious identification group without radically changing as a person.  An example would be switching [[religious denomination]].

=== Cycling ===
Varying religious participation across an individual's lifetime.  Individual may drop out of religion to later return, or periodically fall out of the faith.

'''Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas''' ([[translation]]: ''Ram Birthplace Trust'') is an organisation formed as a [[trust law|trust]] to promote and oversee the construction of a temple in [[Ayodhya]], [[India]] at the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]], the reputed site of the birth of [[Rama]], the seventh and one of the most popular [[Avatar]]s of [[Hinduism|Hindu God]] [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vishva Hindu Parishad and Indian politics|author=Manjari Katju|pages=72–102|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2003|isbn=978-81-250-2476-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyas was formed by members of the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (World Hindu Council).&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

Several Hindu religious and political organisations have sought to construct a temple on the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, to commemorate Rama. However, the [[Babri Mosque]] stood on the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, was constructed by [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal emperor]] [[Babur]] after he demolished the original Rama temple on the site.&lt;ref name="Colin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Colin|title=The geography of war and peace |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-516208-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ms5N7NhGXIC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karen "&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitelli|first=Karen |title=Archaeological ethics|publisher=Rowman Altamira|year=2006|edition=2|isbn=978-0-7591-0963-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTW1Rf-NfJsC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was taken up by organisations such as the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a major [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] political party. In 1992, a procession led by the VHP near the mosque ended up demolishing the mosque, which caused major communal violence across India between Hindus and [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2528025.stm Tearing down the Babri Masjid - Eye Witness BBC's Mark Tully] [[BBC]] - Thursday, 5 December 2002, 19:05 GMT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newindpress.com"&gt;[http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEH20050130092611&amp;Page=H&amp;Title=Top+Stories&amp;Topic=0 Babri Masjid demolition was planned 10 months in advance - PTI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117234145/http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEH20050130092611&amp;Page=H&amp;Title=Top+Stories&amp;Topic=0 |date=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1843879.stm The Ayodhya dispute].

==Foundation==
The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (RJN) was founded as an independent trust by members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad on January 25, 1993 to take charge of the site of Ram Janmabhoomi and oversee the construction of the proposed Rama temple.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebration in Karsevakpuram is premature|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/360-degree/celebration-karsevakpuram-premature-312|date=2010-10-03|accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramchandra Das Paramhans (1913-2003) was head of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1437991/Ramchandra-Paramhans.html |title=Ramchandra Paramhans |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=6 August 2003 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members argued that the Nyas was created so that the [[secular]] [[Government of India]] would not control the site and end up involving itself in the construction of the temple.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; The RJN also operates workshops in ''Karsevakpuram'' (City of Volunteers), a major encampment of volunteer activists (called ''Karsevaks'') outside Ayodhya preparing to undertake the construction of the temple.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

==2010 Ayodhya verdict==
The leaders of the RJN welcomed the decision of the [[Allahabad High Court]] to distribute the disputed territory into three parts, with one-third going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and another to the [[Nirmohi Akhara]] Hindu denomination. However, the RJN claimed that it was the rightful party to take possession of the land and said it would appeal to the [[Supreme Court of India]] to seek possession of the entire site.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nyas to move SC, says ‘no question of victory or loss'|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Nyas-to-move-SC--says--no-question-of-victory-or-loss-/690819|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sv. Troica od Radoviš 49.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Holy Trinity Orthodox church]] in [[Radoviš]].]]

In the '''[[Republic of Macedonia]]''', the most common '''religion''' is [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], practiced by most of the [[ethnic Macedonians]]. The vast majority of the Orthodox Christians in the country belong to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], which declared autocephaly from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1967.

Muslims are the second-largest religious group with almost one-third of the population adhering to [[Islam in the Republic of Macedonia|Islam]], mainly from the country's [[Albanians in Macedonia|Albanian]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minorities. There are also many other religious groups in Macedonia, including the [[Catholic Church in the Republic of Macedonia|Catholic Church]], [[Protestantism in the Republic of Macedonia|Protestantism]], and [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia|Judaism]].

In 2011, through a survey carried out by [[Ipsos MORI]] in the Western Balkans, the religious composition of Macedonia was found to be 70.7% Christian, divided in 69.6% Eastern Orthodox and 0.4% Catholics and Protestants, and 28.6% Muslim, with unaffiliated Muslims making up the 25.6%.&lt;ref name=2011data&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/english/research/projects/nation-w-balkan/index.html|title=Strategies of symbolic nation-building in West Balkan states: intents and results                        (completed)        - Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages|website=www.hf.uio.no|language=en|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, PEW Research estimates that Christians will fall to 55.1% of Macedonia's population (53.7% Eastern Orthodox, 0.4% Catholic, 0.6% Protestant and other Christian denominations), while 43.6% will be Muslim, 1.3% Atheist, 0.2% Jewish, and 0.2% Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/republic-of-macedonia#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2020&amp;restrictions_year=2013|title=Religions in Republic Of Macedonia {{!}} PEW-GRF|website=www.globalreligiousfutures.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sv. Sofija Ohridska.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Church of St. Sophia, Ohrid|Church of St.Sophia]] in [[Ohrid]].]]
[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] has had a long history in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and remains the majority religion.  In 1019 the [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]] was established. In 1767 on order of the Sultan, the Archbishopric was abolished by the Turkish authorities and annexed to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries there was an effort to reinstate the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The Macedonian Orthodox Church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. On July 19, 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared autocephaly from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Most [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonians]] belong to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith. In 2001 the Church had about 1,350,000 adherents in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html CIA - The World Factbook - Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, canonical [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric]] was restored, with autonomous status within the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].

===Other Christianity===
{{See also|Catholic Church in Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Catolic church bitola.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The [[Macedonian Greek Catholic Church]] in [[Bitola]], Macedonia.]]
The Macedonian Catholic Church was established in 1918. It is a [[Byzantine Rite]] ''[[sui juris]]'' particular church in [[full communion]] with [[Pope]] and the rest of the [[Catholic Church]], alongside the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and uses [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in the liturgy. The exarchate was dissolved in 1924. In 2001 the [[Holy See]] re-established the [[Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia]]. Currently, members of the Macedonian Catholic Church number about 11,266.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2012'', p. 1031&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of Protestants in Macedonia. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[United States|American]] missionaries converted villages in the [[Strumica]]-[[Petrich]] region to [[Methodism]], a faith still practiced. There is also a small community of Macedonian Baptists which has existed since 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Историја на македонската нација. Блаже Ристовски, 1999, Скопје&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian Orthodox Church operates among the [[Serbs of the Republic of Macedonia|Serbians in Macedonia]]'s North. The number of adherents corresponds with the number of [[Serbs]] at 36,000.

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam in the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:View of Mustafa Pasha`s Mosque - North-Western side.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Mosque|Mustafa Pasha Mosque]] in [[Skopje]].]]
Islam has had a significant influence in Macedonia since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasions in the 14th and 15th centuries. Many [[Turkish People|Turks]] settled in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and introduced aspects of [[Islamic culture]]. Most [[Albanians]] and some ethnic Macedonians converted to Islam, these [[Macedonian Muslims|Macedonian Muslims or Torbeši]] generally retained their [[Ethnic Macedonian|Macedonian culture]] and customs while many were assimilated as Turks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Niel Simpson, Macedonia; Its Disputed History, Aristoc Press.1994&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th Century most of the cities were primarily populated by [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[Šarena Džamija]] in Tetovo is a legacy of the country's Ottoman past. In 2002, Muslims form approximately 33.33% of the nation's total population.There was no census since 2002 which means that it's all estimates and non-credible sources for the period between then and now.

==Judaism==
{{Main|History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia}}

[[File:SynagogueBitola.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Sephardic Jewish Synangogue in Bitola prior to [[World War II]]]]
Jews had been present when the region now called the Republic of Macedonia was under Roman rule in the second century AD. The population was decimated by the [[Crusades]], but rose again following the immigration of [[Sephardic Jews]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the [[Second World War]], Macedonia was occupied by [[Bulgaria]], an [[Axis power]], and the Jews were sent to [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005355 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926081523/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005355 |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the rest of the Balkans, the [[Holocaust]] and immigration to [[Israel]] means that Macedonia now has a much smaller Jewish community, numbering roughly 200. It is mainly based in the capital, [[Skopje]], and has no functioning [[synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Macedonia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|history}}
The '''Sadducees''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|dʒ|ə|ˌ|s|iː|z|,_|ˈ|s|æ|d|j|ə|-}}; [[Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|צְדוּקִים}} ''Ṣĕdûqîm'') were a sect or group of [[Jews]] that was active in [[Judea]] during the [[Second Temple period]], starting from the second century BCE through the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. The sect was identified by [[Josephus]] with the upper social and economic echelon of Judean society.&lt;ref&gt;"...while the Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich, and have not the populace obsequious to them, but the Pharisees have the multitude on their side." {{Cite Josephus|text=anti|bookno=13|chap=10|sec=6|PACEJ=1|show-translator=yes |abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, the sect fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]. The Sadducees are often compared to other contemporaneous sects, including the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Essenes]]. Their sect is believed to have become extinct some time after the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem in 70 CE, but it has been speculated that the later [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] may have had some roots in—or connections with—Sadducaic views.

== Etymology ==
According to [[Abraham Geiger]], the Sadducaic sect of Judaism drew their name from [[Zadok]], the first [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest of ancient Israel]] to serve in the [[First Temple]], with the leaders of the sect proposed as the [[Kohanim]] (priests, the "sons of Zadok", descendants of [[Eleazar]], son of [[Aaron]]).&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Geiger, ''Urschrift'', pp. 20 &amp;c&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, the name Zadok, being related to the root {{Hebrew|צָדַק}} ''ṣāḏaq'' (to be right, just),&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongHebrew|6659}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be indicative of their aristocratic status in society in the initial period of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[Flavius Josephus]] mentions in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' that in the time of Boethus: "...one Judas, a Gaulonite, of a city whose name was Gamala, who taking with him Sadduc, a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt,...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Josephus|text=anti|bookno=18|chap=1|sec=1|pace=1|show-translator=yes|abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul L. Maier]] notes, "It seems not improbable to me that this Sadduc, the Pharisee, was the very same man of whom the rabbis speak, as the unhappy but undesigning occasion of the impiety or infidelity of the Sadduccees{{what|date=October 2018}}; nor perhaps had the men this name of the Sadduccees till this very time, though they were a distinct sect long before."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Kregel Academic| isbn = 9780825429248| last1 = Josephus| first1 = Flavius| title = The New Complete Works of Josephus| date = 1999| page= 587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of Sadduc to the Zadok above, varying largely in [[transliteration]], lends credence to that account. The contextual inclusion of Boethus and Sadduc implies they were most likely contemporaries.

== History ==

=== The Second Temple Period ===
{{See also|Second Temple Judaism}}
The Second Temple Period is the period in ancient Israel between the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 516 BCE and its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction]] by the Romans in 70 CE.
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 096v 3.png|thumb|A Sadducee, illustrated in the 15th-century ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
Throughout the Second Temple Period, Jerusalem saw several shifts in rule. [[Alexander the Great#Conquest of the Persian Empire|Alexander's conquest]] of the Mediterranean world brought an end to Persian control of Jerusalem (539 BCE–334/333 BCE) and ushered in the [[Hellenistic period]]. The Hellenistic period, which extended from 334/333 BCE to 63 BCE, is known today for the spread of Hellenistic influence. This included an expansion of culture, including an appreciation of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theater]], and [[History of nudity#Ancient Greece|admiration of the human body]]. After the death of Alexander in 323 BCE, his generals divided the empire among themselves and for the next 30 years, they fought for control of the empire. Judea was first controlled by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] of Egypt (r. 301–200 BCE) and later by the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] of Syria (r. 200–167). [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|King Antiochus Epiphanes]] of Syria, a Seleucid, disrupted whatever peace there had been in Judea when he desecrated the temple in Jerusalem and forced Jews to violate the [[Torah]]. Most prominent of the rebel groups were the [[Maccabees]], led by Mattathias the Hasmonean and his son [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah the Maccabee]]. Though the Maccabees rebelled against the Seleucids in 164 BCE, Seleucid rule did not end for another 20 years. The Maccabean (a.k.a. Hasmonean) rule lasted until 63 BCE, when the Roman general [[Pompey]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|conquered Jerusalem]].

Thus began the Roman period of Judea, leading to the creation of the province of [[Roman Judea]] in 6 CE and [[Syria Palaestina|extending]] into the 7th century CE, well beyond the end of the Second Temple Period. [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Cooperation between the Romans and the Jews]] was strongest during the reigns of [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and his grandson, [[Agrippa I|Herod Agrippa I]]. However, the Romans moved power out of the hands of vassal kings and into the hands of [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Roman Prefects.2C Procurators.2C and the Destruction of the Temple|Roman administrators]], beginning with the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 CE. The [[First Jewish–Roman War]] broke out in 66 CE. After a few years of conflict, the Romans retook Jerusalem and destroyed the temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple Period in 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 1–5, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of the Temple ===
During the Persian period, the Temple became more than the center of worship in Judea after its reconstruction in 516 BCE; it served as the center of society. It makes sense, then, that priests held important positions as official leaders outside of the Temple. The democratizing forces of the Hellenistic period lessened and shifted the focus of Judaism away from the Temple and in the 3rd century BCE, a scribal class began to emerge. New organizations and "social elites," according to Shaye Cohen, appeared.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It was also during this time that the high priesthood—the members of which often identified as Sadducees—was developing a reputation for corruption. Questions about the legitimacy of the Second Temple and its Sadducaic leadership freely circulated within Judean society. Sects began to form during the Maccabean reign (see [[#Jewish sectarianism|Jewish Sectarianism]] below).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple in Jerusalem was the formal center of political and governmental leadership in ancient Israel, although its power was often contested and disputed by fringe groups.

===After the Temple destruction===
After the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70&amp;nbsp;CE, the Sadducees appear only in a few references in the Talmud. In the beginnings of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaism]], the followers of Anan ben David were called "Sadducees" and set a claim of the former being a historical continuity from the latter.

The Sadducee concept of the mortality of the soul is reflected on by [[Uriel Acosta]], who mentions them in his writings. Acosta was referred to as a Sadducee in [[Karl Gutzkow]]'s play ''The Sadducees in Amsterdam'' (1834).

== Role of the Sadducees ==

===Religious===
The religious responsibilities of the Sadducees included the maintenance of the Temple in Jerusalem. Their high social status was reinforced by their priestly responsibilities, as mandated in the [[Torah]]. The priests were responsible for performing sacrifices at the Temple, the primary method of worship in ancient Israel. This included presiding over sacrifices during the three festivals of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Their religious beliefs and social status were mutually reinforcing, as the priesthood often represented the highest class in Judean society.
However, Sadducees and the priests were not completely synonymous. Cohen points out that "not all priests, high priests, and aristocrats were Sadducees; many were Pharisees, and many were not members of any group at all."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The Sadducees oversaw many formal affairs of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wellhausen, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Sadducees:
*Administered the state domestically
*Represented the state internationally
*Participated in the [[Sanhedrin]], and often encountered the Pharisees there.
*Collected taxes. These also came in the form of international tribute from Jews in the Diaspora.
*Equipped and led the army
*Regulated relations with the Romans
*Mediated domestic grievances.

==Beliefs==

=== General ===
The Sadducees rejected the [[Oral Torah]] as proposed by the Pharisees. Rather, they saw the [[written Torah]] as the sole source of divine authority.&lt;ref name="aj13.10.6"&gt;{{Cite Josephus|text=anti|bookno=13|chap=10|sec=6|pace=1|abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written law, in its depiction of the priesthood, corroborated the power and enforced the hegemony of the Sadducees in Judean society.

According to Josephus, the Sadducees believed that:
* There is no fate.
* God does not commit evil.
* Man has free will; "man has the free choice of good or evil".
* The soul is not immortal; there is no afterlife.
* There are no rewards or penalties after death.

The Sadducees did not believe in [[resurrection of the dead]], but believed in the traditional Jewish concept of [[Sheol]] for those who had died.

According to the Christian [[Acts of the Apostles]]:
*The Sadducees did not believe in resurrection, whereas the Pharisees did. In Acts, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] chose this point of division to gain the protection of the Pharisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|23:6-9|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Sadducees also rejected the notion of spirits or [[angel]]s, whereas the Pharisees acknowledged them.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|23:8|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sadducees are said to have favored ''[[Sirach]]'', the only book in the Bible that recommends the use of a physician. ''Sirach'' is a product of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman|Jewish community in Alexandria]] dated to the first third of second century BCE &lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiasticus:The Cambridge Bible Commentary on the New English Bible by John G. Snaith, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; There are no extant ancient texts of Hebrew origin with medicine as the primary subject.&lt;ref&gt;H Friedenwald - The Bibliography of Ancient Hebrew Medicine - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC234187/?page=1 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov], ''Bull Med Libr Assoc'', v. 23(3); Jan 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no medicine that was distinctly Jewish; instead, Jewish practitioners had adopted Greek and later Graeco-Roman knowledge as practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferngren|first=Gary B.|authorlink=Gary B. Ferngren|title=Medicine and Health Care in Early Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_j8GNj8VssC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9522-7|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of Remedies'', the earliest medical text written in Hebrew, to [[Asaph the Jew]], dates to the seventh or eighth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Jewish Gynaecological Texts in the Middle Ages|last = Barkai|first = Ron|publisher = Brill|year = 1998|isbn = 9004109951|location = Leiden|pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disputes with the Pharisees ===
*According to the Pharisees, spilt water became impure through its pouring. Sadducees denied that this is sufficient grounds for ''ṭumah'' "impurity" ({{lang-he|טומאה‬}}).&lt;ref name="Mishnah Yadaim 4:7"&gt;Mishnah Yadaim 4:7&lt;/ref&gt; Many Sadducee-Pharisee disputes revolved around issues of [[tumah and taharah|''ṭumah'' and ''ṭaharah'']] ({{lang-he|טָהֳרָה}}, [[ritual purity]]). Some scholars{{Who|date=March 2011}} suggest that the emphasis on purity is characteristic of priestly groups, who often utilized their perceptions of "holiness" and "unholiness" to enforce their power.
*According to Jewish law, daughters inherit when there are no sons; otherwise, the sons inherit. The Pharisees posited that if a deceased son left only one daughter, then she shares the inheritance with the sons of her grandfather. The Sadducees suggested that it is impossible for the granddaughter to have a more favorable relationship to her grandfather than his own daughter does, and thus rejected this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Yadaim 4:6&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was a testament to the Sadducaic emphasis on patriarchal descent.
*The Sadducees demanded that the master pay for damages caused by his slave. The Pharisees imposed no such obligation, as the slave may intentionally cause damage in order to see the liability for it brought on his master.&lt;ref name="Mishnah Yadaim 4:7"/&gt;
*The Pharisees posited that false witnesses should be executed if the verdict is pronounced on the basis of their testimony—even if not yet actually carried out. The Sadducees argued that false witnesses should be executed only if the death penalty has already been carried out on the falsely accused.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Makot 1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish sectarianism==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees and the Saduccees Come to Tempt Jesus (Les pharisiens et les saducéens viennent pour tenter Jésus) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''The Pharisees and the Sadducees Come to Tempt Jesus'' by [[James Tissot]] ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]

The Jewish community of the Second Temple period is often defined by its sectarian and fragmented attributes. [[Josephus]], in ''Antiquities'', contextualizes the Sadducees as opposed to the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Essenes]]. The Sadducees are also notably distinguishable from the growing Jesus movement, which later evolved into [[Christianity]]. These groups differed in their beliefs, social statuses, and sacred texts. Though the Sadducees produced no primary works themselves, their attributes can be derived from other contemporaneous texts, namely, the [[New Testament]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and later, the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. Overall, the Sadducees represented an aristocratic, wealthy, and traditional elite within the hierarchy.

===As opposed to the Essenes===
The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which are often attributed to the [[Essenes]], suggest clashing ideologies and social positions between the Essenes and the Sadducees. In fact, some scholars suggest that the Essenes began as a group of renegade Zadokites, which would indicate that the group itself had priestly, and thus Sadducaic origins. Within the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Sadducees are often referred to as Manasseh. The scrolls suggest that the Sadducees (Manasseh) and the Pharisees (Ephraim) became religious communities that were distinct from the Essenes, the true Judah. Clashes between the Essenes and the Sadducees are depicted in the Pesher on Nahum, which states "They [Manasseh] are the wicked ones...whose reign over Israel will be brought down...his wives, his children, and his infant will go into captivity. His warriors and his honored ones [will perish] by the sword."&lt;ref&gt;''Pesher on Nahum''in Eshol, 40''''&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to the Sadducees as those who reign over Israel corroborates their aristocratic status as opposed to the more fringe group of Essenes. Furthermore, it suggests that the Essenes challenged the authenticity of the rule of the Sadducees, blaming the downfall of ancient Israel and the siege of Jerusalem on their impiety. The Dead Sea Scrolls brand the Sadducaic elite as those who broke the covenant with God in their rule of the Judean state, and thus became targets of divine revenge.

===As opposed to the Early Christian Church===
{{see also|Early Christianity}}
The [[New Testament]], specifically the books of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], describe anecdotes which hint at hostility between the [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and the Sadducaic establishment. These disputes manifest themselves on both theological and social levels. Mark describes how the Sadducees challenged Jesus' belief in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. Jesus subsequently defends his belief in resurrection against Sadducaic resistance, stating, "and as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said to him "I ''am'' the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" He is God not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|12:27|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matthew's Gospel, Jesus asserts that the Sadducees were wrong because they knew "neither the scriptures nor the power of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|22:29|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm Pulpit Commentary on Matthew 22], accessed 14 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus challenges the reliability of Sadducaic interpretation of Biblical doctrine, the authority of which enforces the power of the Sadducaic priesthood. The Sadducees address the issue of resurrection through the lens of marriage, which "hinted at their real agenda: the protection of property rights through patriarchal marriage that perpetuated the male lineage."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary, New Oxford Annotated Bible&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Matthew records [[John the Baptist]] calling the Sadducees a "brood of vipers".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|3:7|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament thus constructs the identity of Christianity in opposition to the Sadducees.

===As opposed to the Pharisees===
The [[Pharisees]] and the Sadducees are historically seen as antitheses of one another. Josephus, the author of the most extensive historical account of the Second Temple Period, gives a lengthy account of Jewish sectarianism in both Jewish War and Antiquities. In Antiquities, he describes "the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which are not written in the law of Moses, and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observance to be obligatory which are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers."&lt;ref name="aj13.10.6"/&gt; The Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic use of the Oral Law to enforce their claims to power, citing the Written Torah as the sole manifestation of divinity.

The Rabbis, who are traditionally seen as the descendants of the Pharisees, describe the similarities and differences between the two sects in [[Yadaim|Mishnah Yadaim]]. The Mishnah explains that the Sadducees state, "So too, regarding the Holy Scriptures, their impurity is according to (our) love for them. But the books of Homer, which are not beloved, do not defile the hands."&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Yadaim 4:6–8&lt;/ref&gt; 
A passage from the book of Acts suggests that both Pharisees and Sadducees collaborated in the Sanhedrin, the high Jewish court.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|23:6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9598">[[File:Prambanan_at_night.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The [[Prambanan]] temple complex, one of the legacies of the Sañjaya dynasty]]

'''Sañjaya''' was an ancient [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[dynasty]] that ruled the [[Kingdom of Mataram|Mataram kingdom]] in Java during first millennium [[Common Era|CE]]. The dynasty was an active promoter of [[Hinduism]] in ancient Java.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

==Origin and formation==
According to [[Canggal inscription]], this dynasty appears to have been founded in 732 by Sañjaya. The Canggal inscription was discovered in Canggal village, Southwest from the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription was written in south Indian [[Pallava]] letters and in [[Sanskrit]], and tells about the erection of a [[linga]] (symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in Kunjarakunja area. This area is located at a noble island called Yawadwipa ([[Java]]) which is blessed with abundance of rice and gold. This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was reigned by [[King Sanna]], whose long period of reign was marked with wisdom and virtue. After king Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. Confusion was widespread due to a lost of ruler and patron. Amidst this, [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] ascended to the throne. He was the son of [[Sannaha]] (sister of Sanna). [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] was a king who mastered holy scriptures, [[martial arts]], and also military prowess. He conquered neighboring areas around his kingdom and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono,| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973, 5th reprint edition in 1988 | location =Yogyakarta| page =40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Sanna]] and [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] was also known in [[Carita Parahyangan]], a book from later period which mainly tells the history of Pasundan ([[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentioned that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], king of [[Galuh]], then he retreated to [[mount Merapi]]. Later Sanna's successor, [[Sanjaya]], reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], [[East Java]], and [[Bali]]. He was also involved in battle with [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king Sang Srivijaya). The main theme of [[Carita Parahyangan]] corresponds to Canggal inscription. This story suggested [[West Java]]'s  origin and links of the dynasty.

==Relations with Sailendra==
There are some theories regarding the Sañjaya-Sailendra relationship. Some scholars suggested that there is no such things as Sanjaya dynasty, since there was only one dynasty called Sailendra that ruled central Java. This theory was proposed by Poerbatjaraka and suggested that there was only one kingdom and one dynasty; the kingdom is called Medang with the capital in Mataram area, and the ruling dynasty is Sailendra. He holds that Sanjaya and all of his offsprings were belongs to Sailendra family that initially were [[Shivaist]].

Another suggests that the Sañjaya dynasty then was forced to the north of Java by the [[Sailendra|Sailendra dynasty]], which emerged around 778. The evidence for this event is based on the [[Kalasan inscription]]. During this period, the Sañjaya dynasty existed next to Sailendra dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterized by peaceful co-existence and cooperation.

The association of Sailendra with [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began after the conversion of Raja Sankhara (Rakai Panaraban or Panangkaran) to buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254–264&lt;/ref&gt; The later Sailendran kings, successors of Panangkaran become Mahayana Buddhist too and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga reign. This theory was based on [[Raja Sankhara Inscription]] (now missing), [[Sojomerto inscription]] and [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript. Shivaist Hindu gain royal patronage again since the reign of Pikatan, well until the end of the Medang kingdom.

Another evidence pointed that Sailendra family was using [[old Malay]] language in some of their inscriptions, which suggested [[Sailendra|Sailendra dynasty]]'s foreign origin in [[Sumatra]] and their connections with [[Srivijaya]]. This theory holds that the Sailendras, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and imposing overlordship on the Rakais (local Javanese lords) including the Sañjaya, thus incorporated the kings of Mataram Sañjaya dynasty in their bureaucracy. The center of the dynasty court seems to be located in [[Kedu Plain|South Kedu]] (around [[Magelang]], North of [[Yogyakarta]]).

==Relations with Champa==

Kingdoms of Java maintain a close relationship with [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] in [[mainland Southeast Asia]] since at least the reign of Sañjaya dynasty . Like the Javanese, the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] are indianized [[Austronesian people]]. An example of relationship can be seen in architectural features in Cham temples, that have many similarities with architectural styles of temples in central Java that was built during the reign of Sañjaya dynasty.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

==The Ruler of Central Java==
[[Rakai Pikatan]], who was the crown prince of the Sañjaya Dynasty, wedded [[Pramodhawardhani]] (833–856), a daughter of [[Samaratungga]], king of Sailendra. From that time onwards, the influence of Sañjaya, who was a Hindu adherer, began to emerge in Mataram, replacing the Buddhist Sailendra. Rakai Pikatan toppled king [[Balaputra]], son of Samaratungga, also the brother of Pramodhawardhani. As a result, in 850, the Sañjaya Dynasty was the sole ruler in Mataram. This ended the Sailendra presence in Central Java and Balaputra retreated to [[Srivijaya]] in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.&lt;ref&gt;" De Casparis proposed that in 856 Balaputra was defeated by Pikatan, whereupon Balaputra retreated to Srivijaya, the country of his mother, to become the first Sailendra ruler of [[Srivijaya]].
Thus in the late 9th century Srivijaya was ruled by a Buddhist Sailendra ruler, while Java was ruled by Pikatan and his successors who become the patron of [[Shivaist]]" (cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111).&lt;/ref&gt;

The information about Sañjaya Dynasty is also found  in the [[Balitung inscription]] dated 907. According to the Balitung inscription&amp;nbsp;– when a ruler died, they transformed into a divine form. From this inscriptions, the scholars estimated the possible sequence of the ruling kings of Sañjaya dynasty:&lt;ref name=indianized&gt;{{Cite book

It was also during the reign of the Sañjaya dynasty, the classic Javanese literature blossomed. The translations and adaptation of classic Hindu literatures into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] was conducted, such as the [[Kakawin Ramayana]]. Around 850s, Pikatan initiated the construction of the [[Prambanan|Prambanan temple]] in [[Central Java]], later completed and expanded extensively by king Balitung. Prambanan temple complex is one of the largest Hindu temple in [[Southeast-Asia]] and its greatness rivalled [[Borobudur]], which happened to be the biggest [[Buddhist temple]] in the world.

In 929, [[Mpu Sindok]] moved the court of Mataram from Central Java to East Java. It is not entirely clear the actual reasons of the movement. There are some possible reasons; an eruption of [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]] volcano, the power struggle, or political pressure from [[Shailendra dynasty|Sailendran]] based in [[Srivijaya Empire]] may have caused the move.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{Cite book

The shift to East Java marked the end for the Central [[Javanese people|Javanese]] Sañjaya dynasty, and from then on a new dynasty named the [[Isyana Dynasty]] emerged in [[East Java]].

'''Satya Mahima Dharma''' (the "dharma of the divine glory") is a religious tradition in [[Hinduism]], from [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. It goes back to a historic person called Mahima Svami (or Mahima Gosain).

He is said to have appeared in [[Puri]] in 1826. Dissatisfied with the ritualised idol worship of Lord [[Jagannath]], he left Puri and travelled to the Kapilas hills near [[Dhenkanal, India|Dhenkanal]], where he engaged himself in severe Yogic practices. In 1862, he became a ''[[siddha]]'' and started preaching a new ''[[dharma]]''. He is said to have attained ''[[samadhi]]'' in 1876. Under his first disciple, Govinda Baba, and the dissident saint poet [[Bhima Bhoi]], the movement shifted away from the coastal region towards the central and western parts of Odisha. Spreading also to other states ([[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]]), people from different regions and sociocultural backgrounds joined as followers. Since then, several monastic as well as lay currents and competing associations emerged and various regional centres (Joranda, Khaliapali) have been established. Mahima Dharma is a popular ascetic movement which considers the void, ''[[shunya]]'', as the divine principle, opposing as such any idol worship. The void can only be venerated through fire, or its manifestation in the Sun, traits which link Mahima Dharma to the ''[[nirguna]] [[bhakti]]'' tradition.

==Life and authorship==
Archimandrite Seraphim (Papakostas) was born in a mountain village of central Greece in 1892, and died in Athens in 1954. He studied theology at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], thereafter serving as a high school teacher for two years, and later as a preacher at the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens|Cathedral of Athens]].

Father Seraphim passed the last twenty-five years of his life in the capacity of Superior of the "[[orthodoxwiki:Brotherhood of Theologians Zoe|ZOE]]" Brotherhood of Theologians,{{#tag:ref|"The aim of this Brotherhood has been to develop an intense spiritual life among the Greek people. To this end, the Brotherhood trains preachers, confessors, and Sunday School teachers and publishes the weekly journal ''"ZOE"'', as well as numerous instructive books of spiritual content."&lt;ref&gt;Archimandrite Seraphim Papacostas. ''Repentance.'' 3rd Edition; Transl. from the 12th Greek edition. Athens: "ZOE" Brotherhood of Theologians, 1987. p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} which was established by his predecessor, Archimandrite Eusebius Matthopoulos.{{#tag:ref|A biography of Archimandrite Matthopoulos was published in English by the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|S.P.C.K.]], London.|group=note}}

As Superior of "ZOE", Father Seraphim Papacostas developed all of the groups under the Brotherhood, contributing to the establishment of associations for parents, the educated, the young working class, students and educators.

Father Seraphim was distinguished as an author. Three of his books, ''The Parables of Christ'', ''The Miracles of Christ'' and ''The Sermon on the Mount'', became classics for the Orthodox in Greece. His liturgical works, ''Baptism'', and ''A Handbook of the Divine Liturgy'', were also of great significance.

In his writings he also dealt with modern social problems. In ''The Problem of Parenthood and Birth Control'', ''Morality and Health'', ''Between the Two Wars'', ''Postwar Problems'' and ''For the Hours of Pain'', he attempted to provide counsels for the difficulties of our times. All of these books had a widespread circulation in Greece, with successive editions being published and warmly received.

However, of all of his books, ''[http://www.notofthisworldicons.com/ProductDetail.jsp?LISTID=8000107C-1272665146 Repentance]'' had the most extensive circulation, having been published repeatedly.

==Criticism==
Professor [[Christos Yannaras]] has remarked that: "like Matthopoulos he wrote like a Protestant [[w:Radical Pietism|pietist]]. In his book ''The Question of Conception'', Papakostas faithfully follows Anglican and Roman Catholic opinion about contraception, presented as a quintessentially Orthodox view."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christos Yannaras]].

{{Ethnic Shanghai sidebar}}
The '''Shanghai Russians''' were a sizable [[Russian diaspora]] that flourished in [[Shanghai]], [[China]] between the [[World Wars]]. By 1937 it is estimated that there were as many as 25,000 Russians living in the city, the largest European group by far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newham |first1=Fraser |title=The White Russians of Shanghai |journal=History Today |date=Dec 2005 |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=20-27 |accessdate=3 October 2018 |publisher=History Today Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of them had come from the [[Russian Far East]], where, with [[Siberian Intervention|the support of the Japanese]], the [[White movement|Whites]] had maintained a presence as late as the autumn of 1922.

== Background ==

In the late 19th century, the Russian imperial government was shifting the focus of its investment to [[Manchuria]]. As a consequence, China's trade with its northern neighbour soared. As soon as there was a regular ferry service between [[Vladivostok]] and Shanghai, the Russian tea merchants started to settle in the commercial capital of China. About 350 Russian citizens resided within the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1905. In order to protect their interests, the [[Consulate-General of Russia in Shanghai|Russian consulate]] was opened in 1896. The old building of the consulate, still occupied by the Russian diplomats, ranks among [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]]'s minor landmarks. 

The bulk of the Russian exile community relocated to Shanghai from Vladivostok following the fall of the [[Provisional Priamurye Government]] at the close of the [[Russian Civil War]]. Admiral [[Oskar Victorovich Stark]]'s squadron alone brought several thousand [[White Emigre|White Russians]] from Vladivostok in 1922. Many [[Harbin Russians]], attracted by the booming economy of Shanghai, moved from Manchuria to the coast over the following years. Barred by both distance and money from joining established communities in [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]], a large number gravitated towards Shanghai, a freeport at the time, requiring no visa or work-permit for entry. For this same reason it was later to become a refuge for Jews fleeing the Nazis. [[File:Russians coming to Shanghai.jpg|250px|thumb|A group of Russian émigrés arriving in Shanghai. A photograph from the newspaper ''Shankhaiskaya zarya'', 23 February 1930.]]

== Living conditions ==

Although free, and relatively secure, conditions for the émigrés were far from ideal. For one thing they were all stateless, as the Soviet government had revoked the citizenship of all political exiles in 1921. The only travel document most of them had was the [[Nansen passport]], issued by the [[League of Nations]]. Unlike other foreigners in [[China]] they did not have the benefits conferred by [[extraterritoriality]], which granted immunity from local laws. 

This was made worse by the barriers to employment opportunities, which in this international city required a good command of English or French as a minimum requirement. There were whole families that depended on wives or daughters who made a living as [[taxi dancer]]s (hired dancing partners). A survey by the League of Nations in 1935 reportedly found that some 22% of Shanghai Russian women between 16 and 45 years of age were engaging in [[prostitution]] to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VCynKuf3JBYC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=shanghai+russians+postitution&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U26p2MLZ0OomGvmWad65f5SYRj7AA ''Port of last resort : the diaspora communities of Shanghai'', by Marcia Reynders Ristaino, Stanford University Press, 2001, page 94]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some did find professional work, teaching music or French. Other women took work as dressmakers, shop assistants and hairdressers. Many men became career soldiers of the ''Shanghai Russian Regiment'', the only professional/standing unit within the [[Shanghai Volunteer Corps]]. By slow degrees, and despite the many difficulties, the community not only retained a good deal of cohesion but did begin to flourish, both economically and culturally. By the mid-1930s there were two Russian schools, as well as a variety of cultural and sporting clubs. There were Russian-language newspapers and a radio station. An important part was also played by the local [[Russian Orthodox Church]] under the guidance of St. [[John of Shanghai and San Francisco]].

[[File:Russiansinshanghai01.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of Vladimir Zhiganov's album ''The Russians in Shanghai'' (1936)]]
Many exiles set up restaurants in the district known as ''Little Russia'' (around the Avenue Joffre, now [[Huaihai Road|Middle Huaihai Road]], in the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]]), contributing to the development of the local Western-style [[Haipai cuisine]]. Russian musicians (such as [[Oleg Lundstrem]]) achieved a dominance over the city's foreign-run orchestra. The most famous Russian singer, [[Alexander Vertinsky]], relocated from Paris to Shanghai; and [[Fyodor Chaliapin]] was seen on tour. [[Vladimir Tretchikoff]], the "King of Kitsch", spent his youth in the city. Russian teachers offered lessons in theatre and dancing. [[Margot Fonteyn]], the English ballerina, studied dance in Shanghai as a child with Russian masters, one of whom, [[Georgy Goncharov|George Gontcharov]], had formerly danced with the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]] in [[Moscow]]. 

But it was the contribution that Russian women made to the entertainment industry, dancing and otherwise, that gave the city its exotic reputation, noted in the guidebooks of the day. A fictionalized portrayal of their predicament is presented in the [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]] film ''[[The White Countess]]'' (2005). Those who were left became the focus of earnest campaigns by the League of Nations and others to end the "white slave trade." [[File:Shanghai0612 001.JPG|thumb|Pushkin monument in Shanghai]]

== During the Japanese occupation ==

The Japanese formed a bureau for the Russian emigrees; it provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel. The Shanghai Russians were left to choose between a Soviet citizenship or to remain stateless by support of the bureau. The stateless Russians were officially favoured by the regime, but in reality, they were not trusted and exposed to a great risk of being arrested as spies for the Soviet Union. They were also often enlisted in the army for work along the border with the Soviet Union. After 1941, when [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the Soviet Union parted, they were in an even more sensitive situation. To separate the anti-Soviet Russians from the Soviet Russians, the former were ordered to wear a badge with the colours of the Czar — later a white numbered disk of aluminium.

== After the Second World War ==
[[File:Russian Orthodox Church, Old Shanghai.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai around 1948]]

The Shanghai Russians survived through the difficult days of the Japanese occupation, but left in the end with the advance of the Communists. They were forced to flee, first to a [[refugee camp]] on the island of [[Tubabao]] in the [[Philippines]] and then mainly to the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]; however, many settled in [[Russians in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. The Russian monuments of Shanghai did not escape the ravages of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The [[Pushkin]] statue, funded by public subscription and unveiled on the centenary of the poet's death, was smashed by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] in 1966. It was subsequently restored in 1987. The Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nicholas, consecrated and elaborately frescoed in 1933, was converted into a [[washing machine]] factory, and subsequently a restaurant. The municipal government terminated the lease of the Cathedral to the restaurant in 2004.

In the 1967 British film ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'', written and directed by [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Sophia Loren]] plays the only child of Russian aristocrats who escaped, during the Russian Revolution, to Shanghai, where she subsequently was born.  Her parents died there when she was thirteen; she was the mistress of a gangster at fourteen.  Asked how she has come to live in Hong Kong, she replies, "Well, there was another war, another revolution — so here we are."

She is not to be confused with the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian sun god, [[Shamash]].

==Baal Myth==
{{Main|Baal cycle}}
In the [[Yam (god)#In the Epic of Ba.27al|Epic of Baal]], Shapash plays an important part in the plot, as she interacts with all of the main characters, and in the end she is favourable to Baal's position as king.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=S1tQ5Larst0C&amp;dq=Shapshu&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 ''The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and Ugaritic Texts''], [[Oxford University Press]] (2001), p. 127; {{ISBN|0-19-513480-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She announces that El supports [[Yam (god)|Yam]].&lt;ref&gt;''KTU''. 1.2.III&lt;/ref&gt; By delivering her verdict in the final struggle of [[Baal]] with Mot, she reveals her role as judge among the gods, and by her judgement against Mot, as saviour of humankind, two aspects, Brian B. Schmidt observes,&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, ''Israel's Beneficent Dead: Ancestor Cult and Necromancy in Ancient Israelite Religion and Tradition'' (Eisebrauns) 1994,
 ''pp 85f.&lt;/ref&gt; that conform with what is known of Shamash's function in Mesopotamia. After Baal is killed, she helps [[Anat]] bury and mourn him,&lt;ref&gt;''KTU''. 1.6.I&lt;/ref&gt; and then stops shining. Following El's dream about the [[Baal cycle|resurrection of Baal]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlfx4YwtaVkC&amp;dq=Shapshu&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 ''The Ugaritic Baal Cycle: Volume I.''], [[Brill Publishers]] (1994), p.257; {{ISBN|90-04-09995-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; El asks Anat to persuade Shapash to shine again, which she agrees to, but declares that she will continue to search for him.&lt;ref&gt;''KTU''. 1.6.III&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Baal cycle#Baal and Mot|battle between Baal and Mot]], she threatens [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]] that El will intervene in Baal's favour, a threat which ends the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''KTU''. 1.6.VI&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Tanakh==
In the [[Tanakh]], worshiping Shemesh is forbidden and is punishable by [[stoning]]. Worshiping Shemesh was said to include [[Bowing (social)#Bowing in religious settings|bowing to the east]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezekiel|8:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the direction of the [[sun]], as well as rituals related to [[horse]]s and [[chariot]]s, which were associated with her.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Deuteronomy]]''. 4-19 and 17-3&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2010}} King [[Josiah]] was also said to have abolished sun worship (among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Kings|23:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2010}}

==In the Bible==
The Bible in general attempts to portray the sun non-anthropomorphically or as representing Yahweh's power. Shapash/Shemesh is usually substituted for euphemisms like "or" (light), and it appears that sun worship, even in an Yahwist way, was avoided at all costs. However, the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], may directly allude to ancient Near Eastern sun goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friendsofsabbath.org/Further_Research/e-books/Dictionary-of-Deities-and-Demons-in-the-Bible.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3393">The [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Northern England|Northern English]]&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of Joseph Ritson, Esq
 By Joseph Ritson, Joseph Frank, Nicholas Harris Nicolas, William Pikering, London, 1833&lt;/ref&gt; [[folklore]], a '''shellycoat''' is a type of [[bogeyman]] that haunts rivers and streams.

==Name==
The name goes from the coat of [[Animal shell|shell]]s these creatures are said to wear, which rattle upon movement.

==Distribution==
Many places on the coast of Scotland have names that reference the shellycoat. Supposedly, shellycoats are particularly fond of the area around the [[River Hermitage]].

==Characteristics==
Shellycoats are considered to be relatively harmless; they may mislead wanderers, particularly those they think are trespassing upon the creature's territory, but without malice.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common tactic of a shellycoat would be to cry out as if drowning and then laugh at the distracted victim.

As described above, the shellycoat shares many of the traits of the [[Brag (folklore)|Brag]], [[Kelpie]] and [[Neck (water spirit)|Nix]].

== Schellenrock ==
[[Jacob Grimm]] stated in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 17, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that the Scottish [[goblin]] Shellycoat is one and the same as the German [[Schellenrock]],  that is bell-coat:

{{bq|text=A pück [home-sprite] served the monks of a Mecklenburg monastery for thirty years, in kitchen, stall and elsewhere; he was thoroughly good-natured, and only bargained for 'tunicam de diversis coloribus, et tintinnabulis plenam.' [a "''parti-coloured coat with tinkling bells''"]&lt;ref&gt;Latin translation following Keightly.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland there lived a goblin Shellycoat, and we saw (p. 465) that the dwarfs of the Mid. Ages also loved bells [schellen; and schellenkappe is Germ. for cap and bells]. The bells on the dress of a fool still attest his affinity to the shrewd and merry goblin (fol, follet); see Suppl.}}

[[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightly]] quotes Grimm and classifies the shellycoat as a type of [[Brownie (mythology)|brownie]].:&lt;ref&gt;Keightly, 1870, in the section "Brownie".&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bq|text=Another name by which the domestic spirit was known in some parts of Scotland was Shellycoat, of which the origin is uncertain.}}

The domestic nature of the shellycoat emphasized by Grimm and Keightly stands in contradistinction to the wild nature of the water sprites mentioned in other sources.

'''Swaminarayan''' ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Svāmīnārāyaṇa}}'', 3 April 1781&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1830), also known as '''Sahajanand Swami''', was a [[yogi]], and an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] whose life and teachings brought a revival of central Hindu practices of [[dharma]],&lt;ref name="Jones 2005 8889"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Farmington Hills|isbn=978-0-02-865984-8|page=8889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ahimsa]]&lt;ref name=rbw01&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond Brady|title=An introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65422-7|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mhe94&gt;{{cite book|last=Meller|first=Helen Elizabeth|title=Patrick Geddes: social evolutionist and city planner|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10393-0|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[brahmacharya]].&lt;ref name="Jones 2005 8889"/&gt; He is believed by followers as a manifestation of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hanna|date=2010-02-19|title=Public Engagement and Personal Desires: BAPS Swaminarayan Temples and their Contribution to the Discourses on Religion|journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=357–390|doi=10.1007/s11407-010-9081-4|issn=1022-4556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of religion|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|publisher=Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA/Thomson Gale, c2005.|year=2005|isbn=978-0028659824|location=|pages=8890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaminarayan was born '''Ghanshyam Pande''' in [[Chhapaiya]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] in 1781. In 1792, he began a seven-year pilgrimage across India at the age of 11 years, adopting the name ''Nilkanth Varni''. During this journey, he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 months of this journey, he settled in the state of [[Gujarat]] around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the Uddhav [[sampradaya]] by his guru, [[Swami Ramanand]], and was given the name ''Sahajanand Swami''. In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death. Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the [[Swaminarayan Mantra]]. From this point onwards, he was known as ''Swaminarayan''. The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]].

Swaminarayan developed a good relationship with the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="Paramtattvadas 58–93"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.001.0001/acprof-9780199463749-chapter-5|title=Swaminarayan and British Contacts in Gujarat in the 1820s|last=Paramtattvadas|first=Sadhu|last2=Williams|first2=Raymond Brady|last3=Amrutvijaydas|first3=Sadhu|pages=58–93|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.003.0005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199086573|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.001.0001/acprof-9780199463749-chapter-2|last=Hatcher|first=Brian A.|pages=6–37|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.003.0002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199086573|date=April 2016|title=Swaminarayan Hinduism|chapter=Situating the Swaminarayan Tradition in the Historiography of Modern Hindu Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from [[Islam]] and [[Zoroastrianism]].

==Childhood as Ghanshyam==
[[File:Dharmadev and Bhaktimata.jpg|thumb|150px|Dharmadev teaching Ghanshyam from the scriptures]]
Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in [[Chhapaiya]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], a village near [[Ayodhya]], in a [[Hindi]] speaking region in India.&lt;ref name="Williams13"/&gt; Born into the [[brahmin]] or [[caste system in India|priestly caste]] of Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named ''Ghanshyam Pande'' by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi).&lt;ref name = "Williams13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of [[Rama Navami]], celebrating the birth of [[Rama]]. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the [[Lunar phase|waxing moon]] in the [[Hindu calendar|month]] of [[Chaitra]] (March–April), is celebrated as both Rama Navami and [[Swaminarayan Jayanti]] by Swaminarayan followers. This celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers.&lt;ref name = "Williams141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Swaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande.&lt;ref name="isbn8190131834"&gt;{{cite book | author=Makarand R.

==Travels as Nilkanth Varni==
[[File:Nilkanth Varni.JPG|thumb|145px|left|Nilkanth Varni during his travels]]
After the death of his parents, Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 (Ashadh Sud 10, Samvat 1849) at the age of 11.&lt;ref name="NV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sksst.org/sampraday/index.asp|title=Sampradat history: Nilkanth Varni|publisher=Shree Kutch Satsang Swaminarayan Temple|location=Harrow, England|accessdate=2009-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630090513/http://www.sksst.org/sampraday/index.asp|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey.  Nilkanth Varni travelled across India and parts of [[Nepal]] in search of an [[ashram]], or hermitage, that practiced what he considered a correct understanding of [[Vedanta]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and [[Pancaratra]], the four primary schools of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name="Williams15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To find such an ashram, Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta categories:&lt;ref name="Williams 2001 36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is ''{{IAST|[[Jiva]]}}''?
* What is ''{{IAST|[[Ishvara]]}}''?
* What is ''{{IAST|[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]}}''?
* What is ''{{IAST|[[Brahman]]}}''?
* What is ''{{IAST|[[Para Brahman]]}}''?

While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered ''[[Raja Yoga|Astanga yoga]]'' (eightfold yoga) in a span of 9 months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi.&lt;ref name=isbn8176501905/&gt; In Nepal, it is said that he met King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] and cured him of his stomach illness. As a result, the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned.&lt;ref name="GujGaz"&gt;{{cite book | author=Gujarat (India) | title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Bhavnagar | publisher=Directorate of Govt.

In 1799, after a seven-year journey, Nilkanth's travels as a [[yogi]] eventually concluded in Loj, a village in the [[Junagadh district]] of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met [[Muktanand Swami]], a senior disciple of [[Ramanand Swami]]. Muktanand Swami, who was twenty-two years older than Nilkanth, answered the five questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=16, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed in the [[Vachnamrut]] that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.&lt;ref name="Williams15"/&gt;

According to the sect, Nilkanth's understanding of the [[metaphysical]] and [[epistemological]] concepts of the ''[[Mahābhūta|pancha-tattvas]]'' (five eternal elements), together with his mental and physical discipline, inspired senior ''[[sadhu]]s'' of Ramanand Swami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.vadtaldhamnj.info/My_Final_Webdesign/PDF%27s/Articles/Bhagwan%20Swaminarayan.pdf | title=

Nilkanth Varni received ''[[sannyasa]]'' initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800, and with it was granted the names ''Sahajanand Swami'' and ''Narayan Muni'' to signify his new status.&lt;ref name="Williams17"/&gt;

At the age of 21, Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the ''[[Uddhav Sampraday]]''&lt;ref name = "Williams17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ramanand Swami]], prior to his death.

Sahajanand Swami was later known as ''Swaminarayan'' after the [[mantra]] he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami.&lt;ref name="isbn8170032040"&gt;{{cite book | author= Anil Kumar Sarkar | title=Yoga, mathematics, and computer sciences: in change confronting the dawn of the twenty-first century | publisher=South Asian Publishers | location= | year=1997 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=NNXWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=&amp;dq= |isbn=978-81-7003-204-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=12 September 2009|page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the [[Swaminarayan mantra]], to repeat in their rituals: ''Swaminarayan''.&lt;ref name="Williams17"/&gt; When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into [[samadhi]] (a form of meditation)&lt;ref name = "Williams21,240"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp= 21, 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The word [[samadhi]] has different meanings in Hinduism.

Swaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and [[dharma]] to lead a pious life.

== Work and views ==

===Women===

Swaminarayan insisted that education was the inherent right of all people, including women, despite considerable criticism from those in his own contemporary society who "loathed the uplift of lower [[caste]] women".&lt;ref name="dl"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/106|title=Inherent Faith and Negotiated Power: Swaminarayan Women in the United States|last=Rudert|first=A.|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2009-05-10|chapterurl=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/106/2/thesis.pdf|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, influential and wealthy individuals educated their girls through private and personal tuition. Male followers of Swaminarayan made arrangements to educate their female family members. The literacy rate among females began to increase during Swaminarayan's time, and they were able to give discourses on spiritual subjects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.001.0001/acprof-9780199463749-chapter-4|last=Mallison|first=Françoise|pages=49–57|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463749.003.0004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199086573|date=April 2016|title=Swaminarayan Hinduism|chapter=Gujarati Socio-religious Context of Swaminarayan Devotion and Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the sect consider Swaminarayan a pioneer of education of females in India.&lt;ref name="W165" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0674024826"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLMQh4oc38gC&amp;dq=swaminarayan+malcolm+law|title=The clash within|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-674-02482-3|location=Boston|pages=322, 323|doi=|oclc=|author=Martha Craven Nussbaum|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn8126123052"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RZCv3d2XUeUC&amp;dq=|title=Encyclopaedia of Historiography|publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt.

According to the author Raymond Brady Williams, "Swaminarayan is an early representative of the practice of advocacy of women's rights without personal involvement with women".&lt;ref name="Williams01"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter the practice of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' (self-immolation by a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre), Swaminarayan argued that, as human life was given by God it could be taken only by God, and that ''sati'' had no Vedic sanction. He went to the extent to call ''sati'' nothing but suicide. Swaminarayan offered parents help with [[dowry]] expenses to discourage female infanticide, calling infanticide a sin.&lt;ref name="W165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp= 165, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0674024826" /&gt; For calling a halt to these prevailing practices, Swaminarayan's "contemporaries naturally saw in him a pioneer of a reformed and purified Hinduism, and Swaminarayan Hinduism an ‘ingrazi dharma’ or British religion."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Professor David Harman observed that Swaminarayan "criticized the popular [[Shaktism|shakta]] cults and '[[Gosains|gosai]]' and '[[nath]]' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental way in which they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardiman|first=David|date=1988-09-10|title=Class Base of Swaminarayan Sect|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=23|issue=37|pages=1907–1912|ref=harv|jstor=4379024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to prevent ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Swaminarayan "forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; This strict precept was one he likely internalized "after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [when] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= McKean, Lisa|title= Divine Enterprise: Gurus and the Hindu Nationalist Movement  |publisher= University Of Chicago Press; New edition | year=1996|page=18 |isbn= 9780226560106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams 2001 152"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the faith are defensive of the fact that some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As with practices of [[Niddah (Talmud)|niddah]] in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the [[menstrual cycle]] lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Kurien, Prema  |title=A Place at the Multicultural Table: The Development of an American Hinduism  |publisher= University Of Chicago Press; New edition | year=2007|page=102 |isbn= 9780813540566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.&lt;ref name=isbn8126123052/&gt;

In case of widows, Swaminarayan directed those who could not follow the path of chastity to remarry. For those who could, he lay down strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family. This may seem regressive, however it gave them "a respected and secure place in the social order" of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swaminarayan restricted widows "to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations."&lt;ref name=isbn8126123052/&gt;

=== Caste system and the poor ===

[[File:Swaminarayan charity.jpg|180px|thumb|Swaminarayan distributing food among the needy]]
After assuming the leadership of the Sampraday, Swaminarayan worked to assist the poor by distributing food and drinking water.&lt;ref name= "TimesCass"&gt;{{cite news|title=Times Music cassette on Swaminarayan serial launched |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1742150037.cms |publisher=[[Times of India]]|date= 2006-01-19|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook several social service projects and opened almshouses for the poor. Swaminarayan organized food and water relief to people during times of drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vadtal.com/lord-swaminarayan.html#9|title=Food and Water for the Needy|publisher=Shree Swaminarayan Temple: Sansthan Vadtal|accessdate=2009-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501010011/http://www.vadtal.com/lord-swaminarayan.html#9|archivedate=1 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faith largely
had excluded the mass of the poor, such as marginal peasants, agricultural labourers, the informal sector working class, [[adivasi]]s and [[dalits]]. Dalits were banned from Swaminarayan temples from the beginning though in one case a separate temple was created for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardiman|first=David|date=1988-09-10|title=Class Base of Swaminarayan Sect|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=23|issue=37|pages=1907–1912|ref=harv|jstor=4379024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that Swaminarayan worked towards ending the [[caste system]], allowing everyone into the Swaminarayan Sampraday. However partaking in the consumption food of lower castes and caste pollution was not supported by him.&lt;ref name = chit/&gt; A political officer in Gujarat, ''Mr. Williamson'' reported to Bishop Herber that Swaminarayan had "destroyed the yoke of caste."&lt;ref name = Williams01/&gt; He instructed his paramhansas to collect alms from all sections of society and appointed people from the lower strata of society as his personal attendants. Members of the lower castes were attracted to the movement as it improved their social status.&lt;ref name="isbn0422609102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=isbn8126123052/&gt; Swaminarayan would eat along with the lower Rajput and Khati castes but not any lower.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2001, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; He established separate places of worship for the lower caste population where they were in large numbers.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4379024|title=Class Base of Swaminarayan Sect|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=23|issue=37|pages=1907–1912|last1=Hardiman|first1=David|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Dalit]]s - those outside of the caste system - were formally excluded from Swaminarayan temples.&lt;ref&gt;The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India Christopher John Fuller P. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a lower caste are prohibited from wearing a full sect mark (tilak chandlo) on their forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now, however, for the vast majority of Gujarat's lower-caste, Untouchable and tribal population, the sect is out of bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shah, A.M. |title= The Structure of Indian Society: Then and Now  |publisher= Routledge India |location= India | year=2010 |page=103 |isbn= 9780415586221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reginald Heber]], the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, noted that disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even included Muslims. He writes "they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live as if they were brothers."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Narrative of a Journey Through the Upper Provinces of India|last=Heber|first=Reginald|publisher=Carey, Lea, and Carey|year=1828|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that "[Swaminarayan] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); that people might eat separately or together in this world, but that above "oopur" pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that [[moksha]] (salvation) was not attainable by everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.&lt;ref name="isbn0422609102" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=57, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal Sacrifices and Yagnas ===

Swaminarayan was against animal sacrifices as carried out by Brahmin priests during Vedic rituals, such as [[yajna]]s (fire sacrifices), influenced by the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and [[Vamachara|Vama Marg]] cults.&lt;ref name="isbn069112048X"&gt;{{cite book | author=Christopher John Fuller | title=The camphor flame | publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=To6XSeBUW3oC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=incarnation+of+swaminarayan | page=171 | accessdate=8 May 2009 | isbn=978-0-691-12048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests consumed "sanctified" [[prasad]] in the form of meat of these animals. To solve this problem, Swaminarayan conducted several large-scale yajnas involving priests from [[Varanasi]]. These did not have animal sacrifices and were conducted in strict accordance with Vedic scriptures. Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating [[ahimsa]] through several such large-scale yajnas. Swaminarayan stressed lacto [[vegetarian]]ism among his followers and forbade meat consumption, codifying the conduct in the [[Shikshapatri]].&lt;ref name = chit/&gt;&lt;ref name=isbn8126123052/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=24, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0813540569"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Prema A.

===Establishing Law and Order of Gujarat ===

{{Npov|date=October 2018}}
During the time when Swaminarayan came to Gujarat, the law and order situation of Gujarat was in worst ever. Neither British government nor local kings were able to control the robberies, killings, internal conflicts, rapes, and other uncultured events in Kathiyawar, Kutch and Gujarat. 
Upon reaching to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values to the extent that they would never rob, or kill any living being. Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ANU7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=swaamee&amp;f=false|title=Narrative of a Journey Through the Upper Provinces of India, from Calcutta to Bombay, Etc|first=Reginald|last=Heber|date=10 October 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Kaira and Panch Maháls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLUBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=swami#v=onepage&amp;q=vardtal&amp;f=false|year=1879|publisher=Printed at the Government Central Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.

The [[Reginald Heber|Bishop of Calcutta]] also noted that Swaminarayan "preached a great degree of purity, forbidding his disciples so much as to (not) look on any woman whom they passed. He condemned theft and bloodshed; and those villages and districts which had received him, from being among worst, were now among the best and most orderly in the provinces." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Temples and ascetics==
[[File:Shreeji Maharaj.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Swaminarayan and Paramhansas in [[Gadhada]]]]

Swaminarayan ordered the construction of several [[Hindu temple]]s and he had built six huge temples by himself and  installed the idols of various deities such as [[Nara-Narayana]] in two temples, [[Laxminarayan Dev]], [[Gopinath (god)|Gopinathji Maharaj]], [[Radha Raman Dev]] and [[Madanmohan Lalji]] . The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan provide evidence of the priority of Krishna.&lt;ref name="isbn0754638561"&gt;{{cite book | author=Raymond Brady Williams | title=Williams on South Asian religions and immigration | publisher=Ashgate | location= | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=nkVBOfE1KkAC | ol=9414082M |doi= |accessdate=7 May 2009 | isbn=978-0-7546-3856-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name = "Williams96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disciples of Swaminarayan composed devotional poems which are widely sung by the tradition during festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mohan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mohan Lal |title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |location= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C |year=1992 |page=4255 |isbn=978-81-260-1221-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaminarayan introduced fasting and devotion among followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2004|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted the festivals of [[Vasant Panchami]], [[Holi]], and [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]] with organization of the traditional folk dance [[Dandiya Raas|raas]].&lt;ref name=isbn8176501905/&gt;

The [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad|first temple]] Swaminarayan constructed was in [[Ahmedabad]] in 1822, with the land for construction given by the British Imperial Government.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shriswaminarayan.org/Temples.php|title=Swaminarayan temples|publisher=Shri Swaminarayan Temple (ISSO OF CHICAGO)|accessdate=2009-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025055/http://www.shriswaminarayan.org/Temples.php|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = FTimes/&gt; Following a request of devotees from [[Bhuj]], Swaminarayan asked his follower Vaishnavananand to build a [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Bhuj|temple]] there.

From early on, ascetics have played a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They contribute towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as ''[[paramhansas]]'' in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of ''[[sannyasi]]'' in the sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent paramhansas included [[Muktanand Swami]], [[Gopalanand Swami]], [[Brahmanand Swami]], [[Gunatitanand Swami]], [[Premanand Swami]], [[Nishkulanand Swami]], and [[Nityanand Swami (Paramhansa)|Nityanand Swami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=187, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptures==
[[File:Sahajanand Swami.jpg |150px|thumb|Swaminarayan under a [[Neem]] tree in [[Gadhada]]]]
Swaminarayan propagated general Hindu texts.&lt;ref name= isbn0028644824/&gt; He held the [[Bhagavata Purana]] in high authority.&lt;ref name="isbn0415051827"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Julius Lipner]] | title=Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices | publisher=Routledge| pages= 124| year=1998 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5iVWq7WJ5gC&amp;dq= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=12 September 2009 | isbn=978-0-415-05182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many texts that were written by Swaminarayan or his followers that are regarded as [[shastra]]s or scriptures within the Swaminarayan sect. Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the ''[[Shikshapatri]]'' and the ''[[Vachanamrut]]''. Other important works and scriptures include the ''[[Satsangi Jeevan]]'', Swaminarayan's authorized biography, the ''Muktanand Kavya'', the ''Nishkulanand Kavya'' and the ''Bhakta Chintamani''.&lt;ref name= WShastra/&gt;

===Shikshapatri===
{{Main|Shikshapatri}}
Swaminarayan wrote the ''Shikshapatri'' on 11 February 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/scriptures/shikshapatri/index.htm|title=Shikshapatri|publisher=BAPS Swamiranayan Sanstha|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the original [[Sanskrit]] manuscript is not available, it was translated into [[Gujarati (language)|Gujarati]] by [[Nityanand Swami (Paramhansa)|Nityanand Swami]] under the direction of Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect.&lt;ref name = chit&gt;{{cite book |editor=M.

Swaminarayan in various places of Shikshapatri describes Shri Krishna as the greatest entity. In Shikshapatri slok 1 and 108 are few places that mentions that Swaminarayan prayed on Shri Krishna.

===Vachanamrut===
{{Main|Vachanamrut}}
Swaminarayan's philosophical, social and practical teachings are contained in the ''Vachanamrut'', a collection of dialogues recorded by five prominent saints ([[Muktanand Swami]], [[Gopalanand Swami]], [[Nityanand Swami (Paramhansa)|Nityanand Swami]], Shukanand Muni, &amp; [[Brahmanand Swami]]) from his spoken words. The ''Vachanamrut'' is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect. It contains views on ''[[dharma]]'' (moral conduct), ''[[jnana]]'' (understanding of the nature of the self), ''[[vairagya]]'' (detachment from material pleasure), and ''[[bhakti]]'' (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a ''[[jiva]]'' (soul) to attain ''[[moksha]]'' (salvation).&lt;ref name="isbn8126003650"&gt;{{cite book |author1=K.

===Satsangi Jeevan===

Satsangi Jeevan is the authorised biography of Swaminarayan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/Scriptures/scriptures.asp|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915161142/http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/Scriptures/scriptures.asp|archivedate=15 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains information on the life and teachings of Swaminarayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindutva|last=Chitkara|first=M.

To enable Shatanand Swami to write from His childhood, Swaminarayan had blessed Shatanand Swami with Sanjay Drishti - special power to see the entire past right from His childhood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once written by Shatanand Swami, this book was verified and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mahatma Gandhi on Swaminarayan ==
In relation to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that "the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not and would never have been achieved by the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/TheFounder%E2%80%93BhagwanSwaminarayan/IntheirEyes%E2%80%A6.aspx|title=In Their Eyes...|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi "most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma." He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="isbn8171548741" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt;

==Relations with other religions and the British Government==

Swaminarayan strived to maintain good relationships with people of other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of [[Muslim]] and [[Parsi]] backgrounds.&lt;ref name=isbn8176501905/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn8183240526"&gt;{{cite book | author=J. J.

Swaminarayan enjoyed a good relationship with the [[British Raj|British Imperial Government]]. The first temple he built, in [[Ahmedabad]], was built on {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} of land given by the government. The British officers gave it a 101 gun salute when it was opened.&lt;ref name = "FTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=The foundations of devotion |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22598178_ITM|publisher=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire, [[Financial Times]]|date= 2003-03-04|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams29"/&gt; It was in an 1825 meeting with Reginald Heber that Swaminarayan is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of Krishna.&lt;ref name="isbn0754638561" /&gt;{{rp=81}} In 1830, Swaminarayan had a meeting with [[Sir John Malcolm]], [[Governor of Bombay]] (1827 to 1830).

In 1830, Swaminarayan gathered his followers and announced his departure. He later died on 1 June 1830 (Jeth sud 10, Samvat 1886),&lt;ref name="Williams29"/&gt; and it is believed by followers that, at the time of his death, Swaminarayan left Earth for [[Akshardham (philosophy)|Akshardham]], his abode.&lt;ref name="isbn8176501905"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dinkar Joshi |author2=Yogesh Patel | title=Glimpses of Indian Culture | publisher=Star Publications | location= | year=2005 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-fw-0iBvmMAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=satsangi+jivan|oclc= |doi= | pages=92–93 | accessdate=7 May 2009 | isbn=978-81-7650-190-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in [[Gadhada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his death, Swaminarayan decided to establish a line of [[acharya]]s or preceptors, as his successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established two ''gadis'' (seats of leadership). One seat was established at Ahmedabad ([[Nar Narayan Dev Gadi]]) and the other one at Vadtal ([[Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi]]) on 21 November 1825. Swaminarayan appointed an acharya to each of these ''gadis'' to pass on his message to others and to preserve his fellowship, the Swaminarayan Sampraday. These acharyas came from his immediate family after sending representatives to search them out in [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tPkexi2EhAIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=swaminarayan#v=snippet&amp;q=pradesh&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|last=Brady Williams|first=Raymond|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780521654227|location=|pages=173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed them to the office of acharya. [[Ayodhyaprasad]], the son of Swaminarayan's elder brother Rampratap and [[Raghuvira]], the son of his younger brother Ichcharam, were appointed ''acharyas'' of the [[Ahmedabad]] Gadi and the [[Vadtal]] Gadi respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaminarayan decreed that the office should be hereditary so that ''acharyas'' would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative division of his followers into two territorial dioceses is set forth in minute detail in a document written by Swaminarayan called [[Desh Vibhaag Lekh]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001 36"/&gt; Swaminarayan stated to all the devotees and saints to obey both the Acharyas and [[Gopalanand Swami]] who was considered as the main pillar and chief ascetic &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Sampraday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dave, Ramesh | title=Sahajanand charitra | publisher=BAPS | location= University of California | year=1978 | pages=199–200 | isbn=978-8175261525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current ''acharyas'' of the Swaminarayan Sampraday are [[Koshalendraprasad Pande]], of the Ahmedabad Gadi, and [[Ajendraprasadji Pande|Rakeshprasadji Pande]], of the Vadtal Gadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayan.info/AcharyaShri.aspx|title=Narnarayan Devgadi DevGadi Acharyas|year=2008|publisher=Ahmedabad Gadi Official site|accessdate=2009-09-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331115229/http://www.swaminarayan.info/AcharyaShri.aspx|archivedate=31 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayanvadtalgadi.org/acharya |title=Acharya Maharajshree Janmotsav Celebration – Junagadh|date=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades after his death, several divisions occurred with different understandings of succession. This included the establishment of [[Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha]] (BAPS), the founder of which left the Vadtal Gadi in 1905, and ''Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan'', the founder of which left the Ahmedabad Gadi in the 1940s.  The followers of BAPS hold [[Gunatitanand Swami]] as the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan, asserting that on several occasions Swaminarayan revealed to devotees that Gunatitanand Swami was [[Akshar Purushottam Upasana|Aksharbrahm]] manifest. Followers of BAPS believe that the acharyas were given administrative leadership of the sect while Gunatitanand Swami was given spiritual leadership by Swaminarayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/swamin.html|title=Swaminarayan|publisher=|accessdate=2010-02-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603195126/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/swamin.html|archivedate=3 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current spiritual and administrative leader of BAPS is [[Mahant Swami Maharaj]].

According to the biographer Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died, he had a following of 1.8 million people.

In his discourses recorded in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans would not be able to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him in the form of an [[Avatar]].&lt;ref name= isbn0813540682/&gt; While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or [[Purashottam|Purushottam]] Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars.&lt;ref name="Williams17"/&gt; A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the [[Nara Narayana]] pair, was cursed by sage [[Durvasa]] to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayan.info/Detail.aspx?ID=JgBJAEQAPQAxADUA-fvGNVxmMIs0%3d |title=Swaminarayan Introduction: Badrikashram Sabha |year=2008 |publisher=Ahmedabad Gadi Official site |accessdate=2009-09-14 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Swaminarayan's followers believe he was an incarnation of Lord [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name= isbn0813540682/&gt; The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story of the birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name = "Williams77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p =77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with [[Reginald Heber]], the Lord [[Bishop]] of [[Calcutta]], in 1825.&lt;ref name="isbn0754638561"/&gt;

The belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Schmidt, Richard M. |title= Sages, Saints, and Seers: A Breviary of Spiritual Masters  |publisher= MOREHOUSE PUBLISHING | year=2015|page=114 |isbn= 9780819229267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a [[Maharaja]] even though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas William''' "'''Tom'''" '''Harpur''' (April 24, 1929 – January 2, 2017) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] author, broadcaster, columnist and theologian. An ordained priest, he was a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]], the idea that [[Jesus]] did not exist but is a fictional or mythological figure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Casey]] ''Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?'' T&amp;T Clark 2014 TOM HARPUR p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of a number of books, including ''For Christ's Sake'' (1986), ''Life after Death'' (1996), ''[[The Pagan Christ]]'' (2004), and ''Born Again'' (2011 and 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/doczone/paganchrist.html "The Pagan Christ"], CBC, December 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Born in the east-end of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] to an [[evangelical]] family, in 1929,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/06/former-star-religion-editor-and-columnist-tom-harpur-dead-at-87.html&lt;/ref&gt; Harpur earned an Honours B.A. in 1951 at [[University College, Toronto|University College]] at the [[University of Toronto]], where he won the Jarvis Scholarship in Greek and Latin, the Maurice Hutton Scholarship in Classics, the Sir William Mulock Scholarship in Classics, and the Gold Medal in Classics. He went on to study Lit.Hum. ("Greats" or Classics) at [[Oriel College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from 1951 to 1954 where he read the ancient historians ([[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Tacitus]]) completely in their original texts. He graduated in 1954 with the B.A and was conferred the M.A. (Oxon.) two years later. Between 1954 and 1956 he studied theology at [[Wycliffe College]], University of Toronto, where he was a tutor in Greek. At Wycliffe he won prizes in [[homiletics]] and Greek and was the senior student and valedictorian in his graduating year. He returned to Oxford in 1962 and 1963 for his post-graduate studies where he read the Early Christian writers or Church Fathers ([[Patristics]]).

==Career==

===Priesthood===
Harpur was ordained a priest in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] in 1956. He served as a [[curate]] at St. John's York Mills, Toronto from 1956 to 1957. From 1957 to  1964 he served the parish of St. Margaret's-in-the-Pines in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]]. During this time he lectured on ancient philosophy part-time at Wycliffe College. From 1962 to 1963 he spent a further year at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], doing postgraduate research in [[Patristics]] and [[New Testament]] studies.

===Academia===
From 1964 to 1971, Harpur was an assistant professor and then a full professor of New Testament and New Testament Greek at Wycliffe, and from 1984 to 1987 he was part-time lecturer on the Theology and Praxis of Mass Media course at the [[Toronto School of Theology]] in the [[University of Toronto]].

===Journalism===
Harpur worked as a journalist at the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' for thirty years, twelve of which were as the newspaper's [[religion]] [[editing|editor]]. He met his wife Susan at the ''Star'', where she worked in the legal department, and married her in 1980.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; After leaving the position of religion editor in 1984 he continued to contribute a regular column on religious and ethical issues. Harpur also wrote a number of books on religion and theology, ten of which became Canadian bestsellers and two of which were made into TV series for [[VisionTV]]. For a time he had his own TV show, ''Harpur's Heaven and Hell'', and has hosted a variety of radio and television programs on the topic of religion, particularly on VisionTV. He was, over the years, a frequent commentator on religious news events for most of the Canadian networks, especially [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. In his later years, Harpur also wrote occasional opinion pieces [[Postmedia Network]] and a column for [[Sun Media]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;http://www.tomharpur.com/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, his bestseller ''Life After Death'' about [[near-death experience]]s was turned into a 10-episode TV series hosted by Harpur himself. Harpur's 2004 book ''The Pagan Christ'' was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by the ''Toronto Star'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.

===Fellowships and awards===
Harpur was a Fellow of the American Religious Public Relations Council, and in 1976 won a [[State of Israel]] Silver Medal for Outstanding Journalism. His biography is included in the American ''Who's Who in Religion'', ''Canadian Who's Who'', and ''Men of Achievement''. In 2008 the CBC documentary ''The Pagan Christ'', based upon Harpur's book, won the Platinum Remi Award at the [[Houston International Film Festival]] and the Gold Camera Award at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. He belonged to the Canadian Association of Rhodes Scholars and the Writers' Union.

=== ''The Pagan Christ'' ===
Harpur's 2004 book ''[[The Pagan Christ]]'' presents the case that the gospels re-work ancient pagan myths. Harpur builds on [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] when listing similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in the second or third centuries, the early church created the fictional impression of a literal and historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence.  Having come to see the scriptures as symbolic allegory of a cosmic truth rather than as inconsistent history, Harpur concludes he has a greater internal connection with the spirit of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Harpur, ''The Pagan Christ'' (Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received a great deal of criticism, including a response book, ''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwPvu3r6ZzUC|title=Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea|last=Porter|first=Stanley E.|last2=Bedard|first2=Stephen J.|date=2006|publisher=Clements Publishing Group|isbn=9781894667715|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Price]]'s negative review of ''The Pagan Christ'' notes, "Harpur grants that the gospel mythemes descend only indirectly from Egyptian prototypes, through the channels of Greco-Roman Mystery cults and even the Old Testament, most of the time his citation of Egyptian stories and iconography, a la Massey, et. al., implies a direct borrowing from Egypt ...I am friendly to this position up to a point. ...But he appeals to many, many more bits of Egyptian myth and liturgy, and most of these do not strike me with anywhere near the force that they did Harpur."&lt;ref name="Price.Harpur"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert M.

==Death==
Harpur died in [[Lion's Head, Ontario]], on January 2, 2017 at age 87.&lt;ref&gt;http://obittree.com/obituary/ca/ontario/richmond-hill/marshall-funeral-home/thomas-harpur/2813519/&lt;/ref&gt;

**The [[Tridentine Mass]], which supplanted the various versions of the [[Pre-Tridentine Mass]] and in turn, with the introduction of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] ceased to be the ordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]] but some versions of which continue to be used as extraordinary forms of the Roman Rite, with [[Summorum Pontificum|official approval]] in the case of the 1962 version.

'''Morris (Moishe) Abraham Cohen''' (1887–1970), better known by the nickname '''Two-Gun Cohen''' and also known by his Chinese name '''Ma Kun''' ({{zh|t=馬坤}}), was a Polish-born British and Canadian adventurer of [[Jew]]ish origin who became [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Sun Yat-sen]] and a [[major-general]] in the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]].

==Early years==
Cohen was born '''Abraham Mialczyn''' into a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Radzanów, Mława County|Radzanów]], Poland on on 3 August 1887. His father was Josef Leib Miaczyn, a wheelwright, and his mother was Sheindel Lipshitz. In 1889 the family emigrated to England and settled in [[East London]], where Josef worked in a textile factory. They changed their family name to the easier-to-pronounce Cohen, and Abraham went by Morris and Moishe.&lt;ref name="canadian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/morris-moishe-cohen |title=Morris Two-Gun Cohen |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen loved the theaters, the streets, the markets, the foods and the [[boxing]] arenas of the British capital more than he did the [[Jews' Free School]], and in April 1900 he was arrested as "a person suspected of attempting to pick pockets". A magistrate sent him to the Hayes Industrial School, an institution set up by the likes of [[Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to care for and train wayward Jewish lads. He was released in 1905 and Cohen's parents shipped the young Morris off to western [[Canada]] with the hope that the fresh air and open plains of the New World would reform his ways.

Cohen initially worked on a farm near [[Whitewood, Saskatchewan]]. He tilled the land, tended the livestock and learned to shoot a gun and play cards. He did that for a year, and then started wandering through the Western provinces, making a living as a carnival talker, gambler, [[Confidence trick|grifter]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and successful [[real estate broker]]. Some of his activities landed him in jail.

Cohen also became friendly with some of the Chinese exiles who had come to work on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]s. He loved the camaraderie and the food, and in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]]  came to the aid of a Chinese restaurant owner who was being robbed. Cohen's training in the alleyways of London came in handy, and he knocked out the thief and tossed him out into the street. Such an act was unheard of at the time, as few white men ever came to the aid of the Chinese. The Chinese welcomed Cohen into their fold and eventually invited him to join the [[Tongmenghui]], [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s anti-[[Manchu]] organization. Cohen began to advocate for the Chinese.

Morris Cohen soon moved to the city of [[Edmonton]] in the neighbouring province of Alberta. There he became manager of one of the provincial capital’s leading real estate agencies and was appointed, on the personal recommendation of the Attorney General Sir [[Charles Wilson Cross]], to serve the province as a Commissioner of Oaths, an appointment offered only to "fit and proper persons".&lt;ref&gt;1 April 1913 appointments made under the provisions of "An Act Respecting Commissioners to Administer Oaths".&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in pre-World War I Edmonton that Cohen commenced his long and varied military career by recruiting members of the Chinese community and training them in drill and [[musketry]] on behalf of Dr Sun Yat-sen’s representative organization in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Michael|title=In Chinese Company|journal=Points East|date=2006|volume=21|issue=2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Cohen fought with the [[Canadian Railway Troops]] in Europe during [[World War I]] where part of his job involved supervising Chinese labourers. He also saw some fierce fighting at the Western Front, especially during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. After the war, he resettled in Canada. But the economy had declined and the days of the real estate boom were long over. Cohen looked for something new to do, and in 1922 he headed to China to help close a railway deal for Sun Yat-sen with Northern Construction and JW Stewart Ltd. After disembarking in [[Shanghai]], Cohen went to see [[George Sokolsky]], the New-York born journalist who worked for Sun's English-language Shanghai Gazette. Sokolsky arranged an interview for him with Eugene Chen, Sun's English language secretary. Cohen was hired, and soon ensconced himself at Sun’s home at 29 Rue Molière in the city’s [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]]. He then got right to work.

In Shanghai and Canton ([[Guangzhou]]), Cohen trained Sun's small armed forces to box and shoot, and told people that he was an aide-de-camp and an acting colonel in Sun Yat-sen's army. Fortunately for Cohen, his lack of proficiency in Chinese — he spoke a pidgin form of Cantonese at best — was not a problem since Sun, his wife [[Soong Ching-ling]] and many of their associates were Western-educated and spoke English. Cohen's colleagues started calling him Ma Kun (馬坤), and he soon became one of Sun's main protectors, shadowing the Chinese leader to conferences and war zones. After one battle where he was nicked by a bullet, Cohen started carrying a second gun. The western community were intrigued by Sun's gun-toting protector and began calling him "Two-Gun Cohen." The name stuck.

Sun died of cancer in 1925, and Cohen went to work for a series of Southern Chinese [[Kuomintang]] leaders, from Sun's son, [[Sun Fo]], and Sun's brother-in-law, the banker [[T. V. Soong]], to such [[warlord]]s as [[Li Jishen]] and [[Chen Jitang]]. He was also acquainted with [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whom he knew from when Chiang was commandant of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], which was located outside of Canton. His dealings with Chiang, though, were minimal since Cohen was allied with southern leaders who were generally opposed to Chiang. Cohen ran security for his bosses and acquired weapons and [[gunboat]]s. Eventually he earned the rank of acting general, though he never led any troops.

When the [[Japan]]ese invaded China in 1937, Cohen eagerly joined the fight. He rounded up weapons for the Chinese and even did work for the British intelligence agency, [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE). Cohen was able to prove that the Japanese were using poison gas to exterminate the Chinese masses.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Cohen was in [[Hong Kong]] when the Japanese [[Battle of Hong Kong|attacked]] in December 1941. He placed Soong Ching-ling and her sister Ai-ling onto one of the last planes out of the British colony.

Cohen stayed behind to fight, and when Hong Kong fell later that month, the Japanese imprisoned him at [[Stanley Prison Camp]]. There the Japanese badly beat him and he languished in Stanley until he was part of a rare prisoner exchange in late 1943.

==Later life==
Cohen sailed back to Canada, settled in [[Montreal]] and married Judith Clark, who ran a successful women's boutique. He made regular visits back to China with the hope of establishing work or business ties. Mostly, though, Cohen saw old friends, sat in hotel lobbies and spun out tales—many of them tall—of his exploits. It was his own myth making, together with the desire of others to fabricate yarns about him, that has resulted in much of the misinformation about Cohen, from the claim that he had a hand in the making of modern China, to such outlandish ones like him having an affair with Soong Ching-ling and a wife in Canada back in the 1920s.{{Verify source|date=November 2014}} After the 1949 Communist takeover, Cohen was one of the few people who was able to move between Taiwan and mainland China. His prolonged absences took a toll on his marriage, and he and Judith divorced in 1956.

When the newly formed United Nations began the debate on the UN Resolution on the [[Partition of Palestine]], following the [[UN Special Committee on Palestine]] recommendation, Morris Cohen flew to San Francisco and convinced the head of the Chinese delegation to abstain from voting when he learned they planned to oppose partition.

Cohen then settled with his widowed sister, Leah Cooper, in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[England]]. There he was surrounded by siblings, nephews and nieces and became a beloved family patriarch. His standing as a loyal aide to Sun Yat-sen helped him maintain good relations with both Kuomintang and [[Chinese Communist]] leaders, and he soon was able to arrange consulting jobs with [[Vickers]] (planes), [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]] (engines) and Decca Radar. His last visit to China was during the start of the [[Cultural Revolution]] as an honoured guest of [[Zhou Enlai]].

Morris Cohen died in 1970 in Salford. He is buried in [[Blackley Jewish Cemetery]] in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Krasno, Rena (2001). "Two-Gun Cohen’s Tomb in Manchester". ''Points East'' '''16''' (2): 9 &amp; 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
*In Frank Capra's "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (1933), the character of a western adviser to the general resembles Cohen. The movie was based on a book of the same name by Grace Zaring Stone, who lived in Canton in the 1920s. In an interview with Stone's daughter in the early 1990s, she said that she was not sure if her mother and Cohen's paths crossed. But since the western community in that city was relatively insular, she said that it was quite likely that Stone at least knew of Cohen.
*''[[The General Died at Dawn]]'' (1936) was inspired by Cohen, with [[Gary Cooper]] playing the part of an Irish-American [''[[sic]]''] adventurer in China.
*''The Gunrunner'' (1984), a Canadian movie with [[Kevin Costner]] was inspired by Cohen

'''USS ''PC-815''''' was a {{Sclass-|PC-461|submarine chaser}} built for the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. It was commanded for about eighty days in 1943 by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], who later became the founder of [[Scientology]]. After Hubbard was removed from command for shelling Mexican territory, the ''PC-815'' served as a shore patrol vessel off [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She was lost with one of her crew in September 1945 after colliding with the destroyer [[USS Laffey (DD-724)|USS ''Laffey'']]. ''PC-815''{{'}}s short career led to the vessel being dubbed the "jinxed sub-chaser".&lt;ref name="sables"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200601/ai_n16063418/pg_1 PC-815: The JINXED SUB-CHASER!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106022926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200601/ai_n16063418/pg_1 |date=6 November 2015 }}", Sables, Robert P., in ''Sea Classics'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
''PC-815'' was laid down on 10 October 1942 at the [[Albina Engine and Machinery Works]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. She was fitted out commencing 5 December and was commissioned on 20 April 1943, with Lieutenant (j.g.) L. Ron Hubbard in command.&lt;ref name="logbook"&gt;USS ''PC-815'' logbook, National Archives &amp; Records Administration, College Park, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later she sailed down the [[Columbia River]] to [[Astoria, Oregon]], where she arrived on 17 May to take on supplies. On 18 May, the ''PC-815'' left Astoria for [[Bremerton, Washington]], where she was to have [[radar]] and [[depth charge]] launchers fitted. Her journey was interrupted by an [[air-sea rescue]] operation, then was resumed with a new destination&amp;nbsp;— [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="logbook" /&gt;

===Propulsion===
Two 1,440bhp [[Hooven-Owens-Rentschler]] R-99DA diesel engines (Serial No. 6977 and 6978), Westinghouse single reduction gear, two shafts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/010815.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "jinxed sub-chaser" ==

=== Claims of submarine contact off Cape Lookout ===
In the early hours of 19 May 1943, the crew of ''PC-815'' detected what Hubbard thought was first one then later two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines]] approximately {{convert|10|nmi|km}} off the shore of [[Cape Lookout (Oregon)|Cape Lookout, Oregon]]. Both the [[sonar]] operator and Lt. Hubbard himself thought that the echo of an [[Active sonar#Active sonar|active sonar ping]], combined with apparent engine noises heard through the ship's [[hydrophone]] indicated contact with a submarine.&lt;ref&gt;"Proceeding southward just inside the steamer track an echo ranging contact was made by soundman then on duty, &lt;NAME REDACTED&gt;, Soundman third class. The Commanding Officer had the conn and immediately slowed all engines to ahead one third to better echo ranging conditions, and placed the contact dead ahead, 500 yards away." and "Screw noises, fluttering and without pulsation, were distinct on the bearing and quite different from the pulsations of our screws." [[:Image:Batrep01.gif|Page 1 of Hubbard's report]]  Image: Page one of Lt. Hubbard's report&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 68 hours, the ship expended 37 depth charges in a "battle" that also involved the U.S. Navy [[K-class_blimp|blimp]]s ''K-39'' and ''K-33'', the [[United States Coast Guard]] patrol boats ''Bonham'' and 78302, and the subchasers USS ''SC-536'' and USS ''SC-537'', all summoned to act as reinforcements. ''PC-815'' was finally ordered back to base on 21 May.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship, Report of'', 24 May 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his eighteen-page after-action report, Hubbard claimed to have "definitely sunk, beyond doubt" one submarine and critically damaged another. However, the subsequent investigation by the Commander NW Sea Frontier, Vice Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]], cast a skeptical light on Hubbard's claims. His summary memorandum to Fleet Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], stated:

:It is noted that the report of ''PC 815'' is not in accordance with "Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship" (ASW-1) which should be submitted to Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:U-521ASW-1.gif Example of form ASW-1 filled by another subchaser of the ''PC-461'' class where a submarine was actually sunk and the report submitted properly]&lt;/ref&gt;

:An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The Commanding Officers of all ships except the ''PC-815'' state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle Report – Submission of.", A16-3(3)/PC815, Vice Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander NW Sea Frontier, 8 June 1943; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Batconcl.gif Image of document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher added that "there is a known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped", absolving the responding blimps from any fault as their method of detecting submarines relies on a [[Magnetic Anomaly Detector]]. This also implied that Lt. Hubbard and his crew were operating the ship's [[sonar]] equipment incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;"At 0906 (see radio log) two U.S.N. anti-submarine blimps appeared, K-39 and K-33. While we held contact they investigated and announced to us that they had a magnetic contact where we were holding a sound contact." [[:Image:Batrep04.gif|Page 4 of Hubbard's report]]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast.&lt;ref&gt;HM Admiralty, ''German, Italian and Japanese U-Boat Casualties during the War: Particulars of Destruction'', Cmd. 6843 (June 1946); US Department of the Navy, ''Japanese Naval and Merchant Shipping Losses during World War II by All Causes'' (February 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard, however, never accepted that he had been mistaken about the "battle." Both he and Tom Moulton, one of his officers, claimed that the official denials of any Japanese submarine presence off the Pacific coast had been motivated by a desire to avoid panic among the U.S. population.&lt;ref name=Streeter208&gt;Streeter, Michael (2008). ''Behind Closed Doors'', New Holland Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1-84537-937-7}}, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Hubbard told Scientologists:

:I dropped the [[Japanese submarine I-176|''I-76'']] or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine down into the mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I never thought about it again particularly except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see?

:But the other day I was kind of tired, and my dad suddenly sprung on me the fact that my submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn't thought about this thing for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a&amp;nbsp;— I don't know, about the size of the first [[USS Narwhal (SS-167)|''Narwhal'']] that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons&amp;nbsp;— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there&amp;nbsp;— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Auditing Techniques&amp;nbsp;— Games Conditions", lecture of 1 February 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the mouth of the Columbia River is some 75 miles north of Cape Lookout, the area in which Hubbard's naval reports claimed his anti-submarine action took place.

Moreover, the Japanese submarine [[Japanese submarine I-176|''I-76'']] (renamed ''I-176'' by that time) was based in [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and operated only in the south Pacific during the time when Hubbard was in command of ''PC-815''. The I-176 was sunk in the [[Coral Sea]] in May 1944 and removed from the Japanese Navy List on July 10, 1944 – a year after Hubbard was  relieved of command of the ''PC-815''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-176.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unauthorized shelling of Coronado Islands and failure to follow orders ===
A month later, the ''PC-815'' traveled to [[San Diego]], which was to become her home port. She arrived there on 2 June, and at the end of June was ordered to sea to join an anti-submarine training exercise.&lt;ref name="logbook" /&gt; The exercise, held on 28 June, ended early and Hubbard took the opportunity to order an impromptu gunnery exercise while anchored just off the [[Mexico|Mexican]] territory of [[South Coronado Island]] to the south-west of San Diego. The Mexican government sent an official protest to the U.S. Government, as no gunnery operations had been scheduled.

[[Image:Uss pc-815 2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Another view of {{nowrap|USS ''PC-815''}} on trials]]
On 30 June a Board of Investigation was convened concerning ''PC-815'' which concluded that Hubbard had disregarded orders, both by conducting gunnery practice and by anchoring in Mexican territorial waters without proper authority. His orders stated that the ''PC-815'' was supposed to return after completing that day's training. Hubbard argued that his crew was inexperienced, it was foggy, and he was tired so he did not return to port as ordered. A month earlier in his after action report concerning the recent fiasco off Cape Lookout, he had described the same men as "experienced" and "highly skilled". Vice Admiral Fletcher, who both chaired the board and read the prior after action report, rated Hubbard "below average" and noted: "Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised". Hubbard was relieved of command effective 7 July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collision with USS ''Laffey'' ==
After Hubbard was replaced, ''PC-815'' remained in San Diego as a shore patrol vessel, but appears to have been mostly inactive during this period. According to her Movement Card she took part in the occasional offshore patrol, training exercises and escorting submarines in and out of the harbor. She was restored to active duty on 2 September 1945, but at 6:47&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 11 September, the ship collided with the destroyer {{USS|Laffey|DD-724}} in dense fog off San Diego. The collision started a fire on board ''PC-815'', which sank within five minutes. One man from ''PC-815'' was recorded as missing, presumed drowned. The ''Laffey'' suffered significant damage, with the fire from ''PC-815'' spreading into one of the destroyer's compartments.&lt;ref name="sables" /&gt;

Navy divers demolished the wreck in early November 1945 due to the navigation hazard that it posed to a busy shipping channel. It is reported to be lying at {{Coord|32|37|54|N|117|14|12|W|}} in {{convert|90|ft|m}} of water and is said to be diveable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.divebums.com/Wrecks/PC815.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717003143/http://www.divebums.com/Wrecks/PC815.html |archivedate=2012-07-17 |title=San Diego Divebums |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in Australia. It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by [[Melbourne University Press]].

Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.

==Background==

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.{{sfn|Orion|1995}}

===Hume and her research===
Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a [[religious pluralism|religious pluralist]] and leading her to study the discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church in [[Calgary]], it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the [[Church of All Worlds]] and held in the rural outskirts of [[Canberra]]. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess [[Oya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for ''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia'', Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]] and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became "not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime." Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, [[Murdoch University]] and at the [[Theosophical Society]] in [[Brisbane]]. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a [[snowball sampling]] method.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Chapter one, entitled "Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;15}} The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=16&amp;ndash;40}} The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=41&amp;ndash;78}} while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=79&amp;ndash;111}}

Chapter five offers an examination of [[rites of passage]] and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=112&amp;ndash;143}} while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=144&amp;ndash;168}} The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=169&amp;ndash;204}} and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=205&amp;ndash;225}} In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=226&amp;ndash;238}}

==Reviews==
Emma Tomalin of [[Lancaster University]] reviewed the work for ''[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]]''. Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being "descriptive rather than discursive", thereby appealing more to those "interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice
than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications."{{sfn|Tomalin|1999|pp=174&amp;ndash;175}}
