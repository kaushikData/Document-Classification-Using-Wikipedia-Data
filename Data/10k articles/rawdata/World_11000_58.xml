'''Ambasse bey''' or '''ambas-i-bay''' is a style of [[folk music|folk]] [[music of Cameroon|music]] and [[dance in Cameroon|dance]] from [[Cameroon]]. The music is based on commonly available instruments, especially [[guitar]], with [[percussion]] provided by sticks and bottles.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The music is faster-paced than and originated from [[assiko]], an older form of Cameroonian popular folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgens and Trillo 1183.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hall described its rhythm as the one of a moving broom. Where dancers swing their shoulders like the wings of birds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salle John, Sur la naissance du Makossa !|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpIufHjSX8&amp;feature=youtu.be|last=Bitjomè Bi Man Mbai|date=2013-02-11|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the dance is composed of sequences of fluid steps and jerky body movements performed in accordance with the music, which is generally the [[makossa]]. In order to perform this dance, the dancers must wear traditional [[sawa people|sawa]] outfits. 

Ambasse bey originated among the [[Yabassi (people)|Yabassi]] ethnic group&lt;ref&gt;''Guide touristique'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew popular in [[Douala]] after [[World War II]]. Through the 1950s and 1960s, the style evolved in the Cameroonian [[Littoral Province (Cameroon)|Littoral]]. In the mid-1960s, [[Eboa Lotin]] performed a style of ambasse bey on harmonica and guitar that was the earliest form of [[makossa]], a style that quickly came to overshadow its predecessor and become Cameroon's most popular form of indigenous music.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 197–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambasse bey was revived to an extent by Cameroonian singer [[Sallé John]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 184.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--When?--&gt;

'''Andrea Belli''' (13 October 1703 – 19 October 1772) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] architect and businessman. He designed several [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] buildings, including [[Auberge de Castille]] in [[Valletta]], which is now the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta.

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Valletta]] on 13 October 1703 to the surgeon Giuseppe Belli and his wife Francesca Romano. He spent some time in [[Venice]] as a youth, and he later traveled to [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A-F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5840">The [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]] meet each autumn in what is officially known as the '''Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group''' and each spring in the '''Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group'''. Names of the two groups are alternated each year so a different one has top billing.

The autumn meetings are customarily held in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]] for two consecutive years, and in another member country in the third year. On the weekend of the autumn meetings the [[G7]] also meets. The [[Singapore 2006|2006 Annual Meetings]] and their supporting events were held from 11–20 September 2006 at the [[Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre]] in [[Singapore]]. The 2018 annual meetings will be held at [[Nusa Dua]], [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].

Since the mid-1990s, these meetings have centerpoints for [[anti-globalization movement]] protests.  There have been complete bans on outdoor protests in the 2003 meetings in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] as well as the 2006 meeting in [[Singapore]], where only indoor demonstrations within a designated area is permitted.  Some argue that such bans are out of safety concerns, while others consider them an effort to curb dissent. These measures has led to retaliatory actions by [[NGO]]s who targeted the organisers, as well as the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]] for allegedly picking venues which are known to impose such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Singapore takes flak for ban on protests | work = [[The Sunday Times (Singapore)]] | date = 2006-09-10 | url = http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/ | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aukštaitian''' ({{lang-lt|Aukštaičių tarmė}}) is one of the [[dialect]]s of the [[Lithuanian language]], spoken in [[Regions of Lithuania|ethnographic regions]] of [[Aukštaitija]], [[Dzūkija]] and [[Suvalkija]]. It became the basis for the standard Lithuanian language.

==Classification==

{{legend|#3c18ca|Sub-dialect of Vilnius}}
Southern Aukštaitian
{{legend|#aa51e7|Southern Aukštaitian or Dzūkian sub-dialect}}]]
Revised classification of the dialects, proposed in 1965 by linguists [[Zigmas Zinkevičius]] and [[Aleksas Girdenis]], divides Aukštaitian dialect into three sub-dialects based on pronunciation of mixed [[diphthong]]s ''an'', ''am'', ''en'', ''em'' and [[ogonek]] vowels ''ą'' and ''ę'':

'''Western Aukštaitian''', most similar to standard Lithuanian, preserves both the diphthongs and the vowels. It is further subdivided into two sub-dialects:
*The Kaunas sub-dialect is spoken mostly in [[Suvalkija]]. This sub-dialect separates long and short vowels pretty well and properly [[Stress (linguistics)|stresses]] word endings.
*The Šiauliai sub-dialect is spoken in a strip between [[Samogitia]] and Aukštaitija. This sub-dialect almost always shortens [[Stress (linguistics)|unaccented]] long vowels (''dumẽlis'' instead of ''dūmelis'' – little smoke, ''vãgis'' instead of ''vagys'' – thieves, ''lãpu'' instead of ''lapų'' – leaves) and moves accent mark from the end of the word (''ràsa'' instead of ''rasà'' – dew, ''tỹliu'' instead of ''tyliù'' – I am silent, ''žmònos'' instead of ''žmonõs'' – wives').

'''Southern Aukštaitian''' preserves the diphthong, but replaces ''ą'' and ''ę'' with ''ų'' and ''į'' (''žųsis'' instead of ''žąsis'' – goose, ''skįsta'' instead of ''skęsta'' – drowns). It is spoken mostly in [[Dzūkija]] and therefore is known as [[Dzūkian dialect]].

'''Eastern Aukštaitian''' replaces the diphthongs with either ''un'', ''um'', ''in'', ''im'' or ''on'', ''om'', ''ėn'', ''ėm'' (''pasumda'' instead of ''pasamdo'' – hiring, ''romstis'' instead of ''ramstis'' – support). The ogonek vowels are replaced with either ''ų'', ''į'' or ''o'', ''ę''/''ė'' (''grųštas'' or ''groštas'' instead of ''grąžtas'' – drill, ''grįšt'' instead of ''gręžti'' – to drill). It is spoken mostly in [[Aukštaitija]]. It is further subdivided into six sub-dialects.

[[File:Melik Memmed.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Malikmammad — main hero of an Azerbaijani fairy tale of the same name]]
'''Azerbaijani fairy tales''' are works of folklore by the [[Azerbaijani people]]. They vary in context and subject and include tales from the heroic past of the Azerbaijani people and struggles with local and foreign oppressors. Spiritual, moral, social and philosophical views are reflected throughout these tales.

The tales hand down ancient national traditions and customs whilst depicting the natural beauty of Azerbaijan; its green valleys and pastures, magnificent mountains, purling rivers and blossoming gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==History==
[[File:Прекрасная Фатма.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Goychak Fatma – one of the main heroines of Azerbaijani fairy tales]]
[[File:Джыртдан.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Jirtdan – one of the main heroes of Azerbaijani fairy tales]]
The first recorded fairy tales are found in the heroic [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] [[Book of Dede Korkut|Kitabi Dede Korkut]] ("The book of grandfather Korkut") of the 10th-11th centuries. For instance, there is a narrated tale about a monster-man who eats "two people and five thousand sheep" per day in [[Tepegoz]]'s (a translation from Turkish – [[Cyclops|Cyclop]]) story.

==Characters==
Jirtdan is the most popular fairy tale character among the children's tales in Azerbaijan, meaning "small" when translated from Azerbaijani. Many fairy tales are based on this character, who is distinguished for his keenness of wit, courage and bravery. He can simultaneously be an idler, but also very brave. Div (giant) is another popular character. Little Jirtdan acquires courage and bravery when he meets Div.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Types==
Azerbaijani fairy tales are divided into three types in essence and content: fairy tales about animals, fairy tales about common people and magic fairy tales.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Azerbaijani fairy tales abroad==
The second edition of ''National fairy-tales from Azerbaijan'' was published by Verlag Dr.Koster Publishing House ([[Berlin]]) on the initiative of the Azerbaijani embassy in [[Germany]]. Liliane Grimm is an [[Austria]]n researcher of Azerbaijani studies and author and translator of the book, whose first acquaintance with Azerbaijan was held at an exhibition of Azerbaijani artists in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

''The Tales of Malik-Mammed'', a play written for children by [[Chris Bartlett (writer)]] inspired by Azerbaijani fairy tales, ran at [[Chelsea Theatre]] in London in March 2015 as part of the [http://www.butafestival.com/2015/ Buta Festival].

'''CFMG-FM''' is a Canadian [[radio station]], broadcasting at [[FM radio|FM]] 104.9 in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. Branded as '''104.9 Virgin Radio,''' the station airs a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40/CHR]] format.  The station also broadcasts a Punjabi language format on a [[Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation]] frequency.

==History==
===Early years and EZ Rock===
The station launched in 1978 playing "oldies" from offices and studios just north of Edmonton in St. Albert. The original frequency was 1070 [[kHz]] ([[AM radio|AM]]) with the callsign CKST.

In 1988, CKST received approval to move from 1070 to 1200 AM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1988/DB88-497.HTM Decision CRTC 88-497]&lt;/ref&gt; and changed callsigns to CHMG the same year. CHMG received approval move from AM to FM in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1994/DB94-436.HTM Decision CRTC 94-436]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, CHMG changed to its current callsign, CFMG. At the same time, the station shifted to an [[adult contemporary]] format, branded as ''EZ Rock''. Programmed by longtime broadcaster Tammy Cole, EZ Rock was a station designed to appeal to office work environments. Music was slanted towards female listeners 25–54 years old.

On September 28, 2007, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] approved the sale of CFMG and all Standard Radio assets to Astral Media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ENG/NEWS/RELEASES/2007/r070928.htm CRTC approves Astral/Standard transaction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CFMG-FM2010.jpg|200px|thumb|left|CFMG's EZ Rock logo, used from September 2010 to February 2011.]]

Astral changed the logo of the station in September [[2010 in radio|2010]]; however, the [[adult contemporary]] format is unchanged while continuing to say the decimal point on the station ID. In addition, most of the [[classic hits]] were dropped.

===Virgin Radio 104.9===
On February 4, [[2011 in radio|2011]], the station dropped [[adult contemporary]] and became [[contemporary hit radio]] as ''104.9 Virgin Radio''. EZ Rock's last song was ''[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys Of Summer]]'' by [[Don Henley]], while the first song on "Virgin" was "[[Firework (Katy Perry song)|Firework]]" by [[Katy Perry]]. This left Edmonton with no [[adult contemporary]] station for 51 days, similar to markets where an [[adult contemporary]] station would play [[Christmas music]] from November/December, until [[CKEA-FM]] dropped [[adult album alternative]] for [[adult contemporary]] (which has since shifted to [[adult hits]]).

CFMG, during its final adult contemporary week, did list its [[contemporary hit radio]] adds on [[Mediabase]]'s Canadian [[adult contemporary]] panel.  A week after the station flipped formats, the station was delisted from Mediabase's station adds. As of March [[2011 in radio|2011]], CFMG-FM joined [[CHBN-FM]] on the [[Mediabase]] [[contemporary hit radio]] panel.

CFMG is the third Virgin Radio station in Canada to have a mainstream top 40 format, the first being at [[Calgary]]'s [[CIBK-FM]] [[2010 in radio|the year before]], and in [[Toronto]] at [[CKFM-FM]] in [[2009 in radio|2009]].

Every year for one week, along with sister stations [[CFBR-FM]] and [[CFRN (AM)|CFRN]], CFMG-FM presents, Stollery Week, a week long fundraiser for the [[Stollery Children's Hospital]]. In past years all three stations had broadcast live for 2 days from the Stollery Children's Hospital. In year one, $300,000 was raised for the Pediatric Oncology Unit; in year two, EZ Rock and her sister stations raised $500,000 for Research. The station was also known for the "EZ Rock Christmas Party for Single Parent Families" where families in need are treated to a very special Christmas.

==Ratings==

The last ratings period when CFMG was an adult contemporary station (October/10 - January/11) placed the station at #4 with a 7.4 share.  In the first ratings period as Virgin Radio (February/11 - May/11), the station plummeted to #14 and with a 2.6 share.  The Fall 2011 BBM Canada ratings book has the station up to #11 with a 4.9 share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pugetsoundradio.com/cgi-bin/forum/Blah.pl?m-1323365392 Fall 2011 Edmonton PPM Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cancioneiro da Vaticana''''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐ̃sjuˈnɐjɾu ðɐ vɐtiˈkɐnɐ|lang}}, {{IPA-gl|kaŋθjoˈnejɾo ða βatiˈkana|lang}}, '''''Vatican Songbook''''') is a compilation of [[troubadour]] lyrics in [[Galician-Portuguese]].  It was discovered c. 1840 in the holdings of the [[Vatican Library]] and was first transcribed by D. Caetano Lopes de Moura in 1847, sponsored by Viscount of Carreira, and again by Ernesto Monaci in 1875.

The songbook contains 228 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s with a total of 1205 lyrics that date from the 13th and 14th centuries. Nearly all the poems belong to the three principal genres of secular [[cantigas]]: the ''[[cantigas de amigo]]'', ''[[cantigas de amor]]'' and ''[[cantigas de escárnio e maldizer]]''. Even though the texts were meant to be sung, there is no musical notation—nor space left for it (see [[Cancioneiro da Ajuda]]).

The ''Cancioneiro da Vaticana'', together with the ''[[Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional]]'' (kept in [[Lisbon]]), were copied from an earlier manuscript (or manuscripts) around 1525, in Rome [[Italy]] at the behest of the Italian [[Humanism|humanist]] Angelo Colocci. The two songbooks are either sister manuscripts or cousins.

The '''Central African Democratic Rally''' ({{lang-fr|Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain}}, RDC) is a [[political party]] in the [[Central African Republic]].

==History==
The party was established on 6 February 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-parties-seats-2005-national-assembly CAR: Parties with seats in the 2005 National Assembly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133858/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-parties-seats-2005-national-assembly |date=April 2, 2015 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; initially as the political vehicle for President [[André Kolingba]]. It was the only legal party in the country until 1992.

Kolingba was the party's presidential candidate in the [[Central African Republic general election, 1993|1993 general elections]], and was eliminated in the first round after receiving just 12% of the vote. The party won 13 seats in the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]], emerging as the second-largest faction behind the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People]] (MLPC). It subsequently joined the coalition government led by the MLPC's [[Jean-Luc Mandaba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2059_93.htm Elections held in 1993] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1998|parliamentary elections]] in 1998 the RDC was part of the Union of Forces for Peace, (UFAP) which opposed President [[Ange-Félix Patassé]]. The RDC won 20 seats, and UFAP gained a majority of 55 of the 109 seats in the National Assembly. However, the MLPC was able to form a government after the defection of a UFAP MP.&lt;ref name=TL&gt;Tom Lansford (2014) ''Political Handbook of the World 2014'', CQ Press, p249&lt;/ref&gt; Kolingba was the party's candidate for the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1999|1999 presidential elections]], finishing second with 19% of the vote as Patassé was elected in the first round of voting.

Kolingba was the party's presidential candidate again for the [[Central African Republic general election, 2005|2005 general elections]]. He finished in third place with took 16% of the vote.&lt;ref name=Rapport&gt;[http://democratie.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/RCA_RMO1303_08052005.pdf Report of the Observation Mission of the Presidential and Legislative Elections of 13 March and 8 May 2005 in the Central African Republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622095141/http://democratie.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/RCA_RMO1303_08052005.pdf |date=22 June 2007 }} Francophone Democracy {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; The elections also saw the party reduced to seven seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

In the [[Central African Republic general election, 2011|2011 general elections]] the party won just one seat in the National Assembly, whilst its presidential candidate Emile Gros Raymond Nakombo finished fourth in a field of five with 5% of the vote.

[[Image:KoprivshtitsaChitalishte.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The ''chitalishte'' in [[Koprivshtitsa]] was built in 1869]]
A '''''chitalishte''''' ({{Lang-bg|читалище}}, pronounced {{IPA-bg|t͡ʃiˈtaliʃtɛ|}}) is a typical Bulgarian public institution and building that fulfills several functions at once, such as a community centre, library, and a theatre. It is also used as an educational institution, where people of all ages can enroll in foreign language, dance, music and other courses. In this function they could be compared to the [[Folk High School]]s of Northern Europe. Some larger urban ''chitalishta'' are not unlike [[92nd Street Y]] in [[New York City]]. 

The term ''chitalishte'' is a compound noun, originating from the Bulgarian Slavic root, ''chital-'' (''reading''); and the suffix ''-ishte'' (''place where preceding verb happens''). The word ''chitalishte'' in translation means "reading room," a place where books are kept for public use. 

The ''chitalishta'' of the 19th and early 20th century had a crucial role in preserving and developing Bulgarian culture and thus played an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. The first institutions of this kind emerged towards the end of the [[Ottoman era]], in 1856 in the towns of [[Shumen]], [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]] and [[Svishtov]]. Later, the ''chitalishte'' became an important multi-purpose institution in villages and smaller towns. Today, ''chitalishta'' are less widely spread and have decreasingly critical roles, mostly due to lack of funding. They are evolving and adapting to host public events, house cinema halls, and other modern organisations.

&lt;!-- Please, add: picture info from bg: ; examples of chitalishta; a report on their use during the [[Vuzrazhdane]]  --&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[Aust-Agder]]''' was approved in 1958 and is two gold beams on a red field. This is to symbolise the [[timber]] trade and extraction of [[iron ore]] which was important to the growth of Aust-Agder.

'''''DP75: Tartina City''''' is a 2007 dramatic film by [[Chad]]ian director [[Issa Serge Coelo]], now at his second feature film. The film has won the Innovation Award at the [[Montreal World Film Festival|31st Montreal World Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.unifrance.org/news/5097/montreal-world-film-festival-awards Montreal World Film Festival Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; While the country where the action is set remains unnamed, the context is that of Chadian history in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "[http://www.cefod.org/Tchad%20et%20Culture/Tc256/fespaco6.htm Issa Serge Coelo, cinéaste tchadien: "On a encore du travail à faire"]", ''Tchad et Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt; The name's title is taken from the "tartina", a mixture of bread and sheep's bowels served to the prisoners.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;[http://www.africultures.com/index.asp?menu=affiche_article&amp;no=5969 Africultures, cultures africaines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The action is set in an unnamed African country, where a brutal governative [[death squad]] commanded by Colonel Koulbou (Felkissam Mahamat) is active. A journalist, Adoum (Youssouf Djaoro), having obtained his passport wants to travel abroad so to be able to report on the situation in his country; but while at the airport, a compromising letter is found on him. Adoum is thrown in one of Koulbou's jails. All hope seems lost, but Adoum finds unexpected help from Koulbou's estranged wife, Hawa.

==Reception==
The film was reviewed favourably by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', which while noting the "rocky story progression and a minimalist tech package" of the feature, judged it overcame these difficulties by placing in the center the figure of Colonel Koulbou, whose interpretation is commended. The reviewer concludes saying that "Coelo displays a commitment to social concerns that flags him as a filmmaker to watch from the region."&lt;ref&gt;E. Cockrell, "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934563.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 DP75: Tartina City]", ''Variety'', 17-9-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'' also reviews positively the film, "a very harsh film, without any concessions to aestheticisms ... Its very crude images have at times shocked the spectators, but the authour avoids falling in sensationalism to describe the martyrdom of a freedom of opinion prisoner".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} R. de Rochebrune, "[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN11037politnarcdn0 Politique sur grand écran]", ''Jeune Afrique'', 11-3-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Duett"''' is a [[power ballad]] in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], sung by [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] and [[Jan Werner Danielsen]] as a [[duet]] in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Melodi Grand Prix 1994]]. The song won the Grand Prix, thus earning the right to represent Norway at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994]].

The song deals with the power of song itself, with both performers describing the feelings they get from hearing the other's voice. They sing that it makes them feel free and united in spirit.

The song was performed seventeenth on the night, following [[Lithuania]]'s [[Ovidijus Vyšniauskas]] with "[[Lopšinė mylimai]]" and preceding [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Alma Čardžić|Alma]] &amp; [[Dejan Lazarević (singer)|Dejan]] with "[[Ostani kraj mene]]". At the close of voting, it had received 76 points, placing 6th in a field of 25.

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] by [[Secret Garden (duo)|Secret Garden]] with "[[Nocturne (Secret Garden song)|Nocturne]]".

"Duett" was also made in an [[English language]] version, where it's called "Duet". The [[single (music)|single record]] featured the Norwegian-language version and the English-language version. It peaked at #3 at the Norwegian singles chart and #89 at the [[Eurochart Hot 100]].

== Career and impact ==
Farkas was a [[meteorologist]], ozone researcher.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookemon.com/book-profile/the-farkas-files/425698|title=The Farkas Files Book 425698|publisher=Bookemon|website=www.bookemon.com|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started working as a meteorologist in the Research Section of the [[MetService|New Zealand Meteorological Service]] in 1951 where she continued to do so for some 35 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorSmith1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Rowan|last2=Smith|first2=Ian|title=The State of New Zealand's Environment, 1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6IfAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=New Zealand Government - Ministry for the Environment|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=978-0-478-09000-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas monitored [[ozone]] from the 1950s until her retirement in 1986, undertaking world-leading research in the field of ozone monitoring over more than three decades. During 1960s her work shifted increasingly to the study of atmospheric ozone including the measurement of total ozone with the [[Dobson ozone spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name="McGloneClarkson1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She became one of a small international group of atmospheric scientists dedicated to the study of atmospheric ozone-interest in which, in that era, was largely in use as a tracer to aid atmospheric circulation studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ioc.atmos.illinois.edu/about/History%20of%20International%20Ozone%20Commission%203.pdf|title=The International Ozone Commission (IO3C) Its history and activities related to atmospheric ozone|last=Bojkov|first=Rumen D.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work contributed substantially towards the discovery of the "[[Ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]]" which changed the world's behavior towards pollution forever. Her interest in atmospheric ozone measurement led naturally to the application of her expertise to the monitoring of surface ozone as part of air pollution studies and also to the measurement of atmospheric turbidity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Farkas was the first Hungarian woman and also the first female New Zealand MetService staff member to set foot in Antarctica in 1975.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her World War II diaries form the basis of a book titled ''The Farkas Files''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Farkas was the first woman to be awarded the New Zealand [[MetService]] Henry Hill Award in 1986,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; upon her retirement.&lt;ref name="Munster (1993)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munster|first1=R.|title=Edith Elisabeth Farkas 1921-1993|journal=Földrajzi Múzeumi Tanulmányok|date=1993|issue=12|pages=110|url=http://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SZAK_FOLD_Fmt_12_1993/?pg=111&amp;layout=s|accessdate=19 August 2016|publisher=Magyar Földrajzi Múzeum|location=Budapest, Hungary|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received special recognition at the Quadrennial Ozone Symposium in Germany in 1988 for her 30 year contribution to Ozone research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Edith donated a number of personal belongings and other objects connected to her career to the Museum, including some rock samples from Antarctica, photographs, publications and the original copy of her novel on her stay in the southernmost continent. She fought a long battle with bone cancer,&lt;ref name="Balázs (1993)" /&gt; and died in Wellington on 3 February 1993.&lt;ref name="Munster (1993)" /&gt;

'''Gluvo-nemo''' (Глуво-немо) or ''Deaf-mute dance'' in English is a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] [[Hora (dance)|oro]] from the region of Mala Reka and [[Galičnik]], region along the river of [[Radika]].

It is a woman dance that is danced without music, only by the rhythm of the coins on the chests on the woman costumes. The dancers are holding belts with the left over the right arm and begin their dance in a position of a half circle. The dance rhythm is {{music|time|2|4}}.

The '''High Commission of Cameroon''' in [[London]] is the [[diplomatic mission]] of [[Cameroon]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/263519/LDL_December_2013.pdf |title=The London Diplomatic List |date=13 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211155353/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/263519/LDL_December_2013.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protest was held outside the embassy in 2013 following the murder of Cameroonian gay-rights activist Eric Lembembe. This led to several more protests in [[Cameroon]], especially in the southern regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/ocvgWua1S6 |title=London: protesters rally at Cameroon High Commission |date=24 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203040338/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/ocvgWua1S6 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''i24NEWS''' is an [[Israel]]i [[International news channels|international 24-hour news]] and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] television channel located in [[Jaffa Port]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=i24news gives 'different view' of Israel: director |first=Michael |last=Blum |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jMR2fW7IMr88duCULDwIBXNLHGbw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219075800/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jMR2fW7IMr88duCULDwIBXNLHGbw |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 February 2014 |newspaper=AFP |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The channel's owner is [[Patrick Drahi]], and the CEO is [[Frank Melloul]].

The network began broadcasting in the US on 13 February 2017.  The English channel is broadcast from [[New York (state)|New York]] between 6 and 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time and at other times broadcasts from Israel.

== History ==
The channel went live on 17 July 2013. Melloul stated that it would battle prejudice and ignorance about Israel with "facts and diversity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/move-over-al-jazeera-israel-s-own-24-hour-tv-news-station-is-about-to-go-live.premium-1.532086 Move over Al Jazeera, Israel’s own 24-hour TV news station is about to go live] By Danna Harman, [[Haaretz]], 3 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-israeli-answer-to-al-jazeera The Israeli Answer to Al Jazeera] By Ruth Margalit, [[The New Yorker]], 29 July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab Israeli]] journalist [[Lucy Aharish]] was the lead anchor of the English-language branch of the channel from July 2013 until she resigned in January 2016.

On 8 December 2016 all programming on the English channel officially ended in preparation for [[I24NEWS (United States)|launching in America]]. The channel broadcast 10 minutes of news on the Hour from 8&amp;nbsp;am to 11&amp;nbsp;pm (local time) and replaced "Morning Edition", "The Daily Beat" and "The Lineup" with a 26-minute news bulletin, repeated at half past.

The launch of i24NEWS in the United States was announced on 27 January 2017. The channel is operated out of headquarters Jaffa.

Live programming in the US is broadcast from [[Times Square]] in New York with an additional bureau in [[Washington, DC]]. Approximately 50 journalists were hired to staff the two locations. The channel uses resources from its Jaffa headquarters.

Among the first journalists hired were Michelle Makori, anchor and editor-in-chief, [[David Shuster]] who is also a managing editor and [[Dan Raviv]] (a 40+ year veteran of [[CBS News]]). The channel acquired many of its debut behind-the-scenes talent from the former [[Al Jazeera America]].

== Distribution ==
i24NEWS started broadcasting in Israel on August 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/international/182936-180829-international-news-channel-i24news-to-begin-broadcasting-in-israel&lt;/ref&gt; It is offered in France (including the [[French West Indies]]), Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland and across the African continent. The channel is also streamed live on its website in all three languages. The channel signed an agreement enabling it to be broadcast in Germany on [[Kabel Deutschland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2014/04/01/i24news-signs-german-swiss-deals/&lt;/ref&gt; i24news was initially broadcast in the United States via the [[Jewish Life Television]] network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/03/18/patrick-drahis-israeli-news-channel-i24news-to-air-in-us-by-jltv/ Patrick Drahi’s Israeli News Channel I24news To Air In US By JLTV], [[Jewish Business News]], 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but following the acquisition of Cablevision by Drahl-owned [[Altice USA]] (formerly Cablevision with a public brand of Optimum), i24NEWS is now broadcast on the Optimum channel 102, and its distribution is limited to Drahl-owned Optimum and Suddenlink systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alticeusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Final-Press-Release-Altice-USA-Partners-with-i24NEWS-to-Launch-Global-Voices.pdf|title=Altice USA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ijesha''' (written as '''Ìjẹ̀ṣà''' in Yoruba orthography), are a sub-ethnicity of the [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]] of West Africa. Ilesha is the largest town and historic cultural capital of the Ijesha people, and is home to a kingdom of the same name, ruled by an Oba locally stylized as the Owa Obokun Adimula. The current reigning Owa Obokun is Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran II.

==Geography==
Ijeshaland is located at latitude 8.92°N and Longitude 3.42°E. It lies in a forested region at the heart of the Yoruba country west of the Effon ridge which separate the Ijeshas from the Ekitis to their east, and at the intersection of roads from Ile-Ife, Oshogbo, Ado Ekiti and Akure. 
The Ijesa cultural area presently covers six local government councils within Osun stae of Nigeria.

The Ijesha territory is adjoined by the [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] on the east, the [[Igbomina tribe|Igbomina]] to the north, the [[Ile-Ife|Ife]] to the south, and the [[Oyo State|Oyo]] and [[Ibolo]] to the west.

The nationally famous  Olumirin waterfalls, more popularly known as [[Erin-Ijesha Waterfalls]] is located in Ijeshaland.

==History==
The Ijesha may have lost some territory to their neighbours during various conflicts and wars of the nineteenth and preceding centuries. The people of [[Oke-Ako]], [[Irele]], [[Omuo-Oke]] are said to speak a dialect similar to Ijesha.

==The Ilesha (Ijesha) Monarchs==
{{Yoruba people}}
The state of Ilesa (Ile ti a sa which means a homeland we chose), Traditional Headquarters of Ijesaland and the capital  of the first Local Council in Nigeria (Ijesa/Ekiti Parapo Council) named by the British Colonial Administrator on 21 June 1900 comprising the present day Ondo and Ekiti States of Nigeria. Founded in c.1350 by Owaluse, a grandson of Ajibogun Ajaka (Ubiquitous Warrior) Owa Obokun Onida Arara, one of the most accomplished sons of [[Oduduwa]], the progenitor of the Yoruba race of South-Western Nigeria and Benin Republic. The city described by Rev. Williams Howard Clark in 1854 as: ''For its cleanliness, regularity in breadth and width, and  the straightness of its streets, the ancient city of Ilesa far surpasses any native town I have seen in black Africa''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12499">'''Khorvaire''' is fictional continent in [[Eberron]], a campaign setting for ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]].

The material plane of Eberron contains four major continents, of which Khorvaire is arguably the most well-documented in the various sourcebooks. The others are [[Argonnessen]] (to the south east), [[Xen'drik]] (to the south west) and [[Sarlona]] (in the far east). The island continent of [[Aerenal]] lies just south east of Khorvaire, and to the north lies the frozen and barren continent of [[Frostfell]].

==Countries==
The landmass features a number of countries:

===Aundair===
Aundair is a mostly flat country of farmlands and vineyards, with a strong culture of craftsmen, academics, and magic. Its capital is Fairhaven, and [[Dragonmarked house#House Lyrandar|House Lyrandar]] and [[Dragonmarked house#House Orien|House Orien]] are headquartered here. It possesses the premier academy of magic in all of Khorvaire, the Floating Towers of Arcanix. Although Aundair's army is small compared to its neighbors, it held its own throughout the Last War through its use of spellcasters within the army to employ destructive magical weapons and spells against its enemies. Aundair is governed by The Triumvirate, consisting of Queen Aurala, First Warlord Adal (who is the Royal Minister of Magic), and Lord Darro (leader of the Knights Arcane). Queen Aurala is a suspicious ruler, and as such operates the most extensive espionage system employed by any of the governments of Khorvaire, the Royal Eyes of Aundair. Its fiercest enemy during the Last War was neighboring Thrane, and relations between the two remain cold. Aundair's national symbol is the dragonhawk, a large, majestic bird of prey that can be used as a mount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/178680000] ''[[Five Nations (accessory)|Five Nations]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breland===
Breland is a large and powerful country that prides itself for its free speech, diversity, and acceptance as compared to the rest of Khorvaire. Although executive and judicial powers still lie with King Boranel, an elected parliament oversees the legislative duties of the country, making Breland the most democratic of any of the Five Nations. The capital of Breland is Wroat, and Breland is home to the largest city on Khorvaire, [[Sharn]], known as the City of Towers for its towering buildings and cosmopolitan atmosphere. Breland has emerged from the Last War as the most powerful country culturally and economically, while its military power rivals that of Karrnath. Although it is the most powerful of the Five Nations emerging from the Last War, it is also the most interested in maintaining peace; King Boranel orchestrated the Treaty of Thronehold, which ended the Last War. The country produces a wide array of goods, and is especially noted for the weapons produced in the smelters and forges of Sharn. [[Dragonmarked house#House Medani|House Medani]] and one of the three branches of [[Dragonmarked house#House Cannith|House Cannith]] maintain their headquarters within Sharn, while [[Dragonmarked house#House Phiarlan|House Phiarlan]] operates from Wroat. After Cyre was destroyed, the surviving Cyran refugees were accepted into the country and formed a community known as New Cyre. The other nations hope for the collapse of the government after King Boranel's death, as none of his heirs have expressed near the amount of charisma or leadership skills as Boranel. Other groups within the country have clamored for the complete elimination of the monarchy and the establishment of an entirely elected government. As the largest and most populous nation (3.7 million people), it is home to the largest communities of humans (44% of Breland's populace), gnomes (14%), half-elves (10%), elves (8%) and changelings (4%).

===Darguun===
Home of nearly 69% of Khorvaire's [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], Darguun is perceived by civilised people as a necessary evil, for the moment at least. It has hardly any exports, although it has a deal with [[Dragonmarked house#House Deneith|House Deneith]] to supply mercenaries.

Darguun was once land owned by the nation of Cyre, and was appropriated by goblinoid mercenaries, who served during the Last War, during a mass coup that occurred around 29 years ago. The coup involved the uniting of numerous goblin bands, scattered throughout the armies of all five warring nations in a massed assault and conquest of southern Cyre. 

This event was largely orchestrated by a young hobgoblin, named [[Haruuc]], who has since named himself Lhesh Haruuc Shaarat'kor, or the High Warlord Haruuc of the Scarlet Blade. It is he to whom the [[Ghaal'dar]] tribe owe allegiance, and his rule has been marked by both cunning and tact, as he his capacity for diplomacy aided the recognition of Darguun as an individual entity at the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] (which ended the Last War 2 years ago in YK 996).

The Ghaal'dar, as a whole, have the most developed relations with foreign realms, trading goods and the services of well-trained goblinoid mercenaries with [[Breland]] and [[Thrane]]. The survivors of Cyre have little regard for the goblins, given their occupation of Cyre land and general bitterness at the loss of their own home. Two other goblin clans exist (consisting of numerous tribes each) - the [[Dhakaani clan]]s ([[Kech Volaar]] and [[Kech Shaarat]]), which reside in the western [[Seawall Mountains]] within ancient [[Dhakaani]] fortresses, and the [[Marguls]], which are tribes of the Northern Seawalls (mostly their highlands) and are primarily composed of [[Bugbear (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bugbears]].

The Marguls are fearsome and the most barbaric of the clans, sharing few interactions with the outside world and only passing relations with Lhesh Haruuc and the Ghall'dar. The Kech seek the rebuilding of the ancient Dhakaani empire, and are guardians of lore and techniques of the fallen kingdom, often seeking out ancient artifacts and stories of the past.

===Demon Wastes===
The Demon Wastes are a barren, volcanic wasteland stretching out from beyond the Shadowcrags and the Icehorn Mountains, which separate the area from the Eldeen Reaches. The plateau that stretches out from the mountains is punctuated by a series of canyons and mesas that form a natural labyrinth from which the demons possess their easiest access to the surface world in all of Khorvaire. From here, the Lords of Dust, ruled by malevolent [[Rakshasa (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Rakshasa]], control fiends and demons and orchestrate far-reaching schemes across Eberron to see their race one day return to power. Two groups of humanoids wander the wastes. One, the Carrion Tribes, are the bloodthirsty, primitive, demon-worshiping Human tribes that wander the plains beyond the Labyrinth. Meanwhile, four separate tribes of slightly more sophisticated orcs (sprinkled with a handful of humans and half-orcs), known as the Ghaash'kala, believe that it is their sacred right to keep demons, barbarian tribes, and other monstrosities from finding their way onto the rest of the continent, and also attempt to keep people from entering the region.

===Droaam===
Before the Last War, Droaam was a part of Breland, but it proved too difficult to protect all civilised inhabitants while fighting a war. Now it is inhabited by mostly goblins, ogres, hags and gnolls.

===Eldeen Reaches===
Most of the land is taken up by forest, out of which most druids operate. The country was a part of Aundair before the Last War, but when troops were withdrawn out of the Eldeen Reaches to help  protect the main cities of Aundair, the inhabitants of the Eldeen Reaches claimed independence. [[Dragonmarked house#House Vadalis|House Vadalis]] operates from the nation.

===Karrnath===
The dictatorship of Karrnath has good ties with the Mror Holds. [[Dragonmarked house#House Jorasco|House Jorasco]] and [[Dragonmarked house#House Deneith|House Deneith]] operate out of Karrnath. Notably, Karrnath supplemented its fighting force with undead creatures.

===Lhazaar Principalities===
Pirates and other nautical forces live here. The principalities consist of a number of islands. Anyone with power controls not only a [[flagship]], but also some land.

===Mournland===
Cyre was a strategic battleground in the Last War, and was host to some of the largest battles of that war. In the last years of the Last War, Cyre was suddenly, and inexplicably, destroyed. A not-quite-dead wasteland remains where Cyre lay, surrounded by a thick gray fog. It appears that Mournland is literally an open grave, where the bodies of deceased soldiers refuse to decay.
A few survivors from Cyre have settled a village in Breland, dubbed ''New Cyre''. The village has expanded to a population size of about 5000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebsi/20051219a Sharn Inquisitive: Prince Slams Pace of Rebuilding&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mror Holds===
This dwarven nation is an important economic power in Khorvaire. [[Dragonmarked house#House Kundarak|House Kundarak]] operates a powerful banking emporium from here. The dwarves have built impenetrable forts here.

===Q'barra===
A country of colonists and idealists, Q'barra is a rainforest. The country was founded, far from everything, to maintain the ideals of King Galifar I, and consists of a few cities and small villages spread throughout the jungle. Q'barra mines and exports Eberron [[Dragonshard]]s. No House operates out of Q'barra, although [[Dragonmarked house#House Tharashk|House Tharashk's]] Finders Guild is involved in the search for Dragonshards. Conflicts have arisen between the lizardfolk who are native to the region and the new Human settlers.

===Shadow Marches===
The Shadow Marches are home to most [[half-orc]]s. The country is home to mostly orcs and human families, with a few half-orcs. The families are part of clans, made up of both humans and orcs. [[Dragonmarked house#House Tharashk|House Tharashk]] operates from here, and consists of a fairly loose group of humans and half-orcs. Eberron Dragonshards are found in the Shadow Marches.

===Talenta Plains===
[[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Halflings]], who learned to work together during the Last War, live a mostly nomadic lifestyle here. They are hunters and herders, and have little industry. [[Dragonmarked house#House Ghallanda|House Ghallanda]] operated out of the Talenta Plains.

===Thrane===
Formally, Thrane is a [[monarchy]] ruled by Queen Diani ir'Wynarn, descendant of King Galifar I. In reality, however, the royal family serves only as a figurehead. Thrane is a fundamentalist [[theocracy]] and the real power resides with the [[Silver Flame|Church of the Silver Flame]]. Below the mighty Council of Cardinals, the archbishops of the Silver Flame act as governors and mayors throughout the realm. Religious design and artwork dominate most of the architecture, giving the urban areas a unique look that doesn't exist anywhere else in Khorvaire. There are few people in Thrane who follow any other faith than the Silver Flame, but those who do and do it openly can expect to be met with suspicion and hostility.

===Valenar===
Originally a colony of elves from the island continent of [[Aerenal]]. The elves that live here live a very militaristic lifestyle and regularly raid Q'barra. Humans, mostly farmers, live here too and produce food for the elves in a sort of symbiosis. [[Dragonmarked house#House Lyrandar|House Lyrandar]] is one the few Houses with any sort of influence here, as it can control the weather.

===Zilargo===
The [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]] have lived here for thousands of years, managing to keep their independence through diplomacy. When King Galifar I built his kingdom, the gnomes surrendered, to maintain their independence. They export diplomatic expertise and produce the Korranberg Chronicle, a widely read newspaper. [[Dragonmarked house#House Kundarak|House Kundarak]] and [[Dragonmarked house#House Sivis|House Sivis]] operate out of Zilargo.

==Population and demographics==

According to the ''[[Eberron Campaign Setting]]'', Khorvaire is home to 15,520,020 people, although some fans dispute the realism of that number, arguing that ten times that is more realistic.  The bulk of the population, 43.2%, is human.  The second largest population is of dwarves, which make up another 9.3%.

According to Israeli diplomat [[Yigal Palmor]], the organization gathered in October 2003 the largest European parliamentary delegation that has ever visited the Middle East.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/european-lawmakers-to-visit-region-to-promote-understanding-1.103660 | title = European lawmakers to visit the region to promote understanding | newspaper = [[Haaretz]] | date = October 24, 2003 |  first = Adar |last = Primor | author2=Haaretz Correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt; 160 parliamentarians from 28 countries took part in the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medbridge.org/une-chance-pour-la-paix |trans-title=A chance for peace | title = Une chance pour la paix | publisher = MedBridge | date = 22 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, the delegation accompanied another large delegation of 60 parliamentarians from 21 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1025201&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 | title = Visite express au Proche-Orient |trans-title=Express visit to the Middle East | date = 21 February 2008 | first = Annick |last = Cojean | newspaper = [[Le Monde]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Abdullah II]] was consulted by a delegation of Medbridge during this visit, and actively lobbied for the creation of a state of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kingabdullah.jo/en/news/king-meets-delegation-med-bridge-centre|title=King Meets A delegation From "Med Bridge" Centre |website=Kingabdullah.jo|date=26 October 2003|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticlePrintPage.aspx?id=1403150&amp;language=en|title=King Meets a Delegation from "Med Bridge" Center|website=Kuna.net.kw|date=26 October 2003|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, after French president [[Jacques Chirac]] told the press that if [[Iran]] held a few nuclear weapons, it wouldn't be a big deal, a delegation of French politicians was sent by Mebridge to Israel and Palestine to get a hands-on approach of the problem instead of viewing the conflict through the lens of the French press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2007/02/11/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/french-politicians-see-regions-nuances|title=French politicians see region’s nuances|website=Jta.org|date=11 February 2007|author=Uriel Heilman|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, MedBridge organized a visit of French writers to the Middle-East in cooperation with ''[[Le Monde]]'' Magazine.&lt;ref name=voyage-decrivains&gt;{{cite web | title = Voyage d’écrivains français en Israël et dans les Territoires palestiniens – 18 au 22 juin 2007 | url = http://www.medbridge.org/voyage-decrivains-francais-en-israel-et-dans-les-territoires-palestiniens-18-au-22-juin-2007 |trans-title=Delegation of French Writers to the Middle-East – June 18 to 22, 2007| date = 29 June 2007| publisher = MedBridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Since its creation in 2003, the organization has initiated a dozen of international events. These include conferences, exhibitions, international meetings and visits of European parliamentarians and civil society representatives to the Middle East.&lt;ref name=initiatives&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medbridge.org/category/initiatives |trans-title=All items in Initiatives |title=Initiatives: Tous les articles dans Initiatives |publisher=Medbridge |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415095851/http://www.medbridge.org/category/initiatives |archivedate=15 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visits to the Middle East ===
Medbridge has organized visits to the Middle East for public leaders and decision-makers. About 500 parliamentarians, from 30 European countries, took part in these visits.&lt;ref name=".doten2-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=initiatives/&gt;

In addition to political visits, MedBridge has also initiated several visits for civil society representatives and opinion leaders.

=== Events ===

{{Anti-Semitism}}

{{main|Antisemitism in Europe}}

'''[[Anti-Semitism]]'''  in the [[history of the Jews in the Middle Ages]] became increasingly prevalent in the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Early instances of [[pogrom]]s against Jews are recorded in the context of the [[First Crusade]]. 
Expulsion of Jews from cities and instances of [[blood libel]] become increasingly common in the 13th to 15th centuries.
This trend peaked only after the end of the medieval period, and subsided only with [[Jewish emancipation]] in the late 18th to 19th century.

== Accusations of deicide ==
{{further|Jewish deicide|Nostra aetate|l2=''Nostra aetate''}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], religion played a major role in driving [[anti-Semitism]]. Though not part of [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], have held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus, through the so-called [[blood curse]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in the Gospels, among other things.

As stated in the [[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays, "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus’ death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[deicide]], or God-killing. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide (Which was originally attributed by [[Melito of Sardis]]) has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America."&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. [http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf "A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301033826/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf |date=March 1, 2011 }}, accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This accusation was repudiated in 1964, when the Catholic Church under [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' as a part of [[Vatican II]].

== Restrictions to marginal occupations (tax collecting, moneylending, etc.) ==

Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to the Jews, pushing them into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], tolerated them as a "[[The ends justify the means#necessary evil|necessary evil]]". Catholic doctrine of the time held that lending money for interest was a [[sin]], and forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, Jews dominated this business. The [[Torah]] and later sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]] criticise [[Usury#Biblical|usury]] but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary (the only time Jesus used violence was against money changers taking a toll to enter temple). Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money lending. This was said to show Jews were insolent, greedy, [[usury|usurers]], and subsequently led to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could personify them as the people taking their earnings while remaining loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/amirkohan/religious-discrimination/ Religious Discrimination], Berkman Center - Harvard Law School {{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Black Death ==
{{further|Black Death}}
As the [[Black Death]] [[epidemics]] devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence, in particular in the Iberian peninsula and in the Germanic Empire. In [[Provence]], 40 Jews were burnt in [[Toulon]] as soon as April 1348.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Never mind that Jews were not immune from the ravages of the plague &lt;!-- uncertainty about the plague being bubonic, although it is the most accepted hypothesis; irrelevant link, Black Death link more appropriate --&gt;; they were tortured until they confessed to crimes that they could not possibly have committed. In one such case, a man named Agimet was ... coerced to say that Rabbi Peyret of [[Chambéry]] (near [[Geneva]]) had ordered him to poison the wells in [[Venice]], [[Toulouse]], and elsewhere. In the aftermath of Agimet's "confession", the Jews of [[Strasbourg]] were burned alive on February 14, 1349.&lt;ref name=Hertzberg&gt;[[Arthur Hertzberg|Hertzberg, Arthur]] and Hirt-Manheimer, Aron. ''Jews: The Essence and Character of a People'', HarperSanFrancisco, 1998, p.84. {{ISBN|0-06-063834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by the July 6, 1348 [[papal bull]] and another 1348 bull, several months later, 900 Jews were burnt in [[Strasbourg]], where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; Clement VI condemned the violence and said those who blamed the plague on the Jews (among whom were the [[flagellant]]s) had been "seduced by that liar, the Devil."

==Demonizing of the Jews==
From around the 12th century through the 19th there were Christians who believed that some (or all) Jews possessed magical powers; some believed that they had gained these magical powers from making a deal with the [[devil]]. See also [[Judensau]], [[Judeophobia]].

==Blood libels==
{{main|blood libel}}
On many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].  According to the authors of these blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of [[black magic]] would be performed on it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} 
[[Image:Descreationofhost.gif|thumb|right|250px|A 15th-century German woodcut showing an alleged host desecration. In the first panel the hosts are stolen; in the second the hosts bleed when pierced by a Jew; in the third the Jews are arrested; and in the fourth they are burned alive.]]
The story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of [[ritual murder]] against Jews. The Jews of [[Norwich]], England were accused of  murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified their victim. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr. Recent analysis has cast doubt on whether this was the first of the series of blood libel accusations but not on the contrived and antisemitic nature of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Gillian (2005), "Towards a revaluation of the legend of 'Saint' William of Norwich and its place in the blood libel legend". ''Folklore'', 116(2), pp 119-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood and satisfied their thirst at the expense of innocent Christian children.  Following this logic, such charges were typically made in Spring around the time of [[Passover]], which approximately coincides with the time of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., Editor;  (1969). ''A History of The Jewish People''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255) said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table. His belly was cut open and his [[Disembowelment|entrails]] were removed for some [[occult]] purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]]. The story of [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475) emphasized how the boy was held over a large bowl so all his blood could be collected.

== Host desecration==
[[Jews]] were sometimes falsely accused of desecrating consecrated [[Host (Holy Communion)|hosts]] in a reenactment of the [[Crucifixion]]; this crime was known as [[host desecration]] and carried the [[death penalty]].

== Disabilities and restrictions ==
[[Jews]] were subject to a wide range of legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]],{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own, were forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and suffered a variety of other measures, including restrictions on dress.
[[Image:BritLibCottonNeroDiiFol183vPersecutedJews.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The yellow badge Jews were forced to wear can be seen in this marginal illustration from an English manuscript.]]

=== Clothing ===
{{main|yellow badge|Jewish hat}}
The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews. It could be a coloured piece of cloth in the shape of a star or circle or square, a Jewish hat (already a distinctive style), or a robe. In many localities, members of medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as [[guild]] members) were prestigious, while others ostracised outcasts such as [[Leprosy|leper]]s, reformed [[heresy|heretics]] and [[Prostitution|prostitutes]].  The local introduction and enforcement of these rules varied greatly.  Jews sought to evade the [[Jewish badge|badges]] by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary "exemptions" to kings, which were revoked and re-paid whenever the king needed to raise funds.

== The Crusades ==
{{see also|Rhineland massacres}}
The mobs accompanying the [[First Crusade]], and particularly the [[People's Crusade]] of 1096, attacked the Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and put many Jews to death. Entire communities, like those of [[Treves]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], and [[Cologne]], were slain during the first Crusade by a mob army. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Before the Crusades the Jews had practically a monopoly of trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of merchant traders among the Christians, and from this time onward restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent. The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against the Jews as against the Muslims, though attempts were made by bishops during the [[First crusade]] and the [[papacy]] during the [[Second Crusade]] to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]], and formed the turning point in the [[medieval]] [[history of the Jews]].

In the [[County of Toulouse]] (now part of southern France) Jews were received on good terms until the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Toleration and favour shown to the Jews was one of the main complaints of the Roman Church against the Counts of Toulouse. Following the Crusaders' successful wars against [[Raymond VI]] and [[Raymond VII]], the Counts were required to discriminate against Jews like other Christian rulers. In 1209, stripped to the waist and barefoot, Raymond VI was obliged to swear that he would no longer allow Jews to hold public office. In 1229 his son Raymond VII, underwent a similar ceremony where he was obliged to prohibit the public employment of Jews, this time at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris. Explicit provisions on the subject were included in the [[Treaty of Meaux]] (1229). By the next generation a new, zealously [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], ruler was arresting and imprisoning Jews for no crime, raiding their houses, seizing their cash, and removing their religious books. They were then released only if they paid a new "tax". A historian has argued that organised and official persecution of the Jews became a normal feature of life in southern France only after the Albigensian Crusade because it was only then that the Church became powerful enough to insist that measures of discrimination be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Costen, ''The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade'', p 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expulsions from England, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal ==
''Only a few expulsions of the Jews are described in this section, for a more extended list see [[History of anti-Semitism]], and also the [[History of the Jews in England]], [[History of the Jews in France|France]], [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]], [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], and [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portugal]].''

In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe persecutions and formal expulsions of Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, whether religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the [[First Crusade]], many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils.  In Germany the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7065-1327-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Anti-Semitism |edition= |language= |publisher=Keter Books |location=Jerusalem |year=1974 |origyear= |pages= |quote= |isbn=9780706513271 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teacher's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/gallery/expuls.htm|work=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida|publisher=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1519, the Imperial city of [[Regensburg]] took advantage of the recent death of [[Emperor Maximilian I]] to expel its 500 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Christopher S., ''Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape'', p. 251, 1993, Reaktion Books, London, {{ISBN|0948462469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for [[ransom]], was utilized to enrich the French crown during 12th-14th centuries. The most notable such expulsions were: from Paris by [[Philip Augustus of France|Philip Augustus]] in 1182, from the entirety of France by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1254, by [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1306, by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1322, by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1394.

To finance his war to conquer [[Wales]], [[Edward I of England]] taxed the Jewish moneylenders. When the Jews could no longer pay, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, the Jews saw Edward abolish their "privilege" to lend money, choke their movements and activities and were forced to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow patch]]. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested, over 300 of them taken to the [[Tower of London]] and executed, while others killed in their homes. ''See also:-[[History of the Jews in England#Massacres at London and York (1189–1190)|Massacres at London and York (1189–1190)]].'' The complete banishment of all Jews from the country in 1290 led to thousands killed and drowned while fleeing and the absence of Jews from England for three and a half centuries, until 1655, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] reversed the policy.

In 1492, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] issued ''[[Alhambra Decree|General Edict on the Expulsion of the Jews]]'' from Spain (''see also [[Spanish Inquisition]]'') and many [[Sephardi]] Jews fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], some to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

The [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]] followed suit and in December 1496, it was decreed that any Jew who did not convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the King. When those who chose expulsion arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion, and promises in order to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This period of time technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as "New Christians" or [[Marranos]] (lit. "pigs" in Spanish), and they were given a grace period of thirty years in which no inquiries into their faith would be allowed; this was later to be extended to end in 1534. A popular riot in 1504 would end in the death of two thousand Jews; the leaders of this riot were executed by Manuel.

In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are eliminated from public records and judicial autonomy is annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution".

{{main|Christianity and anti-Semitism}}

[[Martin Luther]], an [[Augustinian]] [[monasticism|monk]] and an [[ecclesiastical]] reformer whose teachings inspired the [[Protestant Reformation]], wrote antagonistically about Jews in his book ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and their Lies]]'', which describes the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them, and provides detailed recommendations for a [[pogrom]] against them and their permanent oppression and/or expulsion. At one point in ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', Martin Luther goes even as far to write "that we are at fault in not slaying them." According to [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], it "may be termed the first work of modern anti-Semitism, and a giant step forward on the road to [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]]. ''A History of the Jews'', HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, p.242. {{ISBN|5-551-76858-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached "We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord."&lt;ref name=Luther&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''D. Martin Luthers Werke: kritische Gesamtausgabe'', Weimar: Hermann Böhlaus Nachfolger, 1920, Vol. 51, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian anti-Semitism.

The '''Movement for Democratic Renewal and Development''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement pour le Renouveau Démocratique et le Développement}}), ({{lang-ar|لحركة التجديد الديموقراطي والتنمية}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Djibouti]]. It was originally known as the Party for Democratic Renewal. The PRD of Djibouti was created with the purpose of forming a national democratic party.  The PRD gained popularity at the collapse of the communist bloc and the end of the Cold War.  It used its military power gained through its coalition with the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) and the [[Movement for Peace and Reconciliation]] (MPR).  The current leader of PRD is [[Abdillani Hamariteha]].

The PRD was founded by [[Mohamed Djame Elabe]], a former minister in the government, on 27 September 1992;&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,QUERYRESPONSE,,DJI,3ae6aac550,0.html "Djibouti: Political opposition parties (This Response replaces an earlier version dated 13 January 1999).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520004544/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type%2CQUERYRESPONSE%2C%2CDJI%2C3ae6aac550%2C0.html |date=20 May 2011 }}", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (UNHCR Refworld), DJI31018.FE, 1 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; it replaced the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation, a group founded by Djame in early 1992.&lt;ref name=PP&gt;''Political Parties of the World'' (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The party participated in the [[Djiboutian parliamentary election, 1992|December 1992 parliamentary election]] and won 24.41% of vote, although it obtained no representation in the [[National Assembly of Djibouti|National Assembly]];&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; no other opposition party participated in the election, and all seats were won by the ruling [[People's Rally for Progress]] (RPP).&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;

Standing as the PRD presidential candidate in the [[Djiboutian presidential election, 1993|May 1993 presidential election]], Djame placed second behind President [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]] and received about 22% of the vote.&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; Djame died on 26 November 1996, and the PRD held a congress on 23 May 1997, electing Hamariteha as PRD President, [[Maki Houmed Gaba]] as First Vice-President, and [[Carton Dibeth Oblik]] as Second Vice-President.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;

In the [[Djiboutian parliamentary election, 1997|December 1997 parliamentary election]], the PRD received 19.2% of the vote but again failed to win any seats. Together with the leaders of the Group for Democracy and the Republic and the Djibouti United Opposition Front, Hamariteha signed a communiqué providing for an alliance between the three groups on 25 November 1998.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; In the [[Djiboutian parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary election]] held on 10 January 2003, the PRD was part of the [[Union for a Democratic Change]] (''Union pour l'Alternance Démocratique''), which won 37.3% of the popular vote but no seats in the National Assembly.

'''OPS 5118''', also known as '''Navstar 6''', '''GPS I-6''' and '''GPS SVN-6''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] launched in 1980 as part of the [[Global Positioning System]] development programme. It was the sixth of eleven [[GPS Block I|Block I]] GPS satellites to be launched.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

OPS 5118 was launched at 22:00 UTC on 26 April 1980, atop an [[Atlas E/F]] carrier rocket with an [[SGS-1]] upper stage. The Atlas used had the serial number 34F, and was originally built as an [[SM-65F Atlas|Atlas F]].&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3|Space Launch Complex 3E]] at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed OPS 5118 into a transfer orbit.

By 27 May 1980, OPS 5118 had been raised to an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20006|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20357|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.94 minutes, and 62.8 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a design life of 5 years and a mass of {{convert|758|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; It broadcast the PRN 09 signal in the GPS demonstration constellation, and was retired from service on 6 March 1991.

'''PHASE''' is a partnership between several international non-governmental organisations ([[NGO]]s) registered in Austria, [[Nepal]], the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). The organisations specialise in improving health and education services and livelihood opportunities for disadvantaged populations and most of this work takes place in Nepal. The acronym, PHASE, stands for "Practical Help Achieving Self Empowerment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phaseworldwide.org PHASE Charity website]&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the working ethic of the organisations.

==History==
PHASE was founded in 2005 by a group of friends, united by an interest in working in Nepal. PHASE later established several partnerships and now operates as PHASE Austria,&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|https://phaseaustria.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; PHASE Nepal,&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|https://phasenepal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTTI&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|https://nepaltti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PHASE Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|https://phaseworldwide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PHASE Nepal's work in Nepal==
PHASE Nepal implements community based projects in remote communities in Nepal. The organisation aims to help the most vulnerable in Nepalese villages to make their way out of poverty. PHASE Nepal works with communities and local authorities to build the foundations for a future that does not rely on outside sources of funding. PHASE Nepal has its headquarters in Dadhikot just south of the [[Araniko Highway]] between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phasenepal.org PHASE website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/phasenepal PHASE on Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; During 2017 they received support from and are working with [[Medecins du Monde]] on new health promotion work.

===Activities===
PHASE works with remote Himalayan communities aiming to reduce poverty by improving health, education and improving livelihood opportunities.
* The charity supports primary care in areas that have little or no existing services. They support the Nepali governmental health centres with improved buildings, equipment, medicines and qualified staff. In its first nine years of existence, its health workers saw around 140,000 patients, delivered over 400 babies and built 480 toilets. 
In 2009, PHASE Nepal received a grant from the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) Humanitarian Fund enabling it to publish clinical treatment guidelines for health workers in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prasai
  | first =Renu |author2= Gerda Pohl | title = Simple Treatment Guidelines for Primary Health Care

* PHASE Nepal aims to raise levels of literacy and numeracy to give children and adults more opportunities and choices. PHASE Nepal supports government schools with teaching materials, buildings, salaries for extra teachers, early childhood development programmes and scholarships. Since 2006 PHASE Nepal has supplied 10 schools with safe drinking water and toilets, upgraded 1 school to secondary level so children can pass their School Leaving Exams in their home community, helped 60 children complete a catch-up curriculum and integrate into mainstream school, and enabled 200 women to complete adult literacy classes.
* PHASE Nepal aims to improve income generation opportunities. Between 2006 and 2011 the organisation promoted better fertilising techniques to increase yields and introduced cash crops like vegetables, garlic and spices. PHASE Nepal also runs animal husbandry programmes so families have livestock to sell.

==PHASE Partners==

===PHASE Austria===
PHASE Austria raises funds for various aspects of PHASE Nepal’s work, with an initial focus on the field of education, but more recently also in healthcare and livelihoods.

[[Alex Staniforth]] became an ambassador for PHASE in 2016. Staniforth has twice attempted to conquer [[Mount Everest|Everest]] but was prevented from doing so by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 Nepal earthquake]]. In the aftermath of the disaster, Alex worked with PHASE to raise over £15,000 for the disaster relief fund and helped to organise the 'Walk for Nepal' event on the anniversary of the earthquake in 2016. He has raised over £50,000 in total for [[Nepal]]. In autumn 2016, Alex attempted to climb [[Cho Oyu]], the world's sixth highest mountain as a PHASE ambassador.

==Daylight saving time==
{{Main|Summer Time in Europe}}
Daylight saving time in Russia was originally introduced on 30 June [13 July, {{abbrlink|N.S.|Old Style and New Style dates}}] 1917 by a decree of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. However, it was abandoned by a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] of the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] five months later.

Daylight saving time was re-introduced in the [[USSR]] on 1 April 1981, by a decision of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]]. Daylight saving time began on 1 April and ended on 1 October each year, until mid-1984, when the USSR began following [[European Summer Time|European daylight saving time rules]], moving clocks forward one hour at 02:00 local standard time on the last Sunday in March, and back one hour at 03:00 local daylight time on the last Sunday in September until 1995, after which the change back occurred on the last Sunday in October. The usage of daylight saving time continued after [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|the Soviet collapse]] but ended in 2011, when Russia stopped observing daylight saving time.

On 27 March 2011, clocks were advanced as usual, but they did not go back on 30 October 2011, effectively making Moscow Time [[UTC+04:00]] permanently.&lt;ref name="End to DST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2011/02/08/zimynebudet/ |title=Медведев отменил зимнее время |date= 8 February 2011 |publisher= Lenta.ru |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 October 2014, following another change in the law, the clocks in most of the country were moved back one hour, but summer Daylight Time was not reintroduced; Moscow Time returned to [[UTC+03:00]] permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29773559 Russian clocks go back for last time], [[BBC News]], 25 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Since this reform, most Russian territories have a standard time ahead of [[local mean time|mean solar time]], including some cities which are ahead by a whole hour. For example, [[St.Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] at 30°E [+2h (*solar time)] has [[UTC+03:00]], [[Yekaterinburg]] at 60°E (+4h*) has [[UTC+05:00]], and [[Vladivostok]] at 132°E (+9h*) has [[UTC+10:00]].

==History==

===Russian Empire===
In the [[Russian Empire]], most of the nation observed [[solar time]]. During the late 19th century, Moscow Mean Time was introduced on 1 January [13 January, N.S.] 1880, originally at [[UTC+02:30|GMT+02:30:17]].&lt;ref name=timeandate&gt;[https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/russia/moscow Time Zone in Moscow, Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; 2:30:17 corresponds to 37.6166667°, the longitude of Moscow. Other parts of Russia kept solar time for several years. At this time, Russia had the [[Julian calendar]] with 12 or 13 days less date compared to Western Europe, so it is possible to say the Moscow actually had GMT-285:29:43 (GMT-11d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [12 March, N.S.] 1800 − 28 February [12 March, N.S.] 1900), GMT-309:29:43 (GMT-12d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [13 March, N.S.] 1900 − 3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916) and GMT-309:28:41 (GMT-12d 21h 28m 41s) (3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916 − 31 January [13 February, N.S.] 1918). Russia adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] on Thursday, 14 February 1918, which most of Europe already used.

{{clear}}

===Soviet Union===
After the Soviet Union was created, Moscow Time became [[UTC+02:00|UTC+2]] and the various other time zones (up to UTC+12) were introduced throughout Russia and the rest of the [[Soviet Union]], for example [[Irkutsk Time]] GMT+7 (Irkutsk has since this always been MSK+5).&lt;ref name=timeandate/&gt; Between 1917-1922 the time was less ordered, with daylight savings time some of those years, some with two hours addition, and some of those years with one or two hours extra winter time.&lt;ref name=timeandate/&gt;

{{clear}}

On 21 June 1930, the Soviet Union advanced all clocks by one hour, effectively making the nation run on daylight saving time all year (the so-called [[decree time]]).

{{clear}}

On 1 April 1981, daylight saving time (two hours ahead of standard time) was re-introduced; clocks were moved one hour forward on 1 April (the last Sunday of March since 1985) and one hour back on 1 October (the last Sunday of September since 1984, the last Sunday of October since 1996).&lt;ref name=timeandate/&gt;

{{clear}}

On 1 April 1981, 00:00:00, [[Oymyakonsky District]] changed its time zone from [[MSK+6]] to [[MSK+8]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/ust-nera?year=1981 Clock Changes in Ust-Nera, Russia in 1981]. Timeanddate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+9 to UTC+12, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+9 to UTC+11. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

{{clear}}

On 1 April 1982, 00:00:00, [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] changed its time zone from MSK+10 to [[MSK+9]], thus eliminating Anadyr Time (MSK+10 or UTC+13 without DST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/anadyr?year=1982 Clock Changes in Anadyr, Russia in 1982]. Timeanddate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+14 to UTC+13, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+13 to UTC+12.

{{clear}}

On 27 March 1988, 02:00:00, [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]] and [[Volgograd Oblast|Volgograd]] oblasts changed its time zone from [[MSK+1]] to [[Moscow Time|MSK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/saratov?year=1988 Clock Changes in Saratov, Russia in 1988]. Timeanddate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/volgograd?year=1988 Clock Changes in Volgograd, Russia in 1988]. Timeanddate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+5 to UTC+4, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+4 to UTC+3.

{{clear}}

On 26 March 1989, the following changes were introduced, which, in particular, some oblasts switched to Moscow Time (thus eliminating Samara Time; MSK+1 or UTC+4 without DST):

*[[Astrakhan Oblast]]
*[[Kirov Oblast]]
*[[Kuybyshev Krai]]
*[[Ulyanovsk Oblast]]

Some oblasts switched from Moscow Time to Eastern European Time:

*[[Kaliningrad Oblast]]

{{clear}}

===Russian Federation===
Russia and most republics in the Soviet Union abolished the decree time (not moving the clocks) on 31 March 1991, but Russia reversed this the following year (except Samara Oblast which was already in [[UTC+04:00]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

{{clear}}

On 29 September 1991, 03:00:00, [[Samara Oblast]] changed its time zone from [[Moscow Time|MSK]] to [[MSK+1]] (thus reinstating Samara Time; MSK+1). So the zone boundaries on 20 October, [[Samara Oblast]] changed its time zone from [[UTC+03:00|UTC+3]] to [[UTC+04:00|UTC+4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/samara?year=1991 Clock Changes in Samara, Russia in 1991]. Timeanddate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

On 23 May 1993, 00:00:00, [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] changed its time zone from [[MSK+4]] to [[MSK+3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=375&amp;year=1993 Time changes in year 1993 for Russia – Novosibirsk]. Timeanddate.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+8 to UTC+7, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+7 to UTC+6.

{{clear}}

On 28 May 1995, 00:00:00, [[Altai Krai]] and [[Altai Republic]] changed its time zone from [[MSK+4]] to [[MSK+3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/barnaul?year=1995 Clock Changes in Barnaul, Russia in 1995]. Timeanddate.com.

{{clear}}

On 30 March 1997, 02:00:00, [[Sakhalin Oblast]] changed its time zone from [[MSK+8]] to [[MSK+7]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/russia/yuzhno-sakhalinsk?year=1997 Clock Changes in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia in 1997]. Timeanddate.com.

The following time zone changes occurred on 28 March 2010, which, in particular, led to abolition of two of the eleven time zones.

Although the Russian government wants to reduce the number of time zones even further, there have been protests in far-eastern Russia on the recent changes, including protests and a 20,000-strong petition in support of Kamchatka returning to UTC+12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/russia-protest-timezones.html|title=Thousands Protest Time Zone Changes in Russia|date= 2010-12-13|accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decree No.&amp;nbsp;725&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2011/09/06/chas-zona-dok.html Постановление Правительства Российской Федерации № 725 от 31 августа 2011 г. «О составе территорий, образующих каждую часовую зону, и порядке исчисления времени в часовых зонах, а также о признании утратившими силу отдельных постановлений Правительства Российской Федерации».]&lt;/ref&gt; (31 August 2011) changed UTC offset for Moscow Time and the other time zones. [[Moscow Time|Moscow Time Zone]] now used [[UTC+04:00]] all year around. The notions of [[decree time]] and daylight saving time were abolished in the law, but in fact, this law mandated permanent daylight saving time (or even double daylight saving time in regions that had not abolished the decree time). Some areas changed offset from Moscow:

Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Magadan Time (Zone 9) to Vladivostok Time (from Zone 8):
*[[Oymyakonsky District]]

Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Vladivostok Time (Zone 8) to Yakutsk Time (Zone 7):
*[[New Siberian Islands]]
*[[Tomponsky District]]
*[[Ust-Maysky District]]

As a result of the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], local authorities in the [[Republic of Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]] decreed that clocks in the newly proclaimed Russian [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] should jump ahead two hours at 10 p.m. on 29 March 2014 to switch from [[Eastern European Time]] (UTC+2) to [[Moscow Time]] (UTC+4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_03_29/Crimea-switches-to-Moscow-time-0223/|agency=Voice of Russia|title=Crimea switches to Moscow time|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2014, further changes were passed, which took effect on 26 October 2014. All of Russia moved back one hour, so [[Moscow Time]] became [[UTC+03:00|UTC+3]].

* [[Magadan Oblast]] moved back two hours to UTC+10:00 (went from Magadan Time, MSK+8 to Vladivostok Time, MSK+7)
* The parts of the [[Magadan Time]] zone that remained on MSK+8, were given a new time zone name, [[Srednekolymsk Time]], UTC+11.

==Railway time==
All timetables on [[Russian Railways]] (except [[Sakhalin Railway|Sakhalin]] railways) follow Moscow Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng/express?STRUCTURE_ID=46 Russian Railways – Time tables]&lt;/ref&gt; Airports, however, follow local time.&lt;ref&gt;for example http://www.iktport.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tz Database==
[[File:Tz map russia2009r efeledotnet.png|thumb|right|500px|http://efele.net/maps/tz/russia – data from 2009]]
For Russia, the [[tz database]] contains several zones in the file [[zone.tab]].

===List of zones===
The list below shows the 16 zones for Russia as defined in the file zone.tab of the database. The database aims to identify regions that had the same time offset rules since 1970.

Two [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] are contained in more than one tz zone. The Sakha Republic is divided into three: west, central, east. Sakhalin Oblast is divided into two: [[Sakhalin Island]] with [[Kurilsky District|Kurilsky]] and [[Yuzhno-Kurilsky District|Yuzhno-Kurilsky]] districts in the [[Kuril Islands]], and [[Severo-Kurilsky District]] in the [[Kuril Islands]].

Two zones, namely [[Asia/Omsk]] and [[Asia/Novosibirsk]], each cover area that did not observe the same rule set since 1970, all now using [[Omsk Time]].

On the last Sunday in October 2011, [[daylight-saving time]] ended in tzdata, but all zones moved forward one hour. In other words, the clocks did not change, but the names of the time zones reverted permanently to their standard time variants and there will be no more daylight-saving time. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

If available, the change column lists the offset changes that caused a creation of a new zone in the tz database.

"Initial zone" means that in 1970 there was already a difference in time offset from the offsets in any other zone.

'''WCC''' was the busiest coast station in the public ship-to-shore radio service for most of the 20th century.

==Station history==
In 1914, inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] sought a more permanent solution to his weather-induced radio station woes on [[Cape Cod]]. This need was made manifest by the damage and destruction wrought by nature at his [[Marconi Wireless Station Site (South Wellfleet, Massachusetts)|original 1903 South Wellfleet location]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Chatham Marconi Site Communication Technology on Cape Cod-- WCC-Chatham Radio|url=http://www.chathammarconi.org/HistoryCMMCSite.html|publisher=Chatham Marconi Maritime Center|accessdate=2 March 2014|location=Chatham, MA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623222718/http://www.chathammarconi.org/HistoryCMMCSite.html|archive-date=23 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The erosion and wind damage suffered by Marconi's first Cape Cod station continues to this day. Almost the entirety of the historic station is now long gone over the cliffs onto the beach and into the waters of the Atlantic below. 

[[File:Remains of the Marconi Station in Wellfleet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Remains of the South Wellfleet station's towers as they looked in April 2009]]

Marconi realized that a permanent presence would require a more inland and somewhat sheltered location. So it was that Marconi's [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some History of Marconi in New Jersey|url=http://userpages.monmouth.com/~eroswell/histmarc.htm|work=The Guglielmo Marconi Story|publisher=[http://userpages.monmouth.com/~eroswell/qcwa138.htm Marconi Chapter No. 138 - WA2GM]|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; built his new trans-oceanic [[Marconi-RCA Wireless Receiving Station|receiver station in Chatham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Glen|title=Marconi  and his South  Wellfleet Wireless|url=http://www.nps.gov/caco/historyculture/upload/Marconicolor.pdf|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=2 March 2014|author2=Whatley, Mike }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its companion high power trans-oceanic transmitter station forty miles to the west in [[Marion, Massachusetts]] through a contract with J.G. White Engineering Corp.

In 1920, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America sold the Chatham and Marion stations to the [[Radio Corporation of America]].  RCA removed all remaining Marconi equipment from the Chatham receiver station and converted it to a public coast station for communications with ships at sea.  In 1921 Chatham was licensed under the callsign WCC for communications on 500 kHz, 750 kHz and 1 MHz.  In 1922 RCA moved the WCC radio transmitters to the Marion transmitter station to eliminate co-site interference to the sensitive receivers at Chatham.  In 1929 WCC Marion began operations on maritime HF frequencies (6, 8, 12, 16 and 22 MHz).

In 1948, the WCC marine radio transmitter equipment was moved from Marion Station to RCA's newly built oceanfront transmitter station on Forest Beach Road in [[South Chatham, Massachusetts]].  The U.S. Air Force continued to use the [[Alexanderson alternator]] at Marion Station for weather and other broadcasts to its air base in [[Thule]], Greenland and other arctic locations through 1957 under the callsign AFA2.

In 1951, RCA sold Marion Station to the U.S. Government and the U.S General Services Administration sold it to a private investor in 1960.  Most of the 143 acres that comprised the Marion Station was donated to the Sippican Lands Trust in 1986 and is publicly accessible. [http://www.pbase.com/capecodfish/radio_tower Radio Tower Property]

In 1988, RCA Global Communications sold the WCC stations to Western Union International, a subsidiary of [[MCI Communications]], as part of the breakup of RCA. In 1993 WCC became a remotely controlled station, using fiber optic cable to receive signals, transmit signals and issue such commands such as selecting and rotating directional antennas. Even the keying of Morse Code (CW) and [[Radioteletype]] (RTTY) was issued remotely at this early date in the public internet's infancy.  WCC was operated from [[KPH Radio]] in [[Point Reyes, California]] until its closing.

In 1999, MCI/Worldcom sold the WCC receiver station in Chatham and the transmitter station on Forest Beach Road in South Chatham &amp;mdash; nearly 100 acres in total &amp;mdash; to the town of Chatham for a fraction of their value.

The [[Marconi-RCA Wireless Receiving Station|Chatham receiver station]] is now the [[Chatham Marconi Maritime Center]], and the home of [[amateur radio station]] WA1WCC, licensed to the WCC Amateur Radio Association.  The South Chatham transmitter station is now preserved in its entirely as the Forest Beach Conservation Area by the town of Chatham. [https://www.chatham-ma.gov/conservation/pages/forest-beach-conservation-area]

The callsign '''WCC''' is now used by [http://www.globewireless.com/ Globe Wireless] by a [[Maryland]] station it operates to transmit automated e-mail-by-radio.

Chatham station was the subject of the [[Mooncusser Films]] documentary ''Chatham Radio: WCC the Untold Story'', narrated by [[Walter Cronkite]] and directed by [[Christopher Seufert]].
