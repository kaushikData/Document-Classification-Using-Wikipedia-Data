'''''99Vidas''''' ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] for "99 Lives") is a [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] video game developed and published by QuByte Interactive, inspired by the classics of the genre of the late 1980s and 1990s, such as ''[[Double Dragon]]'', ''[[Final Fight]]'', ''[[Golden Axe]]'', and ''[[Streets of Rage]]''. It was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] in late 2016, followed by [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2017, after a successful [[crowdfunding]] campaign in 2015.&lt;ref name="99Vidas on Catarse (Portuguese)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catarse.me/99vidas |title=99Vidas Crowdfunding on Catarse (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nintendo Switch]] release is planned in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/11/99vidas-definitive-edition-for-switch-launches-november-27|title=99Vidas: Definitive Edition for Switch launches November 27|website=Gematsu|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''99Vidas'' is a side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] featuring six playable characters (with five more unlocked through multiple play sessions, bringing the total number of playable characters to 11), and multiple cooperative and competitive game modes, for up to four players, which can be played either locally or online.

Each character has unique attributes, like speed and strength, as well as an elemental alignment (Fire, Water, Wind, Lightning, et al.), which modify their regular attacks, combos and special moves. Different from more traditional games of the genre, characters gain [[experience point]]s by defeating enemies and collecting special items which can then be used by the player to upgrade their abilities and combos, or even unlock new ones.

=== Game Modes ===
==== Campaign ====
Playable either Online or Locally. Can be played solo or with up to four players cooperatively. Players progress through the story, fighting the enemy forces, in pursuit of the ''99Vidas''.

==== Versus ====
Playable either Online or Locally. Two to four players can play head-to-head competitive matches, until there's only one standing.

==== Survival ====
Playable either Online or Locally. Can be played solo or with up to four players cooperatively. Players face several waves of enemies, with a limited number of lives and an ever-increasing difficulty, for the top spot on the Leaderboards.

== Plot ==
''99Vidas'' is set in a fictional  [[Anachronism|anachronic]] universe, inspired by video games and the pop culture of the 1980s and 1990s. The game begins when an artifact known as ''99Vidas'' goes missing. This artifact is believed to hold such great power it could bring darkness and chaos to our very existence, should it ever fall into the hands of those with evil intents. As the Guardians of the ''99Vidas'', granted the Power of the Elements, bound to live through the ages to protect the artifact, it is your responsibility to face the forces of evil, defeat the Evil Boss and his six henchmen, and retrieve the ''99Vidas''.

== Development ==
The development of ''99Vidas'' started in early 2015 as a project of developer QuByte Interactive in partnership with the Gaming Podcast ''99Vidas''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://99vidas.com.br/equipe-99vidas/ |title= Abount 99Vidas - Official Website (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://br.ign.com/99-vidas/38822/news/99vidas-saiba-tudo-sobre-o-game-que-nasceu-de-um-podcast |title=IGN Brazil interviews 99Vidas Game Designer (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to develop a brand new [[beat 'em up]] that would both pay tribute to the classics of the genre while also updating the gameplay with more modern elements.

Prior to initiating a crowdfunding campaign the developers wanted to have something to show the backers so they could better understand the concept behind the game, so a first  [[game demo|demo]] was developed using  [[Unity game engine|Unity]] featuring hand-drawn sprites and sound samples to emulate the look and feel of the  [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit]]. After the [[game demo|demo]] was completed, the decision to start a crowdfunding campaign&lt;ref name="99Vidas on Catarse (Portuguese)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catarse.me/99vidas |title=99Vidas Crowdfunding on Catarse (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://99vidas.com.br/99vidas-178-99vidas-o-jogo-campanha/ |title= 99Vidas about the Crowdfunding Campaign (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial goal was to raise R$80,000.00  [[BRL|Brazilian Real]] for the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] version of the game. The campaign went on to raise a total of R$127,309.78, enabling the development of the console versions – [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Xbox One]]. Simultaneous to the [[crowdfunding]] campaign the games was also submitted to the [[Steam Greenlight]] process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=portuguese&amp;id=518391940 |title= 99Vidas on Steam Greenlight}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was cleared in less than a week&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://overloadr.com.br/noticias/2015/09/jogo-do-99vidas-e-aprovado-no-steam-greenlight/ |title= Overloadr - 99Vidas Greenlit on Steam (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; following approval by the Steam Community, allowing the developers to [[Self-publishing|self-publish]] the game on the [[Steam (software)|Steam digital marketplace]].

The game was then released on December 22, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://99vidas.com.br/99vidas-250-99vidas-o-jogo-lancamento/ |title= 99Vidas about the Game Release (Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and on July 18, 2017&lt;ref name="Playstation Blog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2017/07/14/the-drop-new-playstation-games-for-7182017/ |title=PS Blog – New Releases: Week of July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://br.ign.com/99-vidas/50810/news/game-99vidas-sera-lancado-para-ps4-ps3-e-ps-vita |title= 99Vidas release date confirmed for PlayStation Platforms - IGN Brazil(Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[PS Store]] for [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]].

{{Use Australian English|date=February 2016}}'''Zone Bowling (AMF Bowling Australia) is the''' group of over 40 AMF bowling centres in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] that was previously operated by [[Ardent Leisure]]. Ardent also operated five Kingpin bowling lounges that have what Ardent calls an "upmarket hip format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leisure Portfolio - Bowling|url=http://www.ardentleisure.com.au/Leisure-Portfolio/Bowling.aspx|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMF Bowling Australia originated as the Australian part of the bowling division of [[American Machine and Foundry]] (AMF). AMF began a joint venture to manufacture [[pinspotter]]s in Australia in 1959 in view of the growing popularity of [[ten-pin bowling]] in the country at the time. By 1964 1,600 bowling lanes existed in Australia, but the popularity of the sport had begun to decline. 

In 1985 a group of private investors in Richmond, Virginia, USA purchased the bowling division of American Machine and Foundry to form [[AMF Bowling|AMF Bowling Companies, Inc.]] (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide).&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=AMF Bowling, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/amf-bowling-inc-history/|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company then bought two major Australian bowling chains to revive interest in bowling. AMF Australia expanded from 16 bowling centres to 30 by 1987, and to over 40 by 2004.

AMF Bowling Worldwide sold its Australian division of to Macquarie Leisure Trust (now known as Ardent Leisure) in February 2005 as part of AMF's strategy at the time to re-focus on its U.S. bowling business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMF Signs Agreement to Sell Its Bowling Centers in Australia |url=http://www.edgewaterfunds.com/ef_news/article/amf_signs_agreement_to_sell_its_bowling_centers_in_australia.htm |accessdate=1 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202154916/http://www.edgewaterfunds.com/ef_news/article/amf_signs_agreement_to_sell_its_bowling_centers_in_australia.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, The Entertainment and Education Group (TEEG) announced that they had purchased the bowling and entertainment division of Ardent Leisure in order to merge it with its [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]] entertainment business, forming a combined entertainment group encompassing Timezone, AMF, Kingpin and Playtime, one of the world’s largest family entertainment centre groups. TEEG operates in six countries with over 250 locations.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|title=The Entertainment and Education Group Acquires Ardent’s Bowling and Entertainment Division|url=http://quadrantpe.com.au/Media-Centre/News/The-Entertainment-and-Education-Group-Acquires-Ard.aspx/|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All AMF bowling centres in Australia were rebranded as Zone Bowling.&lt;ref &gt; {{cite web|title=AMF is now Zone Bowling|url=https://www.amfbowling.com.au|accessdate=28 April 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Centres in New Zealand were rebranded Xtreme Entertainment.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''''Attack Force Z''''' (alternatively titled '''''The Z Men''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/3256/Attack-Force-Z/overview | title=Attack Force Z (1982) | work=[[The New York Times]] | author=AMG | accessdate=9 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1981 Australian-Taiwanese&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Daw-Ming ''Historical Dictionary of Taiwan Cinema'' Scarecrow Press, 8 November 2012, pp. xxxix-xxxx&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War II]] film, directed by [[Tim Burstall]]. It is loosely based on actual events and was filmed in [[Taiwan]] in 1979. It was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 18 May 1981.

The film is noted for starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Sam Neill]], who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite [[Z Special Unit]] against the [[Empire of Japan]] during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit. Its main brief was to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage missions throughout Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.

==Plot==

In the Straits of Sembaleng, five men are dispatched by submarine in [[Klepper canoe]]s to rescue survivors of a shot-down plane on a nearby island which is occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Led by Paul Kelly (Gibson), an inexperienced commando officer, the team secretly lands on the island and hides their kayaks. As they venture in land, Ted 'Kingo' King is hit by fire from an unseen machine gun post, the team quickly eliminates the Japanese defenders and return to their wounded comrade. King has been hit on the leg, the bullet smashing his kneecap. King cannot be allowed to fall into enemy hands and compromise the mission under interrogation, and after sharing a cigarette with him, Costello shoots him. The four remaining men return to their search; coming across a rice farmer, they learn of the area in which the plane crashed. The rice farmer is also killed in order to preserve secrecy.

But as they near their destination they spot a Japanese squad at a local house, after the Japanese leave they enter the house and meet the local resistance leader Lin, his grown up daughter Chien Hua and her younger brothers and sisters. With a guide to lead them, they head off to the plane but are attacked by Japanese soldiers at a Buddhist temple. Separated from the rest, interpreter Jan Veitch ends up returning to Lin's house where Chien Hua hides him from the returning Japanese. After the deaths of their soldiers, the Japanese officers Watanabe and Imanaka torture Chien to tell them the location of her father, who they believe is hiding the survivors of the crashed plane, but Chien Hua refuses. Lin's son Shaw Hu falsely tells the Japanese that Lin, the Z men, and the plane's survivors are heading for the island's capital. All the Japanese leave except for two soldiers guarding Chien Hua; Veitch kills both with help of Shaw Hu.

Meanwhile, within sight of the plane, Kelly watches as locals blow up the wreckage. Lin is evasive, and after quizzing the inhabitants of a village, the team head on to the plane. Kelly manages to get Lin to tell them that the two survivors are being taken to his home, so they turn around and head back. In the capital, Veitch is led to the survivors. One of them is a defecting Japanese government official Imoguchi, and he is believed to hold a secret that could end the war faster. Only Kelly knows that he must be rescued at any cost - or killed. As the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall together, Kelly must persuade his own men that Imoguchi is worth rescuing and the local resistance that it is worth fighting against their Japanese enemies.

==Production==
The script was based on a real-life commando rescue raid, [[Operation Opossum]], where a team of commandos rescued the local sultan on the Japanese-held island of [[Ternate]] near Borneo.&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;Sue Johnson, 'After 37 years and 10 beheadings, Operation Rimau Explodes Again', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 27 March 1982 p 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Exploits of the men of Z Force relived", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 6 March 1981 p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was originally entitled ''The Z Men'' and was to be directed by [[Phillip Noyce]]. Pre production commenced in Taiwan where for six weeks Noyce worked on the script with writer Michael Cove. However, Noyce clashed with the producers - McCallum later claimed in particular that Noyce refused to use one of the Chinese actors who had been cast in a small role&lt;ref name="john"&gt;John McCallum interview with Brian McFarlane, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Film'', Oxford Uni Press, 1999 p 300&lt;/ref&gt; - and was fired the night before shooting was meant to start. He was replaced by [[Tim Burstall]] in November 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film_fact.jsp?id=154796 | title=Attack Force Z | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528055814/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film_fact.jsp?id=154796 | archivedate=28 May 2006 | publisher=[[Channel 4]] | accessdate=9 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p39 &amp; 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming was further delayed by constant rain and re-writing of the script.&lt;ref name="stratton2"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p43&lt;/ref&gt; Among the changes made were adding a fifth character to the team - a soldier played by John Waters who would be killed within the opening ten minutes by one of their own men.&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Tim+Burstall&amp;bl&amp;PHPSESSID=b84a60315abeb35485367633c6533d29 Interview with Tim Burstall, 30 March 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115011440/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Tim+Burstall&amp;bl&amp;PHPSESSID=b84a60315abeb35485367633c6533d29 |date=15 November 2013 }} accessed 14 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Attack Force Z'' was only released theatrically in Australia in Melbourne, where it took $88,000 at the box office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to $256,080 in 2009 dollars. After the film's release, Tim Burstall was quoted as saying;
&lt;blockquote&gt; It sold everywhere, sold all over the world, and it got its money back. And it did perform the task of getting some co-productions going with the East, which was useful and very important. But it's always awful when you take over from somebody else - and Phil is a friend - but he really wanted to do something quite different and I was regarded as much more of a whore, I suppose.&lt;ref name="tim"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mel Gibson later called the film "pretty woeful... it's so bad, it's funny."&lt;ref&gt;"Not just a pretty face In his new movie, Mel debuts as a director -- and puts the hunk on hold", Jay Carr, Globe Staff 22 August 1993 The Boston Globe BSTNGB City Edition B1&lt;/ref&gt;

John McCallum later said he and Robinson wanted to make another film in Asia, about drug running in Thailand "starting from the poppies and the hill factories where they distil the damned suff and send it down to Bangkok"&lt;ref name="john"/&gt; but were not allowed to make it because of the dangers involved in filming in Thailand.

{{copy edit|date=November 2018}}

'''Attentat 1942''' is a 2017 Czech video game that tells the story of the Nazi occupation of [[Czechoslovakia]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] through the eyes of the survivors. The game is built on personal memories, interactive comics, and authentic footage. Characters in the game and their stories are fictional, but they are based on personal testimonies and extensive historical research.

The game was developed by scientists from the [[Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague|Faculty of Arts]] and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of [[Charles University]] and the Institute of Contemporary History of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]]. ''Attentat 1942'' stems from the educational project ''Czechoslovakia 38-89'', but has been enhanced and further developed for the worldwide public. The game was released for [[Windows]] and Mac on the distributional platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on October 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/676630/Attentat_1942/|title=Save 50% on Attentat 1942 on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is available in Czech with English, Russian, and German subtitles and is readily found on several [[Website|websites]].

== Content ==
''Attentat 1942'' is a point-and-click adventure game in which players assume the role of the grandchild of Jindřich Jelínek. They discover that his grandfather was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] shortly after the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], ruler of the Nazi-occupied Czech Lands and leading architect of the Holocaust. The players' goal is to find out the reason why the grandfather was arrested and what role he played in the attack. The players pose questions to the grandmother and other eyewitnesses of those events and slowly discover the story of the family and learn more about life in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]].

== Critical reception ==
The game holds 75% on [[Metacritic]] based on 13 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/attentat-1942|title=Attentat 1942|website=Metacritic|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Attentat 1942 will be a treasure not only for a fresh perspective on a widely reported period of time but also for the amount of work that you can see the developers put into making sure their story fit within the confines of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-attentat-1942-481310.phtml|title=Review: Attentat 1942|work=destructoid|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The game was released worldwide on [[Steam (software)]] on October 2017, except in Germany where it was blocked due to the German practice of not giving ratings to games containing Nazi symbolism. On May 2018, ''Attentat 1942'' won the "Most Amazing Game" Award at the A MAZE festival in Berlin, but the visitors could not play it. They could only watch a censored trailer with no Nazi symbolism included. Meanwhile, the jury played the game behind closed doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JrgFriedrich/20180817/324775/Were_making_the_first_game_that_legally_shows_Nazi_symbols_in_Germany__heres_why_you_should_care.php|title=We're making the first game that legally shows Nazi symbols in Germany – here’s why you should care|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the policy of [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], the authority providing age ratings for video games, was changed and now allows that games with Nazi symbolism to receive age ratings, depending on their individual "social adequacy." ''Attentat 1942'' was therefore released in Germany as the first PC game with Nazi symbolism with the USK age rating received after the policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/326142/Attentat_1942_a_video_game_unavailable_due_to_Nazi_symbolism_finally_released_in_Germany.php|title=Attentat 1942, a video game unavailable due to Nazi symbolism, finally released in Germany|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian Rules Football''' is played by three clubs in Iceland, with the Andspyrnusamband Íslands (Icelandic Australian Football League - IceAFL) being the main league and controlling body for the sport. The IceAFL was founded in 2009, and regular competition commenced in 2010. The league is the world's most northerly Australian Rules Football league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20100514220001958 Iceland's Fosters Premiership kicks off this weekend].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Australian rules football has been played in [[Iceland]] since 20 May 2009, when Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson, who had played in the [[Danish Australian Football League]], placed an ad in a local newspaper and put up flyers at pubs and schools around Reykjavik looking for players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/06/12/no-longer-just-aussie-ex-pats/ AFL spreads its wings thanks to ex-pat efforts].&lt;/ref&gt; A group of seven people gathered that afternoon at the far end of the Reykjavik Pond.
Before the first club was founded in Iceland, a national team, named the Icelandic Ravens, had been assembled for the [[2009 EU Cup Australian rules football|2009 EU Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron Richard|url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20090831205520610 |title=EU Cup 2009 - Team Profiles on |publisher=Worldfootynews.com |date= |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first teams were founded in April 2010 and are known as the Dragons, Eagles and Bulls. The team names come from Iceland's coat of arms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andspyrna.is/about-the-team/saga-asi |title=Saga ASÍ |publisher=Andspyrna.is |date= |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the Giant as the only symbol unaccounted for.

The current (2017) president is Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson.

== Clubs ==
There are three clubs currently playing Australian Rules Football in Iceland. They play each other in the nine-a-side IceAFL league. The league was founded in 2009 by Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson, who is the current league president. In its inaugural year 2010, the IceAFL league was named the IceAFL Fostersleague after its main sponsor.

'''The Bulls'''

'''The Dragons'''

The Dragons were founded by Jón Zophoníasson, who captained and coached the team until after the European Championships 2010, when Viðar Valdimarsson took over as coach. In the spring of 2012 the Dragons moved north to Akureyri and are currently (summer of 2012) managed by Sölvi Fannar Sigmarsson, and coached by Jón Hrói Finnsson.

'''The Eagles'''

The Eagles were founded by national team captain and league founder Friðgeir Torfi Ásgeirsson.&lt;ref name="worldfootynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ec1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aflcommunityclub.com.au/index.php?id=51&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=72&amp;cHash=7733edebbf&lt;/ref&gt;

After losses to hosts Denmark and Great Britain, Iceland defeated Finland before losing to Croatia, and ultimately finished in sixth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec2010.info/match-reports/46-finals-5po-croatia-vs-iceland |title=Finals - 5PO - Croatia vs Iceland |publisher=Ec2010.info |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105074710/http://www.ec2010.info/match-reports/46-finals-5po-croatia-vs-iceland |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 Euro Cup, after losing against Norway in the Euro Plate final, they ended up in overall 14th place.

The '''Beijing National Aquatics Center''' ({{zh|t=北京國家游泳中心|s=北京国家游泳中心|p=Běijīng guójiā yóuyǒng zhōngxīn|altname=Beijing National Aquatics Center}}), also officially known as the '''National Aquatics Center''',&lt;ref&gt;Official Olympics Site [http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/nac/index.shtml National Aquatics Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809120236/http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/nac/index.shtml |date=August 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and colloquially known as the '''Water Cube''' ({{zh|s=水立方|altname=Water Cube}}), is an aquatics center that was built alongside [[Beijing National Stadium]] in the [[Olympic Green]] for the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|swimming competitions of the 2008 Summer Olympics]].  Despite its nickname, the building is not an actual cube, but a [[cuboid]] (a rectangular box). Ground was broken on December 24, 2003, and the Center was completed and handed over for use on January 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/nac/headlines/n214241273.shtm National Aquatics Center Delivered for Use]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Beijing 2008 Olympics Official Web Site, January 1, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; Swimmers at the Water Cube [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Records broken|broke 25 world records]] during the 2008 Olympics.&lt;ref name="Reid_2008_08_18"&gt;{{cite web|title=25 world records broken at Beijing's Water Cube |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26268614/ |date=August 18, 2008 |author=Scott M.

==Architecture==
In July 2003 the Water Cube design was chosen from 10 proposals in an international [[architectural design competition|architectural competition]] for the aquatic center project.&lt;ref name=Arup&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Water Cube was specially designed and built by a [[consortium]] made up of [[PTW Architects]] (an Australian [[architecture firm]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptw.com.au/ptw_project/watercube-national-swimming-centre/|title=Water Cube - National Swimming Centre|work=PTW Architects|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] international engineering group, CSCEC ([[China State Construction Engineering Corp]]oration), and CCDI ([[China Construction Design International]]) of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Welcome &gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/may/06/research.science1 Welcome to WaterCube, the experiment that thinks it's a swimming pool] by Peter Rogers in The Guardian, May 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Water Cube's design was initiated by a team effort: the Chinese partners felt a square was more symbolic to Chinese culture and its relationship to the [[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest]] stadium, while the Sydney-based partners came up with the idea of covering the 'cube' with bubbles, symbolising water. Contextually the cube symbolises earth whilst the circle (represented by the stadium) represents heaven. Hence symbolically the water cube references Chinese symbolic architecture.

Comprising a steel [[space frame]], it is the largest [[ETFE]]-clad structure in the world with over 100,000 m² of ETFE pillows that are only 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm (1/125 of an inch) in total thickness.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov06-84.85"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=arup.com | title=Best of What's New 2006 &amp;ndash; Engineering | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2006/product_41.html | page=84&amp;ndash;85 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ETFE [[cladding (construction)|cladding]], supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], allows more light and heat penetration than traditional glass, resulting in a 30% decrease in energy costs.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov06-84.85"/&gt;

The outer wall is based on the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], a structure devised from the [[Patterns in nature|natural pattern]] of bubbles in soap lather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7069401.stm Beijing venues &amp;ndash; National Aquatics Center], on BBC Sports.&lt;/ref&gt; In the true Weaire-Phelan structure the edge of each cell is curved in order to maintain 109.5 degree angles at each vertex (satisfying [[Plateau's rules]]), but of course as a structural support system each beam was required to be straight so as to better resist axial [[compression (physical)|compression]]. The complex Weaire–Phelan pattern was developed by slicing through bubbles in soap foam, resulting in more irregular, organic patterns than foam bubble structures proposed earlier by the scientist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]].&lt;ref name=" Welcome" /&gt;  Using the Weaire–Phelan [[geometry]], the Water Cube's exterior cladding is made of 4,000 ETFE bubbles, some as large as {{convert|9.14|m}} across, with seven different sizes for the roof and 15 for the walls.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal

==2008 Olympics==
The Aquatics Center hosted the swimming, diving, and [[synchronized swimming]] events during the Olympics.  [[Water polo]] was originally planned to be hosted in the venue but was moved to the [[Ying Tung Natatorium]].

Many people believed the Water Cube to be the fastest [[Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic pool]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93478073|title=China's Olympic Swimming Pool: Redefining Fast|date=August 10, 2008|work=NPR|first1=Howard|last1=Berkes|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world.  It is 1.314 meters deeper than most Olympic pools. The [[London Aquatics Centre|London 2012 Aquatics Centre]] is the same depth, which leads many to believe the London pool is as fast as, if not faster than, the Beijing pool. Up to a certain limit, beyond which swimmers will lose their sense of vision, deeper pools allow the waves to dissipate to the bottom, leading to less water disturbance to the swimmers.  The pool also has perforated gutters on both sides to absorb the waves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

After the Olympics, the Water Cube was opened to the public on select days of the week beginning in June 2009, and was also used as the site for a production of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' amongst other shows. On October 19, 2009, the Water Cube was closed to the public to begin a massive renovation of a portion of the complex into a [[water park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/BeijingInformation/BeijingNewsUpdate/t1089220.htm|title=Water Cube will close for renovation from October 15|work=eBeijing, the Official Website of the Beijing Government|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building reopened on August 8, 2010, marking the second anniversary of the beginning of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The redesigned facility contains numerous water rides and slides, a wave pool, and spa areas.

'''''Blitzkrieg 2''''' ({{lang-ru|Блицкриг II|italic=yes}}) is a [[real-time tactics]] computer game based on the events of [[World War II]], the game is an evolution of its predecessor ''[[Blitzkrieg (video game)|Blitzkrieg]]'' and is the second title in the [[Blitzkrieg (video game series)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/blitzkrieg-2/|title=Blitzkrieg 2|website=[[GamesRadar]]|date=September 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] and [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]], and features the 6 different factions portrayed in the game that fought in their battle respective grounds during the war.

==Gameplay==
As its predecessor and the similar ''[[Sudden Strike]] ''games, ''Blitzkrieg 2 ''focuses on the battles of [[World War II]] rather than [[real-time strategy]] aspects like base building and resource extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blitzkrieg-ii-updated-impressions-whats-new/1100-6127480/|title=Blitzkrieg II Updated Impressions - What's New|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 14, 2005|author=Andrew Park|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features many new features and units over its predecessor; the graphics engine is upgraded, allowing for full 3D and the game features over 250 units compared to ''Blitzkrieg'''s 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blitzkrieg-ii-demo-offers-three-offensives/1100-6132533/|author=Tim Surette|title=Blitzkrieg II demo offers three offensives|website=GameSpot|date=September 2, 2005|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Blitzkrieg 2, you can choose from three separate campaigns: The Nazi German Campaign, the American Campaign, and the Soviet Campaign, each divided into four distinct chapters. The German campaign begins in France, 1940, where you are put in command of German offensive forces in an effort to [[Battle of France|conquer France]]. Here, you may use the signature [[Blitzkrieg]] strategy. The second chapter is set in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], which ends with your [[Siege of Tobruk|capture of Tobruk]]. The third is in the Soviet Union, during [[Case Blue]]. And finally, the fourth chapter is staged in the [[Ardennes]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], 1944. The American campaign has its first 3 chapters in the [[Pacific Theater (World War II)|Pacific theater]], where you lead your forces against the IJA ([[Imperial Japanese Army]]) and IJN ([[Imperial Japanese Navy]]) in a number of missions beginning shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The final chapter of the American campaign is in the German [[Ruhr]], 1945. The Soviet Campaign begins shortly after [[Operation Barbarossa]], going through the 5 years of the war against Germany eventually ending with your capture of the German capital of [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. At the end of each campaign, a short cinematic plays.

The game contains six factions:
*[[Nazi Germany|Germany]]
*[[Soviet Union]]
*[[United Kingdom]]
*[[Empire of Japan|Japan]]
*[[United States]]
*[[French Third Republic|France]]
Japan was newly added for ''Blitzkrieg 2 ''for the new Pacific theatre, however, it had previously made a minor appearance in Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder. The game also includes an encyclopedia of all units, so you can easily read about the units you get to see in-game. There is an online version of this at the [http://www.blitzkrieg2.de/index.php?page=blitz2-10-2 ''Blitzkrieg 2 ''website].

The game has relatively low [[system requirements]] considering its graphics and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamesystemrequirements.com/games.php?id=680 Blitzkrieg 2 System Requirements] Retrieved January 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game received positive reviews before release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blitzkrieg-ii-e3-2005-impressions/1100-6126177/|author=Matthew Rorie|title=Blitzkrieg II E3 2005 Impressions|website=GameSpot|date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet never achieved the same long lived success its predecessor had achieved, even though two expansions and numerous spin offs were made.

A '''box house''' was a combination of low-class theater and [[brothel]], found in western [[North America]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It offered light entertainment "such as magic acts, singing, dancing, [[minstrel show]]s," as well as sexual services.&lt;ref name=neighborhoods&gt;[http://web1.seattle.gov/dpd/historicalsite/QueryResult.aspx?ID=-32030428 Summary for 423 2nd Ave Extension / Parcel ID 5247800595], Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed online 19 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Box houses were an antecedent of American [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Cullen &amp; Florence Hackman, ''Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'', Routledge (2006). {{ISBN|0-415-93853-8}}. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning ==
[[Murray Morgan]] describes a box house as "a saloon with a theater attached," which "competed with establishments offering even rougher entertainment."&lt;ref name=Morgan-119&gt;Morgan 1960, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of [[Seattle]]'s box houses in the wide-open [[Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington|"restricted district"]] below Yesler Way were located in basements and operated only in the dry season, because they flooded in the wet winter. Others were built over the [[tideflats]] and would dump over-rowdy customers into the water through trap doors.&lt;ref name=Morgan-119 /&gt;

Morgan quotes a contemporary article in ''Coast Magazine'' describing the Theater-Comique, a typical box house:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A nervous [[opium]]-eating individual was hammering away at a piano. … Not a woman was to be seen in the row of seats…  Around the sides of the room and at the end opposite the stage were built out of thin pine boards apartments with an opening toward the platform and a barn-like door leading into the narrow passageway along the wall. In each room was an electric torch button which communicated with a bar set up behind the stage. The boxes were unlighted… In these boxes were women, one in some, more in others. … Women with dresses [reaching] nearly to the point above their knees, with stained and sweaty tights, with bare arms and necks uncovered halfway to their waists&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed writer for ''Coast Magazine'' some time in the 1890s, quoted in Morgan 1960, p. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the box houses were not as "low" as this: at least one, run by a supposedly titled Englishman featured women in evening gowns and humor at the level of the ''[[double entendre]]''.&lt;ref name=Morgan-119 /&gt; The "king" of Seattle's box houses was [[John Considine (Seattle)|John Considine]], originally an actor, who raised the level of entertainment and eventually became a pioneer of vaudeville.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1960, p. 120–128, 144 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Video Streaming Service/Site aggregators are services that scan across multiple video streaming sites to make it easier to find Movies and/or TV shows and where they are available to stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/reelgood-helps-cord-cutters-find-track-and-watch-content-from-across-streaming-services/|title=Reelgood helps cord cutters find, track and watch content from across streaming services|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=17 July 2017|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/05/justwatch-debuts-a-new-search-engine-for-cord-cutters/|title=JustWatch Debuts A New Search Engine For Cord Cutters|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=5 February 2015|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/streaming-media/sites-that-help-you-find-streaming-shows/|title=Sites That Help You Find Streaming Shows|last=|first=|date=11 September 2018|newspaper=Consumer Reports|access-date=2018-09-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/reelgood-debuts-a-hub-for-finding-tv-and-movies-across-streaming-services/|title=Reelgood debuts a hub for finding TV shows and movies across streaming services|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=21 November 2016|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/got-hulu-netflix-need-app-search/|title=Got Hulu and Netflix?

These sites do not host the content but instead provide links to the service provider sites, directly to the movie or show page in many instances. Search results may also include DVD,Blu-Ray, or digital purchase/rent links, links to facilitate obtaining theater tickets, or to see ratings and reviews from other sites. Registering with these sites is usually not required although doing so can provide additional functionality such as personalized Watchlists, price tracking, and customized/saved searches. Some of these sites also have mobile apps.

'''Compulsion Games Inc.''' is a Canadian [[video game development]] company known for ''[[Contrast (video game)|Contrast]]'' and ''[[We Happy Few (video game)|We Happy Few]]''. Its headquarters are located in an old gramophone factory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://area.autodesk.com/life-in-3d/we-happy-few/|title=Compulsion Games {{!}} Life in 3D {{!}} AREA by Autodesk|website=Area by Autodesk|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. In 2018, it was acquired by [[Microsoft]].

== History ==
Compulsion Games was founded in 2009 by Guillaume Provost;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ca.linkedin.com/in/gprovost|title=Guillaume Provost Linkedin Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously he had worked for  companies such as [[Arkane Studios]] in France.

Provost decided to start his own business and recruited within an old [[Phonograph|gramophone]] factory a team including Alex Epstein (narrative director) and Whitney Clayton (art director). The team's previous experiences range from working with [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] on ''[[The Orange Box]]'' to [[Ubisoft]] with ''[[Far Cry 3]]''. To raise money for ''[[Contrast (video game)|Contrast]]'', their first game, the team worked on projects such as ''[[Darksiders]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Daggerdale]]'', Bagelburg: The Bagelening, and even ''Arthur Christmas: Elf Run'' for [[iOS]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://egmr.net/2013/01/interview-compulsion-games-on-contrast-an-intriguing-game-of-light-and-shadow/|title=Interview: Compulsion Games On Contrast, An Intriguing Game Of Light And Shadow  - #egmr|date=2013-01-28|newspaper=#egmr|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[E3 2018]], Microsoft announced they entered into an agreement to acquire Compulsion Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/10/microsoft-game-studios-just-added-five-new-studios-including-ninja-theory/|title=Microsoft Game Studios just added five new studios including Ninja Theory|date=June 10, 2018|accessdate=June 10, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610210145/https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/10/microsoft-game-studios-just-added-five-new-studios-including-ninja-theory/|archivedate=June 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
The team has produced two games, ''[[Contrast (video game)|Contrast]]'' and ''[[We Happy Few (video game)|We Happy Few]]''.

=== ''Contrast'' (2013) ===

''[[Contrast (video game)|Contrast]]'' was a [[PlayStation 4]] launch title.  The central theme of the title is the care for children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compulsiongames.com/en/2/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Compulsion Games|website=Compulsion Games|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a twilight adventure suspended in [[Belle Époque]] magics and [[Art Nouveau]] aesthetics, with a [[film noir]] atmosphere and haunting soundtrack (''Shadow Music: A Soundtrack to Contrast''). ''Contrast'' is set in the 1920s, blending influences from the 1920s [[Burlesque]] and [[Vaudeville]] era with some more classic film-noir elements from the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/contrast/b/pc/archive/2013/04/04/diving-in-and-out-of-shadows.aspx|title=Contrast Preview: Diving In And Out Of Shadows|website=Game Informer|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl, Didi, who has the power to turn into her own shadow. She can do this any time, provided there is a lit area where Dawn's shadow can be seen. The original gameplay is based on the interplay of shadows and lights; Dawn has the ability to transit from the colorful 3D world of the streets of [[Paris]] into the two-dimensional world of shadows, flattening herself on the walls of buildings or rooms. The player can face unusual 2D platform levels, provided the presence of favorable sources of light that can be moved to solve the puzzles. Provost worked with [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] around the time that the original video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' was released, and was inspired by how the ''[[Portal (video game series)|Portal]]'' series encouraged people to think about space in different ways. The idea of 2D shadow/3D world interaction came to him in a coffee shop in France, and seemed to be a great way of exploring new puzzle mechanics. The film noir world, and the narrative, flowed from this concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== ''We Happy Few'' (2018) ===

''[[We Happy Few (video game)|We Happy Few]]'' is a "cheerful" dystopia set in a fictional English city, Wellington Wells, which is inspired by the psychedelic [[London]] of the '60s. It is about a [[retrofuturistic]]-fashioned society formed following an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]] of events within [[World War II]], which is on the [[Societal collapse|verge of collapse]] in the mid-1960s. The residents of the city, seeking to forget an unspeakable horror they committed, began taking a [[hallucinogen]]ic drug called "Joy" that makes them happy, but also leaves them easily controlled and lacking morality and understanding of anything else. Players will control one of three characters in the full release, who becomes dubbed as a "Downer" after choosing to stop using Joy, and must try to survive long enough to complete something important and personal to themselves, all while trying to escape the city before the impending social collapse. Played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], the game combines role-playing, survival, and light [[roguelike]] elements, with the developers focusing on creating a story with strong narratives, gameplay underlined by a sense of paranoia, and decisions having moral gray areas and weight that influence and affect later parts of the game. This peculiar mix of laughter and dystopia, another "contrast" after the lights and shadows of the previous title, is inspired by the film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' by [[Terry Gilliam]], in turn inspired by the quintessential dystopian novel, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In the first trailers, traces of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' can be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insidetherift.net/art/2016/8/19/interview-with-alex-epstein-of-compulsion-games|title=Interview With Alex Epstein, Narrative Director at Compulsion Games.|newspaper=Inside the Rift|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic style resembles ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' because Compulsion Games seems particularly linked to the [[Art Deco]] style, also present in ''Contrast''. The world of We Happy Few is procedurally generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024239/You-Look-Smashing-Procedural-Art|title=GDC Vault - You-Look-Smashing-Procedural-Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company filmed a video to present the game to the masses. It explains the lore, reveals some characters, such as Percy and Uncle Jack, and teases the adapted alternate history setting of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-cube/why-we-happy-few-is-the-most-promising-game-of-2016-df636f9e9092|title=Why We Happy Few is the Most Promising Game of 2016 – The Cube|last=Hage|first=Zack|date=2015-12-29|website=Medium|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upcoming Title (TBA) ===

Compulsion Games' third video game will be the first video game developed and published exclusively for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] platforms ever since the announcement by Phil Spencer the head of [[Microsoft Studios]] that Compulsion Games was purchased by the [[Microsoft Corporation]] at the 2018 Xbox Electronic Entertainment Expo Event in the city of Los Angeles in June 2018.

Sponsorships with racing teams can be earned by playing through the game and completing challenges. When a sponsor is earned a new paint [[livery]] is unlocked for the player to customize their stock car with. Players can have up to five different saved cars, and each car can feature a different paint scheme and sponsorship. The sponsorship benefits are cosmetic only. Matthew Newman, Producer at Piranha Games stated that the game "is not a [[racing simulation|simulation]], we chose to let the player unlock all the sponsors and race for whichever sponsor they choose in single player and multi player."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-19802-Days-of-Thunder-NASCAR-Edition-Sponsorship-Details.html |publisher=Gamer's Daily News |title=Days of Thunder NASCAR Edition Sponsorship Details |author=Video Game News Staff |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition'' was announced for the PlayStation 3 on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/days-thunder-nascar-edition-announced |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=June 11, 2010 |title=Days of Thunder: Nascar Edition Announced for PS3 |first=Kat |last=Bailey |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox 360 ''Arcade'' version was announced on October 27, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/days-thunder-arcade-headed-xbla-winter |publisher=1UP.com |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |title=Days of Thunder: Arcade Headed to XBLA This Winter |first=Chris |last=Pereira}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with producer Jeff Dickson, the history behind the game was revealed. The game was created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ''Days of Thunder'' film. The ''NASCAR Edition'' is intended to be a union of NASCAR and the film, and features drivers from the movie as well as NASCAR drivers from the past and present ([[Hendrick Motorsports]] was actively involved in the film during 1989 and 1990 filmings, providing cars and technical support; also the film's storyline was based on a former Hendrick driver).&lt;ref name="machinima interview" /&gt; Both versions of the game were designed with arcade-based gameplay. During development trailers fictional drivers had liveries coinciding with Paramount Pictures and ''Days of Thunder'', as well as other Paramount Pictures films such as ''[[Top Gun]]'', ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.&lt;ref name="trailer"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ve3d.ign.com/videos/61509/PC/DUPLICATE-SEE-Days-of-Thunder-NASCAR-Edition/Gameplay/Debut-Gameplay-Movie |title=Days of Thunder - Debut Gameplay Movie |publisher=IGN |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |date=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At release only the ''Days of Thunder'', Paramount Pictures, and other fictional racing liveries/sponsors remained.&lt;ref name="the game"&gt;{{cite video game | title=Days of Thunder | developer=Piranha Games |publisher=Paramount Digital Entertainment |date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Rooker]] returns to voice the character Rowdy Burns in the game.&lt;ref name="the game" /&gt;

When asked why the game would not be a simulation, Dickson replied, "Well, we wanted to stay away from that because the games that are out there that do that do it well."&lt;ref name="machinima interview" /&gt; Developer Piranha Games wanted to ensure that players spent most of their time on the track, so aside from visual modifications, the ability to customize cars is limited. "We don't want you to spend lots of time outside the game, we want you on the race track," stated Dickson.&lt;ref name="machinima interview" /&gt; The AI drivers in the game were designed to adapt to the player's typical racing style. "If you're kind of an aggressive driver, they're gonna drive aggressive against you," Dickson remarked.&lt;ref name="machinima interview" /&gt; The game was released exclusively in North American regions for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2011,&lt;ref name="psn release date"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/988391-days-of-thunder-nascar-edition/data |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |title=Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition Release Information for PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the Xbox 360 on February 25, 2011.&lt;ref name="xbla release"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://majornelson.com/archive/2011/02/25/arcade-days-of-thunder-arcade.aspx |publisher=[[Larry Hryb|Major Nelson]]'s blog |first=Larry |last=Hryb |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |title=Arcade: Days of Thunder:Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retail version of the PlayStation 3 version was bundled with the Blu-ray of the namesake movie, released on June 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |date=June 4, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/04/days-of-thunder-top-gun-movie-and-game-hybrid-blu-rays-coming/ |title=Days of Thunder/Top Gun movie and game hybrid Blu-rays coming}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portable version developed by [[Freeverse]] was initially released for [[iOS]] on February 5, 2009 .

''Days of Thunder'' received very little critical reception, with only one review published for the PlayStation 3 ''NASCAR Edition'' and very few published for the Xbox 360 ''Arcade'' version. Of the reviews published critics gave generally negative reviews. The PlayStation 3 version single [[GameRankings]] score comes from the reviewer from PSNStores, who gave the game a 3/5.&lt;ref name="gr ps3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps3/988391-days-of-thunder-nascar-edition/articles.html |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |title=Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition Reviews and Articles for PlayStation 3 |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic gave high marks for the PlayStation 3 version's inclusion of real-world NASCAR drivers, but was disappointed in the lack of customization.&lt;ref name="psnstores review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psnstores.com/review/review-days-of-thunder-nascar-edition/ |author=Brad T |title=Review: Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two scores were reported at GameRankings for the Xbox 360 version, from the US and UK editions of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''.

Scott Ellison of Saving Content panned the PlayStation 3 version of the game. He stated "simply put, do not buy this game."&lt;ref name="savingcontent review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.savingcontent.com/2011/03/days-of-thunder-arcade-review/ |first=Scott |last=Ellison II |accessdate=March 25, 2011 |date=March 2011 |publisher=Saving Content |title=Days of Thunder: Arcade Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Melton of XBLA Fans agreed. He felt that with a [[Patch (computing)|title update]] the game could improve, but that it felt "like it was a [[Independent contractor|contract job]]."&lt;ref name="xblafans review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xblafans.com/days-of-thunder-arcade-review-xbla-8181.html |accessdate=March 25, 2011 |date=March 5, 2011 |first=Steve |last=Melton |publisher=XBLAFans |title=Days of Thunder Arcade review (XBLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle physics and handling were particular points of negative commentary. Ellison said that "the cars feel as if they don’t have any weight to them."&lt;ref name="savingcontent review" /&gt; Melton concurred and added that the handling was overly sensitive. "Sneeze and the car’ll be in the wall", he stated.&lt;ref name="xblafans review" /&gt; Melton did concede that the steering could be adjusted in the game's options, but that the default configuration would dissuade most players from even looking there.&lt;ref name="xblafans review" /&gt; In the May 2011 issue of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' the game also received extremely poor reception. The reviewer stated "Do yourself a favor: stay as far away from this wreck as possible."&lt;ref&gt;"Official Xbox Magazine" May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Levi Buchanan of [[IGN]] scored the iOS version of the game much higher than the average on other platforms. He stated that "''Days of Thunder'' succeeds as both a silly and serious game."&lt;ref name="ign iphone review" /&gt; He further noted that the game's many cars and tracks gave it lasting appeal on the iPhone.&lt;ref name="ign iphone review" /&gt;

'''''Digimon''''' ({{lang|ja|デジモン}} ''Dejimon'', branded as '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters''''', stylized as '''''DIGIMON'''''), short for "Digital Monsters" ({{lang|ja|デジタルモンスター}} ''Dejitaru Monsutā''), is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing [[digital pet|virtual pet]] toys, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[video game]]s, [[film]]s and a [[trading card game]]. The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a "[[Virtual world|Digital World]]", a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various communication networks.

The franchise was first created in 1997 as a [[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|series of virtual pets]], akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary [[Tamagotchi]] or nano [[Giga Pet]] toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American [[comics]]. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', and an early video game, ''[[Digimon World]]'', both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and [[List of Digimon video games|the video game series]] has expanded into genres such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[racing game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]]. Other media forms have also been released.

==Eponymous creatures==
Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs|デジタマ|Dejitama}}. In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a {{nihongo|Digimental|デジメンタル|Dejimentaru}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called "Digivolution" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as ''Ultra'' in the dub.

===Television series===

The ''Digimon'' [[anime]] series was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made, which later became the basis for ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''. Several more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies. The series was dubbed for release in Western markets, with the first four series under the title ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.

===Distribution and localization===

In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcast through [[Fox Kids]]. The first four series were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters Episode Guide|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010615125822/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|archivedate=2001-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's [[standards and practices]]. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw ''Digi-Bowl'' specials co-produced with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]; ''NFL on Fox'' commentator [[Terry Bradshaw]] provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters: Digibowl 2002|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020123021428/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|archivedate=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during ''[[Digimon Tamers|Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 3)]]'', the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]] due to a deal between Disney and UPN.&lt;ref name="erickson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003, Volume 1|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|authorlink1=Hal Erickson (author)|year=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=|isbn=978-0786420995 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UPN]] aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney.&lt;ref name="erickson"/&gt; ''Frontier'' aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and [[Toon Disney]] (for the latter under the [[Jetix]] branding) for several years after. ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor [[Disney XD]]. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Xros Wars]]''. [[Funimation Entertainment]] has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''.

In September 2012, [[Saban Brands]] announced it had re-acquired the ''Digimon'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Deborah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Brand|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/sep/25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Franchise|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-franchise|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=AnimeNewsNetwork|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Brand|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=BSCKids|date=September 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234026/http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Saban acquired ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' for broadcast on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States starting September 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |title=Nickelodeon dives into Digimon &amp;#124; News |publisher=C21Media |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416084142/http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |archivedate=2013-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three episodes, the show was moved to [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] starting October 13, 2013.

''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and its two sequels, ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', were added to the [[Netflix]] Instant Streaming service in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles. [[Crunchyroll]] began streaming the English-subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, followed by the second season on March 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-02/crunchyroll-to-stream-digimon-xros-wars-anime|title=Crunchyroll to Stream Digimon Xros Wars Anime|work=Anime News Network|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'', and ''Tamers'' were briefly removed from Netflix.

In Canada, the English versions were broadcast on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], but only the first 26 episodes of ''Digimon Fusion'' were shown. The dubbed version of ''Data Squad'' aired on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]]. In the United Kingdom, ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s children's slot [[CITV]] from 2001-2002, which broadcast ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' and a small amount of ''Tamers'' airing during after school hours. The entirety of ''Tamers'' aired on cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] from 2002–04. ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' was originally announced on Jetix but was later dropped. The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://mailchi.mp/30f437a59d09/aw-slate&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2011, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on [[Kix!]] (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids's (2000–03) and Kix's (2010-) [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] Television ratings, ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' &amp; ''Tamers'' have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing Data Top 10s|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10?|publisher=BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board)|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by [[ITV Studios#ITV Studios Global Entertainment|ITV Studios Global Entertainment]], Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, [[CITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Michelle|title=ITV to broadcast Digimon Fusion anime in 2014|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2013101730346/itv-to-broadcast-digimon-fusion-anime-in-2014.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Jeremy|title=ITV licenses Digimon Fusion|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/10/18/itv-licenses-digimon-fusion/|publisher=Kidsscreen|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manga==
Digimon first appeared in [[narrative]] form in the [[One shot (comic)|one-shot]] manga ''[[C'mon Digimon]]'', released in the summer of 1997. ''C'mon Digimon'' spawned the popular ''[[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]]'' manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.

===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===
A Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (余 遠鍠 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers ''Digimon Adventure'' in five volumes, ''Digimon Adventure 02'' in two, ''Digimon Tamers'' in four, and ''Digimon Frontier'' in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote ''[[D-Cyber]]''.

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by [[Chuang Yi]] in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by [[Lianne Sentar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liannesentar.com/works/ |title=Lianne Sentar's Other Published Works/Works List |publisher=Liannesentar.com |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[TOKYOPOP]] in [[North America]].&lt;br&gt;The three volumes for ''Digimon Frontier'' have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of ''Digimon Frontier'' were distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia.

===Dark Horse===
{{main|Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] published American-style Digimon [[comic book]]s, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of ''Digimon Adventure'' in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horn | first = Daniel |author2=Ryan Hill | others = illustrated by Daniel Horn, Cara L. Niece | title = Digimon: Digital Monsters | year = 2001 | publisher = Dark Horse Comics | isbn = 1-56971-516-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panini===
The Italian publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.

'''''Dr. Dolittle 3''''' is a 2006 American [[comedy film|family comedy film]]. It stars [[Kyla Pratt]], the original daughter in the [[remake]] series, as Maya.

Starring alongside her are [[Kristen Wilson (actress)|Kristen Wilson]] as Lisa Dolittle and [[Norm Macdonald]] as the voice of Lucky the Dog. This is the third film in the ''Dr. Dolittle'' series, and the first film not to feature [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Doctor Dolittle]], or [[Raven-Symoné]] as Charisse Dolittle, although they are mentioned in the film.

==Plot==
{{Anchor|Synopsis}} 
Maya has evolved considerably from the [[Dr. Dolittle (film)|first film]]. Though she was then an antisocial individual more interested in her science projects, Maya has transformed into the typical teenager. Like her sister Charisse, she inherits their father John's capacity for communicating with fauna (she is a part-time veterinary assistant), her life is turned upside down on all fronts. She routinely lands in trouble with her parents, while her friends think she's gone crazy.

With John away on animal expeditions, Maya's mother Lisa sends her (with Lucky following along) to a [[ranch]] named "Durango", so she can find herself. The ranch is owned by Jud ([[John Amos]]), and his son Bo ([[Walker Howard]]). While there, Maya, who desperately tried to keep it under wraps so as not to arouse suspicion, uses her talent to "talk to the animals" in order to save Durango from being taken over by a neighboring ranch.

Maya is at first reluctant to reveal her ability, fearing rejection from her friends, but eventually does so. With her help, the Durango ranch enters a rodeo competition with a $50,000 award, and wins it. Also, she shares her first kiss with Bo and finally wins his heart.

==Reception==
Although a relative success in sales, the film was not well received by critics.

Of the two reviews given at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], both were very negative:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr._dolittle_3 Dr. Dolittle 3 {{!}} Rottentomatoes]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one critic, Scott Weinberg, said "Cheap-looking, atrociously written, and delivered with all the energy of a breach-birth bovine, Dr. Dolittle 3 is all kinds of terrible." David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com described the film as "not so much poorly made as it is lazy and cheap."

'''Dust Racing 2D''' (dustrac) is an [[open-source software|open-source]], tile-based 2D racing game developed by Jussi Lind. The [[source code]] is licensed under [[GNU GPLv3]].

== Gameplay== 
The purpose of the game is to race against eleven challenging computer players on different race tracks. Finishing in TOP 6 will unlock a new race track. Only a small portion of the race track is visible on the scrolling screen. There's also an option for a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] two player game. Dust Racing 2D comes with a [[level editor]] that makes creating new race tracks easy.

== History ==
''Dust Racing 2D'' was inspired by [[Super Cars]] and [[Slicks ’n’ Slide]]. The game was built by Jussi Lind on [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] development framework and it uses [[OpenGL]] for graphics. Due to the source availability it is possible to port the game to [[Cross-platform|multiple operating systems]].&lt;ref name="Softpedia" /&gt; The first version of the game was published in 2012. The game is under continued development as of August 2017.

== Reception ==
''Dust Racing 2D'' was selected in Christmas 2013 and in August 2015 as "HotPick" by [[Linux Format]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Linux_Format_178_Christmas_2013/#page/n63/mode/2up/search/hotgames Linux Format 178 Christmas 2013] page 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Linux_Format_August_2015_UK/#page/n59/mode/2up/search/hotgames Linux Format 200 August 2015] page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Dust Racing 2D was reviewed by [[Softpedia]] as being ''"All in all, Dust Racing 2D proved to be a fun video game, especially for nostalgics who want to relive their childhood."'' with 4 of 5 points.&lt;ref name="Softpedia"&gt;

[[Image:Evrofutbol logo small.jpg|right|frame|Eurofootball logo]]
'''Eurofootball''' ({{lang-bg|Еврофутбол}}, ''Evrofutbol'') is the first private [[Bulgaria]]n [[bookmaker]], as well as the country's largest. It began operating on 6 October 1990 and was officially registered in 1993, officially receiving a license on 20 October the same year. The first nationwide draw was performed on 21 August 1993. Eurofootball has developed its own strategy for community support, namely a social program and sponsorship one. For the 16 years of its operation, the company has become the leader in the field on the local market.

On 18 February 2002, Eurofootball became a partner of the [[Greece|Greek]] company [[Intralot]]. On 12 August 2003, the company introduced a new centralized national live betting computer system which cost around [[€]]10 million.

Eurofootball also prints a sports and betting newspaper by the same name, which is distributed twice weekly. Among its other products is the annual statistical book ''Football Programmes'' and the book ''Systems for your Success''.

'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is a short, [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[art game]] that puts the [[Player (game)|player]] in the role of a man whose life is about to change. Developed for the Experimental Gameplay Project in 2009, the game has been described as "a beautiful game with a very bleak outlook."&lt;ref name="paolo"&gt;Pedercini Paolo 2009 [http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2009/12/every-day-the-same-dream Every Day the Same Dream]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian creator Paolo Pedercini claims it is "a short existential game about [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Refusal of work|refusal of labor]]."&lt;ref name="paolo"/&gt; It has been compared to ''[[Passage (video game)|Passage]]'' by [[Jason Rohrer]] and ''[[Don't Look Back (video game)|Don't Look Back]]'' by [[Terry Cavanagh (developer)|Terry Cavanagh]] in that it is "an interesting, potentially fascinating experience."&lt;ref name="mcw"&gt;McWhertor, Michael. (2009). Play [http://kotaku.com/5432261/play-every-day-the-same-dream-feel-bad Every Day the Same Dream'', feel bad.] [[Kotaku]]&lt;/ref&gt; The game is offered as [[freeware]] under the [[Creative Commons license]] [[CC BY-NC-SA]] 2.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html everydaythesamedream] on molleindustry.org '"CC BY-NC 2.5 IT"''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
While the game lacks a traditional [[Narrative|storyline]], the course of events has the player control a [[white collar worker]] and guide this [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] through the daily grind. If the avatar gets dressed, drives to work, and sits at his cubicle, the dream will restart from the initial bedroom scene. An old woman in the elevator offers the cryptic message: "5 more steps and you will be a new person." Once the player deviates from the predetermined path and initiates five specific interactions, the dream restarts in a new state with the player's avatar as the only person in the [[game world]]. When the player next returns to the office and passes the empty cubicles, the avatar stops to watch an identical [[Character (arts)|character]] leap from the rooftop, and the game ends.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soderman"&gt;Soderman, Braxton. (2010). Every game the same dream? Dichtung Digital.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game gives the player simple controls, only enough to walk left or right using the [[arrow keys]] and interact using the [[spacebar]].&lt;ref name="soderman"/&gt; Using these limited controls, the [[gameplay]] encourages the player to "subvert the limitations of the world" however possible until the [[narrative]] changes.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;

== Critical response and analysis ==
Many media outlets noticed the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/5432261/play-every-day-the-same-dream-feel-bad|title=Play Every Day The Same Dream, Feel Bad|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Kotaku|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418234756/http://www.gamezebo.com/games/everyday-same-dream/review|title=Everyday the Same Dream Review {{!}} Gamezebo|date=2012-04-18|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://n4g.com/news/575360/friday-freebies-every-day-the-same-dream|title=Friday Freebies: Every Day the Same Dream|website=n4g.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/12/23/the-9-to-5-scale-every-day-the-same-dream/|title=The 9-to-5 Scale: Every Day The Same Dream|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=2009-12-23|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26653/Best_Of_Indie_Games_It_Came_in_a_Dream.php|title=Best Of Indie Games: It Came in a Dream|last=W.|first=Tim|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactive experience ===
Some find the label "game" unfit for this work, offering "interactive experience" as a more accurate definition.&lt;ref name="mcw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;

===Interactive media and design===
[[Gamasutra]] hosts an article discussing the importance of the game as an example of an [[Interactive media|interactive medium's]] capacity "to offer experiences that [[Media Control Charts|passive media]] can't possibly."&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;Alexander, Leigh. (2010). [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26714/Analysis_Every_Days_Not_The_Same_Art_Game.php Analysis: ''Every Day's ''not the same 'art game']. ''[[Gamasutra]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The game plays especially well on "natural player tendencies" and the expectation that the player will seek to "push the boundaries" of the game as far as possible.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt; Despite its brevity, the game highlights the value and importance of [[interactivity]], both as a [[game design]] principle and for mechanics-as-metaphor.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portnow"&gt;Portnow, James &amp; Floyd, Daniel. (2012). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwcI4iQt2Y Mechanics as metaphor]. ''[[Extra Credits]].''&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Interactive media and meaning ===
The game demonstrates how an interactive work can convey meaning "every bit as effectively as linear media, perhaps even more so."&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;B., Gregg. (2010). Every day the same dream. ''[http://tap-repeatedly.com/2010/01/every-day-the-same-dream/ Tap-Repeatedly].''&lt;/ref&gt; The unique experience of taking agency over someone else's narrative, in this case that of the avatar, allows the player to relate directly to events in the avatar's life, superimpose those events onto the player's own life, and in so doing apply the message of the game to the player's own reality.&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt;

=== Traditional analysis ===
Soderman's essay uses the game to argue that the focus on meaning inferred from [[game mechanics]] has caused "new [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] methods" of interpretation to supersede "visual and narrative representations" in terms of importance and consideration.&lt;ref name="soderman"/&gt; A mechanics-exclusive interpretation of the game ignores key [[Allegory|allegoric]] elements, such as the gradual failure of the company with each act of refusal of labour as presented on the graph at the office, or the [[Simulation game|simulation]] of [[purgatory]] in the final state devoid of the other characters encountered during previous days.&lt;ref name="soderman"/&gt; An approach that fails to analyze "the object from every possible angle" will inevitably miss the most "meaningful facets" of the work.&lt;ref name="soderman"/&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
Pedercini originally produced a [[soundtrack]] consisting of "crappy drones [on] an electric guitar."&lt;ref name="paolo"/&gt; The "thunderous pulsing" heard in the final version of the game, produced by [[Jesse Stiles]], ultimately replaced Paolo's track.&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiles, Jesse. (2009). Every day the same dream. [http://jts3k.com/site2/content/every-day-same-dream ''jts3k.com'']''.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">A '''Florida Western''' can be used to describe a small number of films and literature set in the 19th century, particularly around the time of the [[Second Seminole War]]. Not a significant number of these films have been made, as most [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and other genre westerns are usually located in more familiar regions of the United States, particularly the former frontier territories of "[[American Old West|the West]]".

A series of novels about Florida in the 19th century and their [[Florida cracker]] characters have been called '''''Cracker Westerns'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cracker Western Books|url=http://www.floridacrackerwesterns.com/books.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327064628/http://www.floridacrackerwesterns.com/books.htm|archivedate=March 27, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p.17 Ste Claire, Dana
''Cracker: The Cracker Culture in Florida History'' University Press of Florida, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In 1895 [[Frederick Remington]] and [[Owen Wister]] travelled to Florida to write a story on Florida's cowboys for ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;pp.57-58 Clark, James C.  ''200 Quick Looks at Florida History'' Pineapple Press Inc, 01/09/2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s a series of Cracker Westerns by several authors were published.

In 2014 Rough Edges Press published ''Palmetto Empire'' by David Hardy. This novel follows the fictional adventures of backwoodsmen, outlaws, and rebels in the era of the [[Seminole_Wars#First_Seminole_War|First Seminole War]].

==Films==

It was during the 1950s that most of these films were produced and many included a fictional and [[stereotypical]] portrayal of the real life [[Seminole]] leader, [[Osceola]], who resisted American expansion into [[Florida]] during the late 1830s.  The film ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951), which was one of the earliest Florida Westerns made, even changed his name to Oscala and portrayed him as a malevolent savage, filled with a constant blood lust who fed living prisoners to [[alligators]].

One of the advantages of these types of films, however, was that the producers often used the Florida [[Everglades]] as a backdrop. Now a contemporary audience has the benefit of glimpsing this wilderness in its mid 20th century form. The producers of ''Distant Drums'' even used the historic [[Castillo de San Marcos]] fort as a backdrop for the story. It was depicted as a fictitious stronghold for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[gunrunning|gunrunners]] selling armaments to the Seminole on the west coast of Florida, although it is actually located on the east coast.

Films which were made and could be considered ''Florida Westerns'' include:

*''[[Drums of Destiny]]'' (1937), directed by [[Ray Taylor (director)|Ray Taylor]] and starring [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]] 
*''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951), directed by [[Raoul Walsh]] and starring [[Gary Cooper]]
*''[[The Barefoot Mailman]]'' (1951) directed by Earl McEvoy and starring [[Robert Cummings]]
*''[[Shark River (film)|Shark River]]'' (1953)
*''[[Seminole (film)|Seminole]]'' (1953), starring [[Anthony Quinn]] as Osceola
*''[[Yellowneck]]'' (1955), a [[B-grade]] film set during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]
*''[[Naked in the Sun]]'' (1957), one of the few films to show Native Americans being used as slaves by white Americans
*''[[Wind Across the Everglades]]'' (1961) directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] and starring [[Burl Ives]]
*''{{Interlanguage link multi|Osceola (film)|de|3=Osceola (Film)|lt=Osceola}}'' (1971), an obscure [[East German]]/ [[Cubans|Cuban]] co-production
*''[[Joe Panther]]'' (1976), starring [[Brian Keith]]

'''German underground horror''' is a subgenre of the [[horror film]], which has achieved cult popularity since first appearing in the mid-1980s.

Horror films produced by the German underground scene are usually trademarked by their intensity, taking on topics that are culturally taboo such as [[rape]], [[necrophilia]], and [[extreme violence]]. Films that glorify violence are not technically [[Law|illegal]] in [[Germany]], but certain titles are banned by the government and [[Zollkriminalamt]]. Distribution, import, or creation of specific films can constitute steep fines.

== History of German underground horror ==

In an attempt to shed its violent image, horror films were very rarely made in Germany after the fall of the [[Third Reich]]. Movies such as ''[[Horrors of Spider Island]]'', ''[[The Blood Demon]]'', and ''[[The Head (film)|The Head]]'' were filmed and released in the decades following [[World War II]], but to very little success.

In 1987, filmmaker [[Jörg Buttgereit]] wrote and directed ''[[Nekromantik]]''. Two years later, amateur filmmaker [[Andreas Schnaas]] made the movie ''[[Violent Shit]]'' for a reported $2000. Released as Germany's first [[direct-to-video]] film, it was a modest hit amongst fans of independent horror. Both films were banned by the [[German government]], but their popularity influenced other filmmakers such as [[Olaf Ittenbach]] to bring Germany's underground horror film scene further into the media spotlight.

Since then, many other filmmakers have emerged from the German underground horror scene, including [[Uwe Boll]] and [[Timo Rose]]. Uwe Boll is notable as the only underground German director who has gone on to a career in big budget cinema.

== Ratings' effect on German underground horror ==

Once a film has been rated by the [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft|German ratings board]], that is its rating for both cinema and video releases. It is legal to have two versions of a film. Often, there is a cut "FSK 16" version (equivalent to the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rating]] by the [[MPAA]]) released in cinemas and an uncut "FSK 18" version (equivalent to an [[NC-17]] rating) on video. Films rated "FSK 18" are not stocked by all video shops, which affects rentals of violent German horror.

In Germany, there is also a category above "FSK 18" entitled "indiziert" or "on the index". "Indizierte" films are treated the same way as pornography. Distribution companies, cinemas, and video shops cannot advertise these films, nor can they be openly on display—unless a shop is open to "adults only". However, it is legal to sell and buy such material. Many video rental stores have back rooms or basements for such merchandise. 

Examples of "indizierte" films include ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]'', ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|Last House on the Left]]'', ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'', and [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Profondo Rosso]]'' (Deep Red). Several of these films were released uncut in Germany, but were subject to the limitations listed. Others were edited and then released as "indiziert".

Some movies, e.g. ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'', are completely banned in Germany (mostly for glamorizing violence), as it is illegal even to sell them to adults. These movies are "indiziert" as well as "beschlagnahmt" ("judicially confiscated"). While selling these kinds of media is strictly prohibited, it is legal to buy or own such movies.

'''''Grendel's Cave''''' was a [[Real-time game#Real-time|real-time]] browser-based [[role-playing video game]] and [[MUD]].  Grendel Enterprises published and ran it exclusively on the [[Internet]].  The basis for ''Grendel’s Cave'' was [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|mythology]] and [[Beowulf]], and it was set in the historical [[Middle Ages|medieval period]].  Scholars considered it an artistic depiction of [[Grendel]] and the poem, Beowulf, as well as a modern adaptation and a derivative work of the epic.  Educational websites use ''Grendel's Cave'' as an Internet learning aid for [[medieval literature]] and they considered it an online Beowulf resource.

==Literary significance==
''Grendel's Cave'' was an online Beowulf resource that goes beyond the written text by allowing players to participate in the story.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Mars Software Products wrote the first version of ''Grendel's Cave'' in 1981 as a [[single-player video game]] for the [[SWTPC]] 6800 [[microcomputer]].  This version was a fully [[text-based game]] but included many of the features of the later Internet incarnations of the game.  The developer based the game on an older [[Role-playing game (pen and paper)|pen and paper dungeon game]] with the same name. 
 
In 1997, Grendel's Net took over the project and began development of an Internet version of the game.  Grendel's Net conducted their development as an experiment in [[Active Server Pages|Classic ASP]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL]] 6.0 programming for the [[World Wide Web]].  They rolled out Version 1.0 in August 1998.  This version ran until July 2001.  [[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]] and [[Cheating in video games|cheats]] plagued this version during the last year of its run, which finally brought about the demise of the game.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2005, Grendel Enterprises acquired the rights to all of Grendel's Net assets.  Grendel Enterprises' programmers found the original ''Grendel's Cave'' [[source code]] on an old [[database server]] in an office closet.  Soon after, they started work on ''Grendel's Cave'' v2.0.  They rolled out the first [[beta version|beta]], v1.8A, on April 1, 2005 and over the next two years followed it up by four more pre-2.0 [[Software release life cycle|versions]], 1.8B, 1.8C, 1.9, and 2.0 betas.  Finally, on November 11, 2007, version 2.0 went live.  Version 2.0 contained many aspects of the original ''Grendel's Cave'' with the addition of many [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] elements and [[Non-player character|NPCs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Version 3.0 added text only and MUD style user interfaces, [[Audio game#TTS-enabling video games|TTS-enabling]] the game.  

Grendel's Cave has effectively shut down. 

==Gameplay==

Gameplay involves creating [[Thegn|Thanes]], the [[player character]]s in the game, killing [[monster]]s, primarily found in ''Grendel's Cave'', increasing value and stats and collecting items.  Thanes obtain gold rings, the game's currency, by selling obtained items or Singing of Deeds before King [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]].  They gain magical abilities by visiting the [[Witch]] or through acquired items.  Ultimately, this leads players to complete quests and earn [[amulet]]s, by traveling to other worlds, and trading in those earned amulets for the [[Yggdrasil]] amulet and thus gaining the ability to kill Grendel.  Killing Grendel is the ultimate objective of the game.  After killing Grendel there is a secondary objective, killing [[Grendel's Mother]], and then a tertiary objective, killing [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|The Dragon]].

At any one time there are many kingdoms running, with a Grendel in each kingdom that players can kill, of several different kingdom types.  The different kingdom types range from beginner to advanced, with increasing difficulty and requirements for killing Grendel, occasionally tournament style or championship kingdoms and personal kingdoms that can be custom configured by individual players.  The less advanced kingdoms are generally non-[[Player versus player|PVP]], while the more advanced kingdoms allow PVP and player killing.

Killing Grendel in any of the more advanced kingdoms earns the player's Thane a place on the hall of fame.  To date 202 Thanes have earned a spot on the hall of fame.

==Plot and setting==
The basis for ''Grendel's Cave'' is the Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf.  It is set in King Hrothgar's, king of the [[Danes]], kingdom in the early 6th century.  The kingdom is in the middle of its war with Grendel.  Grendel is an [[Intelligent agent|AI]] monster, who performs many tasks, most of them nasty, involving killing or harassing Thanes in the game. It contains many Norse mythology elements but also contains [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] elements as well as many references to historical events and items and [[popular culture]].  It encompasses [[Norse cosmology]], with each of the nine worlds represented in the game.  Player's Thanes can travel to these worlds and complete quests.  Thanes can take on other than human characteristics, including [[Valkyrie]], [[Berserker]]s, [[Trickster]]s, and [[Shapeshifting|Shape-Shifters]], among others.

'''Horia-Răzvan Gârbea''' or '''Gîrbea''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈhori.a rəzˈvan ˈɡɨrbe̯a}}; born August 10, 1962) is a Romanian playwright, poet, essayist, novelist and critic, also known as an academic, engineer and journalist. Known for his work in [[experimental theater]] and his [[Postmodern literature|Postmodernist]] contributions to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], he is a member of the [[Writers' Union of Romania]] (USR), its [[public relations]] executive and the head of its [[Bucharest]] chapter. Also recognized for his contribution to [[Romanian humor]] and his essays, he has published regularly in journals such as ''[[Contemporanul]]'', ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', ''[[Ramuri]]'' and ''[[Săptămâna Financiară]]''. His career in the media also covers [[screenwriting]] for [[Television in Romania|Romanian television stations]] and the popularization of [[contract bridge]]. The author of several scientific works on engineering, Gârbea is also a faculty member at the [[University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine]].

The recipient of several national awards for literature, he received critical attention for plays, short stories and novels which merge [[intertextuality]] and [[parody]] with [[Neorealism (art)|neorealistic]] elements. In his work for the [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian stage]], Gârbea has primarily reworked motifs from [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Costache Negruzzi]] and various other of his predecessors, addressing contemporary realities. He is also the other of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomedies]] with themes borrowed the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and his country's [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 history]]. The latter focus is complemented by his works in novel and short prose, which often take the form of [[political fiction]] or [[satire]] aimed at his writer colleagues. Such contributions have consolidated Gârbea's success with the general public, but have divided critical opinion on the issue of their ultimate literary value.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in [[Bucharest]], Horia Gârbea is the grandson of [[Titus Gârbea]], a [[Romanian Land Forces|Land Forces]] general and diplomat of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="abprofesia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alina Boboc, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-15-78part2-4922.html "Profesia de scriitor are nevoie de recunoaştere"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 973, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcradem"&gt;{{ro icon}} Bianca Burţa-Cernat, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Sa-ridem-cu-Horia-Garbea*articleID_16567-articles_details.html "Să rîdem cu Horia Gârbea?!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 348, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls that his grandfather's passion for literature was passed onto him from an early age, when he first heard him reciting poems by [[Dante Aligheri]].&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; The future writer attended the [[Mihai Viteazul High School]], opting for a sciences-based curriculum, but envisioned becoming a writer.&lt;ref name="hgmeseria"&gt;Horia Gârbea, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-20-83-part-i-5740.html "Meseria de a scrie (la comandă)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 992, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At around age 17, as one of the adolescent guests on a [[Romanian Television]] [[talk show]] hosted by author [[Mircea Sîntimbreanu]], he stated his intention of having two books published by the year 2000 (he recalls: "[Sîntimbreanu], who was a witty but skeptical man, did not encourage me").&lt;ref name="hgmeseria"/&gt;

Gârbea made his debut in 1982, at age twenty, his poems being published by the student magazine ''Amfiteatru''.&lt;ref name="hgmeseria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex.

A turning point in Horia Gârbea's writing career was the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], which put an end to the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. In 1990, one of his first works in [[drama]], translated into English as ''The Serpent'', was performed by the British [[Royal Court Theatre]].&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; A year later, ''Pescăruşul din livada cu vişini'' ("The Seagull in the Cherry Orchard") was first staged at the [[Victor Ion Popa]] Theater, followed in 1992 by the premiere of ''Funcţionarul destinului'' ("The Clerk of Destiny") with the Bucharest [[experimental theater]] company Inoportun.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; He made his editorial debut in the genre with the 1993 volumes ''Doamna Bovary sînt ceilalţi'' ("[[Madame Bovary]] Are the Others") and ''Mephisto'' (a [[Romanian-language]] variant of [[Klaus Mann]]'s [[Mephisto (novel)|1936 novel]]).&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andespre"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alina Nelega]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Despre-Matei-VISNIEC-Saviana-STANESCU-Radu-MACRINICI...*articleID_3170-articles_details.html "Despre Matei Vişniec, Saviana Stănescu, Radu Macrinici..."], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 57, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his plays, ''Stăpânul tăcerii'' ("The Master of Silence"), was staged in 1994 by [[Piteşti]]'s [[Alexandru Davila]] Theater.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;

Gârbea's first volume of [[lyric poetry]], {{lang|ro|Text biografic}} ("Biographical Text"), saw print in 1996, earning him an award granted by the [[Sighetu Marmaţiei International Poetry Festival|Sighet Poetry Festival]].&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; Also that year, the writer followed up with a second collection of poems, ''Proba cu martori'' ("The Confrontation of Witnesses"), which was awarded the yearly prize of the Bucharest Association of Writers (a section of the USR).&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; In 1996, he wrote the script for ''Ils emménagement'' ("They Are Moving On"), a [[French-language]] [[street theater]] performance, which premiered in France.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; ''Proba cu martori'' was followed in 1997 by the short story volume ''Misterele Bucureştilor'' ("The Mysteries of Bucharest") and the multiple award-winning novel ''Căderea Bastiliei'' (Romanian for "[[Fall of the Bastille]]").&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacarnav"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Aretzu]], [http://revistaramuri.ro/index.php?id=192&amp;editie=13 "D-ale carnavalului literaturii"], in ''[[Ramuri]]'', August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary consecration and Writers' Union activities===
An active member of the Writers' Union since 1994, Horia Gârbea was elected president of its Bucharest chapter in 2003, and appointed head of the Union's [[public relations]] branch two years later.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; As a representative of the Bucharest section, he worked closely with Editura Nouă publishing house in helping to popularize the writings of his fellow association members.&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; Having joined the [[UNITER]] association of theatrical professionals in 1993, he also works as a [[dramaturge]], and has first been employed as such by the Toma Caragiu Theater since 1998.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; His contributions in this field include translations and adaptations of plays by [[Anton Chekhov]] (''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''), [[Pierre Corneille]] (''[[L'Illusion comique]]''), [[Dario Fo]] (''[[We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!]]''), [[Pierre de Marivaux]] (''[[Le Triomphe de l'amour]]''), [[Molière]] (''[[The School for Wives]]''), [[Ayn Rand]] (''[[Night of January 16th]]''), [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Jacques Copi]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[John D. MacDonald]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Gérald Sibleyras]], [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; In 1998, Gârbea also began working in [[screenwriting]], collaborating with several national television stations. He was first employed by [[Pro TV]] from 1998 to 2001, working on the [[variety show]] ''Ministerul comediei'' and the [[sitcom]] ''La Bloc''.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; He was then affiliated with [[Prima TV]], writing for [[Romică Ţociu]] and [[Cornel Palade]]'s ''Alomania'' [[sketch comedy]] show, and later [[Naţional TV]], where he contributed to a similar production, ''Naţionala de bere''.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; In 2001, Gârbea was also involved in writing for [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]]'s sitcom ''Clanul Popeştilor''.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; Between 2002 and 2003, he worked with the public broadcaster [[TVR Cultural]], where he hosted a [[talk show]] on cultural issues.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;

During 2004, authors Horia Gârbea, [[Valeriu Butulescu]], [[Mircea Ghiţulescu]] and [[Mircea Petean]] traveled to [[Vietnam]], on the invitation of the [[Vietnamese Writers Union]].&lt;ref name="lvnghean"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucia Verona, [http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1413/citeste.html "Citeşte!"], in ''[[Săptămâna Financiară]]'', June 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Their experience in the [[Far East]] produced the collective travel account ''Drumul spre Nghe An'' ("The Road to [[Nghe An Province|Nghe An]]"), published the same year.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lvnghean"/&gt; Also in 2004, Gârbea premiered his ''Cleopatra a şaptea'' ("[[Cleopatra VII]]") with the [[Andrei Mureşanu Theatre|Andrei Mureşanu company]] of [[Sfântu Gheorghe]], published a new work for the stage—''Hotel [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]'', and oversaw the publishing of [[Editura Limes]]' ''Repetiţie fără orchestră'' ("Rehearsal without an Orchestra"), an anthology of prose pieces by young Romanian authors.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; His own work also included the 2005 essay collections ''Arte parţiale'' ("Partial Arts") and ''Bridge în 41 de povestiri vesele'' ("Contract Bridge in 41 Cheerful Stories").&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; Gârbea was made Knight of ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' order through a 2004 [[President of Romania|presidential]] decree.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; In March 2005, as head of the Bucharest Association of Writers, he set up the Romanian version of France's literary festival ''Le Printemps des Poètes'' ("Poets' Spring", known locally as ''Primăvara poeţilor'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.revista22.ro/bucuresti-linie-de-orizont-1598.html "''Primăvara poeţilor'' la Paris şi la Bucureşti"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 783, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, during the ''Romanian Comedy Festival'', his play ''Leonida XXI'' was staged by the [[Comedy Theatre, Bucharest|Comedy Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://adevarul.md/articole/2005/ce-haz-mai-are-comedia-romaneasca.html "Ce haz mai are comedia românească?"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', April 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Gârbea and the Writers' Union were involved in a polemic with [[Paul Goma]], a novelist and former [[dissident]] who lives in France. This came after ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', a literary magazine managed by the Union, republished fragments from Goma's diary, which caused public outrage for its perceived [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="diversscandal"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.divers.ro/actualitate_ro?wid=37455&amp;func=viewSubmission&amp;sid=3000 ''Scandal la USR''], at [http://www.divers.ro/ Divers.ro], September 15, 2005; retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mgmanolescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Manuela Golea, [http://www.gardianul.ro/index.php?pag=nw&amp;id=66411 "Manolescu îl acuză pe Goma de antisemitism"], in ''[[Gardianul]]'', September 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osviata"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Şimonca]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/A-devenit-Viata-Romaneasca-o-revista-antisemita*articleID_13902-articles_details.html "A devenit ''Viaţa Românească'' o revistă antisemită?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 286, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Gârbea and USR president [[Nicolae Manolescu]] both intervened to sanction the publication. In an early interview with ''[[Gardianul]]'' daily, he spoke of the editorial staff as having displayed "negligence", and noted that replacing the panel of editors was one of the sanctions being considered, while also stating that he felt none of them were "100% responsible" for the incident.&lt;ref name="mgmanolescu"/&gt; Gârbea however dismissed rumors that he and his colleagues were considering disestablishing ''Viaţa Românească'', noting that the magazine was a historical institution.&lt;ref name="mgmanolescu"/&gt;

The USR's public expression of regret over having tolerated "a text with antisemitic content" caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on [[libel]] grounds.&lt;ref name="diversscandal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="osviata"/&gt; In reaction, Gârbea stated: "What we are interested in is ''Viaţa Românească'', a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally."&lt;ref name="diversscandal"/&gt; According to an overview of the episode by journalist [[Ovidiu Şimonca]], Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian]] community league, or [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation.&lt;ref name="osviata"/&gt; Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.&lt;ref name="osviata"/&gt;

===Since 2006===
Gârbea published his second novel, ''Crime la Elsinore'' ("Murders at [[Helsingør]]"), in 2006.&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cccaderea"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloş]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cderea_elsinore-ului "Căderea Elsinore-ului"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 46/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Printed the same year, his new drama volume, ''Divorţ în direct'' ("Live Divorce"), was nominated for another USR award.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=238 "Nominalizări pentru premiile Uniunii Scriitorilor pe anul 2006"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 4/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007, he participated with fellow writers [[Doina Ruşti]] and [[Liviu Ioan Stoiciu]] in a [[children's literature]] project initiated by [[Editura Paralela 45]], which involved rewriting a series of [[fairy tales]] in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]] and [[Christian mythology]].&lt;ref name="evcopii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vlădăreanu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/a114324/literatura-pentru-copii-intre-harry-potter-si-clasici.html "Literatura pentru copii, între Harry Potter şi clasici"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Basme şi poveşti mistice româneşti repovestite'' ("Retold Romanian Fairy Tales and Mystical Stories"), it was illustrated with reproductions of children-made [[Romanian icons]].&lt;ref name="evcopii"/&gt; His son, Tudor, was born in the same year.&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;

With the 2008 ''Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici'' ("Bygone Lives of Beaus and Aces"), he investigated the history of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] by focusing on and inventorying literary types.&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdpitor"&gt;{{ro icon}} Silvia Dumitrache, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Viata-pitoreasca-a-personajelor*articleID_20807-articles_details.html "Viaţa pitorească a personajelor"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 450, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emscriitori"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Emil Mladin]], [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/57_viata-romaneasca-1-2-2009/10_cronici/254_scriitori-personaje-cititori.html "Scriitori, personaje, cititori..."], in ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', Nr. 1-2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; In spring, he participated in the project ''Scriitori pe calea regală'' ("Writers on the Royal Road"), organized by the former [[King of Romania]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], the [[Romanian Royal Family|Royal House]], the USR and various other venues for the benefit of award-winning writers.&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; He was also the USR's envoy to the Three Seas Writers and Translators Committee conference on [[Rhodes]], Greece.&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt;

The same year, Gârbea voluntarily reduced his contributions to drama and theater criticism, citing his family obligations, alongside a general disappointment with the milieu: "I grew aware that writing for the theater is usually not followed by productions. Although plays I signed were constantly performed, I never had productions at a satisfactory level nor significant material gains, except for translations."&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; Instead, he focused on writing a [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel for the youth, ''Făt Frumos din lună'' ("''[[Făt Frumos]]'' from the Moon") and a cycle of poems known as ''Cântecele lui Huppy'' ("Huppy's Songs"), as well as on reviewing for publishing the [[memoir]]s of his grandfather [[Titus Gârbea]].&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; Working with Editura Tritonic publishing house, Gârbea also coordinated an anthology of [[political fiction]], in which he included his own [[novella]] ''Detestarea naţiunii'' ("Detesting the Nation").&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt;

In 2010, Editura Limes published ''Fratele mai deştept al lui Kalaşnikov'' ("[[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]]'s Smarter Brother"), his new volume of short prose.&lt;ref name="atfratele"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Terian]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/fratele-mai-destept-al-lui-kalasnikov-6139593 "''Fratele mai deştept al lui Kalaşnikov''"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Gârbea visited [[Azerbaijan]], invited by the [[Heydar Aliyev Foundation]], and published some of his impressions in ''[[Revista 22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Horia Gârbea, [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-8928.html "Azerbaidjan – Ţara Focului viu.

==Work==

===Cultural context and Postmodernist reinterpretations===
Committed to [[Postmodern literature|Postmodernism]], Gârbea debuted as a member of the ''[[Optzecişti]]'' group of writers, most of whom reached their creative peak after 1980: together with [[Mircea Cărtărescu]], [[Traian T. Coşovei]], [[Florin Iaru]], [[Doru Mareş]], [[Radu G. Ţeposu]] and [[Ion Stratan]], he was part of the ''Optzecişti'' nucleus inside ''Cenaclul de luni''.&lt;ref name="garevpc"/&gt; Given his relatively late consecration, Gârbea is nevertheless identified with the 1990s generation of post-''Optzecişti''.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egppachet"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Emilian Galaicu-Păun]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20071231/article_5/ "Carte la pachet-2007"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 4/2007&lt;/ref&gt; This also reflects Gârbea's own positioning: according to his own statement, the move from one generation group to the other coincided with his leaving ''Cenaclul de luni'' and joining ''Universitas''.&lt;ref name="hgmeseria"/&gt; In 2008, he expressed much criticism for ''[[Orbitor]]'', a large-scale novelistic cycle by the ''Optzecişti'' group leader Cărtărescu.&lt;ref name="blorbitor"/&gt; In her critical overview of Gârbea's contributions, ''[[Observator Cultural]]'' chronicler Bianca Burţa-Cernat describes him as one among the lesser authors of the 1990s generation, alongside [[Dan-Silviu Boerescu]] and [[Mihail Gălăţanu]].&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt; Writing for the 2007 [[Columbia University]] ''Encyclopedia of Modern Drama'', Romanian-born Israeli actor-director [[Moshe Yassur]] included Gârbea "among the best known" of post-1989 playwrights "experimenting with post-[[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd]]-[[surrealism|surrealist]] modes of expression."&lt;ref name="myromania"&gt;Moshe Yassur, "Romania", in Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (eds.), ''The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama'', [[Columbia University Press]], New York &amp; Chichester, 2007, p.1150.  {{ISBN|978-0-231-14424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in this group are, according to his definition, [[Radu Macrinici]], [[Alina Mungiu-Pippidi]], [[Alina Nelega]], [[Saviana Stănescu]], [[Matei Vişniec]] and [[Vlad Zografi]].&lt;ref name="myromania"/&gt; In a 2001 overview of the generation's contribution, Nelega herself mentioned Gârbea and the others alongside [[Valentin Nicolau]] and [[Răzvan Petrescu]].&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;

A defining characteristic of Gârbea's main works is the reliance on [[intertextuality]], as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madrazb"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea A.

[...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations."&lt;ref name="hgmeseria"/&gt; Poet and critic [[Octavian Soviany]] noted: "Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of [[parody]] and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible".&lt;ref name="ospotop"/&gt; Commenting on the texts grouped within ''Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?'', literary critic [[Mircea A. Diaconu]] placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with [[William Shakespeare]]'s phrase "[[All the world's a stage]]", since "everything is possible at the level of the text becoming reality".&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; He praises the author for managing to preserve an "absence that imposes", by not making his own intervention felt in the text.&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as "gratuitously bookish, [where] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder", but supports the notion that they all display an "[[Existentialism|existential]] bearing", accounting for an "intrinsic value."&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; He speaks of the technique as "a vengeance of the theater" on the traditional historical record: "In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world."&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt;

===Generic traits and related polemics===
Beyond its immediate context, critics see Horia Gârbea's contribution as greatly indebted to the work of 19th century dramatist and humorist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]. According to Diaconu, Caragiale's influence constitutes the "depth" of Gârbea's work, going beyond the "surface level" of intertextual references and tributes.&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; At the same core level, Diaconu identifies the author's debt to [[Eugène Ionesco]], while also judging his manner of "mixing eras, languages, writings, characters or historical figures, fiction and document" to echo the techniques of [[Argentina|Argentinian]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; Another main influence on Gârbea's work is [[interwar]] author [[Mateiu Caragiale]], made famous by his cultivated style and eccentric outlook.&lt;ref name="duistorii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Ungureanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=10757 "Istorii 'albalate' "], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 218, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Dumitru Ungureanu sees this cultural echo as having been filtered by the style of [[Radu Albala]], one of the authors to have been most inspired by the "matein" narratives, and concludes that the lineage places Gârbea on the same level as Cărtărescu and [[Florin Şlapac]].&lt;ref name="duistorii"/&gt;

According to his generation colleague, essayist Dan-Silviu Boerescu, Gârbea "cannot part with the speculative charm of a brain given to bookish games", but closely follows a realistic tradition with his "sarcastic analysis of [...] all everyday weakness."&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; For Boerescu, Gârbea's literature is supported by his sarcasm and his contribution to [[Romanian humor]]: "Thin and edgy like a razor, Gârbea's style forgives no one no thing."&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; Soviany also argues that the "rewriting" of texts attempted by the Romanian author is carried by "[[absurd humor]]" and "the most unusual (as well as the most hilarious) arrangements of famous characters and quotes".&lt;ref name="ospotop"/&gt; Poet and critic [[Paul Aretzu]] writes: "The staple of [Horia Gârbea's] writing is inventive, farcical, the obvious attribute of intelligence and refinement, also displaying bookish support and being enhanced by zestful language. [...] The tendency of visualizing, of sketching portraits, of detailing/dissecting scenes, of verifying [[orality]], the expressive value of the language, reveal the author's dominant structure as a playwright."&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; The alternation of such stylistic traits reflects in part the writer's own parting with the ''Optzecişti''. The focus on everyday issues prompted [[Cătălin Ţârlea]] to view Gârbea's 1990s prose as a revival of [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] after the ''Optzecişti'' [[Experimental literature|experimentalism]].&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; Boerescu however believes this verdict to be "only half right", since the writer continued to employ experimental devices long after 1989, while avoiding the "referential ostentation" of other writers.&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; Appreciation of Gârbea's work was also expressed among older critics and Gârbea's own mentors. [[Nicolae Manolescu]] held Gârbea's contribution in high esteem, an, in his 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, spoke of him as having "indisputably, the fabric of a dramatist".&lt;ref name="bcesecul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Bogdan Creţu]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=18&amp;nr=383 "Eşecul lui Nicolae Manolescu" (II)], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nelega's view, Gârbea, "one of the truly alive writers of his time", was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by prominent Romanian directors—[[Alexandru Darie]], [[Alexandru Hausvater]] and [[Gavril Pinte]].&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt; Gârbea's fellow ''[[România Literară]]'' contributor, literary historian [[Alex. Ştefănescu]], contrasted his writings with the "boring" works by some of his contemporaries, and claimed that "directors and actors take pleasure in staging [Gârbea's plays]."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; Gârbea's work stands out within its cultural and temporal context for its size and diversity. Aretzu sees him as "one of the most ubiquitous authors in present-day literature, [...] gifted with a great availability in processing reality",&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; while critic and academic Nicolae Oprea believes him to be "the most prolific" among the Bucharest-based group formed in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt; Literary reviewer [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]] also describes his colleague as "multilateral" who "can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genre's specificity".&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt; Writing in 2007, Ştefănescu defined him a "one-man orchestra [...] of the apathetic (and sometimes shy-brazen) Romanian literature of today."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; According to [[Moldova]]n writer [[Emilian Galaicu-Păun]]: "As productive as an entire literary school [...], Horia Gârbea is a veritable [[Stakhanovite]] of writing, who has dealt in all genres and species".&lt;ref name="egppachet"/&gt; Gârbea is also among the post-1990 Romanian authors to have received recognition abroad. In addition to the performances of ''The Serpent'' and ''Il émmagement'', Gârbea's ''Raţă cu portocale'' has been translated into German by Veronika Dreichlinger (''Ente mit Apfelsine'', published in 2005).&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt; His work was also included into English-, French-, German-, [[Russian language|Russian-]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian-language]] anthologies.&lt;ref name="cvusr"/&gt;

There are several controversial aspects to Gârbea's public notoriety, involving reactions against academic verdicts, and objecting to the close relationship between Gârbea and mainstream cultural forums such as the USR. The implications of positive appraisals by these venues were debated by literary critic [[Bogdan Creţu]], who argued that Nicolae Manolescu tended to overrate authors in his proximity, while being dismissive of Vişniec's contribution to drama (which Manolescu had claimed lacked originality).&lt;ref name="bcesecul"/&gt; Critic [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]] criticized in particular Manolescu's "caprices", suggesting that, in a 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, his older colleague had assigned Gârbea's entry undeserved space, more than to a better known novelist like [[Gib Mihăescu]].&lt;ref name="dcmcronic"&gt;[[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], "Cronicarul în cumpăna istoriei", in ''[[Idei în Dialog]]'', Nr. 1(52), January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Mihăilescu, Cărtărescu may have had his rival Gârbea in mind when reproaching Manolescu that he had insisted on writers who were not at all worthy of recognition.&lt;ref name="dcmcronic"/&gt; Nicolae Oprea saw Gârbea as apparently "uninhibited" in matters of literary discourse, but critically noted that the poet was also preoccupied, "to the point of obsession", with his own cultural imprint (citing as proof the fact that, in its original version, ''Creşterea iguanelor de casă'' features the English-language versions of five poems, translated by Gârbea's own hand).&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt; A highly critical voice is that of Bianca Burţa-Cernat. She suggests that, in adopting all forms of writing, Gârbea displays "an implausible self-certainty".&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt; She polemically connects the critical appreciation with his status as a "good colleague" and "devoted shadow" of other writers, noting that Gârbea's notoriety is ensured by a promotional system with "all the stakes" and "all the pulleys", as well as by "the argument of prolificity", but that these attributes also surpass his actual value.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;

===Plays===
Usually assigned by their author the name of "texts", in preference over "plays",&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ospotop"/&gt; several among Gârbea's earliest works for the stage are Postmodern reworkings of classical motifs, fashioned into new statements about the limits of literature. His ''Pescăruşul din livada cu vişini'' is a personal take on [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard|Cherry Orchard]]'' and ''[[The Seagull|Seagull]]''. According to the author's own assessment, the text fits in with a Chekhovian homage trend among Romanian dramatists, also including [[Iosif Naghiu]]'s {{lang|ro|Armurierul Cehov}} ("Chekhov the Armorer") and Vişniec's ''La machine Tchekhov'' ("The Chekhov Machine").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Horia Gârbea, [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=24&amp;nr=320 "Pescăruşul din livada cu vişini"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Soviany singles out the text as an answer to claims that parody is always inferior to its models, by identifying its original motifs in a new statement about theater itself: "[the play], which is without doubt ascribable to the formula of 'apocalyptic' theater, draws its substance from mixing intertextual parody with an [[Eschatology|eschatologic]] vision, suggesting the regression (of world and literature) into the primordial mud. Putting to use [...] the [[deluge myth]], the dramatist this time imagines an apocalypse of fiction (of the theater), during which the characters [...] are slowly being swallowed by the mud flows of subterranean waters, which could imply that literature (fiction) unavoidably secretes its own death, so that writing (being written) and dying end up being perfect synonyms."&lt;ref name="ospotop"/&gt; In this analogy between literature and death, Soviany argues, one finds "the most profound message of Horia Gârbea's theater".&lt;ref name="ospotop"/&gt; In ''Doamna Bovary sînt ceilalţi'', the theme and protagonists are borrowed from [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s [[Madame Bovary|1857 novel]], reused by the author to make a statement about drama itself&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt; and combined with elements from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit]]''.&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt; In addition to such themes, Mircea A. Diaconu sees Gârbea's reflection on the conflict between history and fiction as personified by the lead character in ''Stăpânul tăcerii'': the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Thoth]], who bestows the gift of language on man, is depicted as "the prototype of traitors."&lt;ref name="madrazb"/&gt;

Published ten years after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], ''Decembrie, în direct'' recounts a changing of roles between torturer and victim, set to the background of political turmoil.&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcsecurit"/&gt; In the first part, it introduces the two protagonists: a failed boxer turned interrogator for the main communist repressive structure, the [[Securitate]], who confronts his prisoner, a renegade [[nomenklatura]] member who has become a [[dissident]].&lt;ref name="rcsecurit"/&gt; What is supposed to be an ordeal for the latter turns into a revelation for the former: the dissident is successful in assuring his interrogator that communism is doomed, and both flee the prison to partake in the victorious Revolution. The second part sees the dissident transformed into an agent for the reformed [[Serviciul Român de Informaţii|Intelligence Service]], who displays no qualms about capturing, tormenting and finally killing his former associate.&lt;ref name="rcsecurit"/&gt; Historiographer and critic [[Ruxandra Cesereanu]] connects the outcome with a notoriously violent episode in Romania's communist history, the [[brainwashing]] experiment carried out by the Securitate in [[Piteşti prison]]: "The paradox and [[moral]]-antimoral of Horia Gârbea's play is that the victim [...] proves himself tougher, more of an executioner, than his torturer. This means that the lines between victim and executioner are blurred and that, ultimately, the reeducation experiment in Piteşti prison (1949-1952), when victims were forced into becoming torturers, has succeeded. The antimoral in Gârbea's play is, however, all the more tough as the victim here becomes a torturer without being made to do so."&lt;ref name="rcsecurit"/&gt; Cesereanu ranks it and [[Radu Macrinici]]'s ''T/Ţara mea'' (approx. "My Dead Weight/Country") among the post-1989 dramatic texts to have "brought up [...] the Securitate issue, in a trenchant and even revelatory manner".&lt;ref name="rcsecurit"/&gt; Gârbea's fellow playwright [[Alina Nelega]] notes that ''Decembrie, în direct'' is his first entirely original text for the stage, and rates it over intertextual texts from the same period.&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;

Published alongside ''Decembrie, în direct'', ''Capul lui Moţoc'' ("Moţoc's Head") reinterprets ''[[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu (novella)|Alexandru Lăpuşneanu]]'', a [[novella]] by the Romanian classic [[Costache Negruzzi]], which romanticizes events in [[Moldavia]]'s [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval history]]. Integrating further allusions to [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]] (the ''[[Meşterul Manole]]'' myth), Shakespeare and various others, it is also seen by Alina Nelega as a close rendition of Ion Luca Caragiale's style.&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt; The protagonist, a treacherous Moldavian [[boyar]] by the name of Moţoc, uses a discourse rich in political imagery, and towards the end of the play reveals himself as an ''[[alter ego]]'' of [[Communism|communist]] theorist [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt; Nelega is critical of the text, arguing that it "does not surpass the gratuitousness of petty pokes" and is "more [[burlesque]] than absurd", concluding: "I fear that Gârbea did not know how to end his play and quickly fabricated, ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the similitude of a profound sense where there was nothing."&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;

The three-character [[comedy]] and [[satire]] ''Cafeaua domnului Ministru'', seen by poet and literary chronicler [[Emil Mladin]] as one "of morals",&lt;ref name="emdeparte"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Emil Mladin]], [http://www.revistadrama.ro/drama1207/texte/laborator.htm "Laborator. Departe de lumea dezlănţuită"], in [http://www.revistadrama.ro/ ''Revista Drama''], Nr. 1-2/2007&lt;/ref&gt; turns its attention to [[Politics of Romania|Romania's political scene]], showing the stormy encounter between a matron, a female secretary and a politician.&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emdeparte"/&gt; The dialogues are seen by Mladin as "a parody of the discourses with which just about any television station assassinates us",&lt;ref name="emdeparte"/&gt; and, Nelega writes, "the lampoon has precise targets".&lt;ref name="andespre"/&gt; The story pokes fun at the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] governments of the [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 period]], and, according to dramatist and theater critic Mihaela Michailov, was "adequate" in the context of [[Romanian legislative election, 2000|2000 elections]].&lt;ref name="mmginditi"/&gt; Michailov highlights the play's symbolism as illustrating "the stupidity of the political mechanism", whose sphere is turned into "a sort of [[no man's land]] where everything is possible."&lt;ref name="mmginditi"/&gt; According to Alex. Ştefănescu, productions of ''Cafeaua domnului Ministru'' receive as much applause as "a [[rock music]] recital."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; With ''Leonida XXI'', the author returned to intertextual reworkings, this time introducing his style to the works of Ion Luca Caragiale, ''[[Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea]]'' and ''[[O scrisoare pierdută]]''.&lt;ref name="ipalbulescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Popovici, [http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2002-11-18&amp;id=104926 "Mircea Albulescu: 'Aş vrea foarte mult ca cititorii, spectatorii, ascultătorii mei să vrea să nu mă piardă' "], in ''[[Ziua]]'', November 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The play was notably used as teaching material for student actors training at the [[Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography|Caragiale Academy]] under [[Mircea Albulescu]], who called it "extremely interesting".&lt;ref name="ipalbulescu"/&gt;

===From ''Căderea Bastiliei'' to ''Creşterea iguanelor de casă''===
With his debut novel ''Căderea Bastiliei'', Gârbea produces a satirical portrayal of his fellow Romanian writers, disguising their real names with [[anagram]]s or other [[word play]].&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egppachet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmspumna"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Maria Savu, [http://www.revistacultura.ro/Cornelia_Maria_Savu/Pumnagiul,_Cri.../ "Pumnagiul, Criticessa şi Profetul"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 82/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Alex. Ştefănescu, who writes that such portrayals caused "great agitation in the literary world", cites the author's own mock-[[disclaimer]]: "The identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; Ştefănescu however cautions against reading ''Căderea Bastiliei'' purely as a ''[[roman à clef]]'', since the inspiration from "writers' deeds" is "capricious" and the resemblance with real persons "partial".&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; A similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist Cornelia Maria Savu, who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed: "Horia Gârbea does not hate his characters, does not love them, he understands them. And by understanding them, he offers them a few moments to evolve with no strings."&lt;ref name="cmspumna"/&gt; Reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view, Paul Aretzu analyzes the intrusion of "intertextual indulgences" throughout the work, identifying allusions to Ion Luca Caragiale, [[Franz Kafka]], [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti]] and others, while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; Ştefănescu attributes such presences to parody, noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from Kafka's ''[[The Metamorphosis|Metamorphosis]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Plague]]''.&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt;

The narrative delves into Bucharest's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] environment, its heroes being vagrants, misfits or [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] who lead [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] lifestyles.&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; The plot, deemed "to die for" by Galaicu-Păun,&lt;ref name="egppachet"/&gt; notably shows writer and former inmate Aldu Rădulescu seducing literary chronicler Alteea Fleciu, as revenge for a negative review of his work.&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egppachet"/&gt; In Paul Aretzu's view, the manner in which such developments are presented constitutes "a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination."&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; He commends a chapter of the book, which discusses how groups of people differentiated by their respective [[drinking culture]]s, for being "a sort of poem dedicated to the kinds of drink and drunks in a small alcoholic town", while noting that a similar section, dedicated to the attitudes of writers when faced with fatal diseases, "creates, with the means of the [[grotesque]], a ''[[sui generis]]'' mythology of the writers' caste".&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; The latter episode is praised by Ştefănescu for its "irresistible" [[black humor]] and its "devilish verve".&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; The same commentator states: "The novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader. After you finish reading this novel about the ugliness of (literary) life [...], you feel, paradoxically, the joy of living, of communicating, of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; In Artezu's account, those parts of ''Căderea Bastiliei'' in which Gârbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a "captivating" humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an "innocent [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], characteristic for the author".&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; He argues: "With all the signs of his emotional involvement [...], the author also exercises, through correlations [and] quotes, the function of [[depersonalization]], of estrangement, of laughing at one's misfortunes, of projecting oneself into clichés, [...] of surrogate existence."&lt;ref name="pacarnav"/&gt; Literary reviewer [[Cosmin Ciotloş]] issues a more reserved verdict on the text: in his view, the episodes of ''Căderea Bastiliei'' are primarily "charades", whose main quality is being "droll".&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt;

Overall, Horia Gârbea's contribution to short fiction is described by Alex. Ştefănescu as "ingenious" and "endearing".&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; The [[political fiction]] of {{lang|ro|Enigme în oraşul nostru}} is described by Boerescu as "a multitude of sub-worlds" structured around "framework situations", moving between the "petty politics of the day" (targeting the Social Democratic Party) and ironic [[parable]]s or [[dystopia]]s.&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; Boerescu writes: "The author cannot refrain from endlessly staging acts and short plays or inserting lines with an obvious dramatic hue".&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; The same commentator identifies in the stories several allusions, homages or intertextual borrowings, from the "[[Semiotics|semiotic]] games" of [[Umberto Eco]] to a "landscape of luxuriant vegetation" characteristic for the [[Latin American Boom]] writers.&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt; This symbolism is coupled with allusions to Romanian literary life: the final story in the collection, ''Motanii din bibliotecă'' ("The Tomcats in the Study Hall"), speculates about the future of Gârbea's generation, and depicts [[bibliophile]]s keeping pets named after the leading literary critics of the 1980s and '90s.&lt;ref name="dsbpostm"/&gt;

Among his poetry collections, ''Creşterea iguanelor de casă'' drew attention for transferring the intertextual and parodic conventions into a lyrical format, mostly [[free verse]]. According to Ştefănescu, it and his other poetry collections are "better than those by most contemporary authors who emphatically recommend themselves as poets."&lt;ref name="asprea-pl"/&gt; Nicolae Oprea noted in particular the reworking of a motif borrowed from [[Sibiu Literary Circle|Sibiu Circle]] poet [[Ştefan Augustin Doinaş]] and his ''[[Mistreţul cu colţi de argint]]'': the "prince from the [[Levant]]", whom Gârbea transfers into the destitute world of garbage collectors.&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt; Part of it reads:

Oprea also highlighted ironic and dismissive borrowings from Romania's [[national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]], and from [[Poet Laureate|poets laureate]] such as [[Octavian Goga]] and [[Vasile Alecsandri]], as well as an actual lineage from the black humor of 1930s Surrealists.&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt; He sees a direct link between Gârbea and the Romanian Surrealist group's [[Gellu Naum]], and beyond, to the "existential" [[absurdism]] of Ionesco and Kafka.&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt; Also according to Oprea, such texts "are raised as collages of everyday images and bookish suggestions, well tied to each other, to the point where their articulation into colloquial speech puts to use the technique of reabsorbing the dramatic element and the narrative nucleus of [[ballad]]esque nature into the sphere of pure [[lyricism]]."&lt;ref name="notexte"/&gt;

===''Crime la Elsinore'' and ''Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici''===
''Crime la Elsinore'' is a return to prose satire, in this case directed at the theatrical environment. The setting is a fictional theater in provincial [[Călăraşi]], deriving its name from the [[Getae|Getic]] ruler [[Dromichaetes]], and the protagonists, Cosmin Ciotloş notes, are composite portrayals rather than the "masked" characters of ''Căderea Bastiliei''.&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; He argues: "Whichever way you look at it, set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s, the novel stands only to gain."&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; The narrative focus is on the [[kitsch]]y ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of [[Shakespearean tragedy]] into a single show of regular proportions.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], [[Euripides]] and [[Molière]], while adopting the format of a [[detective novel]].&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt;

Ciotloş reproached ''Crime la Elsinore'' for lack of subtlety, in the presence of a "not exactly indispensable" [[glossary]] of terms which was published with the book.&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; Although he acknowledges that the writing is "amusing", he also contends that it is "impossible to extend [[Sociology|sociologically]] or connect to some reality", being isolated "in its own world", and displaying "compositional precariousness."&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; He concludes: "A book perfect in its own way, but far from perfection in ours."&lt;ref name="cccaderea"/&gt; A similar overview is provided by Burţa-Cernat, who contends that, in taking sides and explaining his intentions, the author adopts "the manner of an untalented journalist", with "see-through" results.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt; She also believes that Gârbea's chief comedic resource is "the cheap [[anecdote]] with a trite climax", which she compares with those published by the communist-era magazine ''[[Urzica (magazine)|Urzica]]''.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt; Additionally, Burţa-Cernat comments on the irony of Cosma's reliance on intertextuality, which she finds similar to Gârbea's own work for the stage.&lt;ref name="bbcradem"/&gt; Critic [[Andrei Terian]] noted that he disliked almost all the book, because of its author's tendency to humiliate his characters "before us readers are in the least familiarized with them."&lt;ref name="atfratele"/&gt;

In ''Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici'', Gârbea revisits the main themes of Romanian literature, looking into the biographies of various fictional characters, their lifestyles, personal preferences and social positioning. He himself defined the overview as "a sort of collection of essays on the edge of literary history."&lt;ref name="abprofesia"/&gt; One of its chapters compares the [[tabletop game]]s entertaining such figures, from the [[contract bridge]] parties in [[Camil Petrescu]]'s books and the antiquated [[card game]]s in Mateiu Caragiale's ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' to the cruder [[craps]] and [[gambling]] preferred by thieves in [[Eugen Barbu]]'s novels.&lt;ref name="emscriitori"/&gt; Other sections discuss the attitudes toward love in such diverse places as [[Marin Sorescu]]'s neorealist prose and the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] short stories of [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref name="emscriitori"/&gt; Likewise, the avatars of violence are depicted between Ion Luca Caragiale's satire ''[[D-ale carnavalului]]'', where people threaten to poison each other with [[sulfuric acid]], [[Anton Bacalbaşa]]'s depictions of officers disciplining their subordinates with the use of belts, and [[Marin Preda]]'s ''[[Moromeţii]]'', where peasants beat each other with clubs.&lt;ref name="emscriitori"/&gt; Another part of the book deals with the incidence of failure among intellectual protagonists, and leads Gârbea to conclude that, with the exception of [[Mihail Sebastian]]'s ''[[Accidentul]]'', Romanian narratives generally show their intellectual protagonists incapable of finding their way in life.&lt;ref name="sdpitor"/&gt; According to [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]], Gârbea generally and willingly limited the scope of his investigation to canonical and urbane [[literary realism]], avoiding [[Allegory|allegorical]] styles such as [[Onirism]]: "the author is not interested in symbolic codification, in the [[refraction]] of the characters and their fictional world; but, quite the contrary, in the points and lines at which literature intersects with social life."&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;

In his review of the volume, Emil Mladin deemed it "wonderful" and "an extremely welcome project", noting: "''Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici'' represents a link which the reader needed in his relationship with the characters of stories relevant both at the time of their writing and today."&lt;ref name="emscriitori"/&gt; According to literary critic Silvia Dumitrache, the book creates "new paths in interpretation [...] even when starting from literary locations that are often threatened with turning into clichés."&lt;ref name="sdpitor"/&gt; She concludes "Through the playful note he impresses on the book, Horia Gârbea proves that his main intention does not reside in the willingness to impose a new [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] grid on Romanian literature, but in the attempt to demonstrate that the resources of literature can never, ever, be entirely exhausted."&lt;ref name="sdpitor"/&gt; Cristea-Enache sees in ''Trecute vieţi de fanţi şi de birlici'' "a book as interesting as it is enjoyable [...]. A holiday read, one could say, had this sytagm not been bastardized, in our country, by so many printed works (volumes and journals alike) that offend the reader's intellect."&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;

Outside the critical reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]]. One such chapter is built around the polemic between Gârbea and writer [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], over the issue of what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged.&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt; Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of [[instant messaging]] on the [[Romanian lexis]], with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as ''sal'' (for ''salut'', "hello"), ''vb'' (''vorbim'', "we'll talk") and ''ms'' (''mersi'', "thanks").&lt;ref name="sdpitor"/&gt; Gârbea also pokes fun at the [[babytalk]]-based [[jargon]] of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor.&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt; It reads: "[He] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When I call him using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, for the first time in life, an inexplicable creature."&lt;ref name="dc-ejoc"/&gt;

===Other works===
''Fratele mai deştept al lui Kalaşnikov'', which comprises several stories, received mixed reviews. According to Andrei Terian, the main one, ''Articolul 96'' ("Article 96"), which is about a lecherous politician dating an [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]] model, has the same defects as ''Crime...''.&lt;ref name="atfratele"/&gt; In contrast, Terian notes, Gârbea shows his "sure hand" in other pieces, where he parodies ''Povestea unui om leneş'' ("The Story of a Lazy Man") by 19th century Romanian classic [[Ion Creangă]], or where he pokes fun at the 14th century [[Battle of Rovine]], as well as the [[Absurdism|absurdist]] ''Întoarcerea tatei din război. Subiecte'' ("Father's Return from War. Subjects"), where the same narrative cliché is explored from several conflicting perspectives.&lt;ref name="atfratele"/&gt; According to Terian, the volume as a whole displays influences from poet and satirist [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as borrowings from fellow parodist [[Ioan Groşan]].&lt;ref name="atfratele"/&gt;

''Azerbaijan - The Living Flame'' details Gârbea's trip and offers additional insight into the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and other conflicts between [[Azerbaijani people]] and [[Armenians]]. It features his poems about [[Shusha]] city, the [[Khojaly Massacre]] and the [[Guba mass grave]].&lt;ref name="trendflame"/&gt; The texts received criticism from the [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian Romanian]] community's ''Ararat'' journal: it specifically called "disinformation" the fragments which refer to [[Christianity in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan's Christian past]], and expressed concern over Gârbea's claim that [[Heydar Aliyev]] was "a civilizing providential hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.araratonline.com/2010/03/03/despre-un-neverosimil-%E2%80%9Efoc-viu%E2%80%9C/ "Despre un neverosimil 'foc viu' "], in ''Ararat'', March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kagome Kagome''''' (かごめかごめ, or 籠目籠目) is a [[List of Japanese games|Japanese children's game]] and the song associated with it.  One player is chosen as the ''[[Oni (Japanese folklore)|oni]]'' (literally [[demon]] or [[ogre]], but similar to the concept of "it" in [[tag (game)|tag]]) and sits blindfolded (or with their eyes covered).  The other children join hands and walk in circles around the ''Oni'' while chanting the song for the game.  When the song stops, the ''Oni'' tries to name the person standing directly behind them.

The song is a subject of much interest because of its cryptic lyrics which vary from region to region, and many theories exist about its meaning, but neither have been definitely explained.

==Lyrics==
In Japanese, the song has different lyrics depending on the region, but the most commonly known version is:
{|-
| style="border: 1px solid #2f6fab;" | '''[[Japanese language|Japanese characters]]''' || style="border: 1px solid #2f6fab;" | '''[[romaji|English transliteration (Romaji)]]'''
|-
| かごめかごめ 籠の中の鳥は || Kagome kagome / Kago no naka no tori wa
|-
| いついつ出やる　夜明けの晩に || Itsu itsu deyaru / Yoake no ban ni
|-
| 鶴と亀が滑った || Tsuru to kame ga subetta.
|-
| 後ろの正面だあれ|| Ushiro no shoumen daare
|}
The most common interpretation is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kagome kagome / The bird in the basket/cage,&lt;br&gt;
When, oh when will it come out&lt;br&gt;
In the night of dawn&lt;br&gt;
The crane and turtle slipped&lt;br&gt;
Who is behind you now?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the song is typically written in a single line without any punctuation, in addition to the odd phrasing and ambiguous words, it is also unclear which phrases are connected to which (For example, "In the night of dawn" could be an answer to "when oh when will it come out", or could be a setting for "the crane and turtle slipped").

Common variations in the song include replacing "夜明けの晩に" ("in the evening of the dawn") with "夜明けの番人" ("the guard at/of dawn"), and "後ろの正面" ("in front of behind") with "後ろの少年" ("the boy behind"). There are countless variations in history, many of which can be found recorded in writing. &lt;ref&gt;「竹堂随筆」(1820)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;「戻橋背御摂」(1813)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;「月花茲友鳥」(1823)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;「幼稚遊昔雛形」(1844)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;「俚謡集拾遺」(1915)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of Lyrics==
Many theories surround the meanings of the various phrases in the song.&lt;ref&gt;Yanagita Kunio,『民間伝承論』(1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yanagita Kunio,「こども風土記」(1942)&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

===Kagome===
*"Kagome" (籠目): The holes in a basket
*A corruption of "kakome" ("surround")
*The shape of the holes in a traditional basket, a hexagon
*The shape of the holes in a traditional, including the woven material, a hexagram (Star of David)
*"Kagome" (籠女): A pregnant woman
*Kagome - a caged bird
* Kagome - "Circle you"
*Can also mean "lost"

===Kago no naka no tori wa===
*As "kago" can mean both "cage" and "basket", a bird in a basket would, by the standards of the age, be a chicken
*It is possible that "tori" is supposed to be a metaphor for [[torii]], and that [[kago]] (typically woven out of bamboo) refers to a bamboo fence, and that thus the "torii surrounded by bamboo" is in fact a Shinto shrine.
*In the case that kagome is interpreted as "pregnant woman", the bird in the cage is her unborn child.

===Itsu itsu deyaru===
*Can also be "itsu itsu deau" ("When oh when will we meet")
*Can mean "When will it come out?"
*Can mean "When can it come out?"

===Yoake no ban ni===
*Can simply mean night
*Can mean "from morning till night"
*Can mean an inability to see light
*Can mean a period of time that can be taken as either dawn or night (around 4 AM)
*As "yoake" literally means the end of night, and "ban" can refer to both night or evening, this can be a purposeful contradiction referring to a time period that does not exist

===Tsuru to kame ga subetta===
*The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of good fortune, and thus their slipping can mean the coming of misfortune
*The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of long life, and thus their slipping can mean the coming of death
*"Subetta" can be taken to be "統べった" or "統べた" ("to rule over"), in which case the crane and turtle symbolize a ruler
*Could be a corruption of a line from a Kyoto nursery rhyme, "tsurutsuru tsuppaita"

===Ushiro no shoumen daare===
*Can simply mean "who stands behind"
*Can be taken to mean "who is it that stands right in front when you look behind" in a figurative manner, referring to hidden people in positions of power
*Can be taken to be something said by someone who has been beheaded, whose head is looking at his own back
*Can be taken to be something said by someone who is about to be beheaded, in which case the question "who is it who stands behind me" is in other words "who is my executioner"

==Theories==
The song is a subject of much academic interest and many theories surround its origin and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Yanagita Kunio,『民間伝承論』(1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yanagita Kunio,「こども風土記」(1942)&lt;/ref&gt; Some such theories are:
;The lyrics refer to the game only
:In this theory the lyrics mean "Surround, surround (the Oni) / When will the Oni be able to switch roles with the next person? / Who is it standing behind you?".
;The song is about a prostitute
:In this theory the lyrics refer to a woman forced into prostitution (the bird in a cage) who has seen so many men that she cannot remember all of them ("who is it who stands behind" refers to the next person in line) and wonders when she will be able to escape (when oh when will it escape).
;The song is about a pregnant woman
:In this theory the "kagome" is a pregnant woman. Someone pushes her down a flight of stairs ("tsuru to kame ga subetta") and she miscarries, and wonders who killed her child ("ushiro no shoumen daare").
;The song is about a convict to be executed
:The "kagome" is a prison cell, and the bird is its prisoner. "Tsuru to kame ga subetta" symbolizes the end of life and fortune, and "ushiro no shoumen daare" is either the prisoner wondering who his executioner is, or his disembodied head gazing at his own body.

==In popular media==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
* The song is used in the film and manga series "[[Kami-sama no Iu Toori]]" (As The Gods Will), as four floating [[Kokeshi|wooden dolls]] (known as Tarou, Akemi, Hanako, and Kenichi) kill any player who fails or refuses to play the song-game.
* In the manga ''[[After School Nightmare]]'', [[Setona Mizushiro|the author]] mentions the rhyme, explaining that the recurring motif of cages throughout the work are a metaphor relating to the rhyme. In keeping with the themes of the manga, she interprets the rhyme as being about miscarriage.
* The song features prominently in the Japanese [[visual novel]]s [[Remember11]], [[Chaos;Head]] and [[Robotics;Notes]]. In the latter two the song appears as being important to a secret society.
* A song called "Kagome Kagome" ("Circle you, Circle you") is based on the song and game, but has a more horror-oriented version than the original. It was created by producer Kamiyanagi using the Japanese singing synthesizer [[Vocaloid]] and sung by [[Hatsune Miku]] and Megurine Luka.
* In the anime/manga [[Inuyasha]] by [[Rumiko Takahashi]], the protagonist [[Kagome Higurashi]] didn't like her name in her youth because the other children kept teasing her for having the same name as the song. In episode 16 of the anime series ''[[Inuyasha#Inuyasha: The Final Act|Inuyasha: The Final Act]]'', Kagome flashbacks to her younger self playing it with other kids.
* In the game [[The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil|Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], the extra-stage boss has a Spell Card (special attack) called "Kagome, Kagome". In [[Imperishable Night|Touhou 8: Imperishable Night]], the fifth stage's theme is an arrangement of this song called: Cinderella Cage ~ Kagome-Kagome.
* In the horror game [[Fatal Frame]], ghost children are shown singing this at the beginning of the second chapter.
* In the Japanese version of [[Terranigma]], the dolls summoned by Bloody Mary sing this rhyme. This sequence proved extremely problematic in the English translation, as the sequence required the player to attack the doll that stopped behind them to proceed, but an overly-literal translation, combined with the dolls' movements not syncing up with the much slower-displaying English text, made it difficult to understand what to do.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* In the horror manga ''[[Ibitsu]]'' by Ryou Haruto, a little girl often says "kagome, kagome", playing with the name of the song and with her own name.
* In the anime series [[Tactics (manga)|Tactics]] (2004), directed by Hiroshi Watanabe, episode three revolves around a mountain god and uses the Kagome song to choose victims.
* In the game [[Corpse Party#Blood Covered and BloodCovered: ...Repeated Fear|Corpse Party: Blood Covered ...Repeated Fear]] the song is heard in the 5th chapter when the protagonist explores the bomb shelter.
*In the game [[Corpse Party#Book of Shadows|Corpse Party: Book of Shadows]] the song is heard in the chapter Purgatory while the protagonist explores the bomb shelter.
*In the anime series "[[Ghost Stories (anime)|Ghost Stories]]" this song is sung by a group of toys in the 11th episode.
*In the video game [[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]] a group of children sing a song to the tune of Kagome that teaches the player how to cross an impassable sea.
*In the song "魑魅魍魎ノ跳梁跋扈 (Chimimouryou no Chouryoubakko)" by japanese visual kei band 己龍(Kiryu).
* In the song 蝕紅 by the Japanese band [[Dir En Grey]] from their album Vulgar.
* In the horror game Misao, the player can hear the song being sung while exploring a hallway.
* In [[Re:Kinder]], after exploring a room in one house, this song can be heard by exiting that room.

'''''Krapp's Last Tape''''' is a [[one-act play]], in English, by [[Samuel Beckett]].  With a cast of one man, it was written for Northern Irish actor [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] and first titled "Magee [[monologue]]".  (Patrick Magee is familiar to many moviegoers as the writer who Alex cripples while invading his home and raping his wife in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.)  It was inspired by Beckett's experience of listening
to Magee reading extracts from ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' and ''[[From an Abandoned Work]]'' on the [[BBC Third Programme]] in December 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Reading]] Library MS 1227/7/7/1, as cited in James Knowlson, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm  "''Krapp's Last Tape'': the evolution of a play"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424084731/http://english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}, ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 1.1. &lt;!--Needs date of publication and page numbers, inclusive--&gt;: "The first known holograph is contained in the ''Été 56'' notebook in [[University of Reading|Reading University]] Library. It is headed ''Magee monologue'' and is dated 20 February 1958."&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was first performed as a curtain raiser to ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' (from 28 October to 29 November 1958) at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, directed by [[Donald McWhinnie]] and starring Patrick Magee.  It ran for 38 performances.

''Krapp's Last Tape'' premiered in North America at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]], with the lead role played by Canadian actor [[Donald Davis (actor)|Donald Davis]], who won an [[Obie Award]] in 1960 for his performance in the play.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gussow|first1=Mel|title=Donald Davis, 69, Actor in Challenging Roles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/28/arts/donald-davis-69-actor-in-challenging-roles.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=28 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===First publication===
In a letter to a London bookseller Jake Schwartz on 15 March 1958, Beckett wrote that he had "'four states, in typescript, with copious notes and dirty corrections, of a short stage monologue I have just written (in English) for Pat Magee. This was composed on the machine from a tangle of old notes, so I have not the [[Manuscript|MS]] to offer you."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Jacob Schwartz (bookseller)|Jake Schwartz]], a bookseller in London, as qtd. in Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 136; the quoted letter is held at the Beckett Collection, Humanities Research Center, [[University of Texas at Austin]], along with the typescript to which it refers.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ackerley and Gontarski, "It was first published in ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' 2.5 (summer 1958), then in ''Krapp's Last Tape and Embers'' (Faber, 1959), and ''Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces'' (Grove, 1960)."&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley, and S. E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett’s own translation of the play into French, ''La Dernière Bande'', was published in ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'' on 4 March 1959.

The available printed texts must not be taken as definitive. "By the mid-1950s Beckett was already talking and working like a director. In a letter to [[Barney Rosset|Rosset's]] editorial assistant, Judith Schmidt, on 11 May 1959, Beckett referred to the ''staging'' of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' as its 'creation'," and he made numerous significant changes to the text over the years as he was involved in directing the play.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Gontarski, "Beckett in Performance" 200, in Lois Oppenheim, ed., ''Palgrave Advances in Samuel Beckett Studies'' (London: Palgrave, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
The first German performance, on 28 September 1959, was directed by Walter Henn at Berlin's ''Schillertheater'', where 10 years later, on 5 October 1969, Samuel Beckett himself staged his text in a most successful performance (with [[Martin Held]] as Krapp).&lt;br /&gt;
The first American performance, on 14 January 1960, was directed by [[Alan Schneider]] and starred [[Donald George Davis|Donald Davis]].

==Synopsis==
{{Plot|date=May 2012}}

The curtain rises on "[a] late evening in the future."&lt;ref name="Samuel Beckett 1984"&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 55.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Krapp’s 69th birthday and he hauls out his old tape recorder, reviews one of the earlier years –  the recording he made when he was 39 – and makes a new recording commenting on the last 12 months.

Krapp is sitting in his den, lit by the white light above his desk. Black-and-white imagery continues throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 486.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]", in ''[[The Times]]'', Saturday Review, 25 April 1970, as qtd. in James Knowlson and [[John Pilling]], ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his desk are a tape-recorder and a number of tins containing reels of recorded tape.  He consults a  ledger. The tape he is looking to review is the fifth tape in Box 3. He reads aloud from the ledger but it is obvious that words alone are not jogging his memory. He takes childish pleasure in saying the word ‘spool’.

The tape dates from when he turned 39. His taped voice is strong and rather self-important.

The voice mentions that he’s just celebrated his birthday alone "at the wine house" jotting down notes in preparation for the recording session later. His [[Intestine|bowel]] trouble is still a problem and one obviously exacerbated by eating too many bananas. "The new light above my table is a great improvement,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 57&lt;/ref&gt; reports the 39-year-old Krapp, before describing how much he enjoys leaving it, wandering off into the darkness, so that he can return to the zone of light which he identifies with his essential self. He notes how quiet the night is.

The voice reports that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties. It amuses him to comment on his impressions of what he was like in his twenties and even the 69-year-old Krapp joins in the derisory laughter. The young man he was back then is described as idealistic, even unrealistic in his expectations. The 39-year-old Krapp looks back on the 20-odd-year-old Krapp with the same level of contempt as the 20-odd-year-old Krapp appears to have displayed for the young man he saw himself for in his late teens. Each can see clearly the fool he was but only time will reveal what kind of fool he has become.

The voice reviews his last year, when his mother died. He talks about sitting on a bench outside the [[nursing home]] waiting for the news that she had died. When the moment comes he is in the process of throwing a rubber ball to a dog. He ends up simply leaving the ball with the creature even though a part of him regrets not hanging onto it as some kind of memento. Krapp at 69 is more interested in his younger self's use of the rather archaic word "viduity" (Beckett had originally used "widowhood" in early drafts) than in the reaction of the voice on the tape to their mother's passing. He stops listening to look up the word in a large dictionary.

He returns to the tape. The voice starts to describe the revelation he experienced at the end of a pier.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian Mercier, ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990) 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Krapp grows impatient and gets worked up when his younger self starts enthusing about this. He fast-forwards almost to the end of the tape to escape the onslaught of words. Suddenly the mood has changed and he finds himself in the middle of a description of a romantic liaison between himself and a woman in a punt. Krapp lets it play out and then rewinds the tape to hear the complete episode. Throughout it he remains transfixed and visibly relives the moment while it is retold.

Afterwards, Krapp carefully removes this tape, locates a fresh one, loads it, checks the back of an envelope where he has made notes earlier, discards them and starts. He is scathing when it comes to his assessment of his thirty-nine-year-old self and is glad to see the back of him. He finds he has nothing he wants to record for posterity, save the fact he "Revelled in the word ''spool''."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  But he does mention a trip to the park and attending [[Vespers]], where he dozed off and fell off the pew. He also mentions his recent literary disappointments: "seventeen copies sold", presumably of his last book, eleven of which have gone not to interested readers but to foreign libraries; "Getting known," he sarcastically summarises. His sex life has been reduced to periodic visits by an old prostitute recalling the jibes made in ''[[Eh Joe]]'': "That slut that comes on Saturday, you pay her, don't you? ... [[History of the British penny (1901-1970)|Penny]] a hoist tuppence as long as you like."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his younger selves, Krapp has nothing good to say about the man he has become and even the idea of making one "last effort"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 63.&lt;/ref&gt; when it comes to his writing upsets him. He retreats into memories from his dim and distant past, gathering holly and walking the dog of a Sunday morning. He then remembers the girl on the punt, wrenches off the tape he has been recording, throws it away and replays the entire section again from the previous tape. It is a scene of masochism reminiscent of Croak in ''Words and Music'', tormenting himself with an image of a woman’s face. This time he allows the tape to play out. It ends with the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp determinedly not regretting the choices he has made, certain that what he would produce in the years to come would more than compensate him for any potential loss of happiness.

Krapp makes no response to this but allows the tape to play on until the final curtain. "Krapp’s spool of life is almost wound, and the silent tape is both the time it has left to run and the silence into which he must pass."&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the younger Krapp talks about the "fire in me"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; the tired old man who sits listening is simply "burning to be gone."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The title of the play seems obvious, that what we have witnessed is the recording of Krapp’s final tape, "yet there is an [[ambiguity]]: 'last' can mean 'most recent' as well as 'ultimate'.  The speaker in [[Robert Browning|Browning's]] ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is already planning to marry his next duchess ... Still, one hopes for Krapp's sake that he will be gone before another year is over."&lt;ref&gt;Vivian Mercier, ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990) 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
In ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Beckett uses aspects of [[Judeo-Christian]]ity as the template for his play, in ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' the template is the writings of [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], and in ''Krapp's Last Tape'', according to [[Anthony Cronin]], he uses [[Manichaeism]] as a structural device: &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[dichotomy]] of light and dark ... is central to Manichaean doctrine ... Its adherents believed that the world was ruled by evil powers, against which the god of the whole of creation struggled as yet in vain ... Krapp is in violation of the three seals or prohibitions of Manichaeism for the elect: the seal of the hands, forbidding engagement in a profession, the seal of the breast against sexual desire, and the seal of the mouth, which forbids the drinking of wine ... Beckett [however] seems to have known no more about Manichaeism than is contained in the eleventh edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], which he possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 485, 486.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characters==
Although there is only one person onstage, there are a number of 'characters' mentioned throughout. The play is considered to be Beckett at his most autobiographical, and it does draw heavily on biographical detail. He once told the scholar Lawrence Harvey, though, that his "work does not depend on experience – [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it."&lt;ref&gt;Undated interview with Lawrence Harvey, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 371, 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett takes elements from his own life, his failed love life, his drinking, his – at the time – literary failures and looks where things might have gone. "When, in 1956, [[Vivian Mercier]] saw him in Paris, he told him that he felt 'all dried up, with nothing left but self-translation.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 472&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp
Krapp was originally designated simply ‘A’ in the first draft. The first appearance of a title was "a manuscript edition to Typescript 2: ''Crapp’s Last Tape''";&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 138.&lt;/ref&gt; the more familiar Germanic spelling came later. The name Krapp with its [[wikt:crap|excremental connotations]] had been used before by Beckett however. In his first play, ''[[Eleutheria (play)|Eleutheria]]'', dating back to 1947, the protagonist is Victor Krap, a young man who has decided to retreat from life and do nothing. He has been described as a world-weary [[anti-hero]], a failed writer and seedy [[Solipsism|solipsist]], a clear prototype for the later Krapp.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Buning (President, Dutch Samuel Beckett Society), ''[http://samuel-beckett.net/Eleutheria_Revisited.html Eleutheria Revisited]'', public lecture delivered at Teatro Quijano, [[Ciudad Real]], Spain, 2 December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp (as a boy)
When the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp is talking about his neighbour's ritual singing in the evening he tries to remember if he sang as a boy and is unable to do so. He does recall attending [[Vespers]] but it would be unusual for him to attend [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] without participating in the singing of the hymn. The sixty-nine-year-old Krapp sings a few lines from the "Now the Day is Over" in early performances of the play but Beckett excised this as being "too clumsily explicit".&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm "''Krapp's Last Tape'': The Evolution of a play, 1958–75"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424084731/http://english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}, ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 1 (Winter 1976): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no time frame is given, it is likely that sixty-nine-year-old Krapp's memories of being "again in the dingle at Christmas Eve, gathering holly ... [or] on [[Croghan Mountain|Croghan]] on a Sunday morning, in the haze, with the bitch"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; alludes to Beckett's own childhood familial memories.&lt;ref&gt;D.

;Krapp (in his twenties)
His birth-sign in early drafts is given as [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], Beckett's own. All we learn about Krapp at this age comes from the tape. Like a lot of young men he is full of "aspirations" – his work is starting to take shape – and "resolutions" – he is already aware that his drinking needs to be curbed. He is becoming resigned to the fact that he might well have let true love – represented by the image of a "girl in a shabby green coat, on a railway-station platform" – get away from him. He has settled for an on/off relationship with a "Bianca" but even there his future plans do not feature her. We learn that his problem with constipation has been ongoing since at least this time. He disparages his youth and is glad it is over. The thirty-nine-year-old Krapp estimates that the tape he had been listening to was made some ten or twelve years earlier. If it was twelve then he would have been twenty-seven at the time it was recorded.

;Bianca
"In the earlier drafts the woman with whom the young Krapp lived [later named "Bianca"] was first named 'Alba' (a character in ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'' modelled on Ethna MacCarthy whom he had loved when he was a young man), then 'Celia' (the name of the green-eyed prostitute with whom Murphy cohabits in ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''), then 'Furry' (nickname of Anne Rudmose-Brown, the wife of Beckett's French Professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity]], who was himself satirised as 'the Polar Bear' in ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'').".&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 303&lt;/ref&gt;

He settled on 'Bianca', who was most likely based on another lecturer, Bianca Esposito, who (along with [[Walter Starkie]]) taught him Italian and cultivated his lifelong passion for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].  He took private lessons from Signorina Esposito as well.  Those lessons at 21 Ely Place were then caricatured in the short story '[[More Pricks Than Kicks|Dante and the Lobster]]'. Kedar Street is not a real location but an [[anagram]] of 'darke' or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for 'black'.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping this in mind, the name may simply have been selected because "''bianca''" means "white woman" in Italian. Little is recorded about her other than "'a tribute to her eyes. Very warm.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vivian Mercier]], who knew Beckett personally, writes: "Although I do not recall his ever using the phrase, Beckett unquestionably regards the eyes as the windows of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 131&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp's father
Krapp’s father, the only other man mentioned in the play, is spoken of only very briefly. The expression "Last illness" suggests he has not been a well man for some time and dies while Krapp is in his twenties. His own father, William Beckett, died of a heart attack on 26 June 1933, when Beckett was twenty-seven.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

;The girl in the green coat
Beckett's first love, his cousin, [[Peggy Sinclair]], had "deep green eyes and [had a] passionate love of green clothing."&lt;ref&gt;Bair, D., ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990), p 79&lt;/ref&gt;  An allusion to Peggy Sinclair also appears in ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'' in Smeraldina, the "little [[emerald]]".  Although the relationship is often cited as being a little one-sided, Beckett does recall: "Oh, Peggy didn’t need any chasing."&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson and E. Knowlson, eds, ''Beckett Remembering / Remembering Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2006) 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp (aged 39)
This character does the majority of the talking throughout the play. His voice is contained on Tape 5 from Box 3. His voice is strong and rather pompous. He has celebrated his birthday alone in an empty wine house before returning home to consume three bananas. As has become his practice on his birthday he makes a tape looking back at who he was, assessing who he is and anticipating what might be to come. His is as disparaging of the young man he was in his twenties as he was then of the youth he had been thinking about when he made that earlier tape. He records the death of his mother, an epiphany at the end of a pier and an idyllic moment in a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].

;Old Mrs McGlome
This character is based on Miss Beamish, an eccentric novelist from [[Connacht]] whom Beckett had met in [[Roussillon]], while hiding during [[World War II]]. "Whether the real Miss Beamish did actually sing regularly every evening is ... debatable. Beckett did not remember this."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with James Knowlson, July 1989, cited in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 330, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The dark young beauty
There appears to be no direct correlation between this character and anyone living. The black-and-white imagery is strong here: her white uniform and the "big black hooded [[Baby transport#Pushable vehicles|perambulator]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Krapp also remembers this woman’s eyes as being "[l]ike ... [[Olivine|chrysolite]]!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Rosemary Pountney observes Beckett changed "[[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]]" to chrysolite, an olive-green coloured mineral, in Typescript 4.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

She observes also that Beckett made "a direct connection ... with ''[[Othello]]'', a play in which dark and light imagery is central," as "in the margin of the text that he used for the 1973 London production," on page 15 where the word 'chrysolite' occurs ... he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If heaven would make me such another world&lt;br&gt;
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite&lt;br&gt;
I’d not have sold her for it&lt;br&gt;
''Othello'' V2.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Like Othello, too," Pountney continues, "Krapp has lost his love through his own folly."&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp's mother
Beckett’s mother, May, died on 25 August 1950 in the Merrion Nursing Home which overlooked Dublin’s [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]]. Beckett had made the trip over in the early summer to be with her. By 24 July medical opinion confirmed that she was dying. During that last long month he used "to walk disconsolately alone along the [[towpath]] of the Grand Canal."&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end she was oblivious to his presence. Her death took place while he was sitting on a bench by the canal. "At a certain point he happened to look up. The blinds of his mother’s window, a dirty red-brown affair, was down. She was dead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 407.&lt;/ref&gt;  A drawn blind, an old custom signifying death, also makes an appearance in ''[[Rockaby]]'': "let down the blind and down".&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, citing Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The little white dog
When Krapp’s mother died, he was throwing a ball for a little white dog. He says he will keep it forever: "But I gave it away to the dog."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly the ball is black to contrast with the white of the dog. In ''All Strange Away'' a "small grey punctured rubber ball"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, "All Strange Away", in ''Beckett Short No 3'' (London: Calder Publication [1976] 1999) 33.&lt;/ref&gt; is the last object contemplated before Fancy dies. The ball had already appeared in ''[[All That Fall]]'': Jerry returns "a kind of ball"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; to Mr. Rooney.  Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant [[Motif (literature)|motif]] of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.

;The girl in the punt
Beckett makes the relationship of this woman to Krapp clear when "[i]n 1975, directing Pierre Chabert in Paris, Beckett said: 'I thought of writing a play on the opposite situation, with ''Mrs Krapp, the girl in the punt'', nagging away behind him, in which case his failure and his solitude would be exactly the same.'"&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 303.&lt;/ref&gt; In her biography of Beckett, [[Deirdre Bair]] deduces that "the girl in the punt" may be [[Peggy Sinclair]] because of the references to "Effi" and to "the [[Baltic states|Baltic]]": in July 1929 Beckett vacationed with the Sinclairs "in one of the smaller resort towns along the [[Baltic Sea]]. Summer, traditionally the time for light reading, found Peggy tearfully engrossed in [[Theodor Fontane]]'s novel, ''[[Effi Briest]]''. Beckett read it too, but with more detachment than Peggy, who wept and suffered as Effi's infidelity ended her marriage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Talking to James Knowlson, a few days before his death, Beckett said that he "did not remember the scene this way, however, denying that girl in the boat ... had anything at all to do with his cousin, Peggy."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with James Knowlson, 17 November 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443. From the emendations made by James Knowlson in ''Beckett Remembering / Remembering Beckett'' published in 2006, it appears that Beckett’s memory about those events could have been inaccurate.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowlson feels "that there is little doubt the source for the girl with the haunting eyes is Ethna MacCarthy. For, as ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'' had made clear ... the 'Alba', who, on Beckett’s own admission, was closely modelled on Ethna, had eyes like dark, deep pools."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with James Knowlson, 13 September 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett left no doubt however when he told Jean Martin, whilst rehearsing the play in 1970, that the girl was modelled on Ethna.&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 576.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 1957 Beckett learned that Ethna was terminally ill and regularly wrote uncharacteristically long letters until her death. When he completed the play he wrote her: "I’ve written in English a stage monologue for Pat Magee which I think you will like if no one else."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Ethna MacCarthy, 2 June 1958, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in the recollection, the young Krapp leans over the young woman to shade her from the sun. "Let me in," he says. This caused the [[Lord Chamberlain]] some concerns when the play was first presented before him to grant a [[Lord Chamberlain#Theatre censorship|license]]. He believed that what was being suggested was a desire for sexual penetration and was not convinced that Beckett was simply alluding to her eyes. It was not until a mere three weeks before the play's opening that the objection was dropped. In 1982 Beckett, in response to a similar suggestion from one of James Knowlson's [[Graduate school|postgraduate students]], "said with a chuckle, 'Tell her to read her texts more carefully. She'll see that Krapp would need to have a penis at an angle of a hundred and eighty degrees to make coitus possible in the position he is in!'"&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 451.&lt;/ref&gt;––a position that Rosette Lamont proposes also "suggests that of a [[Breastfeeding|suckling babe]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rosette Lamont, "Beckett's ''Eh Joe'': Lending an Ear to the Anima", 234 in ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'', ed. Linda Ben-Zvi (Urbana and Chicago: U of Illinois P, 1992) 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Krapp (aged 69)

Beckett would not be 69 until 1975 so, from his perspective, with Krapp a proxy for him, the action is set in the future. The first line of the play explicitly sets it 'in the future',&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 137:  "A specific date variously tried out at the opening of Typescript 3 is ... subsequently omitted: '&lt;s&gt;April 1986&lt;/s&gt;. A late evening [sic] &lt;s&gt;in 1985&lt;/s&gt; the nineteen eighties' [amended to simply] 'in the future' in the final text."&lt;/ref&gt; although nothing onstage reveals this. Beckett wrote this play shortly before he turned 52 years old. As it happens, with ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', success had found him but, at 39, the future must have seemed a lot bleaker for the writer, the Second World War was ending and all Beckett had had published were a few poems, a collection of short stories and the novel, ''Murphy''. Beckett had this to say about the drained old man we see onstage: "Krapp sees very clearly that he’s through with his work, with love and religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]", ''[[The Times]]'' 25 April 1970, Saturday Review; qtd. in James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Rick Cluchey]], whom he directed in 1977, that Krapp was "in no way senile [but has] something frozen about him [and is] filled up to his teeth with bitterness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 484, 485.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Habit, the great deadener"&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Waiting for Godot'', (1956; London: Faber and Faber, 1988) 91.&lt;/ref&gt; has proven more tenacious than inspiration. His "present concerns revolve around the gratification of those very bodily appetites that, earlier, he had resolved should be out of his life. Eating bananas and drinking have become a [daily routine]. Of the physical activities that he once considered excesses only sex has come to play a reduced part in his lonely existence"&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 81.&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of periodic visits from an old prostitute.

Although this is a play about memory, the sixty-nine-year-old Krapp himself remembers very little. Virtually all the recollections come from the tape. As evidenced most clearly in the novel ''Murphy'', Beckett had a decent understanding of a variety of mental illnesses including [[Korsakoff's syndrome|Korsakoff's Alcoholic Syndrome]]––"A [[hypomania]]c teaching slosh to a Korsakow's syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, ''Murphy'', (London: John Calder, 1963) 96&lt;/ref&gt;––which is characterised by powerful [[Amnesia|amnesic]] symptoms accompanied by [[Bowel obstruction|intestinal obstruction]].

In his focus on [[Alcoholism|chronic alcohol consumption]], Narinder Kapur explains in ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' that it can lead to marked memory loss and generalised cognitive defects, as well as "disorientation for time and also place". More recent memories are likely to be forgotten than remote memories, for "memory loss shows a temporal gradient with greater sparing of items from earlier years."&lt;ref&gt;N. Kapur, ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' (London: Butterworth, 1988) 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Krapp's gathering of red-berried [[holly]] in the dingle could be an example of the "relatively intact remote memory"&lt;ref&gt;P. Whitehouse, ed., ''Dementia'' (Philadelphia: F A Davis, 1998) 328.&lt;/ref&gt; that preceded Krapp's apparent addiction to alcohol.

Krapp is not a textbook case. He is an individual with his own individual symptomology but he is more than a list of symptoms. Bananas contain [[pectin]], a soluble fibre that can help normalise movement through the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] and ease constipation. Bananas can also aggravate constipation especially in young children. It depends what the root cause of the problem is. They are also high in Vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]] as well as [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]] and [[thiamine]] and one of the root causes of Korsakoff's Syndrome is thiamine deficiency; eating bananas would be good for him. It is easy to get caught up in this kind of over-analysis to the detriment of the play as a whole. "[A]ttempts to demonstrate that Beckett's characters conform to specific psychological syndromes so often turn into [[Will-o'-the-wisp|will-o-the-wisp]] pursuits. Certainly, Beckett would not deny that psychologists have offered very useful descriptions of mental activity. But their theories are typically no more than initial steps in an understanding of mental processes, fragmented bits of knowledge which should not be taken for universal principles."&lt;ref&gt;R. Rabinovitz, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num1112/065_RABINOVITZ.PDF "Beckett and Psychology"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221123042/http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num1112/065_RABINOVITZ.PDF |date=21 February 2007 }},  ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 11/12 (December 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to remember that Krapp has not simply forgotten his past but he has consciously and systematically rejected it as one way of reassuring himself that he has made the right decisions in "his yearly word letting."&lt;ref&gt;J. Malkin, "Matters of Memory in ''Krapp's Last Tape'' and ''Not I''", ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'' 11.2 (Spring 1997): 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Effi Briest
In the past year Krapp has been re-reading Fontane's ''[[Effi Briest]]'', "a page a day, with tears again," he says, "Could have been happy with her, up there on the Baltic...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984)  62.&lt;/ref&gt; Existing only on the printed page this fantasy woman is perhaps the most black-and-white of all Krapp’s women. Like the girl in the punt and the [[nursemaid]] mentioned earlier, perhaps to contrast with his inner fire, "Once again Beckett situates Krapp's memory on some side near the water."&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Lyons, ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fanny
Just as Krapp’s name is a [[Vulgarism|vulgar]] [[pun]], so is the name Beckett gave to the woman who visits him from time to time, whom he describes as a "bony old ghost of a whore."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As Fanny is an "old ghost," all Krapp's women are figuratively "ghosts, really, dependent for their existence on Krapp's bitter-sweet recording of them," according to [[Katherine Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Worth, "Women in Beckett's Radio and Television Plays" 236, in ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'', ed. Linda Ben-Zvi (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[wikt:fanny|Fanny]]" is a slang British expression for the female genitals – woman reduced to a function.  "Fanny" is also a commonly used diminutive of Frances, and Beckett occasionally referred to his aunt, Frances "Cissie" Sinclair, as "Fanny."&lt;ref&gt;[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 520; [[cf.]] James Knowlson, in ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) &lt;!--page refs.?--&gt;; Knowlson uses the alternative spelling "Fannie" instead of "Fanny."&lt;/ref&gt;

Krapp refers to her visits as "better than a kick in the crutch."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, S., ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1985 television version, Beckett changed this phrase to "better than the finger and the thumb,"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mith2.umd.edu/beckett/ Beckett directs Beckett]'', directed by [[Walter Asmus]] based on the [[mise en scène]] by Samuel Beckett) starring Rick Cluchley.&lt;/ref&gt; an unambiguous reference to masturbation that would never have escaped the British [[Lord Chamberlain]] in the fifties.

;Krapp's "vision at last", on the pier at [[Dún Laoghaire]]
In an earlier draft of the play Beckett "uses 'beacon' and '[[anemometer]]' rather than 'lighthouse' and 'wind-gauge'.  The anemometer on the East Pier of Dún Laoghaire was one of the world's first.  [It is] widely regarded as a mirror reflection of Beckett's own revelation. Yet it is different both in circumstance and kind."&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 352, citing [[Edna O'Brien]], ''The Beckett Country'' (Dublin: The Black Cat Press, 1986) 83, 355 n.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Beckett wrote to [[Richard Ellmann]]: 'All the jetty and howling wind are imaginary. It happened to me, summer 1945, in my mother's little house, named New Place, across the road from Cooldrinagh.'"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Richard Ellmann]], 27 January 1986; qtd. in John Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 772 n. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

He summarised what this experience signified for him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I realised that [[James Joyce|Joyce]] had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], interview with James Knowlson, 27 Oct. 1989, qtd. in Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;The tape recorder
Beckett has applied character to non-human elements in his plays before, e.g. the light in ''Play'', the music in ''[[Words and Music (play)|Words and Music]]''. "Beckett instructed the actor Pierre Chabert in his 1975 Paris production of the play 'to become as much as possible one body with the machine ... The spool is his whole life.'"&lt;ref&gt;"Beckett as Director", ''Gambit'' 7.28 (1976): 62,61; qtd. in Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama: 1956–1976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 173, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Krapp no longer owns the memories on the tapes. His mind is no longer capable of holding onto them. The recorder also serves as proxy. When John Hurt, as Krapp, is transfixed by the retelling of the events in the punt he literally cradles the machine as if it were the woman recalling Magee’s original performance; Beckett took pains to point this out to [[Alan Schneider]], who was at the time preparing his own version of the play, in a letter dated 21 November 1958, and incorporated the gesture in future productions in which he was involved.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alan Schneider, 21 Nov 1958, qtd. in M. Harmon, ed., ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider'' (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1998) 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on 4 January 1960, Beckett wrote a more detailed letter describing another unexpected revelation of that earlier performance, "the beautiful and quite accidental effect in London of the luminous eye burning up as the machine runs on in silence and the light goes down."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alan Schneider, 4 Jan 1960, qtd. in M. Harmon, ed., ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider'' (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1998) 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances of Krapp==

===David Kelly===
In 1996, the Gate Theatre visited the Lincoln center in New York where David Kelly performed ‘Krapp’ receiving standing ovations at every performance. Kelly had first performed the play in Dublin in 1959 and the original recordings of his ‘young self’ were discovered. These were painstakingly remastered by Noel Storey at Beacon studios in Dublin to be used on stage. It it believed to be the only time that real 30 year old recordings have been used.
The NY Times broke their own rules by sayin in their review that “Kelly’s performance is the best that will ever be”.

===Patrick Magee===
Beckett told [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], the original Krapp, that his "voice was the one which he heard inside his mind. Thus it seems likely that the return to English was a matter of expediency because of the English-speaking actor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Magee had a harsh, gravely voice which had little [[superficial charm]] but had a [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] effect on the listener ...

===Corin Redgrave===
[[Corin Redgrave]] performed the role of Krapp for [[BBC Radio 3]] in 2006 a few months after he had suffered a major heart attack.  The production was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 May 2010 as part of a double bill with a 2006 production of ''Embers''.

===Brian Dennehy===
[[Brian Dennehy]] performed the role of Krapp during the 2008 [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] and again in 2010 at the [[Goodman Theatre]] of Chicago, both times directed by [[Jennifer Tarver]].  The Beckett one-act was paired at both venues with [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Hughie]]'' (directed by [[Robert Falls]]), also a one-act, and also performed by Dennehy, in the lead role of [[Erie Smith]].  The show ran at the [[Goodman Theatre]] from 16 January through 28 February 2010. A Broadway run is also planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hughie/Krapp's Last Tape |url=http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/production.aspx?tess=3283 |publisher=Goodman Theatre |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228223835/http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/production.aspx?tess=3283 |archivedate=28 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Gambon===
In April 2010 Irish actor [[Michael Gambon]] continued his relationship with both Beckett and the [[Gate Theatre]] when he returned to the Dublin stage as Krapp for a limited run which was followed by a transfer to London's West End.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gate-theatre.ie/programme/138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Bremmer===

===Gerard Murphy===
In 2012, at [[Glasgow]]'s [[Citizens Theatre]], [[Gerard Murphy (Irish actor)|Gerard Murphy]] performed the role, even though he was suffering spinal cord compression due to prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/28/gerard-murphy |title=Gerard Murphy obituary |last=Coveney |first=Michael |date=28 August 2013 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===

Joe Gistirak played Krapp at the Above Board Theatre in 1978. It was directed by Michael Corrigan.

In 2018, Bob Nasmith played Krapp to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of [[Theatre Passe Muraille]] in a production directed by Mac Fyfe.

==Media recordings==
Beckett opposed vehemently the transfer of some of his works from one medium to another, but he did not oppose such recordings of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' as much as he did others.  For example, "A [[gramophone record]]ing (New York: Spoken Arts #788, 1960), based on the original American production, was distributed by [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo]] (RG 220), and by HEAR, Home Educational Records, London (1964),"&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 302.&lt;/ref&gt; and "It was often adapted for television with his encouragement." The first [[BBC]] version was produced by Peter Luke, featuring [[Cyril Cusack]] (13 November 1963).  Approached by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], [[Cologne]], to permit a television version of his 1969 Schiller-Theatre ''Das letzte Band'' [the German title of the play], Beckett wrote a set of "Suggestions for TV Krapp", which "was broadcast [on] 28th October 1969."&lt;ref&gt;C. Zilliacus, ''Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for Television and Radio'' (Åbo, Åbo Akademi, 1976); C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'', (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has subsequently been broadcast on radio, turned into an opera (see below) and filmed as part of the [[Beckett on Film]] project and for the DVD of Pinter's Royal Court performance, both of which have been shown on television.

==Musical adaptations==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
There have been several musical adaptations of ''Krapp's Last Tape'', most notably the opera ''[[Krapp, ou, La dernière bande]]'' by composer [[Marcel Mihalovici]]. American composer [[Earl Kim]] alludes to the work within his ''Gooseberries, she said'' (1967), part of the four-part cycle ''Exercises en Route''. The [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] composer [[Gyula Csapó]] has created the work ''Krapp's Last Tape –- after Samuel Beckett'' (1975) loosely inspired by Beckett's play.&lt;ref name=TMW&gt;[http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_csapo.html "Gyula Csapó"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625173347/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_csapo.html |date=25 June 2007 }}, ''The Modern Word'', accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This theatrical work is for a "violinist-actor," a tape recorder, four spotlights and a [[sine wave]] generator.&lt;ref name=TMW2&gt;''[http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_csapo_krapp.html Krapp's Last Tape –after Samuel Beckett] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165039/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_csapo_krapp.html |date=30 September 2007 }}'' (1975), ''The Modern Word'', accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the English experimental composer, [[Michael Parsons (composer)|Michael Parsons]], adapted ''Krapp's Last Tape'' for piano, two pre-recorded pianos, and voice on tape. The piece, specifically written for [[John Tilbury]], was called ''Krapp Music''.

==Allusions in popular culture==
The play was memorably [[parody|parodied]] in the television [[sketch comedy]] ''[[The Fast Show]]'', in which – as a reference to Max Wall – fictional [[music hall]] comedian [[Arthur Atkinson (character)|Arthur Atkinson]] played a comically more stoic version of Krapp.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|YK96IJnNse0|The Fast Show – Arthur Atkinson Complete Part 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the title of a track on Fredrik Thordendal's solo album [[Sol Niger Within]].
A prefiguring of the play, titled, "Krapp, 39" written and performed by Michael Laurence and directed by George Demas, premiered at the 2008 New York International Fringe Festival and begins its commercial run Off Broadway at The Soho Playhouse in New York City on 13 January 2009. The piece follows an actor's obsession with the character Krapp. In the Canadian film ''[[Meetings with a Young Poet]]'', the character of Lucia Martell wants the rights to the piece to transform it into a one-woman play as a vehicle for herself.

The play is mentioned in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' and in [[Spalding Gray]]'s 'A Personal History of the American Theatre', a 1985 monologue directed for television by [[Skip Blumberg]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Kyoto National Museum'''|京都国立博物館|''Kyōto Kokuritsu Hakubutsukan''}} is one of the major [[art museum]]s in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA671&amp;dq= "Museums"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 671-673.&lt;/ref&gt; Located in Kyoto's Higashiyama ward, the museum focuses on [[pre-modern Japan]]ese and [[Asia]]n art. 

==History==

The Kyoto National Museum, then the Imperial Museum of Kyoto, was proposed, along with the Imperial Museum of Tokyo ([[Tokyo National Museum]]) and the Imperial Museum of Nara ([[Nara National Museum]]), in 1889, and construction on the museum finished in October, 1895.  The museum was opened in 1897.  The museum went through a series of name changes, in 1900 changing its name to the Imperial Household Museum of Kyoto, and once more in 1924 to the Imperial Gift Museum of Kyoto.  The current name, the Kyoto National Museum, was decided upon in 1952.

===Timeline===
The growth and development of today's museum has been an evolving process:

==Layout==

The museum consists of several buildings, the most prominent being the Special Exhibition Hall (Main Exhibition Hall), designed by [[Katayama Tokuma|Katayama Tōkuma]] in 1895, and The Collections Hall (New Exhibition Hall), designed in 1966 by [[Morita Keiichi]]. In September 2014, the museum completed renovations on a new permanent collections hall, the Heisei Chishinkan Wing (The Collections Galleries), designed by [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], known for his redesign of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and his design of the [[Tokyo_National_Museum#H.C5.8Dry.C5.AB-ji_H.C5.8Dmotsukan_.28The_Gallery_of_H.C5.8Dry.C5.AB-ji_Treasures.29|Gallery of Hōryū-ji Treasures]] at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].

The regular exhibitions are shown in The Collections Galleries, while the Special Exhibition Hall is used for special exhibits. The Main Exhibition Hall, the Main Gate, and the Ticket Area have all been designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]] in Japan.

==Museum Collections==
The museum was originally built to house and display art treasures privately owned by temples and shrines, as well as items donated by the [[Imperial Household Ministry]].  Currently, most all of the items in the museum are more or less on permanent loan from one of those places.

The museum focuses on mainly pre-modern Japanese works (it is said to have the largest collection of [[Heian period]] artifacts) and [[Asian art]].  The museum is also well known for its collections of rare and ancient Chinese and Japanese [[sutra]]s.  Other famous works include ''[[senzui]] [[byōbu]]'' ([[landscape]] screen) from the 11th century, and the ''gakizōshi'' ([[Scroll]] of Hungry Ghosts) from the 12th century.

The museum is divided into three parts: 
*'''Fine Arts''', including sculptures, paintings and works of calligraphy; 
*'''Handicrafts''', including pottery, fabrics, lacquerwares and metalworks; 
*'''Archaeology''', including objects of archaeological and historical interest.  

Altogether, the museum houses over 12,000 works, of which around 6,000 are on display at the museum.  The museum also boasts photographic archives containing over 200,000 photographic negatives and color transparencies.  In the Fine Arts collections alone, there are more than 230 pieces that have been designated as either [[National Treasure]]s or Important Cultural Properties.

[[File:Unicornio alado (Le Manége d'Andrea) Segovia.JPG|thumb|One of the horses on Le Manège d'Andrea]]
'''''Le Manège d'Andrea''''' (Andrea’s Merry-go-round) is a carousel that was built by ''[[la machine]]'' in [[Toulouse]], [[France]], in 1999 under the artistic and technical direction of [[François Delaroziér]]. The ride was made with materials such as wood, leather, glass, iron, feathers, steel, tin and copper, together with several pieces from junk (motorbikes, electric fans, etc.). Every figure or seat has several mechanisms that can be activated by the children riding them. Some examples include a steering wheel on the ''Petit Poisson'' that activates gears that turns the head and tail of the fish, a lever on the seahorse that nods its head, and a crank on a steam engine that releases "steam".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10560">'''Literary forgery''' (also known as '''literary mystification''', '''literary [[fraud]]''' or '''literary [[hoax]]''') is writing, such as a [[manuscript]] or a [[literary work]], which is either deliberately misattributed to a historical or invented author, or is a purported [[memoir]] or other presumably nonfictional writing deceptively presented as true when, in fact, it presents untrue or imaginary information.

== History ==
Literary [[forgery]] may involve the work of a famous author whose writings have an established intrinsic, as well as monetary, value.  In an attempt to gain the rewards of such a reputation, the forger often engages in two distinct activities. The forger produces a writing which resembles the [[Style (fiction)|style]] of the known reputable author to whom the fake is to be attributed.  The forger may also fake the physical alleged original [[manuscript]]. This is less common, as it requires a great deal of technical effort, such as imitating the ink and paper.  The forger then claims that, not only is the style of writing the same, but also that the ink and paper are of the kind or type used by the famous author. Other common types of literary forgery may draw upon the potential historical cachet and novelty of a previously undiscovered author.

Literary forgery has a long history. [[Onomacritus]] (c. 530 – 480 BCE) is among the most ancient known literary forgers.  He invented [[prophecy|prophecies]], which he ascribed to the bard [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Ehrman, ''Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are'', HarperOne (2011){{ISBN|0062012614}}, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century CE, a certain Septimius produced what appeared to be a Latin translation of an eyewitness account to the [[Trojan War]] by [[Dictys of Crete]].  In the letter of dedication, the translator gave additional credence to the document by claiming the Greek original had come to light during [[Nero]]'s reign when Dictys' tomb was opened by an earthquake and his diary was discovered.  Septimius then claimed the original had been handed to the governor of Crete, [[Publius Rutilius Rufus|Rutilius Rufus]], who gave the diary to Nero during his tour of Greece in 66-67 CE.  According to historian Miriam Griffin, such bogus and romantic claims to antiquity were not uncommon at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nero: The end of a Dynasty, Miram T. Griffin, 1984. Chapter 9. {{ISBN|0415214645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longest lasting literary forgeries is by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a 5th-6th century Syrian mystical writer who claimed to be a disciple of [[Paul the Apostle]].  Five hundred years later, [[Abelard]] expressed doubts about the authorship, but it was not until after the Renaissance that there was general agreement that the attribution of the work was false.  In the intervening 1,000 years, the writings had much theological influence.&lt;ref&gt;
Sarah Coakley (Editor), Charles M. Stang (Editor), ''Re-thinking Dionysius the Areopagite'', Wiley-Blackwell (2009), {{ISBN|978-1405180894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Chatterton]] (1752–1770), the English poet and letter writer, began his brilliant medieval forgeries when little more than a child. While they brought him praise, and fame after his death, his writing afforded little in the way of financial success and he committed suicide aged 17, penniless, alone and half-starved.

[[The English Mercurie]] appeared to be the first English newspaper when it was discovered in 1794.  This was, ostensibly, an account of the English battle with the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588, but was, in fact, written in the 18th century by [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke]], as a literary game with his friends.&lt;ref&gt;''Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', Volume 9, January 18, 1840, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary forgery was promoted as a creative method by [[Charles Nodier]] and, in the 19th century, many writers produced literary forgeries under his influence, notably [[Prosper Merimee]] and [[Pierre Louys]].

''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' was an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] forged document first published in Russia. The abridged version was available to the public in 1903. The unabridged version was later edited by a retired officer of the Russian Imperial Guard, G.V. Butmi. This forgery exploits Jews by stating that Jews were inevitably trying to exercise a coup against [[Christianity]] in order to essentially rule the world. The document was exposed as [[plagiarism]] by English journalist [[Philip Graves]] in 1921. Graves exposed the strong similarities in the political satire by [[Maurice Joly]], ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]''.  The forged document was supported and promoted by [[Henry Ford]] in his newspaper, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Philip|title=The Truth about the Protocols: A Literary Forgery|year=1921|publisher=The Times of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake memoirs==
The [[genre]] of false and deceptive [[autobiography]] or [[fake memoirs]] has seen the rise of [[misery lit]] books, in which the author claims to have suffered illness, abuse, and/or drug abuse during his or her upbringing.

[[Stephen Longstreet]], a prolific and popular novelist in the mid-20th century, referred to and eventually produced a manuscript called ''Nell Kimball: Her Life as an American Madam, by herself,'' allegedly penned by a prostitute who lived from (1854-1934) and worked in New Orleans. Additionally, the work was partly plagiarized from the works of [[Herbert Asbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:longstreet&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes|title=Guide to the Stephen Longstreet Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=Yale.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A recent example is ''Love and Consequences'' by Margaret B. Jones, the author's story about being a young American foster girl who was raised in a gangland culture in Los Angeles involving drugs, forced sex and criminality.  The author, real name [[Margaret Seltzer]], was exposed as a fraud by her elder sister: in reality, she has lived a middle-class life without trauma, and received a good education (which also included a course in [[creative writing]]).&lt;ref&gt;William McGowan, ''Gray Lady Down: What the Decline and Fall of the New York Times Means'',  pp. 160-161, Encounter books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1594034862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Lewis James|Danny Santiago]], author of ''Famous All Over Town'', published a novel in which he depicts life through the eyes of a young Hispanic boy growing up in East Los Angeles.  The novel won the Rosenthal Award for Literary Achievement in 1984, though suspicion arose about the true identity of Danny Santiago when the author refused to supply a biographical sketch for editors at Simon &amp; Schuster who wanted to submit the book for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Folkart, Burt A. "OBITUARIES : Daniel James : Writer Who Masqueraded as a Latino."Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Times, 21 May 1988. Web. 24 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-21/news/mn-2879_1_daniel-james&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation revealed that the writer was actually Daniel James, a middle- to older-aged Caucasian male writing from the standpoint of a young Latino American boy.  He received criticism from the literary community, and gave up writing for good.

[[James Frey]], another author chastised for forging his memoir, published ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a memoir about his struggle with drug addiction and his journey through the inner working of the legal system and rehabilitation.  The truth about his "imagined escapades" eventually came to light when his close family and friends revealed that he had actually never been a drug addict or incarcerated.  Frey eventually faced more than 10 [[class action]] lawsuits, including negligence, false advertising, and breach of contract.  At the heart of each suit was an allegation of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Simon. "Sentimental Frauds." Law &amp; Social Inquiry 36.1 (2011): 83-113. Academic Search Premier. Web. 24 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MUZU''' was an independent online music video site with the largest legal catalogue of music videos available on the web.

The video catalogue was licensed by all major record labels [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], independent music labels and niche music content owners.

Content includes concerts, music videos, lyric videos, interviews, music documentaries and lots more. MUZU also powered music video solutions on hundreds of sites and platforms including Microsoft [[Xbox]], [[Samsung]], [[Sony]], [[LG]] and [[Philips]] Smart TV's along some of the largest sites in the world including: [[Last.fm]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Daily Mail|Mail Online]]'', ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'', [[Bild.de]], ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Metacafe]] and many more.

MUZU.TV was founded in Ireland by Ciarán Bollard and Mark French and operated in over 19 countries with offices in Dublin, London and Germany.

MUZU generated revenue through premium advertising solutions; Artists, labels, broadcasters and all music content owners got a revenue share of the advertising revenue generated from plays of their videos on and off the site.

The company called a creditors meeting on 22 October 2015 and revealed that it is heading into liquidation and that Michael Leydon has been appointed liquidator.

==Company history==

'''Majesty Music''' is a privately-owned, conservative [[evangelical Christian]] music and book publishing company in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], perhaps best known for its children's adventure-story character [[Patch the Pirate]]. The company publishes sheet music, hymnals, choral collections, cantatas, and Christmas plays.

Majesty Music (originally Musical Ministries) was founded in 1973 by Frank Garlock (b. 1930), a musician with academic training from both [[Bob Jones University]] (BJU) and the [[Eastman School of Music]]. While teaching music theory at BJU, Garlock began a second career of "challenging the [[Rock and roll|rock]] culture," denouncing contemporary music for promoting "rebellion" and "the violation of moral principles." Garlock feared that contemporary music styles were permeating evangelical churches as well as the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Garlock, ''I Being in the Way, the Lord Led Me: The Autobiography of Frank Watson Garlock'' (Greenville, SC: Majesty Music, 2012), 97, 121; Garlock, ''The Big Beat: A Rock Blast'' (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, 1971). The corporate name was changed from Musical Ministries to Majesty Music in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the BJU faculty, he continued to conduct choral seminars to emphasize alternatives to contemporary music and (with the help of a wealthy friend) published, through his company, religious music written by himself, his daughter Shelly, and her husband [[Ron "Patch" Hamilton|Ron Hamilton]] (b. 1950). 

After losing an eye to cancer, Hamilton created the character "Patch the Pirate," around which he based an album of children's songs, ''Sing Along with Patch the Pirate'' (1981). By 2018, Majesty Music had released 39 Patch the Pirate albums, sold more than a million recordings, and produced more than 800 of Hamilton's songs.&lt;ref&gt;Garlock, ''Autobiography'',109-114; [https://www.independentmail.com/story/life/faith/2017/12/21/ron-hamilton-music-legend-patch-pirate/967956001/ Mike Ellis, "'God chose to spare his life:' How Ron Hamilton became music legend Patch the Pirate," Anderson Independent Mail, December 21, 2017]. A few [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] have criticized later Patch the Pirate albums for their "accented notes of the contemporary style," "country western sound," and "soft, sensual, 'middle-of-the-road,' 'easy listening' type of music." H. T. Spence, ''Confronting Contemporary Christian Music'' (Dunn, North Carolina: Forwarding Faith Publications, 1997), 205-09. Shelly Hamilton describes the mechanics of producing the Patch the Pirate albums in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JmJC6G-KMs "Ron Hamilton Interview and Testimony"].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Majesty Music created Patch the Pirate clubs and published material for them that included Bible studies, devotional material, and elementary music theory lessons. Within ten years, more than 10,000 children were enrolled in the program.&lt;ref&gt;Garlock, ''Autobiography'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Majesty Music also supported an ''Adventures of Patch the Pirate'' radio broadcast, recognized by the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] as the country's third largest religious program for children, airing on more than 450 stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patchthepirate.org/about-us Patch the Pirate website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Patch the Pirate material, Majesty Music has sold its own [[hymnals]], sheet music, [[cantatas]], and vocal and instrumental CDs and DVDs, some of them in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.majestymusic.com/ Majesty Music website].&lt;/ref&gt; The company also continued to hold two-day music conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.majestymusic.com/music-conferences.html Majesty Music conferences webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; At first operating from Frank Garlock's garage, Majesty Music expanded several times and eventually occupied two adjacent buildings on [[Wade Hampton Boulevard]] within walking distance of Bob Jones University.&lt;ref&gt;Garlock, ''Autobiography'', 119-122. Most employees were BJU students or alumni.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the company repurposed its underused recording facility to accommodate a music studio, Majesty Music Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majestymusicacademy.com/ Majesty Music Academy website].&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the Garlocks began transferring ownership of the business to the Hamiltons; and in the 2010s, the Hamiltons made similar arrangements to perpetuate the ministry through their daughter, Megan, and her husband, Adam Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;Garlock, 122-23; Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4889">{{Communist Czechoslovakia}}

The '''mass media in [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]]''' was controlled by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ). Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this informational monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were reviewed by the government's Office for Press and Information. [[Censorship]] was lifted for three months during the 1968 [[Prague Spring]] but afterward was reimposed under the terms of the 1966 Press Law. The law states that the Czechoslovak press is to provide complete information, but it must also advance the interests of socialist society and promote the people's socialist awareness of the policy of the communist party as the leading force in society and state. 

Government concern about control of the mass media was such that it was illegal to own a duplicating machine or to reproduce more than eleven copies of any printed material. Nevertheless, a fairly wide distribution of underground publications (popularly known as [[samizdat]] throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union) that were established during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation continued throughout communist rule into the 1980s.

==  Newspapers ==
*The chief newspaper of the KSČ was the Prague daily, ''[[Rudé Právo]]'', which, with a circulation of 900,000 in the 1980s, was the most widely read and most influential newspaper in the country. Its editor in 1987 was Zdeněk Horeni, a member of the Secretariat of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|KSČ]] Central Committee.
*Its sister publication, [[Bratislava]]'s [[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]], was the organ of the [[Communist Party of Slovakia|KSS]].
*Other dailies with large circulations were e. g. [[Lidová Demokracie]], published by the Czechoslovak People's Party (see [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]]); ''[[Mladá Fronta]]'' in Bohemia/ ''[[Smena newspaper, Slovakia|Smena]]'' in Slovakia published by the Socialist Union of Youth (see [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]]); ''[[Práce]]'' in Bohemia / ''[[Práca]]'' in Slovakia published by the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement; ''[[Svobodné Slovo]]'', published by the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, and ''[[Ľud]]'', published by the Slovak Revival Party.

The Czechoslovak Press Agency (in Czech: ''Československá tisková kancelář'', in Slovak: ''Československá tlačová kancelária'' ČTK / ČTK) received a state subsidy and was controlled by the federal government through its Presidium.

== TV and radio ==
The government also controlled several domestic television and radio networks. 

Czechoslovak Television started broadcasting in 1953 from [[Prague]], in 1955 from [[Ostrava]] and in 1956 from [[Bratislava]]. Daily broadcasting started in 1959, broadcasting in colour in 1970 from Bratislava. A second TV channel was added in 1970. Since then, the first TV channel was conceived as a federal one (i.e. mostly in Czech, but also in Slovak), the second TV channel was different for the Czech Socialist Republic (in Czech) and for the Slovak Socialist Republic (in Slovak). A third TV channel was added only in the mid-late 1980s. It broadcast the First Programme of [[Soviet Union]] Central Television. 

In addition, many citizens in Czechoslovakia were able to pick up foreign radio and television stations {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (terrestrially and in late 1980s over satellite). TV stations, for example, could often be picked up (depending on which part of the country one lived in) both from the communist [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]], and from the noncommunist countries [[Austria]] and the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany){{Dubious|date=July 2009}}.

The relatively attractive TV programmes from Austria and West Germany had a sizable influence on the population {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. TV was not [[radio jamming|jammed]] by the authorities. The radio station [[Voice of America]] and the [[BBC World Service]] also had some audiences in Czechoslovakia, and their broadcasts were subject to only occasional jamming. [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasts, however, were extensively [[radio jamming|jammed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3207">[[Image:Maurice-strakosch.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Maurice Strakosch by [[Jose Maria Mora]] (ca. 1875).]]
'''Maurice Strakosch''' (probably 15 January 1825 – 9 October 1887) was an American musician and impresario of Czech origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/atho/atho.detail.people.aspx?personcode=per0053985 Maurice Strakosch: ''North American Theatre Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Strakosch was born in [[Židlochovice|Gross-Seelowitz]] (today Židlochovice), [[Moravia]]. He made his debut as a pianist at the age of 11 in [[Brno]] performing a piano concerto by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]. Because his parents weren't satisfied with his career choice, he ran away to Vienna at the age of twelve, where he studied under [[Simon Sechter]]. He also studied singing under [[Giuditta Pasta]] for some time.

In 1843, he met tenor [[Salvatore Patti]] (1800–1869) at a music festival in [[Vicenza]]. Five years later, he was tour manager of Patti group in New York. These performances started his successful career as a manager in the [[United States]] and his long-standing friendship with the Patti family. In 1852, Strakosch married Patti's daughter [[Amalia Patti]]. He was also the first manager of the youngest and most successful daughter, [[Adelina Patti]], from her debut in 1859 until her marriage in 1868. It is believed that Strakosch was her most important teacher.

Besides the Pattis, he and his brother Max (born in [[Brno|Brunn]], Moravia, 27 September 1835; died in New York City, 17 March 1892) worked as impresario with [[Teresa Parodi]], [[Christine Nilsson]], [[Marie Heilbronn]], [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], [[Carlotta Patti]], [[Karl Formes]], [[Pasquale Brignoli]], [[Italo Campanini]], [[Pauline Lucca]], [[Thérèse Tietjens]], [[Louis M. Gottschalk]], [[Clara Louise Kellogg]], [[Marie Roze]] and [[Marietta Alboni]].

Strakosch occasionally performed as a pianist, e.g. he played duet with [[Ole Bull]] during his tour in America. In 1857, his opera ''Giovanna of Naples'' (Regina Giovanna di Napoli) was performed in New York. His compositions for the piano were at one time very popular, and among them the music of one of [[Bayard Taylor]]'s songs.

In 1886, he published a memoir book ''Souvenirs d'un impresario'' (Souvenirs of an Impresario). Strakosch died in [[Paris]] in 1887.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">[[File:Badakhshan.svg|thumb|Location of Badakhshan, divided between Tajikistan in the north and Afghanistan in the south]]
[[Badakhshan]] is a region of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] with a unique musical heritage, especially that of the remote Pamiri [[Ismaili]]s.  Badakhshan's unique folk scene is said to be characteristed by the use of many chromatized tones (especially in [[falak music|falak]]) in a narrow melodic range, and the use of a characteristic minor-like scale [https://web.archive.org/web/20050510021458/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/music_badakhshan/music_badakhshan.htm].

==Instrumentation==

[[Lute]]s are an extremely important part of Badakhshani music, especially the three-stringed shortneck lute played with a wooden [[plectrum]]; this is called the ''[[Pamiri rubab]]''.  Other varieties of lute in Badakhshan include the [[Jew's_harp|komus]], a three-stringed but unfretted lute played by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] of eastern Badakhshan, the [[tanbur]], a seven-stringed lute with [[sympathetic string]]s, the [[setar]], with three melody strings and a number of sympathetic strings; the imported Afghan [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]] and Azerbaijani [[Tar (Azerbaijani instrument)|tar]] are also a major part of Badakhshan's lute heritage [https://web.archive.org/web/20050510021458/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/music_badakhshan/music_badakhshan.htm].

Other instruments include the [[ney]], a kind of flute, and the [[Ghaychak]], a spiked fiddle; the circular [[frame drum]] [[daf]] is also common, as is the [[accordion]], brought by [[Russia]]ns.

==Vocal music==

Badakhshani music has a characteristic throaty, nasal sound which is a distinguishing characteristic of the area's vocal style.  The ''madah'' is a kind of sung religious poetry, accompanied by [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]]s and/or [[tanbyr]] with at least one daf [https://web.archive.org/web/20050510021458/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/music_badakhshan/music_badakhshan.htm].

*[[Muboraksho Mirzoshoyev]] from [[Gorno-Badakhshan]], Tajikistan.
*[[Daler Nazarov]] from [[Gorno-Badakhshan]], Tajikistan.

[[File:Phone box prostitute calling cards 1.jpg|thumb|230px|Ads for various sexual services posted in a phone box, as was common in the UK before the Internet]]

'''Phone sex''' is a conversation between two or more people on the phone where one or more of the individuals is describing the act of sex.

Phone sex takes imagination on both parties' part; [[virtual sex]] is difficult if the operator does not put the images in the head of the caller and the caller must be open to the pleasure as well. The [[Dirty talk|sexually explicit conversation]] takes place between two or more persons via telephone, especially when at least one of the participants [[masturbate]]s or engages in [[sexual fantasy]].

Phone sex conversation may take many forms, including: guided fantasy, sexual sounds, narrated and enacted suggestions; sexual anecdotes and confessions; candid expression of sexual fantasies, feelings, or love, and/or discussion of very personal and sensitive sexual topics.

Once means of transmitting payment were developed, phone sex turned into primarily a commercial activity, with customers (overwhelmingly male) and sellers (overwhelmingly female).

== As a substitute for physical intimacy ==
Phone sex does not involve physical contact between those participating in it. Couples may choose to engage in phone sex when the inconvenience of distance makes [[physical intimacy]] inopportune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| first=Lizzie
| last=Zucker Saltz

|quote=Certainly one of the reasons that long-distance relationships are so difficult to maintain is due to the physical separation that no advance in communication technologies has yet been able to reconcile.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the potential for emotional intimacy between those who have engaged in phone sex, it is a matter of some debate whether phone sex is to be considered [[infidelity]] when involving a person outside of a committed [[personal relationship]]. Nevertheless, phone sex should not be confused with [[prostitution]] wherein money is exchanged for real life sexual services or physical interaction.

Later she recorded others such as [[Annie Sprinkle]] "[[Dirty talk|talking sexy]]". Leonard convinced magazine owner Carl Ruderman to purchase more of these numbers and the business began to be successful using the magazine to promote the service.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt; Leonard herself was surprised at the success of these numbers.

=== Operation ===
Originally phone sex services consisted of a managed network of dispatchers (live or automated) and erotic performers. Performers would come to a studio where they received a cubicle, coaching, and cash incentives to keep callers on the line longer. This is the world portrayed in [[Spike Lee]]'s movie about phone sex, [[Girl 6]].  At that time independent phone sex was more dangerous, as Lee's movie portrays.

With the progress of technology it became more practical, convenient, and economical for providers to work out of their homes. Human dispatchers — female, except for gay male phone sex — answered the advertised phone numbers, processed payment via [[credit card]], chose who of the available performers in the dispatcher's judgment best matched the clients' fantasy (grandma, black girl, college girl, etc.), and connected the client with the provider. The caller could not see the performer's number. Either could hang up, though some services put economic pressure on providers not to do so.

Originally, per-minute billing was provided by phone companies (in the U.S., using  976, then 900 numbers). There was, from some services, an attempt to keep the caller aroused but short of orgasm, so he would spend more money. (This attitude still survives among some providers.) When public (mostly female) pressure forced the phone companies to stop providing this service to sex workers, a transition was made to a manual method: pre-paid blocks of time, 10, 30, 60 minutes, whatever the customer would pay for. The incentives for providers were then reversed; rather than earning money from keeping the customer on the line (orgasm delayed), they earned more from bringing the caller to orgasm quickly, so as to move on rapidly to another call. Unused minutes were rarely usable on a second call. The provider provided (say) 10 minutes of service, but got to keep all of the money (say 20 minutes).

When the Internet got relatively mature, sale of any sexual service not involving a minor could be made to anyone not a minor.  Software platforms were custom written to handle money collection and transfer, connecting caller and sex worker though neither could see anything but the platform's phone number, and metering the connection. Details vary significantly from one platform to another, but the provider may be given a personal page on the platform to use however she (sometimes he) wishes. All have some way for a provider to post a picture and some text. Big platforms as of 2016 are Niteflirt, TalktoMe, and My Phone Site;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} the latter also includes provision by which a manager, with the consent of the providers, could have a [[virtuality|virtual]] shop with many providers under them. Foreign (non-US) customers were courted. Customers had a variety of payment options, and pages of providers to choose from, sometimes with voice samples available. In concept they have a lot in common with platforms such as [[Ebay]]: the seller provides the picture(s), description, and sets the price, a percentage of which is kept by the platform. In the sex industry, similar platforms emerged facilitating the selling of used panties and other odoriferous garments, and for "cam" video sessions, in which the customer, for a fee, can direct the woman on the video screen, and for a higher fee, have a private connection (no one can see caller or provider except each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== United States ====

By the end of the 1980s, nearly all of the major local phone companies in the United States, plus the major long distance carriers, were actively involved in the adult chat line business. The telephone companies would provide billing services for chat line companies. Typically the telephone companies would bill callers to chat lines and then remit 45% of the money collected to chat line operators. The telephone companies placed the chat line charges on a customer's local phone bill. If a customer disputed a charge, the telephone company would usually “forgive” the charge but block the caller from calling any other chat lines.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In 1988, the American phone sex industry generated an estimated $54 million annually (for both producers and telecommunications providers), according to the Information Industry Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=Commission officials estimated that Audio Enterprises collected $250,000 in revenue over a two-year period. Altogether, the dial-a-porn industry produces about $54 million annually in revenue for those who provide the messages and for teleephone companies, according to the Information Industry Bulletin. |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/us/dial-a-porn-company-to-pay-a-50000-fine.html |title='Dial-a-Porn' Company to Pay a $50,000 Fine |author=[[The Associated Press]] |date=November 8, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007 only Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T remained in the chat line business in the U.S. By 2007 Verizon and MCI had merged and only a few chat line companies remained active as a result. Verizon provided billing services to calls made in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine. AT&amp;T and MCI offered nationwide collection services, with a cap of $50 per call.&lt;ref name="cnet_20060106"&gt;{{cite web

In 2002 profits from phone sex were estimated at one billion dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Helena Echlin|title=How I became a 'call' girl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/03/gender.uk|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 June 2002|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] estimated that phone sex earned U.S. telephone companies close to $500 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The vast majority of modern services in the United States use [[toll-free]] numbers whereby clients can dial up to request a call with a particular performer using credit cards, [[ACH Network]] systems, and a variety of other billing methods. There are still some services that rely upon premium-rate telephone numbers (e.g., [[Premium-rate telephone number|976]] and 900 numbers) for billing purposes, although this practice has been largely abandoned due to the high rate of fraud associated with these lines and the inability to dial 900 and 976 lines from cellular phones. As a direct result, most telephone companies allow their customers to block outgoing calls to premium-rate telephone numbers. In 1996, the FCC changed regulations on 900 numbers to address abuse of these services by minors and fraud concerns.

Independent phone sex operators engage in self-promotion. This self-promotion can involve a personalized website where the phone sex performer lists their specialties and services, engaging prospects in social media, various methods of advertising (via the traditional methods listed below, or on organized third-party network sites that provide a basic level of privacy for performer and client alike) and/or surfing of sexually themed chat rooms for interested clients.

Phone sex service providers typically advertise their services in [[men's magazines]], in [[Pornography|pornographic]] magazines and videos, on late-night [[cable television]], and [[online]].  Some phone sex services use state-of-the-art customer acquisition techniques such as active [[database marketing]] to reach potential clients. These advertising methods almost invariably target men, the primary consumers of phone sex services.

The major phone sex and adult chat lines spend millions of dollars in advertising every month. Thanks to technology, their marketing departments can track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns by assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising campaign, regardless if it includes TV, print, online or a combination of all these. Unique numbers might either be toll-free 1-800 numbers or local access numbers in order to accommodate callers who have been targeted in a local advertising campaign. Phone sex services will usually list all the local numbers on their websites. Assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising channel allows phone chat companies to measure not only the number of calls that each channel generates but also the price per call, conversion rate, and return on investment. This information can be further analyzed to determine key insights such as the most and least profitable caller's demographics, best and worst times to advertise and ultimately which advertising channels to invest more in and which ones to cut.

==== United Kingdom ====
Phone sex lines appeared in the UK in the 1980s using [[premium-rate telephone number]]s for adult services with sexual content, with many of the lines playing tape recordings. The phone sex market in the UK is closely linked to the pornographic magazine market, and advertising for such services often provides a vital element of a magazine's revenue. Up to a quarter of the page length of some magazines may be devoted to such advertisements.&lt;ref name=C&amp;S&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&amp;pg=PA537&amp;dq=%22readers+wives%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22readers%20wives%22&amp;f=false|date=2013|publisher= Routledge|editor1=Peter Childs|editor2=Michael Storry|isbn=9781134755554|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising in newspapers, which had been common in the 1980s, was ended as a result of regulatory changes in 1994 which restricted advertisements to top-shelf adult magazines. At the same time rules were introduced requiring the user to pro-actively opt-in by requesting a pin number. This dramatically reduced the number of calls, and the proportion of the income generated by premium-rate telephone numbers which was associated with adult services fell from 18% in 1992 to 1% in 1996. During the 1990s many companies began to re-route their traffic abroad in an attempt to circumvent the regulations. The industry took to operating from 40 countries worldwide, commonly Guyana and the Caribbean. In 1995 the income generated in this way was $2 billion. The regulations also led to an increase in the use of live call-back services paid by credit cards, which did not fall under the regulator's jurisdiction because they did not use premium-rate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 September 1996|accessdate=16 June 2016|author=Lesley Gerard |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sex-1362202.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 the proportion of the UK population that had used phone sex lines was 45%, according to a survey by [[Durex]]. By 2013 there were over 2,000 phone sex companies in the UK. Most phone sex workers are recruited through word of mouth or the internet as the companies are widely forbidden from advertising in mass media. The number of female university students working for phone sex lines in the UK doubled between 2011 and 2013, according to a [[BBC]]-commissioned investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students and phone sex: 'Why not work as a phone sex operator and pay your way through University'|url=http://helpmeinvestigate.com/education/2013/05/students-and-phone-sex-why-not-work-as-a-phone-sex-operator-and-pay-your-way-through-university/|website=Help Me Investigate|author=Nicole Froio|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry's regulatory body [[Phone-paid Services Authority]] (formerly ICSTIC and PhonePayPlus) monitors and enforces specific community standards in terms of content and price for premium rate numbers.
.

=== Legality ===

The legality of phone sex businesses was challenged by the U.S. Federal government in July 1988 with the passage of the [[Telephone Decency Act]], which made it a crime to use a "telephone ... directly or by recording device" to make "any obscene or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person," punishable by a $50,000 fine or six months in prison." At the time the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was responsible for policing 900 numbers for obscenity and indecency.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;

Sable Communications of California filed suit against the FCC in federal court to overturn the Telephone Decency Act. On July 19, 1988, U.S. District Judge [[A. Wallace Tashima]] ruled that "the prohibition against 'indecent speech' on 900-number recordings was unconstitutional, though its ban on 'obscene speech' could stand."&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;

On June 23, 1989, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that obscene speech, even in commercial telephone calls, was not protected, though indecent speech was. [[Justice Byron White]] wrote for the high court's majority
{{quote|There is no constitutional barrier under ''[[Miller v. California|Miller]]'' to prohibiting communications that are obscene in some communities under local standards even though they are not obscene in others." "Sable, which has the burden of complying with the prohibition, is free to tailor its messages, on a selective basis, to the communities it chooses to serve.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;}}

=== Workers ===

A phone sex worker is a type of [[sex worker]] and [[pornographic actor]], sometimes referred to as a "phone sex operator", "fantasy artist", "adult phone entertainer", "audio erotic performer", or any one of other monikers. The most valued attributes of a phone sex professional are his or her voice, acting  and [[sexual roleplay]] skills, along with the experienced ability to discern and respond appropriately to a broad spectrum of customer requests.&lt;ref name="voiceofshia"&gt;{{cite web

=== Online companies ===

Several online companies provide Internet-based phone sex lines. These services enable callers to post profiles of themselves and then engage in [[VOIP]]-based and other types of online sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">The '''RBW British Tag Team Championship''' was one of the official [[British wrestling|British]] [[tag team]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)|titles]]; it was contested for in [[Revolution British Wrestling]]. However, the championship's origin was within the [[United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance]], where it was known as the '''UKWA British Tag Team Championship'''. UKWA is slated to return along with the titles.

==History==
The UKWA British Tag Team Champions were first crowned during February 2003 in a match between the "Boogie Knights" [[Scotty Hexx]] &amp; [[Kris Travis]] and the "Urban Warriors" [[William Salt|Will Assault]] &amp; [[Glyn Woods|Rainz]], "The Boogie Knights" would win this match and the titles. However, Just two weeks later "The Urban Warriors" would win a return match to take the titles away from "The Boogie Knights", but not before having a public disagreement in the ring. This would lead to both men vacating the championships the very next morning.

On Sunday March 23, 2003 an 8-team tournament was held in [[Sheffield]], containing many top tag teams in the country. The Champions were crowned when [[Andrew Huntington|Andi Le Bon]] and [[Karl Harker]], known as the "Brit Pack", narrowly defeated the combination of "Golden Boy" Cameron Knite and Chris Lightning in the final.

The pair would hold the titles for a few months before being defeated by the team of [[Domino (UK wrestler)|Domino]] and "Rage" [[Andy Baker]] in July 2003 in Sheffield, England. 

The next month RBW's working relationship with UKWA was announced and on a joint show RBW wrestlers [[Stixx]] and "The Gift" [[Ross Jordan]]  would defeat the UKWA team and bring the titles under the RBW banner.

With the United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance's relationship with Revolution British Wrestling announced, a revolutionary new rule was introduced, where the Champions could consist of three wrestlers, as opposed to just two. When it came to Championship defenses, the Champion team could consist of any two of the three.

In [[Killamarsh]], during November 2003, Stixx was in singles action, meaning that Ross Jordan needed to use the unknown third partner. After the original chosen partner [[Kruiz]] wasn't available, Ross Jordan and Stixx announced that [[J.C Thunder]] had moved to the South of England, to get away from the North, and was now the third partner of the Tag Team Champions, which was soon named the "Southern Alliance".

Since then, the group shifted its members with Ross Jordan leaving and being replaced by [[Chris Wyld]] as the third man that would defend the Championship. The Southern Alliance group kept a stronghold on the British Tag Team Championships until UKWA's hiatus in August 2004 and the eventual closer of RBW in late 2005.

In early 2006 it was announced that United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance would be set to return later in 2006. This announcement came from UKWA's Director of Sports Entertainment, Andrew Huntington, who also stated that UKWA would also recognise "The Southern Alliance" as their current UKWA British Tag Team Champions.

==History==

===Partnership with Battle of the South (Netherlands)===
On April 2, 2011, a 'RESPECT.FC Title Contender Fight' between Ben Boekee and Denis Oliwka took place at "Battle of the South",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battleofthesouth.nl |title=Battle of the South 31 maart 2012 kickboxing k1 en mixed martial arts |publisher=Battleofthesouth.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the biggest MMA Events in the Netherlands. That was the first and only co-promotion for RESPECT.FC so far.

==Rules==
RESPECT.FC's rules differ somewhat from the North American [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules]]. Among the differences are the allowance of knees to the head of downed opponent and stomp kicks to the body, while elbows to the head of downed opponent and soccer kicks are prohibited. Similar to the [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules]], fights have 3 rounds each lasting 5 minutes. Title Fights are 5 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectfc.de/?REGELN |title=RESPECT.FC &amp;#124; Germany's Premier MMA Event |publisher=Respectfc.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roboreptile''' is a toy [[robot]] manufactured by [[sphero]] Ltd. The Roboreptile has infrared and sound [[sensors]], and is able to [[autonomous]]ly explore its environment while avoiding obstacles. It can also operate in different modes where it simulates behaviors of real animals. It is able to rear up on its hind legs and attack.  Roboreptile was released in [[China]] on the 28 April 2006 and to the rest of the world later that year. It is superficially similar to a [[theropod]] or a [[prosauropod]] dinosaur but being quadrupedal it's better equated to a [[Silesauridae|silesaurid]] or a [[monitor lizard]].

== Features ==
*Biomorphic movements
*Four-legged walking and low speed running; bipedal "attack" mode; jumping action
*Flexible neck; whipping tail
*Multi-sensory environmental awareness
*[[Infrared]] [[Computer vision|vision]] sensors for obstacle avoidance and detection of movements
*Sonic sensors for detection of sharp, loud sounds
*Touch sensor for responding to human interaction
*Five modes
:#'''Autonomous''' (default): Hungry and aggressive; explores and interacts with his environment searching for prey; attacking, roaring, biting behaviors
:#'''Direct control''': Multi-layered 28 function remote including demo function and volume control
:#'''Program''': Enter a sequence of up to 20 commands
:#'''Guard''': Activates vision and sonic sensor with realistic screeching
:#'''Sleep'''
*Three moods
:#'''Hungry''': his "natural" (default) mood; activate the "feed" button on the remote and he will track down the signal
:#'''Satisfied''': he calms down after eating
:#'''Hooded''': he becomes subdued; depending upon human interaction, will either wake up hungry or fall asleep
*Auto shut-off function

== Robotyrannus ==
Despite its namesake, Robotyrannus is not a robotic version of a [[Tyrannosaurus]]. The Robotyrannus is a variation of the Roboreptile with some [[Aesthetics|cosmetic]] differences: horns on its head and a dorsal fin. It is currently being sold in the UK, Canada and the United States (although in the US it is generically called Roboreptile, despite being the Robotyrannus design). Regardless of the altered appearance, Robotyrannus is functionally identical to the original Roboreptile. It has been a RadioShack exclusive in United States, but the title was RoboReptile.

[[Rock climbing]] in Australia originated in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania in the early 1920s, and spread to the rest of Australia after WWII.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reinventing the heights: The origins of rockclimbing culture in Australia|url = http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/55835/88315_1.pdf?sequence=1|doi =|access-date=26 December 2017|author=Michael Meadows|year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 it had a 0.3% participation rate for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/CA25687100069892CA2568890021779A/$File/41770_1997-98.pdf |page=7|publisher=Australian Buero of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been featured in magazines like ''Vertical Life''. Competition climbing is managed by [[Sport Climbing Australia]], and has seen a surge in participation since rock climbing's inclusion in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-28/australian-rock-climbing-gains-popularty-ahead-of-tokyo-2020/8565308 |publisher=ABC News|title=Australian rock climbers eye ascent to Tokyo 2020 as sport gains popularity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Like Europe and America, the climbing culture of Australia has its roots in alpinism and exploration. Early European exploration was focused in southeast of [[Queensland]] in the Blue Mountains. There, the seemingly endless sandstone walls and the imagining of the landscape represented in the local newspapers helped to spread interest climbing peaks. Between 1927 and 1938 there were 150 articles, most of which are accompanied by photographs. It became traditional to set peaks on fire after reaching them, to signal success to the rest of the ascensionists' party on the ground.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;

Little is known about rock climbing in Aboriginal Australian culture, but today many mountains are sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ABC News|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-02/mountains-celebrate-decade-back-under-aboriginal-management/7294216 |title=Sacred mountains celebrate decade back under Aboriginal management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/they-did-it-at-uluru-should-we-ban-climbing-at-mt-/3255969/ |publisher=Northern Star |title=They did it at Uluru, should we ban climbing at Mt Warning? |date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of the climbs gradually increased, with some stylistic differences between Queensland and NSW climbers, with the former often climbing [[Free solo climbing|free solo]] and NSW climbers relying heavily on ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weareexplorers.co/history-rock-climbing-australia/ |title=The Intriguing History Of Rock Climbing In Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt; Some of the early bold ascents include ''[[Warrumbungle National Park|Crater Bluff]] (9)'' by Eric Dark and Dorothy English in 1936, and ''[[Federation Peak]] (5)'' in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/warrumbungles/area/11773351 |publisher=The Crag |title=Crater Bluff |accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-WWII===

Australian climbing began pushing into higher grades in the late 1950s with the first grade 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verticallifemag.com.au/2016/09/first-at-the-grade/ |publisher=Vertical Life |title=First at the Grade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s [[John Ewbank (climber)|John Ewbank]] developed the [[Climbing grades#Ewbank|Ewbank System]] for grading climbs, the worlds first open ended system.

==Synopsis==
A parody of over-the-top [[soap operas]], ''Shadazzle'' follows the melodrama in the lives of a group of friends, centred on Florence Smith (played by Helen Hall) and her fiancé, Fred Flagglebush (Brett Barnett).&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends write and star in local soap|work=The Barnsley Chronicle - 'Chronicle 2' supplement|first=Paul|last=Nizinskyj|date=3 August 2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Fred decides to hire a "vodka swilling cleaner,"&lt;ref name="Flicker"&gt;{{Citation|last =Duncan|first =Sarah|title =Shadazzle|newspaper =Flicker Magazine|pages =|year =2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple's personal expenses become tighter and Florence is forced to accept a job as an exotic dancer at a local club.&lt;ref name="Terrace" /&gt; She soon becomes the center of an unstable Trevor Shaw's (Jonathan Homer) unwanted affection, that ends in disaster when Trevor crashes the wedding.&lt;ref name="Terrace" /&gt;

Later seasons explore romance, loneliness, and ultimately the murder of Alex Abernathy (Leigh-Anne Homer) and the clash between Florence and her murderer, Billy (Ellis Marsh), all told from the perspectives of Florence and those closest to her.&lt;ref name="Terrace" /&gt;

Each episode of ''Shadazzle'' follows the perspective of a different character, with story lines eventually interlinking as the series progresses,&lt;ref name="WebVee"&gt;{{Citation|last =Clarke|first =Susan E.|title =Shadazzle|newspaper =WebVee Guide|pages =|year =2014|url =http://webveeguide.com/blog/2014/02/shadazzle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features themes of personal struggle and alcoholism, among others.&lt;ref name="SnobbyRobot"&gt;{{Citation|last =Urtz|first =Eric|title =Shadazzle|newspaper =Snobby Robot|pages =|year =2012|url =http://snobbyrobot.com/2012/11/08/web-series-wednesday-shadazzle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Strawberry Panic!'''''|ストロベリー・パニック!|Sutoroberī Panikku!}} is a series of Japanese illustrated short stories written by [[Sakurako Kimino]], which focus on a group of [[Adolescence|teenage girls]] attending three affiliated all-girl schools on Astraea Hill. A common theme throughout the stories is the intimate [[lesbian]] relationships between the characters. The original artist was [[Chitose Maki]], who was succeeded by [[Namuchi Takumi]] when production of the [[manga]] and [[light novel]]s began.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt;

Following ''Strawberry Panic!'''s first run in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' it was six months before results began to indicate that the series was a success, and that its fans were growing in number;&lt;ref name="Jul04"/&gt; the manga and light novels which followed were a reflection of its popularity. The series became sufficiently popular for [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] to license the manga series and light novels for English language distribution. ''Strawberry Panic!'' was one of the debut titles on the company's light novel and [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] manga production lines.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; An [[anime]] television series was produced in 2006 by [[Madhouse (studio)|Madhouse]] and is licensed by [[Media Blasters]]. A [[visual novel]] was produced in 2006 by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] for the [[PlayStation 2]].

There is a slight difference in the title of the series between media and national affiliation. The original short stories, manga, light novels, and video game used the [[exclamation mark]] in the title; the anime excluded it. When the manga and light novel series were licensed for English language distribution, Seven Seas Entertainment did not use the exclamation mark in the title. The appearance of the logo for ''Strawberry Panic!'' has changed four times. The subtitle "Girls' School in Fullbloom" was added during the short stories stage, and later appeared on the Japanese covers of the light novels, manga, and video game version, but was excluded from the anime adaptation and the English covers of the light novels and manga.

==Plot==
[[File:Astrea Hill.png|thumb|200px|left|Aerial view of Astraea Hill. Locations include: Strawberry Dorms (top), Lulim (left), Miator (bottom), church and library (center), and Spica (right).]]

===Setting===
The setting for ''Strawberry Panic!'' is {{Nihongo|Astraea Hill|アストラエアの丘|Asutoraea no Oka}}, a very large hilltop where the three affiliated schools of Miator, Spica and Lulim, are located.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; Each school has its own student council, which governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish system]] of grade numbering. Students are ranged from grades one through six, the equivalent of the three years of junior-high and high school in Japan, and seventh through twelfth grade in North America.&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt;

The hill is known as a sacred area which no men are allowed to enter.&lt;ref name="ncsx"/&gt; A prominent feature is a very large [[Catholic]] church in the center of the hill near a small lake; the church can be seen from a long distance away. There is a horse ranch at Spica. The students may go and study for their classes at a library on the lake's shore. Although only implied in the anime, the manga explains that the library building has another name, "The Secret Garden". It is well-known on campus as a ''[[Meeting|rendezvous]]'' for secret lovers.&lt;ref name="spmanga2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 2|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students living on campus occupy a [[dormitory]] referred to as the {{Nihongo|"Strawberry Dorms"|いちご舎|Ichigo Sha|lit. "Strawberry House"}}, although its correct name is ''[[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] Dormitory'', named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100&amp;nbsp;years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.

The building's name is based on its similarity to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When ''Strawberry Panic!'' was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory was not a single building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt;

===Story===
The plot of ''Strawberry Panic!'' revolves around the lives of the [[Adolescence|adolescents]] who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's [[Strawberry Panic!#Etoile system|Etoile]], a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.

In the ensuing story, Nagisa is introduced to other students from each of the three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the [[Intimate relationship|relationships]] the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of ''Strawberry Panic!'' are the [[lesbian]] relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit [[fan service]]&amp;nbsp;– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations&amp;nbsp;– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of [[Astronomical object|astronomical]] [[star]] imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor [[Catholic]] religious undertones including a [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary]] statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.

===Main characters and schools===
&lt;!-- Please add extra information on the main character article, not here. --&gt;
{{main|List of Strawberry Panic! characters}}
At each of the three schools, there are four main characters, who comprise the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only those twelve appear in the subsequently adapted visual novel version.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Other characters were introduced in the manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict, and these additional characters are also featured in the anime adaptation.

&lt;span id="Miator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Miator's Girls' Academy
:{{Nihongo|St. Miator's Girls' Academy|聖ミアトル女学園|Sei Miatoru Jogakuen}}, the oldest of the three schools which has a history of over 100 years, is known for upholding old traditions. It was founded on a monastery and is seen as the school for "brides", reinforced by the existence of extracurricular classes including [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Ikebana|flower arrangement]], and Japanese dancing.&lt;ref name="Jan04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=January 2004|pages=134–136|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for students to be engaged before graduation.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; The school uniform is a long black dress, designed in the [[Gothic Lolita]] fashion. At Miator, the [[Class (education)|class]] names are associated with objects from nature, such as {{Nihongo|moon|月|tsuki}}, {{Nihongo|flower|花|hana}} and {{Nihongo|snow|雪|yuki}}.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; In the Strawberry Dorms, there is a concept called the room temp system for students from Miator. Every underclassman entering the dormitories, if they are chosen to serve the upperclassman as room temps, perform maid duties, which include cleaning the room of the students they are assigned to serve.&lt;ref name="SP5"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Younger Sisters|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep05|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 1, 2006|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Nagisa Aoi is the main character of the story. She is a cheerful girl who finds pleasure in making new friends, which she finds easy to do because of her open personality and sociable attitude. The first person she meets at Miator is Shizuma Hanazono,&lt;ref name="SP1"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Cherry Blossom Hill|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep01|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=April 3, 2006|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mysterious upperclassman and the [[#Etoile system|Etoile]] as the story begins, which gives Miator significant influence. Nagisa at first finds that she is strangely affected when in the presence of Shizuma, who in turn is extremely interested in Nagisa in both the manga and the anime. The next girl she meets is Tamao Suzumi,&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt; who becomes her close friend and roommate. Tamao is well regarded among her fellow Miator students; among the first-years, she is seen as a viable Etoile candidate.  She expresses some light and playful interest in Nagisa, but it is much less overt than Shizuma's interest and is very downplayed in the manga. The last main character from Miator is Chiyo Tsukidate, a timid first year student who is employed as the [[Maid|room temp]] for Nagisa and Tamao; in the anime, she deeply admires Nagisa.&lt;ref name="SP5"/&gt;

&lt;span id="Spica"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Spica's Girls' Institute
:{{Nihongo|St. Spica's Girls' Institute|聖スピカ女学院|Sei Supika Jogakuin}} has the white colored buildings and uniforms, and was built after Miator. The school prides itself in advancing the independence of women who play a role in improving society.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; It is well known for its culture and the accomplishments of its sports program compared to the other two schools. Spica has what is known as the St. Spica Choir, or the "Saintly Chorus," which consists of students from Spica who perform at special events and even concerts for students at Astraea Hill. At Spica, the class names are numbers in French, such as ''un'' (one), ''deux'' (two), and ''trois'' (three).&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Spica and Miator compete with each other quite aggressively, which often ends in dispute when students from these two schools get together.&lt;ref name="SP3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Attic|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep03|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=April 17, 2006|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Hikari Konohana, a shy and quiet girl, is the main focus among the main characters who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari are members of the St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention.&lt;ref name="spmanga1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.&lt;ref name="SP8"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hydrangeas|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep08|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 22, 2006|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="Lulim"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Lulim's Girls' School
:{{Nihongo|St. Lulim's Girls' School|聖ル・リム女学校|Sei Ru Rimu Jogakkō}} (originally Le Lim&lt;ref name="Jul04"/&gt;) is the newest of the three schools, and has pink colored buildings and uniforms. Its uniform is modeled after a traditional [[Japanese school uniform]] style. At Lulim, the class names are the letters from the [[Latin alphabet]]: A, B, C, etc.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Students at St. Lulim's are traditionally free and relaxed, and are rarely seen fighting. The students enjoy a lot of freedom in terms of activities, or the clubs they are allowed to form. In effect, there are a wide range of clubs at St. Lulim's ranging from dancing, to cooking, to anything else a group of at least three people can think up.&lt;ref name="anime6"/&gt;

:Of the three schools, St. Lulim&lt;ref&gt;"Lulim" is the spelling used on [http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php#003 MediaWorks' official ''Strawberry Panic!'' website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915020351/http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php |date=2008-09-15 }} and on the Japanese covers of the light novels and manga, although "Le Rim" is used in [[Media Blasters]]' translation of the anime version.&lt;/ref&gt; has the least emphasis on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice or simply a shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, the youngest of the group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear {{Nihongo|Percival|パーシバル|Pāshibaru}} which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.&lt;ref name="SP20"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Confession|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep20|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=August 14, 2006|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etoile system===
{{Nihongo|'''Etoile'''|エトワール|Etowāru}} is a French word meaning ''[[star]]''. The Etoile system of Astraea Hill is employed as the internal politics between the schools and governs school operations. Little is shown as to the influence the teachers and sisters have on the inter-school politics. The system is designed for two Etoiles to be instated at the same time in order to work as a team. In the anime, Shizuma Hanazono is the sole Etoile,&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt; the other Etoile having died, which is explained in the latter part of the story. The two Etoiles are seen as [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]]s for Astraea Hill. Although Astraea has three schools, both Etoiles must come from the same school. They have certain specific duties, such as greeting new students arriving at Astraea Hill, participating in important school events, and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, among others. They are given a private greenhouse in which to grow flowers for use during school events.&lt;ref name="anime6"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Greenhouse|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep06|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 8, 2006|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etoiles are elected after going through what is known as {{Nihongo|''The Etoile Election''|エトワール選|Etowāru-sen}}, which consists of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions.&lt;ref name="spmanga2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spmanga1"/&gt; The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election,&lt;ref name="anime26"/&gt; at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the [[pendant]]s: one is red, the other is blue. The [[Senpai and kōhai|older student]] receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.&lt;ref name="anime26"&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Beginning|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep26|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=September 25, 2006|number=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Strawberry Panic! first short story.png|thumb|200px|right|The first short story from the reader participation project featuring Nagisa and Shizuma as the first couple.]]
Since the first issue of [[ASCII Media Works]]' ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' was published, the editors of the magazine have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. ''Strawberry Panic!''{{'}}s origin was in the October 2003 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' where it was announced after the ending of [[Sakurako Kimino]]'s previous work ''[[Sister Princess]]'' that a new reader participation project would start the following month.&lt;ref name="Oct03"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=October 2003| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project.&lt;ref name="Nov03"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=November 2003|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters and at the same time younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in ''Dengeki G's Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Nov03"/&gt;

In December 2003, the characters from Spica (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced and in the January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by [[Chitose Maki]]; the reader participation game began in this issue.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Feb04"/&gt; Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.&lt;ref name="Feb04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2004|language=Japanese|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the results of the polls were printed in the March 2004 issue, the rules of the game had been changed from the original concept, showing that readers wanted to focus on the relationships between the girls, and in this respect, the readers could vote on who they wanted to be coupled together.&lt;ref name="Mar04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=March 2004|pages=127–137|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of votes for this first round were less than 2000.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; Noting this, the editorial staff lifted the restriction on only coupling within the same school, along with the restriction of only allowing the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna to couple. This resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between the twelve characters in the series. In this issue, it was explained that four events were planned for the stories that followed: Easter, Athletic Carnival, Cultural Festival, and Christmas Bazaar. The "Etoile" title was born in this issue, which was initially used to crown the best couple voted first by the readers in each of the four events to follow.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; These events were going to be carried out by the three schools in cooperation. It became such that the planning of the schools resulted in them in a triangle position, having the dormitories at the center. The reader's position as the elder brother was canceled in this issue, and the game became a simple popularity vote for coupling. Due to this new system, Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna ceased to be sisters;&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; surnames were later added to clarify this. After the first [[story arc]] of the short stories concluded, it was shown that the number of votes had increased sharply due to the new voting mechanisms. The Etoile voting was announced in the July 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been the case beforehand. The deadline for voting was shifted to the middle of every month, and online voting was introduced. In September 2004, the voting for the next Etoile was shifted to be online-only; the voting for the ''Dormitory Panic'' arc became mail voting only.&lt;ref name="Sep04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=September 2004|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reader participation game ended after ten rounds of voting in the February 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' where it was announced that the series would be continued in other forms, such as the light novels and manga that followed.&lt;ref name="Feb05"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2005|pages=163–174|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original short stories and the poll results of the reader participation game were used as a basis for subsequent releases of ''Strawberry Panic!''.&lt;ref name="Feb05"/&gt;

===Short stories===
{{see also|List of Strawberry Panic! short stories}}
The first results of the polls from the reader participation project appeared in the form of the first three short stories which resulted from direct fan involvement in the March 2004 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; The stories were written by [[Sakurako Kimino]] and illustrated by [[Chitose Maki]]. Over the following months, the stories continued, producing the first [[story arc]] named the {{Nihongo|''Etoile Chapter''|エトワール編|Etowāru-hen}} containing eighteen stories which ran between March and July 2004. Due to the concerns that there was not enough time between the Athletic Festival (an early summer event) and the Cultural Festival (an autumn event), the second, and last, story arc named the {{Nihongo|''Dormitory Panic Chapter''|寄宿舎パニック編|Kishukusha Panikku-hen}} containing seven stories began the next month, running between August 2004 and January 2005. The second arc's stories, which were longer than the earlier pieces, involved taking one of the three main characters, performing coupling for them with one of the other eleven girls and presenting them in various situations. None of the original stories were ever published again in [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]]. The stories themselves were more or less [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]], in which each gave a brief glimpse into what was referred to as a "yuri coupling".&lt;ref name="okazu"&gt;{{cite web|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date= April 11, 2006|url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2006/04/11/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic-2/|title=Okazu: Yuri Anime: Strawberry Panic|work=Okazu | publisher=[[Yuricon]] | accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic.html --&gt;

Between May and September 2005, a revised series of the short stories was produced; once per month, five more supplementary short stories were published during this time period, each of which was longer than any of the previous pieces. Although each individual story had its own title, the stories were under the collective title of "The Girls, [[Lord's Prayer|who art in heaven]]". After the ending of this short compilation in September 2005, it was decided that the original illustrator, Chitose Maki, would be replaced by [[Namuchi Takumi]] for future ''Strawberry Panic!'' projects.&lt;ref name="Sep05"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=September 2005|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet radio show===
Between November 2005 and December 2006, [[Lantis (company)|Lantis Web Radio]] hosted a radio show entitled {{Nihongo|''[[List of Strawberry Panic! albums#Web radio CDs|Mai &amp; Ai no Dengeki G's Radio Strawberry Panic!: Oneesama to Ichigo Sōdō]]''|麻衣&amp;愛の電撃G’sラジオ ストロベリー・パニック!~お姉様といちごそうどう~}}. The show was hosted by [[Mai Nakahara]], who voiced Nagisa Aoi in the anime edition, and [[Ai Shimizu]], who voiced both Tamao Suzumi and Kizuna Hyūga in the anime. The show contained sixty-one episodes, which were divided between three CDs; the first went on sale on March 8, 2006.&lt;ref name="Lantis-CDs"/&gt; The other two releases came out on July 5, 2006 and January 11, 2007 in Japan.&lt;ref name="Lantis-CDs"/&gt; The radio show included nine guests who had played other [[Seiyū|voice acting]] roles in the anime version, and [[CooRie|Rino]], singer of the opening theme "Sweetest" in the PlayStation 2 game version.

===Manga===
The ''Strawberry Panic!'' manga, written by [[Sakurako Kimino]] and illustrated by [[Namuchi Takumi]], was serialized in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]] have been published in Japan under [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' ''[[Dengeki Comics]]'' label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; While the manga's story is unfinished, ''Strawberry Panic!'' has not made an appearance in ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō.&lt;ref name="spmanga1"/&gt; The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until the latter part of the series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt;

===Light novels===
The announcement that a ''Strawberry Panic!'' [[light novel]] series was to be written based on the original short stories appeared in the April 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''. Work on writing and illustrating the novels began in May 2005, by the same two people who worked on the manga. The announcement that the writing was finished appeared in the September 2005 issue of the same magazine, although the first novel was published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] on their ''[[Dengeki Bunko]]'' publishing label, on March 10, 2006. The first volume had Shizuma and Nagisa on the cover and the second volume, released on August 9, 2006, had Amane and Hikari on the cover.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; The third and last volume, released on December 10, 2006, had Chikaru and Kizuna on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/5162KJBFAYL._SS500_.jpg|title= ''Strawberry Panic!'' light novel volume 3 cover image|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=October 2, 2008|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] announced on September 13, 2006 that they had licensed the right to release the English translations of the ''Strawberry Panic!'' light novels and the manga series. After several delays, the English version of the first light novel was released in March 2008, and the second volume light novel was released on July 8, 2008. An omnibus volume containing the three light novels was released in June 2011.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gomanga.com/manga/strawberrypanic.php|title=Strawberry Panic!|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
{{see also|List of Strawberry Panic episodes}}
The [[anime]] series, entitled ''Strawberry Panic'' (without the [[exclamation mark]]), was produced by the Japanese animation studio [[Madhouse (studio)|Madhouse]] and directed by [[Masayuki Sakoi]]. The series was composed by Tatsuhiko Urahata, and featured two other screenwriters Hideo Takayashiki and Kazuyuki Fudeyasu. The character design was done by Kyūta Sakai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strawberrypanic.com/staff/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212044559/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/staff/index.html|title=Anime staff at anime's official website|archivedate=February 12, 2008|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=March 21, 2009|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; working from the original designs by [[Chitose Maki]] and later [[Namuchi Takumi]]. The twenty-six episode anime aired in Japan between April 3 and September 25, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215050943/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/onair/backnumber.html|url=http://ww.strawberrypanic.com/onair/backnumber.html|title=''Strawberry Panic'' on air info backnumber episode listing|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|archivedate=December 15, 2007|accessdate=March 21, 2009|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a central [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] theme.

The anime series is mainly based on the short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a slightly lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the three girls that they each are or become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in the election of the new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. [[Fan service]], or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.

In Japan, eight [[DVD]] compilations, in regular and special editions, were released containing three episodes each, between June 23, 2006, and January 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212024548/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/product/dvd01.html|url=http://www.strawberrypanic.com/product/dvd01.html|title=''Strawberry Panic!''

===Visual novel===
A [[visual novel]] named ''Strawberry Panic! Girls' School in Fullbloom'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]] on August 24, 2006 in Japan by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. Two versions of the game were released, a regular edition and a limited edition which included a drama CD; there is a different cover for each of the versions. The drama CD contained three tracks, one for students of each school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/SLPS-25611.html|title=''Strawberry Panic!'' limited PS2 game information|publisher=National Console Support|accessdate=March 16, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526075708/http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/SLPS-25611.html|archivedate=May 26, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three playable characters, one from each of the schools: Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna.&lt;ref name="system"/&gt; They have no family names in the game, as when the series of short stories were first published.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php|title=Character profiles for the visual novel|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=September 28, 2008|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915020351/http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php|archivedate=September 15, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Ai Shimizu]] maintained her role for Kizuna in the game, [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] performed the voice for Tamao Suzumi. The game features a "boy mode" and a "girl mode". Choosing the male version means that the story is told via emails from the player's younger sister; choosing the female version means that the story is told in the player's own diary.&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/system.php|title=Visual novel story mechanics synopsis|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=September 28, 2008|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701134527/http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/system.php|archivedate=July 1, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player is given the chance to pair their chosen character with one of the other nine available girls, not including the other possible playable characters. There are twenty-seven different combinations depending on which girl the player chooses at the start of the game.&lt;ref name="ncsx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/SLPS-25612.html|title=''Strawberry Panic!''

The game is played over the course of a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1. In "boy mode", each day concludes with a [[super deformed]] image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the [[Computer display|monitor]]. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a [[Speech balloon#Thought bubbles|thought bubble]] above her head. In "girl mode", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a "Strawberry chance" system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message {{Nihongo|"Chance!"|チャンス!|Chansu!}} is displayed in the upper right screen corner.&lt;ref name="ncsx"/&gt;

==Reception==
During the reader participation game running in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', which were to determine who would be the subjects in the couplings between the characters of each respective school. The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with the highest number of votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes.&lt;ref name="May04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=May 2004|language=Japanese|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple for the third time in a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.&lt;ref name="Jul04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=July 2004|language=Japanese|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Strawberry Panic!'' short stories were initially panned by Erica Friedman as being "distinctly derivative of ''[[Maria-sama ga Miteru]]''".&lt;ref name="okazu"/&gt; Friedman is the president of [[Yuricon]], an [[anime convention]] geared towards fans of [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri.

The five subtitled DVDs released by [[Media Blasters]] were reviewed by [[Anime News Network]] (ANN). The first DVD was declared rental-worthy by ANN, citing the characters as being "a lot of fun" and the series as being a "very laid-back show" that would work well as a relaxing watch over a weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2008-06-09|title=Shelf Life: Strawberry Fields|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date= June 9, 2008|author=Dong, Bamboo|accessdate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in [[fan service]], humor, and that it "struggles to find any other reason to be compelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/strawberry-panic/sub.dvd-1|title=Strawberry Panic!

''Strawberry Panic!'' was one of the premier titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) production lines when it was licensed for [[English language]] distribution by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/manga-articles/101/|title=Interview with Adam Arnold from Seven Seas Entertainment|publisher=Anime Boredom|accessdate=September 28, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821100707/http://animeboredom.co.uk/manga-articles/101/|archivedate=August 21, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, "How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?" His response was, "We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like ''[[Pita-Ten]]'', ''[[Ballad of a Shinigami|Shinigami no Ballad]]'' or ''Strawberry Panic!''....In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of the property otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/features_gomanga_012.php|title=Interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|accessdate=September 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Streaming television''' (or '''streaming TV''') is the [[digital distribution]] of [[television]] content, such as [[TV shows]], as [[streaming video]] delivered over the [[Internet]].  Streaming TV stands in contrast to dedicated [[terrestrial television]] delivered by [[Broadcast television systems|over-the-air]] aerial systems, [[cable television]], and/or [[satellite television]] systems.

== History ==
The mid 2000s were the beginning of television programs becoming available via the Internet. [[ITunes]] began offering select television programs and series in 2005, available for download after direct payment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Waterman, D., Sherman, R., &amp; Ji, S. W. (2013).

Telecommunications Policy, 37(9), 725-736.&lt;/ref&gt; The video-sharing site [[YouTube]] also launched in 2005 allowing users to share illegally posted television programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A few years later television networks and other independent services began creating sites where shows and programs could be streamed online. [[Amazon Video]] began in the United States as Amazon Unbox in 2006, but did not launch worldwide until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2229623 "Amazon - Press Room - Press Release"].

''Netflix Media Center''. Retrieved 2017-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[Hulu]], owned by NBC and Fox, was launched, followed by tv.com in 2009 and owned by CBS. Digital media players also began to become available to the public during this time. The first generation [[Apple TV]] was released in 2007 and in 2008 the first generation [[Roku]] streaming device was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/21133BEF-61B4-40C1-A976-5C1360E60694.html "How Apple's iTV Media Strategy Works"].

Access to television programming has evolved from computer and television access, to also include mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Apps for mobile devices started to become available via app stores in 2008. These [[mobile app]]s allow users to view content on mobile devices that support the apps. In 2017 YouTube launched [[YouTube TV]], a streaming service that allows users to watch live television programs from popular cable or network channels, and record shows to stream anywhere, anytime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tv.youtube.com/ "YouTube TV - Watch &amp; DVR Live Sports, Shows &amp; News"].

==Technologies used==
The [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies (such as [[SES S.A.|SES]], [[Humax]], [[Philips]], and ANT Software) is currently promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital television and multimedia applications with a single-user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=August 27, 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European Initiative Merges Television with the Power of the Internet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010s, providers of Internet television use various technologies to provide [[Video on demand|VoD]] systems and live streaming.  [[BBC iPlayer]] makes use of the [[Adobe Flash Player]] to provide streaming-video clips and other software provided by Adobe for its download service. [[CNBC]], [[Bloomberg Television]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] use live-streaming services from [[BitGravity]] to stream live television to paid subscribers using the HTTP protocol.

BBC iPlayer originally incorporated [[peer-to-peer]] streaming, moved towards centralized distribution for their video streaming services.  BBC executive Anthony rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as the unhappiness among consumers unhappy with their own network bandwidth being consumed for transmitting content to other viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49302215,00.htm|title=iPlayer uncovered: What powers the BBC's epic creation?|date=November 18, 2009}} CNet interview with iPlayer boss Anthony Rose, mostly on iPlayer 3.0&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twice.com/article/468711-Samsung_To_Do_3D_VOD_Streaming.php Samsung To Do 3D VOD Streaming], May 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
===Access control===
Some streaming services incorporate [[digital rights management]].  The [[W3C]] made the controversial decision to adopt [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] due in large part to motivations to provide [[copy protection]] for streaming content. [[Sky Go]] has software that is provided by [[Microsoft]] to prevent content being copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibbs |first1=Samuel |title=Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that's better for work than play |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/06/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-thats-better-for-work-than-play |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=6 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, BBC iPlayer makes use of a parental control system giving parents the option to "lock" content, meaning that a password would have to be used to access it. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPTV===
{{main|IPTV}}
[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the "last-mile" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, "Internet television" is "over-the-top technology" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system—a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.

The Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]—browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.

IPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).

==Stream quality==
Stream quality refers to the quality of the image and audio transferred from the servers of the distributor to the user's home screen. Higher-quality video such as video in high definition (720p+) requires higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds. The generally accepted kbit/s download rate needed to stream high-definition video that has been encoded with [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years {{when|date=September 2016}}, [[Channel 4]] has started providing HD content on its On Demand platforms such as iOS App, Android App and Channel4.com website. Although competitors in the UK such as [[Demand Five]] have not yet offered HD streaming {{when|date=September 2016}}, the technology to support it is fairly new and widespread HD streaming is not an impossibility. The availability of [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] content on [[YouTube]] is predicted to prove incredibly popular as series such as ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', ''[[Green Wing]]'', ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' and others become available in a simple, straightforward format on a website which already attracts millions of people every day.

==Usage==

Internet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s. About one in four new televisions being sold is now a smart TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Connected-TVs-Reach-One-Four-Homes/1009581|title=Connected TVs Reach One in Four Homes|date=January 3, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Considering the vast popularity of [[smart TV]]s and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as [[Netflix]]'s ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/house-cards-season-2-sees-surge-viewers-netflix-article-1.1617972 | title='House of Cards' season 2 sees surge of Netflix viewers over first season | work=NY Daily News | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2016 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as [[Hulu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com|title=Watch TV and movies on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more - Hulu|work=Hulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the [[BBC]] utilizes their [[iPlayer]] format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that [[FIOS|Verizon]] is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon|title=Why Netflix streaming is getting slower, and probably won’t get better any time soon|work=ExtremeTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aereo]] was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aereo-broadcasters-streams-networks-tv_n_1690173.html |title=Aereo Threatens Broadcasters By Streaming Network TV Online |date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney| title=Supreme Court rules against Aereo| author=Stelter, Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/25/media/aereo-supreme-court-ruling/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market competitors==
Many providers of Internet television services exist—including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as "on-demand" and "catch-up" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/itve/ Internet television platforms around the world] International TV Explorer&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the BBC, which introduced the [[BBC iPlayer]] on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its "RadioPlayer" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD ("4 on Demand") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.

Since 2012 around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-11092017|title=Parks Associates Announces 2017 Top 10 U.S. Subscription OTT Video Services|website=www.parksassociates.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Investment by [[Netflix]] in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/08/netflix-original-programming-13-billion/|title=Netflix Is Expected to Spend up to $13 Billion on Original Programming This Year|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting rights==
Broadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.

Some companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the "[[TV Everywhere]]" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.

==Profits and costs==
With the advent of broadband Internet connections multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 43 million members and its membership numbers are growing {{when|date=September 2016}}{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called "cord cutters". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.

{{nihongo|'''''TV Star Meikan'''''|TVスター名鑑|Terebi Sutā Meikan}} is a [[Japan]]ese television personality directory of Tokyo News Service, which launches in the [[autumn]] every year.

In this article, it will also describe {{nihongo|'''Web-ban TV Star Meikan'''|Web版TVスター名鑑|Webu-ban Terebi Sutā Meikan}} and its sister magazine {{nihongo|'''''Fresh Star Meikan'''''|フレッシュスター名鑑|Furesshu Sutā Meikan}}.

==Overview==
''TV Star Meikan'' was first published in 1992. As commemorating the 30th anniversary of the launch of television information magazine ''TV Guide'' as an extra special issue (15 October Issue)&lt;ref&gt;See its cover page.&lt;/ref&gt; it was issued (the front cover is ''TV Star Meikan'', on the back cover is ''TV Guide Rinji Zōkan: Heisei 4-nen 10 tsuki 15-nichi-gō '92 Tv Star Meikan'' notated with adifferent title).

Initially it was combined with the publication year and title year, but the year of the title is set to the next fiscal year from ''TV Star Meikan '96'' (temporary extra publication 25 October issue) issued in 1995. Until the 1999 edition, the publication dates are October, 2000, 2006 to 2006, November 2007. Regarding the form of issue, the extra publication of ''TV Star Meikan '98'' ''TV Guide'' extra edition, ''TV Star Meikan 2000'' 'in 1999, ''TV Guide'' extra publication, 2000 ''TV Star Directory 2001'' are books of from the ''Tokyo News Mook'' Mook series.

Its [[book size]] format is [[Paper size#A series|A5]] size, the basic [[Color|colour]] in the cover is blue (2000 edition only, 2001 edition only dark blue) or purple land (after 2002 edition), the body magazine is [[Monochrome painting|monochrome]]. A celebrity directory booklet will be posted as an appendix to the usual ''TV Guide'' from about July every year, but those summarized are released in late October or early November. In addition to celebrities (individuals, groups, children), cultural people, [[news presenters]], and announcers are posted. [[Athlete]]s were also posted at the beginning of its first publication (Thereafter, there were also times when [[K-1]] players were posted as male stars).

==Web-ban TV Star Meikan==
In 2008, Web-ban TV Star Meikan has started as the website version of this directory. In addition, even the entertainer posted in the book version may not be posted on the web version due to circumstances of the rights. Also, some may not be published in the book version, some of the entertainers were posted only on the web version.

==''Fresh Star Meikan''==
In its sister magazine there was the '''''Fresh Star Meikan''''', a star map book of only young stars. It was launched in 1994 and it was released every March. Here the format is also A5 size. Female celebrities between 12 and 25 years old and male celebrities between 12 and 30 years old were eligible to be included (provided, however, that for groups the members were eligible for publication if they were even members).

It has not been issued since the 2008 edition, according to the news planning company, which is in charge of editing, it is undecided in the future and it is in fact a state of being suspended.

==Episodes==

===Episode 1===
The story takes place in late December 1988 with the first episode starting on 23 December. Lol is haunted by visions of her dead father Mick – whom she killed in the previous series when he tried to rape her – and is struggling to cope as a [[single parent]] with her young daughter, Lisa, who is a result of her affair with Milky two and a half years prior. Lol's affair has also led to Woody's self-imposed exile from the gang, but he has begun to rebuild his life. He has a new girlfriend, Jennifer, whom his parents adore, and has been offered a promotion at work. Smell and Shaun are still together, but growing distant. Shaun develops his creative side on a college drama course, and grows close to Fay, a girl performing in his Christmas play. Milky is welcomed back into the gang after spending some time away, but after Woody sees them together in the pub, old wounds re-appear.

===Episode 2===
Despite Woody's misgivings about the responsibilities associated with a promotion, he is seemingly convinced after a dinner out with Jennifer and his boss. Lol turns to a religious, concerned paediatric nurse for help, and finally pays a visit to Combo in prison. She thanks him for having always been there to support her, and apologises for the way she treated him when he returned to the gang [[This Is England|five and a half years prior]]. Shaun takes centre-stage for his acting debut, and Smell's suspicions are heightened when she walks in on him and Fay 'rehearsing' a kiss backstage before the performance. Fay has a party at her house to celebrate the success of the play, and Shaun finds her upstairs alone in her bedroom. The two talk about their growing feelings for each other and despite agreeing not to get any more serious, they are unable to control their passions and end up having sex. Smell arrives at Fay's house intending to apologise to Shaun for her jealousy earlier in the evening, but walks in on Shaun and Fay in bed. Smell angrily breaks up with Shaun and storms out, leaving him devastated.

===Episode 3===
As Christmas Eve turns to Christmas Day, Shaun is devastated after Smell caught him cheating at the after-show party. Mum Cynthia and Mr. Sandhu (now a surrogate father to Shaun) comfort Shaun and promise him that Smell will eventually forgive him.

Meanwhile, most of the gang is out getting merry until they bump into Woody and Jennifer. It is revealed that Woody didn't find out about Lol and Milky's affair until the birth of a mixed-race daughter, Lisa. A distraught Woody, revealing he'd earlier attempted suicide, cannot control his rage and attacks Milky, who refuses to fight back or walk away. The others break up the fight and lead Milky away, with Woody repeatedly screaming how he loved Milky like a brother. Woody calls Milky a "snake in the grass," repeating what Combo had accused Woody of being in 1983. Woody eventually realises he can never love Jennifer as much as he loved Lol, and they agree to end their relationship and remain friends.

Lol seeks solace in a [[midnight mass]] service, but it does not ease her pain, and she has visions of Mick again. Feeling unable to cope any longer, and consumed with guilt over Combo's prison sentence, Lol takes an overdose of Paracetamol. Trev and Kelly find her and rush her to the hospital where her stomach is pumped. Trev, after being unable to contact Woody by telephone, goes to his parents' house, where they are all opening Christmas presents. On hearing of Lol's suicide attempt, Woody rushes to the hospital, where he finds Lol's bed empty. He immediately thinks she has died, but Lol's mother and friends (including Milky) inform him that she is alive, doing well and is nearby having a smoke. Woody and Milky finally make up, and Woody goes to talk alone with Lol. She tells him about her emotional problems, and the truth about her father's murder. Visibly shaken, but touched by Combo's sacrifice, Woody tells Lol he still loves her and can't be with anyone else.

The episode ends with Woody and Lol in each other's arms, and then cuts to various members of the gang – including Combo in his prison cell, eating his Christmas meal with a plastic fork. Shaun is shown having Christmas dinner with his mother and Mr. Sandhu, but still miserable over losing Smell.

==Reception==
Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Euan Ferguson said that it "was all phenomenal" and "roll on their next story".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/18/this-is-england-88-review?newsfeed=true |title=Rewind TV: This is England '88 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Euan |last=Ferguson |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Shennan writing for the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' also rated the series, calling it the best drama series of 2011.&lt;ref name="Echo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2011/12/17/paddy-shennan-s-tv-review-this-is-england-88-channel-4-100252-29966528/ |title=Paddy Shennan’s TV review: This Is England ‘88 (Channel 4) |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Shennan |last=Paddy |work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hugh Montgomery writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' found all the misery "increasingly irritating".&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/this-is-england-88-channel-4-tuesday-to-thursday-6278588.html |title=This is England '88 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Hugh |last=Montgomery |work=The Independent |location=London |date=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series won the award for Best Mini Series at the 2012 BAFTA Television Awards, and also led to a Best Actor nomination for Joseph Gilgun (Woody) and a second successive Best Actress nomination for Vicky McClure (Lol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/television/awards/|title=BAFTA Television Awards|work=bafta.org|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cpscmagnetixtoyrecall.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetix]], a popular construction toy selling over 3.8 million units, was recalled after injuries and a fatality when magnets came loose.]]
'''Toy safety''' is the practice of ensuring that [[toy]]s, especially those made for children, are safe, usually through the application of set [[safety standards]].  In many countries, commercial toys must be able to pass safety tests in order to be sold. In the U.S., some toys must meet national standards, while other toys may not have to meet a defined safety standard. In countries where standards exist, they exist in order to prevent accidents, but there have still been some high-profile [[product recall]]s after such problems have occurred.  The danger is often not due to faulty design; usage and chance both play a role in injury and death incidents as well.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"&gt;The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]], March 2001.  "[http://www.rospa.com/productsafety/factsheets/toysafety.htm Toy Safety Factsheet]".  Accessed 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential hazards==
[[Image:Someone ate simba.JPG|right|thumb|Small toys may be swallowed by children, such as this electronic button seen in a child's stomach.  Toys stuck in the [[esophagus]] or too large to pass through the [[stomach]] may need to be removed with [[endoscopic foreign body retrieval|endoscopes]].]]
Common scenarios include:
*Ingestion of magnetic toys
*[[Choking]] or aspiration of small parts of the toy
*Cuts by sharp parts of the toy
*Motor toy vehicles incidents involving  hair 
*Chemical substance

==Accident frequency==
Accidents involving toys are quite common, with 40,000 happening each year in the United Kingdom (according to 1998 figures&lt;ref name="1998DTI"&gt;[[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], 2000 (using 1998 data).  "Home Accident Surveillance System, 22nd Annual report".&lt;/ref&gt; - data has not been collected in the UK since 2003&lt;ref&gt;[https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/welcome.jsp European Injury database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), accounting for less than 1% of annual accidents. In 2005 in the U.S., 20 children under 15 years of age died in incidents associated with toys, and an estimated 202,300 children under 15 were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with toys, according to data from the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's]] National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.&lt;ref name="CPSC Toy Report"&gt;CSPC, 5 October 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/library/toymemo05.pdf Toy-Related Deaths and Injuries, Calendar Year 2005]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, no fatal accidents have been reported in the European Injury Database since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/result.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, home and leisure data was examined concerning injuries caused by falls to a lower level among 0-4-year-olds from Austria, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Sweden. It was found that children′s use of several product categories was closely related to age. Children′s furniture account for between 21% (Netherlands) and 34% (Sweden) of the injuries from falls to a lower level in the first living year, but decreased with increasing age in all countries. The same pattern applied to strollers. In contrast, injuries due to falls involving playground equipment increased with age to reach between 13 (Greece) and 34 (Netherlands) percent of injuries from falls to a lower level among 4-year-olds. Bicycles also increase with age, reaching between 4 (Netherlands) and 17 (Denmark) percent among 4-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Consumer rights for child safety products"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincenten|first1=Joanne|title=Consumer rights for child safety products|url=http://www.leokids.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rights_child_safety_prod.pdf|ref=Consumer rights for child safety products}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety standards==
Distinction must be drawn between [[regulations]] and voluntary [[safety standards]]. From the table below, it can be seen that many regions model their safety standards on the EU's [[EN 71]] standard, either directly, or through adoption of the ISO 8124 standard which itself is modelled on EN 71.

(Source: [http://www.toy-icti.org/info/toysafetystandards.html ICTI Toy Safety Standards])

In [[Europe]] toys must meet the criteria set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) in order for them to carry the [[CE mark]].  All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995.&lt;ref name="lbwf"&gt;"[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19950204_en_1.htm The Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995]".  Accessed 7 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trading Standards Officers in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the RAPEX recall notification system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation).&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm EUROPA - Consumer Affairs - Safe Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074207/http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm |date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Canada]] the government [[Ministry (government department)|department]] [[Health Canada]] has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) does in the [[United States]]. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/toys.html] Harmonised EU toy safety standards&lt;/ref&gt; as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.

===Appropriate age===
[[File:Age warning symbol.svg|thumb|Age warning symbol specified in the European standard [[EN 71]]-6.]]
Manufacturers often display information about the intended age of the children who will play with the toy.  In the U.S. this label is sometimes mandated by the CPSC, especially for toys which may present a [[choking]] hazard for children under three years of age. In most countries the intended age is either shown as a minimum age or as an age range.  While one reason for this is the complexity of the toy and how much it will interest or challenge children of different ages, another is to highlight that it may be unsafe for younger children. While a toy might be ''suitable'' for children of one age, and thus this is the age ''recommended'' on the product, there may be safety hazards associated with use by a lower age group, necessitating a mandatory warning. Some manufacturers also explain the specific dangers next to the advised age (as is mandated by European and International toy safety standards EN71 and ISO 8124 respectively, but not US standard ASTM F963).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/consumers/Safety/products/child-products/Toys/index.html Toy Safety Regulations - BERR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some accidents occur when babies play with toys intended for older children.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;

===United States regulations===
In August 2008, the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] (''CPSIA'') was passed.  Some observers are of the opinion that this new law imposes the toughest toy-making standard in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-consumer-safety,0,7590962.story | title=Bush signs bill banning lead from children's toys; toughest standard in the world | publisher=Associated Press | date=14 August 2008 | accessdate=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CPSIA restricts the amount of [[lead]] and [[phthalates]] that may be contained in children's products (ages 12 and under) and adopts the provisions of the ''ASTM Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety'' (ASTM F963-11) as the requirements of the CPSC.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 2051 Sec. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the US state of [[Minnesota]] introduced its own legislation that requires reporting information on a list of priority chemicals found in children’s products and sold in the state. This law demands all manufacturers of toys to provide the state of Minnesota with a report if their children’s products contain any of the priority chemicals such as [[Bisphenol A]], [[Formaldehyde]], [[lead]] or [[cadmium]].

===European regulations===
In Europe, the comprehensive legislation addressing toy safety is ''the Toy Safety Directive'' of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]], ([[Council Directive]] 88/378/EEC). This directive is a list of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective Toy Safety Regulations (e.g.: the UK's ''Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 ([[Statutory Instrument]] 1995 No. 204)'').  This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF] Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys&lt;/ref&gt; which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the chemical requirements of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a [[CE Mark]], which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment.  Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/toys/eg_guidance.htm] Official guidance on the classification of toys&lt;/ref&gt;  Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive.  The toy safety directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.
The Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 Toy Safety Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.
If a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of ''due diligence'' (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the safety of the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.

The new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD) requires a series of safety assessments, including the Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA). If the non-chemical requirements were already enforced in July 2011, the chemical requirements are to be enforced first on 20 July 2013. In 2009, the European Union adopted the new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD). The [[Comité Européen de Normalisation]] or CEN wrote these standards in order for them to be harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive.  Official EU Guidance&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4208/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native] Guidance document on the application of the toy safety directive 2009/48/EC&lt;/ref&gt; on the interpretation of the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC exists and although non-binding, it has been agreed by a majority of EU Member States.

===Chinese regulations===
China's toy industry has been regulated since early 2007 by the expansion of the nation's compulsory certification system to include toy products.
Regulations require a manufacturers to apply for [[China Compulsory Certificate|China Compulsory Certification]] (CCC) from the nation's Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). From 1 March, toy producers in China have been able to apply to three certification agencies nominated by the CNCA to certify their products. Toys are subject to inspection and certification review. Since 1 June 2007, no toy products without CCCs has been be allowed to leave factories, be sold or be imported into China.  It is hoped this measure will mitigate the increasing international pressure on environmental protection, as well as further expand the nation's toy export market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200604/01/eng20060401_255145.html People's Daily Online - Toy industry gets improved regulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This increase in scrutiny was introduced before the [[2007 Chinese export recalls]].

==Safety testing==
The EU Commission expert group on toy safety regularly publishes a large number of guidance documents &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm European Guidance Documents on Toys]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to help on interpretation issues related to the [[Toy safety#European regulations|Toy Safety Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm Guidance documents from the Expert Group on Toy Safety] European Commission, Retrieved 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Toy manufacturers need stay ahead of regulatory changes and be sure that their products comply with the new requirements.

Therefore, it is vital to perform tests and risk assessments for every product before selling them in the designated market. This is important for every manufacturer as they can be held liable for injuries and fatalities resulting from design flaws, use of unsuitable materials, and substandard production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btha.co.uk/dynamic/documents/toysafety/06%20Safety%20Assessment%20of%20Toys%20-%20Daryl%20Scrivens.pdf Safety Assessment of Toys]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following safety tests are performed:
* Mechanical/physical testing
* Flammability testing
* Electrical safety testing
* Labeling
* Chemical testing

Product safety/risk assessment (also known as product hazard analysis) can identify potential hazards and provide solutions early in the product life cycle to prevent products becoming stalled in production or recalled once they are released onto the market. During risk assessments for toys possible hazards and potential exposure are analyzed. Additionally the manufacturing of the toys will be controlled to ensure safety and quality throughout production.

The new European standard EN 71-4:2013 was published in 2013. It replaces and updates the 2009 version of the same standard since the latter and newest has been harmonized under the EU [[Toy Safety]] Directive. The new method is a reference test method regulating [[chemicals]] in toys and juvenile products. This gives a new test method for 'Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities' under the toy safety EN 71 series.

==International commerce==
International commerce plays a big role in toy safety. In the first four months of 2006, China exported US$4 billion worth of toys. The United States contributed 70 percent of the global market by exporting US$15.2 billion in toys in 2005.  The European Union accounts for 75% of the final disposition of these toys. From January 2005 through September 2006, products originating in China were responsible for about 48 percent of product recalls in the U.S., and a similar percentage of notifications in the EU.&lt;ref name="China Econ Review"&gt;China Economic Review, January 2007.  "[http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/subscriber/articledetail/1526.htmll REPORTS / Better safe than sorry]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of process control in sub-contracted vendors has been a contributing factor in recent high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6948274.stm | work=BBC News | title='Brand China' at risk after toy recall | date=15 August 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moves toward global standards===
Although an international toy safety standard exists, nations around the world still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-icti.org/info/toysafetystandards.html Toy Safety Standards Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has been seen in the large scale [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls of 2007]], sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.
Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the [[ISO 9000]] systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.
The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/qmp/qmp-6.htm Quality management principles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.
In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as [http://www.lga.de/ LGA], [http://www.eurofins.com/product-testing-services/industries/toy-testing.aspx Eurofins], [[Bureau Veritas]] or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUKL0889219620071108?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | title=EU, U.S. seek new global toy safety standard | first=Darren | last=Ennis | date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineers.ihs.com/news/ansi-toy-safety.htm ANSI: Toy Safety Takes High Priority with Standards Developers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.

==Product recalls and safety hazards==
The ability to [[product recall|recall]] a product from the market is a necessary part of any safety legislation. If existing quality and safety checks fail to detect an issue prior to sale, a systematic method of notifying the public and removing potentially hazardous products from the market is needed.
Some toys have been discovered to have been unsafe after they have been placed on the market.  Before the introduction of safety monitoring organisations the toys were simply stopped being manufactured if any action was taken at all{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, but since then there have been many toys that have been recalled by their manufacturer.  In some notable cases the problem has only been found after the injury or even death of a person that purchased the product.

Choking is the number one reason for accidents, but chemicals such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ and system in the human body, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic to the brains of young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.xos.com/blog/bid/343549/EPA-Prevention-Week-Highlights-the-Importance-of-Lead-Detection EPA Lead Safety Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection are responsible for screening children's products imported into the country.  Just less than 10% of products screened are stopped for violations.  Nearly two thirds are stopped for lead violations and 15% are stopped for choking hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2013/More-than-48M-Units-of-Violative-Imported-Products-Kept-at-Bay-During-Fiscal-Year-2012/ More than 4.8M Units of Violative Imported Products Kept at Bay During Fiscal Year 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom toys are regulated by the Toy Product Safety Regulations 1995 which require that toys must not be sold if they do not have the correct safety labels.

===Examples===

====Bindeez/Beados====
Batches of [[Bindeez]] were recalled in November 2007 after several children swallowed beads and were adversely affected. Upon ingestion, a chemical used in the product metabolized in the stomach into the sedative drug, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. The design called for a different, non-toxic chemical, but this had been substituted with an alternative chemical, which had approximately the same functional properties. The name was changed to "Beados" in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theillustrator.ca/Headlines/China-admits-that-poison-was-in-toys.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids====
The [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls were very popular in the 1980s across North America and many parts of Europe.  The "Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids" line of dolls were an early 1990s incarnation designed to "eat" [[plastic]] snacks.  The mechanism was a pair of one-way metal rollers behind a plastic slot and rubber lips, and there were 35 reported incidents in which a child's hair or finger was caught in the mouths.  On 31 December 1996, after 700,000 dolls were distributed in the [[United States]] in just five months, the CPSC along with manufacturers [[Mattel]] announced that they would place warning information labels on all unsold dolls.&lt;ref name="KidSourceCPK"&gt;KidSource, 31 December 1996.  "[http://www.kidsource.com/cpsc/cabbage.warning.html CPSC and Mattel Announce Warning for Cabbage Patch Doll]".  Accessed 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, in January 1997, CPSC and Mattel announced that all Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids were being removed from the market.&lt;ref name="CPSC Cabbage Patch Press Release"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 6 January 1997.

====Lawn darts====
[[Image:Lawndart.jpg|thumb|A safety warning given out by the CPSC.]]
[[Lawn darts]] are large, weighted darts intended to be tossed underhand towards a horizontal ground target.  On 19 December 1988, all lawn darts were banned from sale in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission after they were responsible for the deaths of three children since 1970.&lt;ref name="CPSCLawnDarts"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC).

====Magnetix====
One death and four serious injuries led to the recall of 3.8 million [[Magnetix]] building sets in March 2006.  The [[magnets]] inside the plastic building pieces could fall out and be swallowed or aspirated.&lt;ref name="CPSCMagnetix"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 31 March 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html Child’s Death Prompts Replacement Program of Magnetic Building Sets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405113358/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html |date=5 April 2006 }}".

====Polly Pocket====
In November 2006 4.4 million [[Polly Pocket]] Quik-Clik sets were recalled by Mattel after children in the United States swallowed loose magnetic parts.  The toys had been sold around the world commencing three years previous.&lt;ref name="ScotsmanPP"&gt;[[The Scotsman]], 22 November 2006.  "[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 Toy recall over magnet hazard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116050215/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 |date=16 November 2007 }}".

====Clackers ====
[[Clackers]] were discontinued when reports came out of children becoming injured while playing with them and after a ruling in [[United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls]] that they were hazards in the United States. Fairly heavy and fast-moving, and made of hard [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic plastic]], the balls would occasionally shatter upon striking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Google | title = Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pz8mD9Vn6OQC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=clackers+toy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hbPqTqKDOozKiQLO6InPBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=clackers%20toy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Razor Scooter ====
The CSPC issued a voluntary Razor scooter recall, specifically targeting the Razor PowerWing three-wheeled scooters. Around 103,000 Razor scooters were affected by this recall. The reason for the [[Razor scooter]] recall is that the underside of the foot platform can have sharp edges, thus leading to a laceration hazard to kids who are riding the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Virginia Film Office''' is a part of the Virginia Tourism Corporation located in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The Virginia Film Office brings jobs and revenue to the Commonwealth by marketing the state as a location for film, television, and commercial production and by supporting and fostering Virginia's in-state production industry.

==About==
The Virginia Film Office was founded in 1980 with the mission of increasing revenue to the state of Virginia through the production of filmed products, including television shows, feature films, short videos, documentaries, and commercials.  The office is part of the Virginia Tourism Corporation and helps to supports its goal of "supporting, maintaining and expanding … the tourism and motion picture production industries in order to increase visitor expenditures, tax revenues and employment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatc.org Virginia Tourism Corp.], Virginia Tourism Corporation, 07-18-2011&lt;/ref&gt;   "A recent study conducted by Mangum Economic Consulting found that, in 2015, the film industry's contribution to Virginia's economy was $615.6 million in total economic output, 3,883 full time equivalent jobs, $195.3 million associated in labor income, and $24.3 million in state and local tax revenue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magnum|date=October 2016|title=The Motion Picture and Video Industry's Contribution to Virginia's Economy in 2015|journal=Magnum Economics|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Film Office is committed to increasing film and video production within the Commonwealth through activities that attract out-of-state business and expand the existing in-state industry.  In 2012, due to Virginia's beautiful and diverse palette of film locations, supportive public institutions, and experienced Film Office staff, the state was ranked as one of the top ten best filming locations in the United States by ''P3/Production Update'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/articles-moviemaking/2012-top-10-cities-indie-moviemakers-new-orleans-austin-albuquerque-new-yor/|title=Top 10 Cities to be a Moviemaker: 2012 - MovieMaker Magazine|date=2012-01-16|newspaper=MovieMaker Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Film Office primarily promotes Virginia's exceptional locations for film and video production.  Throughout the entire production process, staff members work closely with producers assisting mainly with local crew and location resources.  In addition, the Film Office also provides a statewide network of film liaisons who help with more specified location concerns.

==Incentives==
The State of Virginia offers an incentive package which encourages, through various economic measures, filmmakers to choose the state of Virginia for their film making.  Virginia's incentive package is based on two different funds: the Governor's Motion Picture Opportunity Fund, which is a grant fund, and the Virginia Motion Picture Tax Credit fund, which is a refundable tax credit program.  In addition to the incentive funds, the state also has a Sales and Use Tax Exemption that applies to the purchase of production related supplies and equipment.  Finally, hotel stays of 30 days or more are also exempt from state sales tax and some local lodging taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Film Office: tax incentives [http://www.film.virginia.org/incentives/], Virginia Film Office, 10-18-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had mixed reviews. The general consensus is that "the career mode is a lot of fun and the tracks are varied. On the other hand, the game lacks challenge, has an overabundance of loading times and disappoints audiovisually."  It got to number 21 in the UK sales charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fsoftware%2Fuk%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&amp;ct=110031&amp;arch=t&amp;lyr=2013&amp;year=2013&amp;week=43&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|250px| From ''Northern Antiquities'', an English translation of the [[Prose Edda]] from 1847. Painted by Oluf Olufsen Bagge.]]
[[File:Dolmatov World tree.png|thumb|right|250px|Russian 19th century ornament of the world tree.]]

The '''world tree''' is a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] present in several religions and mythologies, particularly [[Indo-European religion]]s, Siberian religions, and [[Native American religion]]s.  The world tree is represented as a colossal tree which supports the [[heaven]]s, thereby connecting the heavens, the terrestrial world, and, through its roots, the [[underworld]]. It may also be strongly connected to the motif of the [[tree of life]], but it is the source of [[Yggdrasil|wisdom of the ages]].

Specific world trees include ''[[égig érő fa]]'' in [[Hungarian mythology]], Ağaç Ana in [[Turkic mythology]], Modun in [[Mongol mythology]], ''[[Yggdrasil]]'' (or ''[[Irminsul]]'') in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] (including [[Norse mythology|Norse]]) mythology, the [[oak]] in [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] and [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Iroko]] in [[Yoruba religion]], ''Jianmu'' in [[Chinese mythology]], and in [[Hindu mythology]] the ''[[Ashvattha]]'' (a ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'').

==In specific cultures==
===American pre-Columbian cultures===
{{Main|Mesoamerican world tree}}
* Among [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, the concept of "world trees" is a prevalent motif in Mesoamerican cosmologies and iconography. The [[Temple of the Cross Complex]] at [[Palenque]] contains one of the most studied examples of the world tree in architectural motifs of all Mayan ruins. World trees embodied the four cardinal directions, which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as, or represented by, a [[ceiba]] tree, called ''yax imix che'' ('blue-green tree of abundance') by the Book of [[Chilam Balam]] of Chumayel.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967: 100&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.
* World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster", symbolic of the underworld).
* The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, ''et al.'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Izapa Stela 5]] contains a possible representation of a world tree.

A common theme in most indigenous cultures of the Americas is a concept of directionality (the horizontal and vertical planes), with the vertical dimension often being represented by a world tree. Some scholars have argued that the religious importance of the horizontal and vertical dimensions in many [[animist]] cultures may derive from the human body and the position it occupies in the world as it perceives the surrounding living world. Many Indigenous cultures of the Americas have similar cosmologies regarding the directionality and the world tree, however the type of tree representing the world tree depends on the surrounding environment. For many Indigenous American peoples located in more temperate regions for example, it is the [[spruce]] rather than the ceiba that is the world tree; however the idea of cosmic directions combined with a concept of a tree uniting the directional planes is similar.

===Baltic mythology===
The world tree is widespread in Lithuanian folk painting, and is frequently found carved into household furniture such as cupboards, towel holders, and laundry beaters.&lt;ref&gt;Straižys and Klimka, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lithuanian.net/mitai/cosmos/baltai2.htm Cosmology of the Ancient Balts - 3. The concept of the World-Tree] (from the 'lithuanian.net' website. Accessed 2008-12-26.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The world tree ({{lang-lv|Austras koks}} - "Tree of Dawn") also was one of the most important beliefs in [[Latvian mythology]].

===Iranian mythology===
[[File:A rhyton from Marlik, Iran, 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|Two winged bull are guarding a sacred tree, on a rhyton from [[Marlik]], Iran, currently at the [[National Museum of Iran]]]]

In the [[Iranian mythology]], [[Gaokerena]] or white [[Haoma]], is a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe. Bas tokhmak is another world tree with remedial attribute, it's retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title= Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date=2013 |publisher= Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last= Taheri |first= Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt; World tree is a common motif in ancient art of Iran.

===Jewish mythology===
The [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] and the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]] are both components of the [[Garden of Eden]] story in the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].  According to [[Jewish mythology]], in the [[Garden of Eden]] there is a tree of life or the "tree of souls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;lpg=PA153 |title= Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher= Books.google.com |date= |access-date=2014-05-01 |isbn= 0691020477 |year= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; that blossoms and produces new [[souls]], which fall into the [[Guf]], the ''Treasury of Souls''. The Angel [[Gabriel]] reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then [[Lailah]], the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121030044612/http://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archivedate=2012-10-30 |title=200_ THE TREASURY OF SOULS for Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism |work= Scribd |deadurl= yes |access-date= 15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse mythology===
In [[Norse mythology]], [[Yggdrasil]] is the world tree. Yggdrasil is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]] that is central and considered very holy. The [[Æsir]] go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well [[Urðarbrunnr]] in the heavens, one to the spring [[Hvergelmir]], and another to the well [[Mímisbrunnr]]. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the [[Deer|hart]]s [[Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór]], the giant in eagle-shape [[Hræsvelgr]], the squirrel [[Ratatoskr]] and the [[Norse dragon|wyrm]] [[Níðhöggr]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name ''Yggdrasil'', the potential relation to the trees [[Mímameiðr]] and [[Læraðr]], and the [[sacred tree at Uppsala]].

===North-Asian, Siberian, Mongol and Turkic cultures===
The world tree is also represented in the mythologies and [[folklore]] of [[North Asia]] and [[Siberia]]. In the mythology of the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]], the world tree connects different realities (underworld, this world, upper world) together. In their mythology the world tree is also the symbol of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] who is said to give the Samoyed [[Shamanism|shaman]] his drum and also help him travel from one world to another.

The symbol of the world tree is also common in [[Tengrism]], an ancient religion of [[Mongols]] and [[Turkic peoples]].

The world tree is visible in the designs of the [[Crown of Silla]], [[Silla]] being one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. This link is used to establish a connection between Siberian peoples and those of [[Korea]].

===South Asian religions===
Remnants are also evident in the [[Kalpavriksha]] ("wish-fulfilling tree") and the [[Ashvattha]] tree of the [[South Asian]] religions.

In [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, the World Tree is portrayed as the "Kalpa Vriksha Tree", or "Tree of Humanity", in which the founder Brahma Baba ([[Dada Lekhraj]]) and his Brahma Kumaris followers are shown as the roots of the humanity who enjoy 2,500 years of paradise as living deities before trunk of humanity splits and the founders of other religions incarnate. Each creates their own branch and brings with them their own followers, until they too decline and split. Twig like schisms, cults and sects appear at the end of the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Walliss, John (2002). From World-Rejection to Ambivalence. Ashgate Publishing. pp. 33. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0951-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary origins==
Some scholars suggest that the world tree is programmed into the human mind by evolutionary biology. Theory suggests that human beings are primates, and lived in trees for around 60 million years. The idea of a vast tree as the entirety of the world is thus still implanted in our collective unconscious.&lt;ref name=Burkert&gt;[[#refBurkertW|Burkert, ''Creation of the Sacred'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haycock&gt;[[#refHaycockDE|Haycock, ''Being and Perceiving'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
