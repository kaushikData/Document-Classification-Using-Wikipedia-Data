'''''1066 and All That: A Memorable History of England, comprising all the parts you can remember, including 103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates''''' is a tongue-in-cheek reworking of the [[history of England]]. Written by [[W. C. Sellar]] and [[R. J. Yeatman]] and illustrated by John Reynolds, it first appeared serially in [[Punch magazine|''Punch'']] magazine, and was published in book form by [[Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.]] in 1930.

==Setting and background==
[[Raphael Samuel]] saw ''1066 and All That'' as a product of the post-[[First World War]] debunking of British greatness, very much in the tradition of ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' (1918):&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; as he put it, "that much underrated anti-imperialist tract ''1066 and All That'' punctured the more bombastic claims of drum-and-trumpet history".&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both the Tory view of a 'great man' history, and the liberal pieties of [[Whig history]] are undermined in the work, in the (then contemporary) style of such serious historians as [[Namier]] and [[Herbert Butterfield]].&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 209-11&lt;/ref&gt; With its conflation of history and memory, and its deconstruction of "standard" historical narrative lines, the book can also be seen as an early [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] text.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/speaking-volumes-wc-sellars-and-rj-yeatmans-1066-and-all-that/159911.article 1066]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book is a [[parody]] of the style of history teaching in English schools at the time, in particular of ''[[Our Island Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; It purports to contain "all the History you can remember", and, in sixty-two chapters, covers the history of England from [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] through [[Norman conquest of England|1066]] "and all that", up to the end of World War I, at which time "America was thus clearly Top Nation, and history came to a [[full stop|.]]" [full-stop, like a telegram]. The book is full of examples of half-remembered and mixed-up facts.

Although the subtitle states that the book comprises "103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates", the book's preface mentions that originally four dates were planned, but last-minute research revealed that two of them were ''not memorable''. The two dates that ''are'' referenced in the book are 1066, the date of the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of Britain]] (Chapter XI), and 55 BC, the date of the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|first Roman invasion of Britain]] under [[Julius Caesar]] (Chapter I). However, when the date of the Roman invasion is given, it is immediately followed by the date that Caesar was "compelled to invade Britain again the following year (54 BC, not 56, owing to the peculiar Roman method of counting)". Despite the confusion of dates the Roman Conquest is the first of 103 historical events in the book characterised as a ''Good Thing'', "since the Britons were only natives at that time".

Chapter II begins "that long succession of Waves of which History is chiefly composed", the first of which, here, is composed of [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], mere [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], and [[Huns]]. Later examples are the "Wave of Saints", who include the [[Bede|Venomous Bead]] (Chapter III); "Waves of Pretenders", usually divided into smaller waves of two: an [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] and a [[Charles Edward Stuart|Young Pretender]] (Chapter XXX); plus the "Wave of Beards" in the [[Elizabethan era]] (Chapter XXXIII).

According to Sellar and Yeatman, in English history kings are either "Good" or "Bad". The first "Good King" is the confusingly differentiated [[King Arthur]]/[[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] (Chapter V). Bad kings include King [[John, King of England|John]], who when he came to the throne showed how much he deserved this epithet when he "lost his temper and flung himself on the floor, foaming at the mouth and biting the rushes" (Chapter XVIII). The death of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] from "a surfeit of [[palfrey]]s" (recorded in other historical works as a "surfeit of [[lamprey]]s", Chapter XIII) proves to be a paradigmatic case of the deaths of later monarchs through a surfeit of over-eating or other causes. Other ''memorable'' monarchs include the Split King ([[Henry IV, Part 1]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2]]) and [[Mary I of England|Broody Mary]].

''Memorable'' events in English history include the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Disillusion of the Monasteries]] (Chapter XXXI); the struggle between the [[Cavalier]]s (characterised as "Wrong but Wromantic") and the [[Roundhead]]s (characterised as "Right but Repulsive") in the [[English Civil War]] (Chapter XXXV); and [[Industrial Revolution|The Industrial Revelation]] (Chapter XLIX).

The book also contains five joke "Test Papers" interspersed among the chapters, which contain nonsense instructions including the famous "Do not on any account attempt to write on both sides of the paper at once" (Test Paper V),&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; and "Do not attempt to answer more than one question at a time" (Test Paper I) and such unanswerable questions as "How far did the Lords Repellent drive [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] into the arms of [[Peter of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]]? (Protractors may not be used.)" (Test Paper II).

==Musical comedy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In 1935, the [[musical comedy]] ''1066—and all that: A Musical Comedy based on that Memorable History by Sellar and Yeatman'' was produced. The book and lyrics were by [[Reginald Arkell]]; the music was composed by [[Alfred Reynolds (composer)|Alfred Reynolds]]. It was revived at the [[Palace Theatre, London]], in 1945.

The narrative for the musical is based on the idea of an [[Everyman]] character, the Common Man, who is visiting a waxworks museum. He experiences some of the major events and characters of British history, starting with the Romans. "What good did history ever do me?" moans the Common Man. While his wife and son traipse round the waxworks, he dreams the waxworks come to life, singing and dancing and recalling the events and characters first met in dry-as-dust school lessons that are most likely to stick, however imperfectly, in an everyman-school-student's mind: [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] burning the cakes; [[Cnut the Great|Canute]] inventing [[King Canute and the waves|sea bathing]]; [[John, King of England|King John]] losing his washing, and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] marrying [[Henry VIII of England|VIII wives]] – or vice versa. From the Roman Conquest to the Modern Era of automobiles.

A chorus of Roman soldiers sing about "Going home", and being "on the road that leads to Rome. / We've been to Gaul, we've been to Spain / And now we're going home again / Rome, sweet home". Later a chorus of monks sing about the horrors of meatless Friday meals in the abbey. A Puritan and a Cavalier sing a jaunty, flirting ditty, and so on.

At the end, the Common Man is run down by a passing taxi, and the Finale reprises the "Going home" song with suitably modified lyrics.

==Works inspired by ''1066''==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''1066 and All That'' inspired [[Paul Manning (British writer)|Paul Manning]]'s ''1984 and All That'', dealing with the subsequent history of Britain and the rest of the world up to 1984, and written in the same style, with similar prose, illustrations and tests. ("What caused the [[Wall Street Crash]]? Speculate wildly.") The title also echoes [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Ned Sherrin]] and Neil Shand wrote a sequel ''1956 and All That'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrin|first=Ned|title=1956 And All That|year=1984|publisher=Michael Joseph Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0718124793|page=144|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/1956-All-That-Ned-Sherrin/dp/0718124790}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the subtitle ''a memorable history of England since the war to end all wars (Two)''.

[[Scoular Anderson]] has written a humorous history of Scotland in two volumes: ''[[Battle of Bannockburn|1314]] and All That'' and ''[[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] and All That''. Although the titles reflect Sellar and Yeatman's work, the style of writing and illustration is very different.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2005 [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] released ''[[1966 and All That (book)|1966 and All That]]'', which copied the book's style (including elements like the end of chapter tests), recounting the remainder of the 20th century. In 2006 the book was [[1966 and All That (radio)|adapted for BBC Radio 4]] in four parts.

[[Richard Armour (poet)|Richard Armour]]'s book ''It All Started With Columbus'' (1953, revised 1961) treats the history of the United States, from 1492 to the presidency of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], in a manner that owes a great deal to Sellar and Yeatman ("[[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] refused to believe the world was round, even when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] showed them an [[Egg of Columbus|egg]]"). Acknowledging the debt, Armour dedicated his book to Sellar and Yeatman.

[[Dave Barry]]'s 1989 book ''[[Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States]]'' is another treatment of American history reminiscent of ''1066 and All That'', though Sellar and Yeatman are not acknowledged. ("The first major president to be elected after the [[War of 1812]] was President [[Monroe Doctrine]], who became famous by developing the policy for which he is named.")

[[Matthew Sturgis]]' book ''1992 and All This'' (Macmillan, 1991) is a "humorous look at Europe in preparation for 1992 when Britain officially becomes part of the Continent. Much of the humour focuses on the differences between the British and the Europeans."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Malcolm Knox (author)|Malcolm Knox]]'s 2009 book ''[[1788 Words or Less]]'' gives a Sellar and Yeatman-esque twist to the history of Australia.

==Works with titles inspired by ''1066''==
* The title was adapted by [[Raymond F. Streater]] and [[Arthur S. Wightman]] for their (serious) textbook on [[axiomatic quantum field theory]], ''[[PCT, Spin and Statistics, and All That]]''. This in turn influenced the titles of several other books, monographs, and papers on [[mathematical physics]]: as of November 2013, a search for "and all that" in the open collection of specialized scientific articles [[arXiv]] yields 25 such titles; MathSciNet ([[Mathematical Reviews]] online) lists 83 hits for corresponding mathematical papers. There is also an introductory vector calculus text by H. M. Schey called ''Div, Grad, Curl, and all that''.
* Australian cricketer and cartoonist [[Arthur Mailey]] had taken all 10 wickets for 66 runs in a first-class match during the 1921 tour of England, and hence titled his 1958 autobiography ''10 for 66 And All That''.
* Liverpool band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] featured a song entitled "1966 and All That" on their debut EP ''[[The Trumpton Riots]]''.   
* Welsh rock band [[Mclusky]] recorded the song "1956 and All That" for their third album ''[[The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire]]''.
* ''1089 and All That—A Journey into Mathematics'' is a popular mathematics book by [[David Acheson (mathematician)|David Acheson]].
* ''Amo, Amas, Amat... and All That: How to Become a Latin Lover'' by [[Harry Mount]] is a guide to (and celebration of) the [[Latin language]].
* In 1992, [[Robert Royal]] wrote ''1492 And All That: Political Manipulations of History.'' From the dust jacket: "Spurning the false idealism and bland caricatures of historical actors that distort the arguments of both sides, Robert Royal surveys the available facts and political positions about Columbus and his legacy and seeks to find the truth among them. His provocative analysis recommends a better-balanced reading of our past and a wise use of that base for determining our common future."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* In the 1960s, the railway enthusiasts' book ''Four feet eight and a half and all that'' was published in a comparable style by [[G. R. Mills]], with the same mixture of puns and humour, which will be best appreciated by those who know their subject already. Now out of print but a collector's item. The title is a reference to the [[standard gauge]] of railway tracks.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* In 2000, [[John W. O'Malley]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], published ''Trent and All That: Renaming Catholicism in the Early Modern Era.'' The book deals with historians' attempts to describe, name, and understand the Catholic side of Reformation-era Europe. The title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the habit of most historians giving the subject little thought beyond vague references to the [[Council of Trent]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Algebraic Geometers [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joe Harris]] and [[David Eisenbud]] are soon to publish an intersection theory book called ''3264 and All That.'' 3264 refers to the number of smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics, an answer to a problem in enumerative geometry.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Reaction==

===Post-publication retraction===
In July 2014, the sub-chapter "Punching Out Scruff Face" was removed from later editions of the book, after a three-week trial in U.S. Federal Court wherein the jury found that the author, Chris Kyle, had [[unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] himself by [[defamation|defaming]] plaintiff [[Jesse Ventura]]. In the book, Kyle described blackening the eye of "Scruff Face", whom he later identified in media interviews as Jesse Ventura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_26299954/venturas-1-8m-award-defamation-trial-ruled-reasonable | title=Jesse Ventura's $1.8M award in defamation trial ruled reasonable | work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] | date=August 8, 2014 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury awarded Ventura $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140729-breaking-jury-awards-jesse-ventura-1.8-million-in-american-sniper-lawsuit.ece |title=Jury awards Jesse Ventura $1.8 million in 'American Sniper' lawsuit |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Kyle trial: Jesse Ventura wins $1.8 million in defamation case|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/lake-oswego/index.ssf/2014/07/chris_kyle_trial_jurors_warn_t.html|accessdate=January 15, 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Oregon Live|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, attorneys for Ventura filed a separate lawsuit against HarperCollins, the parent company of the publisher, for failing to check the accuracy of the story it used in publicity.

===Charity donation claims===
Some sources claimed Kyle's family had said all his book proceeds were donated to veterans' charities. ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and ''[[National Review]]'' disputed the donation amount, asserting that around 2 percent ($52,000) went to the charities, while Kyle's family received $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jilani|first1=Zaid|title=7 heinous lies "American Sniper" is telling America|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/01/23/7_enormous_lies_american_sniper_is_telling_america_partner/|accessdate=January 26, 2015|agency=[[Alternet]]|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delgado|first1=A.J.|title=Justice for Jesse: Ventura Was Right in His Lawsuit|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/384176/justice-jesse-ventura-was-right-his-lawsuit-j-delgado/|accessdate=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[National Review Online]]|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military record claims===
In May 2016, ''[[The Intercept]]'' claimed that Kyle's autobiography "embellished" his military record, and that he had been warned by Navy officials about the inaccuracies before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Chris Kyle overstated his military medal record, documents show|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-lied-about-his-record-documents-show/|accessdate=May 26, 2016|agency=Fox 5 San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettys|first1=Travis|title=REVEALED: Conservative hero 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle grossly exaggerated his military record|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2016/05/revealed-conservative-hero-american-sniper-chris-kyle-grossly-exaggerated-his-military-record/|accessdate=May 27, 2018|agency=The Raw Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://theintercept.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-distorted-his-military-record-documents-show/ |title= "American Sniper" Chris Kyle Distorted His Military Record, Documents Show |date= May 25, 2016 |first1= Matthew |last1= Cole |first2= Sheelagh |last2= McNeill |work= [[The Intercept]] |accessdate= May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle's truthfulness is in question once again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/25/how-american-sniper-chris-kyles-truthfulness-is-in-question-once-again/|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|first=Dan|last=Lamothe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including co-author Scott McEwen, disputed this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-author-defends-chris-899044|title='American Sniper' Co-Author Defends Chris Kyle's Military Record Over New Controversy|quote=We submitted the book for vetting with the DOD ... and certain parts of the manuscript were, at their request, redacted. [C]ertain other figures ... for example the number of Chris' confirmed kills —were agreed upon as something that could be released to the public.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' did an analysis, concluding that the newly released internal Navy documents were inconclusive — that the document that typically is the definitive record of military service matched Kyle's claims and that the Navy had not yet publicly stated this document or the facts within it were incorrect. Kyle's [[DD Form 214]] listed a total of two Silver Stars and six Bronze stars, more than he claimed in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-chris-kyle-medal-898004|title='American Sniper' Chris Kyle's Record Under Fire, But Is It a Memorial Day Rush to Judgment?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 8, 2016, the U.S. Navy corrected Kyle's DD-214 regarding some decorations listed on his original discharge document.&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Jamie|publisher=CNN|title=Navy: 'American Sniper' medal count corrected|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy revised it to one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars with valor.&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"/&gt; The Navy said "Kyle would have played no role in the production of his personnel files other than signing the DD-214 upon his discharge" and "[a]fter thoroughly reviewing all available records, the Navy determined an error was made" and "issued a corrected copy of the DD-214, which accurately reflects Kyle's years of honorable and extraordinary service."&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"/&gt;

==Film adaptation==
[[Clint Eastwood]]'s film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) is based on Kyle's autobiography. It had its world première on November 11, 2014, at the [[AFI Fest|American Film Institute Festival]], followed by a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 25, 2014.

{{italic title}}
'''''An Outline of Psychoanalysis''''' is a work by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Returning to an earlier project of providing an overview of [[psychoanalysis]], Freud began writing this work in Vienna in 1938 as he was waiting to leave for London. By September 1938 he had written three-quarters of the book, which was published in 1940, a year after his death. Composed of three sections, the "Outline" opens with a description of the [[psychic apparatus]], including its spatial organization and differentiation into agencies. The ego, which develops through contact with the outside world, attempts to reconcile the needs of the [[Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id|id]], the superego, and reality. The id represents the hereditary past, the superego, tradition. Drives, which are basically conservative and located in the id, represent [[Somatic theory|somatic]] needs for the psyche. Eros and the destruction, or death, impulse, whether antagonists or combined in biological functions, are the two fundamental impulses.

'''''Anastasia''''' is a 1997 American [[Animation|animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed and produced by former [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] directors, [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]] in association with [[Fox Animation Studios]], distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], and starring the voices of [[Meg Ryan]], [[John Cusack]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]. The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], which claims that she, in fact, escaped the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]]. Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old [[amnesia]]c orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess; thus the film shares its plot with [[Anastasia (1956 film)|Fox's prior film from 1956]], which, in turn, was based on the 1955 play of the same name by [[Marcelle Maurette]].

The film was met with criticism by some historians for its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess. Though it enjoyed a positive reception from many critics, the historical inaccuracies were panned. From a $50 million budget, ''Anastasia'' grossed over $139 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date. It received nominations for several awards, including for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] ("[[Journey to the Past]]") and [[Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]]. The success of ''Anastasia'' spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a [[Bartok the Magnificent|direct-to-video spin-off film]], a computer game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IGN: Anastasia: Adventures with Pooka and Bartok | publisher = IGN | url = http://pc.ign.com/objects/854/854157.html | accessdate = December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; books, toys and a [[Anastasia (musical)|stage musical]], which premiered in 2016.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef5"&gt;{{cite web | first=Rialto | last=Chatter | date=July 28, 2012 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading! | url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728 | accessdate=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=April 23, 2015 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=ANASTASIA Musical to Make World Premiere at Hartford Stage Next Summer; Darko Tresnjak to Direct! | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/ANASTASIA-Musical-to-Make-World-Premiere-at-Hartford-Stage-Next-Summer-Darko-Tresnjak-to-Direct-20150423 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1916, [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]], [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] hosts a ball at the [[Catherine Palace]] to celebrate the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty|Romanov tricentennial]]. His mother, the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]], is visiting from [[Paris, France]] and gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words "Together in Paris" as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, 8-year-old [[Grand Duchess Anastasia]]. The ball is suddenly interrupted by the [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] [[Grigori Rasputin]], the former royal adviser to the [[House of Romanov|Romanov family]] until he was [[exile]]d for [[treason]]. Seeking revenge, Rasputin [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul]] in exchange for an unholy [[reliquary]], which he uses to place a [[curse]] on the Romanovs, sparking the [[Russian Revolution]]. During the siege of the palace, only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape with the aid of 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri, who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasia's bedroom. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and suffering [[amnesia]].

Ten years later, Russia is under [[Soviet Union|communist rule]] and Marie has publicly offered 10 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime Vladimir search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, Anastasia—now 18 years old and going by the name of "Anya"—leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, still suffering from amnesia. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names "Pooka", she decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on the necklace she still has, but finds she is unable to leave Russia without an [[exit visa]]. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace, where he and Vladimir have made residence; there, the two men are impressed by her resemblance to the "real" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris.

Bartok, Rasputin's albino bat minion, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where Rasputin, slowly decomposing, survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his [[demon]]ic minions from the reliquary to kill her; despite two attempts, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil his plans, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface.

The trio eventually reach Paris and go to meet Marie, who has given up the search after being tricked by numerous imposters. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anastasia to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught to) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the [[Palais Garnier]] Opera house. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anastasia overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri drags Marie to see Anastasia, who regains her memories as they converse. Convincing the empress of her identity, the two are joyfully reunited.

Marie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them from the siege; to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia. At Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anastasia torn between staying or going with him. Pooka suddenly runs off; Anastasia chases him to the [[Pont Alexandre III]], where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is soon injured and knocked unconscious. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin disintegrates and dies.

In the aftermath, Anastasia and Dimitri reconcile after Anastasia discovers the truth; they elope, and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. The couple are then seen kissing on a riverboat. Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.

In May 1994, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]] had signed a long-term deal to produce animated features with 20th Century Fox with the studio channeling more than $100 million in constructing the animation studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Company Town Annex|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-04/business/fi-53741_1_animated-films|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 4, 1994|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They selected [[Phoenix, Arizona]], for the location of the new animation studio because the state offered the company about $1 million in job training funds and low-interest loans for the state-of-the-art digital animation equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1995/08/18/203658-animated-film-a-first-for-state | title=Animated film a first for state | work=[[The Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Tucson Citizen]] | date=August 18, 1995 | accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a staff of 300 artists and technicians, a third of whom worked with Bluth and Goldman in [[Dublin, Ireland]], for [[Sullivan Bluth Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox produces animated feature - with a difference|url=http://lubbockonline.com/news/042297/fox.htm|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=April 22, 1997 | accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their first project, the studio insisted they select one out of a dozen existing properties which they owned where Bluth and Goldman suggested adapting ''[[The King and I]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Verniere |title= High toon in Hollywood - Disney has long dominated animation, but with 'Anastasia,' Fox cuts in. |newspaper=[[The Boston Herald]] |format=Fee required |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate=November 4, 2015 |date=November 16, 1997 |first=James |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56441515.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Bluth and Goldman felt it would be impossible to improve on [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s performance and [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s score. Following several story suggestions, the idea to adapt ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' originated from Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO [[Bill Mechanic]]. They would later adapt story elements from ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' with the peasant Anya being molded into a regal woman.&lt;ref name="Battleroyal"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kuklenski|first=Valerie|title=Battle Royal for Animation Crew; 'Anastasia' Putting Fox In The Game|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BATTLE+ROYAL+FOR+ANIMATION+CROWN%3B+%60ANASTASIA'+PUTTING+FOX+IN+THE+GAME.-a083892460|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com#TheFreeLibrary.com|TheFreeLibrary.com]]|date=November 18, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early into production, Bluth and Goldman began researching the actual events through enlisting former [[CIA]] agents stationed in Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="OnceUponaNovember"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schnurr|first=Samantha|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/892883/once-upon-a-november-behind-the-scenes-of-anastasia-20-years-later|title=Once Upon a November: Behind the Scenes of Anastasia 20 Years Later|publisher=''[[E! Online]]''|date=November 20, 2017|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this same time, screenwriter Eric Tuchman had written a script that co-screenwriter Bruce Graham described as being "very adult, very based in reality, all about politics, and without any magic or comedy". Eventually, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film.&lt;ref name="Battleroyal" /&gt; In 1995, Graham and Susan Gauthier reworked Tuchman's script into a lighthearted romantic comedy. When Graham and Gauthier moved onto other projects, husband-and-wife screenwriting team [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired for additional rewrites.&lt;ref name="HeatVision"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bitran|first=Tara|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anastasia-was-originally-darker-eyed-woody-allen-role-1058446|title='Anastasia' Was Originally Much Darker and Eyed Woody Allen for Role|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Carrie Fisher]] also made uncredited rewrites of the film particularly the scene in which Anya leaves the orphanage for Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee Lenker|first=Maureen|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/21/anastasia-songs-lynn-ahrens-stephen-flaherty/|title=''Anastasia'' composers tell the stories behind the film's most beloved songs|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the villains, Bluth also did not take into consideration depicting [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolsheviks]], and initially toyed with the idea of a police chief with a vendetta against Anastasia. Instead, they decided to have [[Grigori Rasputin]] as the villain with Goldman explaining it was because of "all the different things they did to try to destroy Rasputin and what a horrible man he really was, the more it seemed appetizing to make him the villain".&lt;ref name="OnceUponaNovember" /&gt; In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin. "I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh. A bat seemed a natural friend for Rasputin. Making him a white bat came later - just to make him different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vincent|title="Anastasia" Touching Off War New 20th Century Fox Film Threatens Disney's Hold on Animation Market|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68516406.html|newspaper=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|via=HighBeam Research|first=Mal|date=November 22, 1997 | accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composers Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens recalled being at Au Bon Pain in New York City where Rasputin and Bartok were pitched, and being dismayed at the decision to go down a historically inaccurate route; they made their stage musical adaption "more sophisticated, more far-reaching, more political" to encompass their original vision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/how-ahrens-and-flaherty-are-re-envisioning-anastasia-for-the-stage|title=How Ahrens and Flaherty Are Re-Envisioning Anastasia For the Stage {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Bluth stated that [[Meg Ryan]] was his first and only choice for the title character. However, Ryan was indecisive about accepting the role due to its dark historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearlman|title=Like her characters, Meg Ryan is sweet, tart|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4410328.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=HighBeam Research|first=Cindy|format=Fee required|date=November 16, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To persuade her, the animation team took an audio clip of Annie Reed from ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and created an animation reel based on it which was screened for her following an invitation to the studio. "I was blown away that they did that", Ryan later confessed, and accepted the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Meg Ryan Learned To Sigh Like 'Anastasia'|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971121&amp;slug=2573647|last=Stark|first=Susan|work=[[The Detroit News]]|publisher=The Seattle News|date=November 21, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Ryan was cast, Broadway singer and actress [[Liz Callaway]] was brought in to record several demos of the songs hoping to land a job in [[backing vocalist|background vocals]], but were liked well enough by the songwriters that were ultimately used in the final film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|title=Voice in toon // Animation not new to Callaway|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4412289.html|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|via=HighBeam Research|first=Jae-Ha|format=Fee required|date=December 28, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cusack openly admitted after being cast that he couldn't sing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovell|title=John Cusack won't be an Oscar nominee again but he should be|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-70238960.html|newspaper=[[Knight Ridder]]|via=HighBeam Research|first=Glenn|format=Fee required|date=February 9, 2001|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which his singing duties were performed by [[Jonathan Dokuchitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ai|title=Mystique of 'Anastasia'|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-4546913.html|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|via=HighBeam Research|first=Tan Lang|format=Fee required|date=November 3, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter O'Toole]] was considered for the role of Rasputin, but [[Christopher Lloyd]] was hired because of his involvement with the ''[[Back to the Future]]'' trilogy. Bartok was initially written for [[Woody Allen]], but the studio was reluctant to hire him following revelations of his relationship with his ex-partner [[Mia Farrow]]'s adoptive daughter, [[Soon-Yi Previn]].&lt;ref name="HeatVision" /&gt; [[Martin Short]] was also considered, but [[Hank Azaria]] won the role ten minutes into his audition.&lt;ref name="OnceUponaNovember" /&gt;

==Release==
20th Century Fox scheduled for ''Anastasia'' to be released on November 21, 1997, notably a week after the 1997 re-release of Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Disney claimed it had long-planned for the 17-day re-release to coincide with a consumer products campaign leading into Christmas and the film's home video release in March 1998, as well continue the tradition for re-releasing the film within a seven- to eight-year interval. In addition to this, Disney would release several competing family films including ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'' on the following weekend, as well as a [[double feature]] of ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]'' and ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title=Draw and Fire: Disney Flexes Financial Muscle to Protect Its Animation Turf|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/10/business/fi-41150/|page=[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/10/business/fi-41150/2 2]|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=October 10, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, Disney refused to advertise for ''Anastasia'' on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#The Wonderful World of Disney (1991 – present)|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', and banned its corporate sponsors from airing film clips during their television commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World War 'Toon|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1997/11/07/world-war-toon |author=EW Staff |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 7, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the fierce competition between the two films, Disney spokesman John Dreyer brushed off allegations of studio rivalry, claiming "We always re-release our movies around holiday periods". However, Fox executives refused to believe Dreyer's statement with Bill Mechanic responding that "It's a deliberate attempt to be a bully, to kick sand in our face. They can't be trying to maximize their own business; the amount they're spending on advertising is ridiculous...It's a concentrated effort to keep our film from fulfilling its potential."&lt;ref name="Animationbattle" /&gt;

===Marketing===
''Anastasia'' was accompanied with a marketing campaign at more than $50 million with promotional sponsors from [[Burger King]], [[Dole Food Company]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]], [[Pond's|Chesebrough-Ponds]], [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell Oil]], and the [[1997 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. Overall, the marketing costs exceeded that of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' by more than 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/fox-s-toon-high-noon-1116677167/|title=Fox’s toon high noon|last=Petrikin|first=Chris|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 26, 1997|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For merchandising, Fox selected [[Galoob]] to license dolls based on Anastasia.&lt;ref name="Animationbattle"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Farhi| last2=Salerno| title=Animation's New Battle Lines; With 'Anastasia' Marketing Blitz, 20th Century Tries to Out-Fox Disney |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-756093.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|via=HighBeam Research|first1=Paul|first2=Heather| date=November 21, 1997 | accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many storybooks adapted from the film were released by [[Little Golden Books]].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Anastasia'' received a positive reception from critics. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 85% based on 52 reviews with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads, "Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make ''Anastasia'' a winning first film from Fox animation studios."&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes&gt;{{cite web|title=Anastasia (1997)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1079818-anastasia/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing, "The result is entertaining and sometimes exciting".&lt;ref name=ebertanastasia&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Anastasia|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/anastasia-1997|work=Roger Ebert|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=May 10, 2013|date=November 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' described ''Anastasia'' as "charming" and "entertaining", concluding, "''Anastasia'' serves up a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess".&lt;ref name=cincinnatianastasia&gt;{{cite web|last=McGurk |first=Margaret |title=Dancing around history |url=http://cincinnati.com/freetime/movies/mcgurk/anastasia.html |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |publisher=news.cincinnati.com |accessdate=May 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201151650/http://cincinnati.com/freetime/movies/mcgurk/anastasia.html |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Osbourne of ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'' called the film "pure family entertainment."&lt;ref name=boxofficeanastasia&gt;{{cite web|last=Osborne |first=Lisa |title=Anastasia |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/reviews/theatrical/2008-08-anastasia |work=Boxoffice |publisher=Boxoffice Media, LLC |accessdate=May 10, 2013 |date=November 14, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202161118/http://www.boxoffice.com/reviews/theatrical/2008-08-anastasia |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Awarding the film three out of five stars, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'''s Philip Thomas wrote, "Historical inaccuracies aside, Anastasia manages to be a charming little movie".&lt;ref name=empireanastasia&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas| first=Philip|title=Anastasia|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=164|work=Empire|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics have drawn positive comparisons between ''Anastasia'' and the Disney films released during the [[Disney Renaissance]], noting similarities in their story and animation styles. Marjorie Baumgarten of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' awarded the film three out of five stars. Likening its quality to that of a Disney animated film, Baumgarten wrote that ''Anastasia'' "may not beat Disney at its own game, but it sure won't be for lack of trying". Baumgarten continued, "[t]his sumptuous-looking film clearly spared no expense in its visual rendering; its optical flourishes and attention to detail aim for the Disney gold standard and, for the most part, come pretty darn close".&lt;ref name=austinchronicle&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|title=Anastasia|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1997-11-21/140819/|work=The Austin Chronicle|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp|accessdate=May 10, 2013|date=November 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]''{{'s}} Jeffrey Gantz jokingly stated, "[i]f imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, then the folks at Disney should feel royally complimented by Twentieth Century Fox's new animated feature about Tsar Nicholas II's youngest daughter."&lt;ref name=phoenixanastasia&gt;{{cite web|last=Gantz |first=Jeffrey |title=Anastasia |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archives/1997/documents/00524793.htm |work=The Phoenix |publisher=The Phoenix |accessdate=May 10, 2013 |date=November 20, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403022522/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archives/1997/documents/00524793.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "Fox's challenge to the Disney empire is a beautifully animated musical". However, Gleiberman continued, "''Anastasia'' has the Disney house style down cold, yet the magic is missing."&lt;ref name=eweeklygleiberman&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Anastasia (1997)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,63435,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc|accessdate=May 10, 2013|date=October 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception in Russia was also, for the most part, positive despite the artistic liberties that the film took with Russian history. [[Gemini Films]], the Russian distributor of ''Anastasia'', stressed the fact that the story was "not history", but rather "a fairy tale set against the background of real Russian events" in the film's Russian marketing campaign so that its Russian audience would not view ''Anastasia'' "as a historical film".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;{{cite news| last = Saffron | first = Ingra | title = A Cartoon 'Anastasia' Charms a New Russia / Bolsheviks Get Written Out. | newspaper = The Philadelphia Inquirer | page = A01 | date = March 19, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Russians praised the film for its art and storytelling and saw it as "not so much a piece of history but another Western import to be consumed and enjoyed".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

Some [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christians, on the other hand, found ''Anastasia'' to be an offensive depiction of the Grand Duchess, who was [[Canonization of the Romanovs|canonized]] as a [[new martyr]] in 1981 by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mattingly |first=Terry |title=Upset about Anastasia's movie portrayal |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |date=November 29, 1997 |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |publisher= |url=http://texnews.com/religion97/matt112997.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518175127/http://texnews.com/religion97/matt112997.html |archivedate=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians echoed their sentiments, criticizing the film as a "sanitized, sugar-coated reworking of the story of the Czar's youngest daughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Holden | first = Stephen | title = Film Review: A Feeling We're Not in Russia Anymore | publisher = The New York Times | date = November 14, 1997 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/movies/film-review-a-feeling-we-re-not-in-russia-anymore.html | accessdate = December 31, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124033247/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/movies/film-review-a-feeling-we-re-not-in-russia-anymore.html| archivedate=January 24, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the filmmakers acknowledged the fact that "''Anastasia'' uses history only as a starting point", others complained that the film would provide its audience with misleading facts about Russian history, which, according to the author and historian Suzanne Massie, "has been falsified for so many years".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; Similarly, the amateur historian Bob Atchison said that ''Anastasia'' was akin to someone making a film in which [[Anne Frank]] "moves to [[Orlando]] and opens a crocodile farm with a guy named Mort".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

Some of Anastasia's contemporary relatives also felt that the film was distasteful, but most Romanovs have come to accept the "repeated exploitation of Anastasia's romantic tale...with equanimity".&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldberg| first = Carey | title = After the Revolution, Comes 'Anastasia' the Cartoon | publisher = The New York Times | date = November 9, 1997 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/movies/after-the-revolution-comes-anastasia-the-cartoon.html | accessdate = December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
A [[limited release]] of ''Anastasia'' at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on the weekend of November 14, 1997, grossed $120,541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Moviegoers Track 'The Jackal'| publisher = The Los Angeles Times| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/18/entertainment/ca-54921 | accessdate = June 7, 2012| first=Robert W.| last=Welkos| date=November 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, the wide release of ''Anastasia'' in the United States made $14.1 million (for an average of about $5,692 from 2,478 theaters), which placed it as the #2 film for the weekend of November 21–23, 1997.

===Stage musical adaptation===
{{main|Anastasia (musical)}}

On April 21, 2015, Hartford Stage, [[Hartford, Connecticut]], announced that they will premiere a new stage production of ''Anastasia'', with the book by [[Terrence McNally]], lyrics by [[Lynn Ahrens]], music by [[Stephen Flaherty]] and directed by Darko Tresnjak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfly.co/n8HYp "Hartford Stage Announces Tony Award-winner Darko Tresnjak Will Direct World Premiere of Anastasia"] Hartford Stage&lt;/ref&gt; The production ran from May 13 through June 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam. [http://www.playbill.com/article/anastasia-musical-leaps-from-screen-to-stage-tonight# "Broadway-Bound ''Anastasia'' Begins Previews After Delay"], Playbill, May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an original new musical combining both the 1956 Fox film and the 1997 animated film. According to Tresnjak, the musical features six songs from the animated movie and additionally includes 16 new songs. Additionally, there have been some newly rewritten characters including Checkist secret Police officer Gleb Vaganov (in the place of Rasputin), and Lily, who has been renamed in the place of Sophie.&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert and Hetrick, Adam. [http://www.playbill.com/article/cast-announced-for-ahrens-and-flahertys-stage-anastasia-com-351490# "Cast Announced for Ahrens and Flaherty's Stage 'Anastasia'"] Playbill, March 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; McNally said "This is a stage version for a modern theatre audience...The libretto’s 'a blend' of old and new...There are characters in the musical that appear in neither the cartoon nor the Ingrid Bergman version.”&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Mervyn. [http://www.playbill.com/article/what-to-expect-from-terrence-mcnallys-new-anastasia# "What to Expect From Terrence McNally’s New 'Anastasia'"] playbill.com, April 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartford production featured [[Christy Altomare]] as Anastasia/Anya, [[Derek Klena]] as Dimitri, [[Mary Beth Peil]] as The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, [[Manoel Felciano]] as Gleb Vaganov, [[John Bolton (actor)|John Bolton]] as Vladimir, [[Caroline O'Connor (actress)|Caroline O'Connor]] as Lily, and Nicole Scimeca as Young Anastasia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Christy-Altomare-and-Derek-Klena-Will-Lead-Hartford-Stages-World-Premiere-of-ANASTASIA-20160309 "'Christy Altomare and derek Klena Will Lead Hartford Stages World Premiere of 'Anastasia'"] broadwayworld.com, March 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The musical transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] with much of the original Hartford cast, opening on April 24, 2017, at the [[Broadhurst Theatre|Broadhurst Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/28/anastasia-musical-broadway-cast-opening " 'Anastasia 'musical arriving on Broadway in 2017"] Ew.com, June 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; to mixed reviews.

'''Artraker''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Community Interest Company]] established in 2012 and the brain-child of political artist, [[Manali Jagtap]]. Artraker annually recognizes artworks that helps shape and inspire through [[visual arts]] how people and organisations understand, engage and respond to [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/#/about/4571166102/ “About Artraker”], Artraker Official Website, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Artraker Annual Award ==
Artraker celebrates and awards art works and art projects that make a direct positive change in countries which have experienced [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/20/artraker-artists-conflict-zones-in-pictures/ |title=Artraker award: artists in conflict zones fight back – in pictures |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artraker Awards differ from other awards such as the [[Turner Prize]] or the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]]. Although like them, Artraker awards [[contemporary art]], it is not primarily interested in the significance of the artists’ contribution to the disciplines of [[art]] or [[photography]], but is focused instead on the ability of art to create opportunities for change and to co-create experiences of freedom even in the midst of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/ “Dr Bernadette Buckley, Artraker Jury and Advisory Member”], Unseen, Unknown, and Unsung – Artraker Story, 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Annual Awards are announced during the week of International Peace Day each year and include three [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 2500 cash prizes.  The Artraker Awards are designed by London-based wood artist Sebastian Cox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandconflict.org.uk/news/global-artrakers-unleashed-on-international-peace-day/ “Global Artrakers unleashed on International Peace Day”], Culture+Conflict, 8 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected by an international jury from over 300 submissions from 90 countries, South African photographer Alexia Webster received the first Artraker Annual Award on [[International Day of Peace]] (21 September 2013) from [[Martin Bell]] at a ceremony which took place at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gostoli |first=Ylenia |url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/artraker/ |title=Art of Peace : Artraker Award Winners |publisher=[[Trebuchet Magazine]] |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Awards for 2014 were selected from 250 entries and included three award categories: The Artraker Award, Artraker Award for Social Impact, and Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative (supported by a/political).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/artraker-awards/4571762059 “Artraker Awards 2014”]&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were San Zaw Htway (Artraker Award),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/san-zaw-htway/4586127186 “Recycling Myanmar's Dignity”]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror Image (Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/mirror-image/4586001543 “Cutting Away the Void”]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lorena Wolffer (Artraker Award for Social Impact).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/lorena-wolffer/4586004589 “States of Exception”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patrons and Partners ==
Artraker’s founding patrons and partners (2012-2013) are leading [[peacebuilding]], creative, cultural, and academic organisations that  include International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting Ltd, [[International Alert]], Pulse Brands Ltd, [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], Integrity Research and Consultancy Ltd, and Culture+Conflict.&lt;ref name="integrityresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityresearch.com/integrity-blog/understanding-conflict-through-art-artraker/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925050731/http://integrityresearch.com/integrity-blog/understanding-conflict-through-art-artraker |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-09-25 |title=Understanding Conflict Through Art: Artraker |publisher=Integrity Research and Consultancy |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name 'Artraker' is derived from "[[Muckraker]]", a term coined by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1906. It refers to the adversarial journalistic movement that investigated and published truthful reports on social issues.&lt;ref name="integrityresearch" /&gt;

'''Beit She'arim''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שְׁעָרִים}}, "House of the Gates") is  the currently used name for the ancient Jewish town of '''Bet She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|בּית שערַיִם}}, "House of Two Gates") or '''Kfar She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|כְּפר שערַיִם}}, "Village of Two Gates").&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its [[Arabic]] name '''Sheikh Ibreik''' or '''Sheikh Abreik''',&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; and which historical geographer [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 137 in: {{cite journal |last=Vitto|first=Fanny |title=Byzantine Mosaics at Bet She'arim: New Evidence for the History of the Site |journal='Atiqot |accessdate=31 August 2018 |volume=28|issue= |pages=115-146 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23458348 |date=1996|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}. In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kila'im'' 9:3), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, ({{Lang-he-n|בית שריי}}), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' ''[[Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 24, ({{lang-gr|Βησάραν}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another Arabic name is ''bayt al-ġurabāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|بيت الغرباء}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive [[necropolis]] of [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tombs]] and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|National Parks Authority]] as the '''Beit She'arim National Park'''. It borders the town of [[Kiryat Tiv'on]] on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of [[Moshav]] [[Beit She'arim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02881.html Modern Bet She'arim] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated 20&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Haifa]] in the southern foothills of the [[Lower Galilee]].

In 2015 it was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4676480,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1471], [[UNESCO world heritage site]],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
According to [[Moshe Sharon]], following [[Yechezkel Kutscher]], the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates).&lt;ref name="Sharon"&gt;Sharon, Moshe (2004), Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol. III, D-F; page XXXVII [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also "Bet She'arayim", which is more closely related to the [[Ancient Greek]] rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, "Besara".&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud, Punctuated'' ({{Hebrew|תלמוד בבלי מנוקד}}), ed. Yosef Amar, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Sanhedrin'' 32b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, {{Hebrew|בֵּית}}, is "beit", while the traditional King James one is "beth", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited "bet".

==History==

===Iron Age===
Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Second Temple period===
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus1-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Two lions facing each other, a Greek mythological scene decorating a sarcophagus in the Cave of the Coffins]]
Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King [[Herod the Great|Herod]].&lt;ref name=Mazar19&gt;Benjamin Mazar, ''Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936-1940'', Vol. I, p19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], in his [[The Life of Flavius Josephus|''Vita'']], referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of [[Berenice II of Egypt|Queen Berenice]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[Benjamin Mazar]] described it as a prosperous [[Jew]]ish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] and that after some time it was renewed as a [[Byzantine]] city,&lt;ref name=Mazar19/&gt; but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; The [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, the  [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]] (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the [[Mishna]], lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to [[Sepphoris]] for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The most desired burial place for Jews was the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]], but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhPlUt1kz-wC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=land+beit+she%27arim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IHnzWvgzpQ&amp;sig=8ycK-VQl1S8C-BScn4fxQfR8iqI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=czzcSp_6NqSwnQPvpKzaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Holy Land: An Oxford archaeological guide, From earliest times to 1700, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the [[Jewish Diaspora]], from nearby [[Phoenicia]]&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; to far-away [[Himyar]] in [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Hymiar"&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; to be buried next to his grave.

While it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in [[Greek language|Greek]], but also in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of [[Umayyad]] (7th-8th centuries) and [[Abassid]] (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; A large Abbasid-period [[glassmaking]] facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see [[Beit She'arim National Park#Glassmaking industry (Abbasid period)|below]]).

===Crusader period===
There is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the [[Crusades|Crusader period]] (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Ottoman period===
A small Arab village called [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun|Sheikh Bureik]] was located here in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter; Abdulfattah, Kamal (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband, Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A map by [[Pierre Jacotin]]  from [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of 1799]] showed the place, named as ''Cheik Abrit.''&lt;ref&gt;Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is mentioned again in [[Palestine Exploration Fund|The Survey of Western Palestine]] (SWP) citing data from 1859,&lt;ref name=SWP.273&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/273/mode/1up 273]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1875 by [[Victor Guérin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n408/mode/1up  395]-397&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the  [[Sursuk family]] of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/356/mode/1up  356]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Survey of Western Palestine", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqam'']] (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of [[adobe|mud]], and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150.&lt;ref name=SWP.273/&gt; During [[World War I]], the "finest oaks" of Sheikh Bureik were "ruthlessly destroyed" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, report of 1923, quoted by R. El-Eini, British forestry policy in Mandate Palestine 1929-48: Aims and realities, ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 35, 1999, pp 72–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate===
The October [[1922 census of Palestine]] recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1922/p33.pdf  33]&lt;/ref&gt; At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the [[Jewish National Fund]], via [[Yehoshua Hankin]], a [[Zionist]] activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in Ottoman Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Avneri, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Teb4dKHQcoC&amp;pg=PA122 122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1925, according to [[Media:ShawSursockTable.png|List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine]], evidence to the [[Shaw Commission]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and [[Harbaj]], a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth W. Stein]], ''The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], a Zionist political party and settlement movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Jewish Encyclopedia'', Vol 6, entry "Colonies, Agricultural", p287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Visitors at the Cave of the Coffins]]
The archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/343/mode/1up Survey of Western Palestine, Vol. I, pp. 325-328 and 343-351]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]].  In 1936, [[Alexander Zaïd]], employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and [[Nahman Avigad]].

===Jewish necropolis===
Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as [[Palmyra]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'' considers Beth She'arim of international importance (Volume 1, p. 309-11); Tessa Rajak considers its importance regional ("The rabbinic dead and the Diaspora dead at Beth She’arim" in P. Schäfer (ed.), ''The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture'' 1 (Tübingen 1997), p. 349-66); S. Schwartz however, in ''Imperialism and Jewish society, 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E.'' (Princeton 2001), p. 153-8, plays down the importance of Beth She'arim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in [[relief]], ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.&lt;ref name="Beth She'arim"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1643/ Beth She'arim], [[UNESCO world heritage site]] "tentative list", summary from 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1124426.html Row erupts over discovery of Beit Shearim caves, [[Haaretz]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cave of Judah the Prince====
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]], Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kelaim 9, 32a-b&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral is described as follows: "Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a)." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/97mag/betshearim/betshearim.htm Bet Shearim archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beit She'arim - The Jewish necropolis of the Roman Period |author= |work=www.mfa.gov.il |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2000 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/beit%20she-arim%20-%20the%20jewish%20necropolis%20of%20the%20roman.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'', Volume 1, p. 309-11. For a more cautious view see M. Jacobs, ''Die Institution des jüdischen Patriarchen, eine quellen- und traditionskritische Studie zur Geschichte der Juden in der Spätantike'' (Tübingen 1995), p. 247, n. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads "Simon [Shimon] my son shall be [[hakham]] [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son [[Nasi (Hebrew title)#Late Roman empire to medieval period|patriarch]], Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi [[Hanina bar Hama]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;  Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of "R. Gamliel" and "R. Shimon", believed to refer to Judah's sons, the ''nasi'' [[Gamaliel III]] and the ''hakham'' Rabbi Shimon.&lt;ref name="Zelcer"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Jerusalem Talmud |series= |author=Heshey Zelcer |year=2002 |location= |publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]] |page=74 |isbn=9781581126303 |quote=In 1954 two adjoining sepulchres in cave 14 in Bet She'arim were discovered bearing the inscriptions in Hebrew and Greek "R.

====Himyarite tombs====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yemenite Jews]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
[[File:Tomb Inscription of Himyarite buried in Beit She'arim National Park (Israel).jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Himyarite, in Greek uncials]]

In 1937, [[Benjamin Mazar]] revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of [[Himyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) dating back to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946,  pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the [[Sanhedrin]]. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet ''qyl ḥmyr'' [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called ''Menae presbyteros'' (Menaḥem, the community's elder).&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56 – 57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature ''qyl ḥmyr''. He notes that today the inscription ''Menae presbyteros'' can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is ''Ômêritôn'' [the Ḥimyari].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid period===

====Glassmaking industry====
In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A [[glassmaking]] furnace was located here in the 9th century during the [[History of Palestine#Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid periods|Abbasid period]], which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sheikh+ibreik&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikh%20ibreik&amp;f=false  pp86-87].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=9420 The Mystery Slab of Beit She'arim, Corning Glass Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:מערת_הלולבים.JPG|thumb|"Cave of the [[Lulav]]im"]]

====Poem inside catacomb====
An [[elegy]] written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the ''Magharat al-Jahannam'' ("Cave of Hell") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in [[acrostic]] in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun#Poem from Abbasid period|here]] on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xli&gt;Sharon, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR41 xli]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well.&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii&gt;Sharon, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR42  p.xlii]&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii/&gt;

===Recent excavations===
[[File:The gate of Bet Shearim 01.jpg|250px|thumb|The gate of Bet Shearim  that eas published on January 2017]]
The excavations at the site were resumed by  Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The [[University of Haifa]]. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beth-Shearim-Excavation/556477027790445 Official Facebook page of renewed expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhils''' or '''Bheels''' are primarily an ethnic group of people in [[West India]]. Bhils are also settled in the [[Tharparkar District]] of [[Sindh]], Pakistan. They speak the [[Bhil languages]], a subgroup of the [[Indo-Aryan languages#Western Zone|Western Zone]] of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. As of 2013, Bhils were the largest tribal group in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://tribal.nic.in/ST/StatisticalProfileofSTs2013.pdf|title=Statistical Profile of Scheduled Tribes in India|last=|first=|publisher=Ministry of Tribal Affairs|year=2013|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhils are listed as indigenous people of the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Rajasthan]] - all in the  western [[Deccan]] regions and central India - as well as in [[Tripura]] in far-eastern India, on the border with [[Bangladesh]]. Bhils are divided into a number of [[endogamy|endogamous]] territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. Most Bhils now speak the language of the region they reside in, such as [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] or a [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] dialect.

== Present circumstances ==

In Azamgarh and Jaunpur, the Bhil are now mainly a community of settled farmers, with a significant minority who are landless agricultural labourers. A significant subsidiary occupation remains hunting and gathering. The Bhil are now largely [[Hindu]], with [[Nirdhi Bhil|Nirdhi]] following [[Islam]], and few sub-groups in the [[Dang District, India|Dangs]] following [[Christianity]]. They continue to worship tribal deities such as Dev Mogra Mata and Sitla Mata.&lt;ref name="R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham page 214"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 214 to 221 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India Maharashtra Volume XXX  Part  One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 280–286&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhil are classified as a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribe]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], Rajasthan and [[Tripura]] under the [[Reservation in India|Indian government's reservation program]] of [[positive discrimination]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-divisions ==
The Bhil are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. The main divisions in [[Gujarat]] are the [[Barda (tribe)|Barda]], [[Dungri Garasia]], and [[Vasava]], while in [[Maharashtra]], the [[Bhil Mavchi]] and Kotwal are their main sub-groups.&lt;ref name="R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham page 214"/&gt;

In [[Rajasthan]], they exist as  [[Bhil Garasia]], [[Dholi Bhil]], [[Dungri Bhil]], [[Dungri Garasia]], [[Mewasi Bhil]], [[Rawal Bhil]], [[Tadvi Bhil]], [[Bhagalia]], [[Bhilala]], Pawra, [[Vasava]] and [[Vasave]].&lt;ref name="census2001"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Census of India: Government of India |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |date=7 March 2007 |title=List of Scheduled Tribes |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605042409/http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The [[Vasava]] and [[Vasave]] in [[Rajasthan]] may be alternate transliterations of the name for a single community.

== Language ==
[[File:A partial specimen of the Bhili Language.png|thumb|Partial specimen of the Bhili language]]
The language commonly spoken by Bhils throughout their geographic distribution is [[Bhili language|Bhili]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoQqpkfrXfAC&amp;dq=bhil+language&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Ethnographic Atlas of Indian Tribes|last=Mehta|first=Sonu|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Mehta|editor-first=Prakash Chandra|location=New Delhi|pages=191|chapter=Bhils - I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhili has about up to 36 identified dialects and pronunciation differs by region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/14048|title=Dialect Continuum in the Bhil Tribal Belt: Grammatical Aspects|last=Phillips|first=Maxwell P.|publisher=University of London|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhili is based on Gujarati, but dialects of Bhili gradually merge into more widely-spoken languages such as Marathi in the southeast and Rajasthani in the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcTz54VVHF4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Being Tribal|last=Ratnagar|first=Shereen|publisher=Primus Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Bhils have rich and unique culture. The Bhilala sub-division is known for its [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pachauri|first1=Swasti|title=Pithora art depicts different hues of tribal life|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/pithora-art-depicts-different-hues-of-tribal-life/|accessdate=13 February 2015|work=Indian Express|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghoomar]] is a traditional [[folk dance]] of Bhil tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inquisitive Social Sciences|last=Kumar|first=Ashok Kiran|publisher=S.

[[Wheat]] and [[rice]] are used at time of festivals and other special occasions only. They keep self-made bows and arrow, sword, Knife, axe etc with them as weapon for self-protection and hunting the wild fauna which also form the major part of their diet. They profusely use alcohol distilled by them from the flower of Mahua([[Madhuca longifolia]]). On festive occasions various special preparation from the dish rich, i.e Makka, genhu, lapsi, kasar and chawal etc. Bhils are traditionally non-vegetarian. They eat the meat of Goat, Chicken, Fish, Bull, Deer etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith and worship===
Every village has its own local deity ([[Gramadevata|Gramdev]]) and families too have their Jatidev, [[Kuladevata|Kuldev]] and Kuldevi(house hold deity) which symbolised by stones. 'Bhati dev' and 'Bhilat dev' are their serpent-god. 'Baba dev' is their village god. Karkulia dev is their crop god, Gopal dev is their pastoral god, Bag dev is their Lion god, Bhairav dev is their dog god. Some of their other gods are Indel dev, Bada dev, Mahadevel, Tejaji, Lotha mai, Techma, Orka Chichma and Kajal dev. A number of Hindu deities have now also been worshipped by them, viz. [[Hanuman]], [[Shri Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Shiva]], [[Laxmi]], [[Ganesh]], [[Kuber]], [[Indra]] and  [[Durga]]. 

They have much faith in magico-religious beliefs and [[Bhopa]]s for their physical, mental and psycological treatements. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
There are a number of festivals, viz. [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]], [[Navratri]], [[Dashera]], [[Diwali]], [[Holi]] which celebrated by the Bhils. They also celebrate some traditional festivals viz. Akhatij, Navmi, Howan Mata ki Chalavani, Sawan Mata ki jatar, Diwasa, Nawai, Bhagoria, Gal, Gar, Dhobi, Sanja, Indel, Doha etc with ceremonious zeal and ethusiasm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21478">A '''book club''' is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have [[reading (activity)|read]] and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book sales club]], which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include '''reading group''', '''book group''', and '''book discussion group'''. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, [[library|libraries]], [[bookstore]]s, online forums, pubs, and in cafés or restaurants over meals or drinks.

A practice also associated with book discussion, '''common reading program''' or '''common read''', involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.

== Single-title clubs ==
A single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.

There may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.

== Multi-title clubs ==
The characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.

=== Open loans ===
Open loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.

=== Catch and release ===
Catch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with [[BookCrossing]]. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.

==Library book clubs==
Many [[public library|public libraries]] lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis.  A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book.  Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting.  If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility,  often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron.  Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book.  The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions.  This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes, V., Hill, M.A., &amp; Frisbee, J. L. (2008). Reviving literary discussion: Book club to go kits. ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly, 48''(1), 30-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of [[Google+]] hangouts and [[Skype]] to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliss, A. F. (2014). A novel idea: librarians reimagine book clubs with the help of technology. American Libraries, (5). 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online clubs ==
With the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of [[Internet forum]]s, [[Yahoo Groups]], e-mail [[mailing list]]s, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com,&lt;ref&gt;Goodreads. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.goodreads.com/group&lt;/ref&gt; apps such as [http://novellic.com Novellic] and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of [[social networks]], these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.

== Author led clubs ==
In 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club "[http://www.12booksgroup.com 12 Books]." Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live [[conference call]] or [[webinar]].

== Broadcast clubs ==
A broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:

* "[[Oprah's Book Club]]", a segment of the American television show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]]
* "[[Book Club of the Air]]", a segment of [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s American radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' hosted by [[Ray Suarez]]
* "Good Morning America Book Club", a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s American television show ''[[Good Morning America]]''
* "Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)", a segment of [[Univision]]'s American Spanish-language television show ''[[¡Despierta América!]] (Wake Up America)'' hosted by [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]]
* "[[Richard &amp; Judy#Richard .26 Judy Book Club|Richard &amp; Judy Book Club]]", a segment of [[Channel 4]]'s British television show ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]'' hosted by [[Richard and Judy|Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan]]
* ''[[Bookclub (radio)|Bookclub]]'', a British radio show on the [[BBC Radio 4]] station hosted by [[James Naughtie]]
* ''[[First Tuesday Book Club]]'', an Australian television show on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network hosted by [[Jennifer Byrne]]
* "Jonny's Book Club", a segment of the weekly [[podcast]] ''[[Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern]]'' hosted by [[Jonny McGovern]]

== Book reading clubs ==
Given the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group [[Reading (process)#History|reads the book out loud]] while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the "homework" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.

The most popular car colours today are [[greyscale]] colours, with over 70% of cars produced globally being [[white]], [[black]], [[grey]] or [[silver (color)|silver]]. [[Red]], [[blue]] and [[brown]]/[[beige]] cars range between 6% and 9% each, while all other colours amount to less than 5%.

== Financial impacts of colour choice ==
Silver is a popular colour for rental vehicles.&lt;ref name="peterson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/brn/070914/22589.html?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |title=Hottest Car Colors |author=Erin Peterson |publisher=Yahoo! Personal Finance |accessdate=2007-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417204221/http://biz.yahoo.com/brn/070914/22589.html?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |archivedate=2008-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars that are silver retain their value better than any other colour, reselling for around 10% more than white cars; this superior resale value has caused many UK police agencies to replace their standard white patrol cars with silver models.&lt;ref name="peterson"/&gt;

A common belief is that red cars cost more to [[car insurance|insure]]; in fact, insurers do not take colour into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/18/do-drivers-of-red-cars-really-pay-more-for-auto-insurance.html | author = Sarah Whitten | publisher = [[CNBC]] | accessdate = 2017-04-18 | title = Do drivers of red cars really pay more for auto insurance? | date = 2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/are-red-cars-more-expensive-to-insure/article551722/ | author = Roma Luciw | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate = 2017-04-18 | title = Are red cars more expensive to insure? | date = 2011-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical trends ==
[[File:DOWNTOWN PARKING LOT - NARA - 553303.jpg|thumb|More colour variety in 1973, America]]
Colour choice is subject to fluctuation and fashion, and historical trends shifted from dark neutral colours of early cars, through more vivid colours of 1950s and 1960s, back towards today's greyscale colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of Automobiles and Colour before the Age of Chromophobia |url=https://autouniversum.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/a-history-of-automobiles-and-color-before-the-age-of-chromophobia/ |website=www.autouniversum.wordpress.com |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Are Our Cars Painted Such Boring Colors? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/design/2011/10/car_paint_colors_why_are_so_many_cars_painted_white_silver_and_b.html |website=www.slate.com |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
A 2013 survey in the United States found that men were 12% more likely to prefer a red car, while women were 9% more likely to prefer silver.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/11/26/men-see-red-women-take-a-shine-to-silver-when-car-shopping-survey-says?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |title=Men See Red, Women Take A Shine To Silver When Car Shopping, Survey Says |author=Jim Gorzelany |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research suggested this may indicate that women are more likely to prefer practical cars, while men may be more likely to prefer fast and fun cars.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

[[File:E. D. Babbitt.png|thumb|Edwin Dwight Babbitt an early proponent of Chromotherapy]]
'''Chromotherapy''', sometimes called '''color therapy''', '''colorology''' or '''cromatherapy''', is an [[alternative medicine]] method, which is considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromotherapists claim to be able to use [[light]] in the form of [[color]] to balance "energy" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels.

Color therapy is distinct from other types of [[light therapy]], such as [[Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice treatment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1108807 |pmc=1545706 |year=1975 |author1=Dobbs |first1=R.

The potential risk of retinal damage linked to chromotherapy has been discussed by French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point. Although Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/shouldnt-afraid-leds/|title=Why you shouldn't be afraid of LEDs - European Scientist|author=|date=1 February 2018|website=europeanscientist.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  Some evidence that white LEDs are toxic for Human at domestic radiance?, Radioprotection, september 2017 , https://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/abs/2017/04/radiopro170025/radiopro170025.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.&lt;ref&gt;S.Point, the danger of chromotherapy, Skeptical Inquirer, Vol.41, N°4, July/August 2017 skepdigest.awardspace.us/The_Danger_of_Chromotherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrp.asso.fr/medias/sfrp/documents/Divers/Fiche%20lampes%20%C3%A0%20Led%20SFRP%20-%20Anglais%20_%2006-2018%20(2).pdf S. Point and A. Barlier-Salsi, LED lighting and retinal damage.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and in [[Therapy|treatment]], discussed chromotherapy in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. He wrote that "color is an observable symptom of disease" and also developed a chart that related color to the [[temperature]] and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ecam/neh137 |pmid=16322805 |pmc=1297510 |year=2005 |author1=Azeemi |first1=S. T. |title=A Critical Analysis of Chromotherapy and Its Scientific Evolution |journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=481–488 |last2=Raza |first2=S. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Civil War General [[Augustus Pleasonton]] (1801–1894) conducted his own experiments and in 1876 published his book ''The Influence Of The Blue Ray Of The Sunlight And Of The Blue Color Of The Sky'' about how the color [[blue]] can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to modern chromotherapy, influencing scientist Dr. Seth Pancoast (1823–1889) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt (1828–1905) to conduct experiments and to publish, respectively, ''Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine'' (1877) and ''The Principles of Light and Color''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Paul. (2001). ''Banvard's Folly: Tales of Renowned Obscurity, Famous Anonymity, and Rotten Luck''. Picador. p. 229. {{ISBN|0-330-48689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Indian-born American-citizen scientist [[Dinshah P. Ghadiali]] (1873–1966), published ''The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia'', a work on color therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, Joe. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/spectro.html "Colorful Nonsense: Dinshah Ghadiali and His Spectro-Chrome Device"]. Quackwatch.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. Ghadiali also thought that by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its functioning or condition. Dinshah P. Ghadiali's son Darius Dinshah continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book ''Let There Be Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dinshah | first=Darius | title=Let There be Light | isbn=978-0933917309 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5wBLPwAACAAJ | year=2012 | publisher=Dinshah Health Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] had described Ghadiali as "perhaps the greatest quack of them all". In 1925, Ghadiali was accused of rape and arrested in Seattle and sentenced under the [[Mann Act]] for five years at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]]. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are "indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 211-212. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century "color healers" claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases including [[constipation]] and [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Gruson | first = L | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/science/color-has-a-powerful-effect-on-behavior-researchers-assert.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Color has a powerful effect on behavior, researchers assert | date = 1982-10-19 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colored chakras==
[[File:Chakra silhouette.png|thumb|100px|A New Age conceptualisation of the chakras of Indian body culture and their positions in the human body]]

Practitioners of [[ayurvedic medicine]] believe the body has seven "[[chakra]]s", which some claim are 'spiritual centers', and which are held to be located along the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. [[New Age]] thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct  such imbalances.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = D | year = 2001 | title = Color Decoder | isbn = 978-0-7641-1887-6 | publisher = Barron's }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purported colors and their associations are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm | title = Color Psychology: How Colors Impact Moods, Feelings, and Behaviors | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[About.com]] | last = van Wagner | first = K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific reception ==

Chromotherapy is regarded by health experts as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. (1993). ''Mystical Diets: Paranormal, Spiritual, and Occult Nutrition Practices''. Prometheus Books. pp. 256-257. {{ISBN|0-87975-761-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Jonathan. (2003). ''Quack Magic: The Dubious History of Health Fads and Cures''. Ebury Press. p. 216. {{ISBN|978-0091888091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book published by the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses".&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ades | first = Terri | year = 2009 | title = Complete Guide to Complementary &amp; Alternative Cancer Therapies | isbn = 9781604430530 | publisher = American Cancer Society | pages = 210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photobiology]], the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian [[mysticism]] and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt; [[Light therapy]] is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.

==Plot==
The film follows a young Serbian boy named Nenad, who was living in a ghetto that was the product of a previous war. Rather than having a linear plot line, the film focuses on the different unfortunate events in Nenad's life, sometimes revisiting past events. Specifically, the events are:
* Nenad is driven to school each day in an armoured car. This is due to the discrimination against him by everyone not living in his enclave. There is only one teacher at his school and he is also the only student. However, his teacher later leaves the war-torn place, and his school trips end.
* Nenad witnesses his grandfather die.
* Nenad gets mixed up with some bad friends. After swimming with them, his clothes fall into the river and are lost. As a result he is whipped by his father.
* A man attempts to steal Nenad's father's cattle and Nenad's father attempts to shoot him. The police arrive and arrest Nenad's father and confiscate all of his illegally owned weapons, which were kept in a box under his bed. The police offer Nenad's father a chance at employment at the police station, but he turns it down.
* Nenad's hostile friends trap him under a giant bell for refusing to play a game, and the leading boy (Baskim) pulls out a pistol and shoots the bell. This causes the bullet to ricochet and hit Baskim.
* Baskim's family questions him about who shot him. Baskim responds, "A Serb." Baskim's family and their gang set the Serbian enclave on fire, trapping Nenad under the bell tower. The heat and smoke nearly suffocates Nenad. Baskim feels guilt for trapping Nenad and revisits the bell where Nenad is trapped.
* Nenad's family decides they want a new life and end up moving to [[Belgrade]] after they free Nenad from under the bell. Nenad is not used to a school with many people and as a result he does not perform well socially.

==Cast==
* [[Filip Subarić]] as Nenad
* [[Denis Murić]] as Baskim
* [[Nebojša Glogovac]] as Vojislav Arsic

'''The [[flag]] and the [[coat of arms]] of Terengganu''' are [[federated state|state]] [[symbol]]s of [[Terengganu]], a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Like the majority of state symbols for states with Malay royalties, the flag and the arms of Terengganu centre on [[Sultan of Terengganu|its royalty]], as well as [[Islam]], the state's traditional religion.

== Flag ==

=== Design ===
[[File:Flag of Terengganu.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[File:FIAV 110000.svg|23px|State flag.]] The flag of Terengganu. Flag ratio: 1:2.]]

First revealed in 1953,&lt;ref name="star idris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/13/nation/15701374 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521135850/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/13/nation/15701374 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2011 |title=Idris: Terengganu needs vibrant flag |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; the present flag of Terengganu encompasses a black flag with a thick, white [[Flag terminology#Basic patterns in flags|border]] and a white [[star and crescent]] in the centre that points towards the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]].&lt;ref name="fotw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/my-teren.html |title=Trengganu (Malaysia)|accessdate=24 September 2008 |author=Various authors |date=7 June 2008 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the crescent is five-sixths the width of the black panel, while the width of the star, which is tilting clockwise, is two-thirds that of the crescent.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

The white signifies the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], while the black signifies the state's citizens; with the white border surrounding the black panel, the layout represents the Sultan's duty to protect his subjects.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |title=Bendera Negeri |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708115532/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |archivedate=8 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The star and crescent denote [[Islam]] as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"/&gt;

In October 2006, then-[[List of Menteris Besar of Terengganu|''Menteri Besar'' of Terengganu]] [[Idris Jusoh]] voiced intentions by the state government to "[brighten] up" the flag and incorporate an emblem by first seeking opinions from professions, citing feedback of the flag being too "simple and dull".&lt;ref name="star idris"/&gt; As of 2008, there have been no reports of further action.

=== Variants ===

==== District flags ====
Terengganu has eight [[Daerah|administrative districts]] (''[[daerah]]''), each assigned their own district-level flags.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=872 |title=Bendera Daerah |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All eight of the flags consist of only a single coloured [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|field]] with the state flag on the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]]; the only distinction is the colour of the field, which corresponds to respectable districts and represents their qualities:&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fotw district"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/my-ter-m.html |title=Municipal flags in Terengganu (Malaysia) |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author=Various authors |date=19 July 2008 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultan's Royal Standard is known as ''Tanah Putih'' and consists of a white flag bearing a partial rendition of [[#Coat of arms|the state emblem]], as well as a wreath of [[rice]] stalks and a [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |title=The Body Flag Of His Royal Highness The Sultan Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234551/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a plain white flag,&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; the additional emblem, which is coloured yellow, was added to identify the flag to Terengganu's royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101010/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the ''Pemaisuri''{{'}}s (Queen's) Royal Standard (which is given the name ''Tanah Kuning Tua'') is very similar to that of the Sultan's, but features a reversed arrangement of colours, with a white emblem against a yellow field.&lt;ref name="queen standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |title=The Body Flag Of Her Royal Highness The Queen Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234705/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143709/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Standard of the ''Yang Di-pertuan Muda'' (Crown Prince) bears a similar colour configuration as the Queen's, but features only the partial rendition of the state emblem, which is significantly larger than that of the Sultan's and the Queen's.

==== Obsolete flags ====
Prior to the adoption of the present flag, the state flag of Terengganu previously sported a significantly different design, although many of its elements would be carried over to its successor. The earliest known variant of the state flag was used between 1925 and 1933, and consisted of only a white-black flag divided vertically with the black stripe two times wider than the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1912 - 1933).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1933.]]

In 1933, a star and crescent that pointed upwards and featured rounder crescent was added on the black band, signifying Terengganu's recognition of Islam as the state's religion.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag remained in use until the introduction of the current flag.

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1933 - 1947).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1953.]]

Additionally, the state government of Terengganu formerly flew its own "Governmental Service Flag", which design originated in the same manner as the state flag. Bearing the same vertical white-black layout, a white [[saltire]] was also included on the black stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; Similarly, a star and crescent was also added in a later date, but was placed on the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag was rendered obsolete following the adoption of the present state flag, which was also to be used by the state government.

==State Emblem==

=== Design ===
[[File:Coat of arms of Terengganu.svg|thumb|The state emblem of Terengganu.]]

Approved for official use by the State Ministers Committee in 1932, the state arms or emblem (Malay: ''Jata'') of Terengganu was designed by several state officials during the reign of [[Zainal Abidin III|Sultan Zainal Abidin III]] (1881–1918), and is thought to have been drawn by Mohamad bin Abdul Rahim, the relative of Dato' Nara Wangsa (Dato' Mata-Mata).&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |title=Jata Kebesaran |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064520/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms originally consisted of a white outlined oval that encompassed a series of symbols coloured in yellow and a [[Jawi script|Jawi]] [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu|Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]] (1945–1979), the emblem was modified with the addition of a dotted figure of a [[Seal (device)|seal]] around all of the symbols except the [[star and crescent]], which resides over the seal, the addition of a pair of maces and the shortening of the motto.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

Details of the emblem's components are as follows:&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

;Star and crescent
:The [[star and crescent]] reside atop the seal, pointing upwards. As a symbol of the [[Islam|Islamic faith]], they represent Terengganu as an Islamic state.

;Seal
:The seal consists of a near-oval, shield-like dotted outline that encompasses virtually all symbols in the emblem with the exception of the star and crescent, including:
:* A [[crown (heraldry)|crown]], located near the top, which represents the sovereignty of the [[Sultan of Terengganu]];
:* a [[sword]], a long ''[[kris]]'' and a pair of [[ceremonial mace]]s (The sword and ''kris'' crisscrosses each other to the top, while the maces crisscrosses each other lower down), which symbolise the royal paraphernalia of Terengganu;&lt;ref name="royal regalia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |title=ROYAL PARAPHERNALIA |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234726/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* two books, located on opposing sides of the seal below the upper half of a mace and the lower half of the sword or ''kris'', represent two important books in Terengganu: The Book of Law—placed on the left—denoting justice and the [[Qur'an]]—placed on the right—denoting the Law; and
:* a [[scarf]] (''wali'' or ''selampai''), which wraps around the sword or ''kris'' and over the maces, signify a portion of the state's cultural regalia.&lt;ref name="royal regalia"/&gt;

;Motto
The [[motto]], "Terengganu" written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]] (ترڠڬانو), is located below the seal. When introduced in 1932, the emblem's motto originally read "''Jawatan Kerajaan Terengganu''" (Terengganu Government Post) in Jawi.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]], "''Jawatan Kerajaan''" was omitted from the motto, resulting in its present form.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

=== Royal Standard variants ===
The state emblem of Terengganu is included on the [[#Royal Standards|Royal Standards of Terengganu's royal family]], but differs slightly, as it is only duplicated partially, without the outlining oval border and seal, the "Terengganu" [[motto]] and the star and crescent. Two elements are added on the emblem in the case of the Royal Standards for the Sultan and the Queen: a [[wreath]] of [[rice]] stalks and a different motto depicted in the form of banner to be written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]].&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The motto corresponds to the individual the Standard is assigned to; as such, the motto for the Standard of the Sultan reads "''Sultan Terengganu''" while that of the Queen reads "''Pemaisuri Terengganu''".&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The emblem on the Royal Standard of the Crown Prince consists of only the partial replication of the state emblem.&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

As the Standard of the Sultan has a white field, the emblem retains its yellow colour.&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt; However, as the Standard of the Queen and the Crown Prince bare yellow fields, their emblems are white.&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

The '''Gabriel Prize''' is an award given annually by the Western European Architectural Foundation, through a three-stage national competition, to one American candidate working in the field of [[architecture]] or [[landscape architecture]]. Results are announced in March of each year.

Award winners spend three months in residence in [[France]], focusing on a particular aspect of [[French architecture]] they have chosen to research. They spend much of their [[sabbatical]] traveling, sketching and measuring, and in the course of three months, produce three large [[Architectural rendering|rendering]]s. The laureates work closely with the foundation's European representative, a [[Paris]]ian architect who serves to assist their progress.

The Prize was founded in 1991 by George Parker, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabrielprize.org/ |title=Gabriel Prize |publisher=Gabriel Prize |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4087">The '''Guggenheim International Award''' was established in 1956 as "both a recognition of outstanding achievements in the visual arts and an important manifestation of international goodwill".  A shortlist of artists and works were selected by juries to represent different countries, with one overall winner selected by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and awarded a monetary prize of US$10,000, then the largest art prize awarded in the US.  Prizes were given every two years from 1956 to 1964 (omitting 1962).  The award was discontinued after 1964 in order to divert funds to acquiring further artwork for the Foundation.

An '''intellectual property broker''' mediates between the buyer and seller of intellectual property (IP) and may manage the many steps in the process of creating a deal with regard to the purchase, sale, license, or marketing of intellectual property assets. This may include: patents, trademarks, or inventions (prototypes).

Inventors are faced with several alternatives to making their invention a commercial success.  They can build their own start up company from scratch using their own resources.  In the United States, they can seek government grants; SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) and (TTR) Technology Transfer Research to fund the early stage development of their technology.  They can contract with third parties such as: [[venture capital]] or [[angel investors]] to finance a startup or they can sell or license their products to an existing and established company.  Often inventors are interested in expanding their own intellectual property assets through licensing and acquisitions.

Because there is not a well defined market around the buying and selling of patents or other IP assets, if an inventor or patent owner wants to monetize their asset, an intellectual property broker can help by serving to connect the inventor or patent owner with one or more interested buyers.  The broker should have a network of connections in various market segments which can be used to help market the patent being sold.  Potential buyers may include industry peers, competitors, entrepreneurs looking to commercialize the technology, but also defensive patent aggregators, and patent licensing companies.

A competent broker should be able to explain to the inventor or patent owner the spectrum of values that may be assessed to a patent depending on the situation or motivation of the buyer in the market.  In addition, in bringing buyers and sellers together, an intellectual property broker may provide any or all of the following services:

* initial due diligence
* technology assessment
* market analysis
* value analysis
* competitive analysis
* lead development
* introductions
* lead management
* contract negotiations
* relationship management

==Patent Brokers Market==
The estimated number of patent brokers varies greatly. For example, a 1999 World Intellectual Property Organization [[WIPO]] paper estimated 500 "patent brokers" in the United States in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/freepublications/en/intproperty/834/wipo_pub_834_ch9.pdf "Patent Brokers, Chapter 9"] by Hisamitsu Arai, [[WIPO]], December, 1999, in "Intellectual Property Policies for the Twenty-First Century: The Japanese Experience with Wealth Creation"&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2015 listing of patent brokerage companies includes only about 57 businesses worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardsonoliver.com/brokers/ "Patent Brokers/Patent Sellers"] website listing compiled by the ROL Group, October 15, 2015. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As none of these firms have a large number of employees, the 1999 estimates are either wrong as the number of businesses operating as patent brokers does not match the 1999 patent brokers estimates, or there has been a significant decline in the market for patent brokerage. Further research is required to estimate the number of patent brokers.

The estimated size of the brokered patent market was $165 million in 2016, down from $233 million in 2015. It was estimated that of all the brokered patent packages brought to market only 21% of them sell. Average asking price per patent asset was $197K in 2016. 137 people were estimated to be employed in the brokered patent market. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardsonoliver.com/news/2017/6/1/2016-secondary-market-report-available-for-download Richardson, Oliver, Costa, "Inside the 2016 brokered patent market", IAM Magazine, Issue #81, January/February 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' ('''ICESCR''') is a multilateral [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 16 December 1966 through GA. Resolution 2200A (XXI), and came in force from 3 January 1976.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt; It commits its parties to work toward the granting of [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] (ESCR) to the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]] and individuals, including [[labour rights]] and the [[right to health]], the [[right to education]], and the [[right to an adequate standard of living]]. As of September 2018, the Covenant has 169 parties.&lt;ref name="reservations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-3&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=UN Treaty Collection: International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|last=|first=|date=3 January 1976|website=|publisher=UN|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further four countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.

The ICESCR (and its [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|Optional Protocol]]) is part of the [[International Bill of Human Rights]], along with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), including the latter's [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|first]] and [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|second]] Optional Protocols.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |title=Fact Sheet No.2 (Rev.1), The International Bill of Human Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=June 1996 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313093428/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm |archivedate = 13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Covenant is monitored by the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on economic, social and cultural rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CESCR/Pages/CESCRIndex.aspx|work=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
The ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International bill of human rights|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|work=lawteacher.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140819165643/http://www.lawteacher.net/human-rights/essays/international-bill-of-human-rights.php|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man" had been proposed at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 San Francisco Conference]] which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] was given the task of drafting it.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt; Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs2/&gt;

Drafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of [[negative right|negative]] civil and political versus [[positive right|positive]] economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Human Rights|last=Sieghart |first=Paul |year=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, "one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights."&lt;ref name=unga-r543&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 543, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously.&lt;ref name=unga-r543/&gt; Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 545, 5 February 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories]], shall promote the realization of the right of [[self-determination]], and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;'''International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''', Part I, Article 1, Paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document became the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the [[UN General Assembly]] for discussion in 1954, and adopted in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2200, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR, with a preamble and thirty-one articles, divided into five parts.&lt;ref&gt;The following section summarises the text of the Covenant.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 1''' (Article 1) recognises the right of all peoples to [[self-determination]], including the right to "freely determine their political status",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a [[negative right]] of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence,&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 2''' (Articles 2–5) establishes the principle of "progressive realisation" – see below. It also requires the rights be recognised "without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The rights can only be limited by law, in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights, and only for the purpose of "promoting the general welfare in a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Part 3''' (Articles 6–15) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to
* work, under "just and favourable conditions",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; with the right to form and join trade unions (Articles 6, 7, and 8);
* [[social security]], including [[social insurance]] (Article 9);
* family life, including paid [[parental leave]] and the protection of children (Article 10);
* [[right to an adequate standard of living|an adequate standard of living]], including adequate [[right to food|food]], clothing and [[right to housing|housing]], and the "continuous improvement of living conditions" (Article 11);
* health, specifically "the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health" (Article 12);
* [[right to education|education]], including free universal primary education, generally available secondary education and equally accessible higher education. This should be directed to "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society (Articles 13 and 14);
* participation in cultural life (Article 15).

Many of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them.

'''Part 4''' (Articles 16–25) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It also allows the monitoring body – originally the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] – now the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the [[UN General Assembly]] on appropriate measures to realise the rights (Article 21)

'''Part 5''' (Articles 26–31) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.

==Core provisions==

===Principle of progressive realisation===
'''Article 2''' of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to

&lt;blockquote&gt;take steps... to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is known as the principle of "progressive realisation". It acknowledges that some of the rights (for example, the right to health) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time, and that states may be subject to resource constraints, but requires them to act as best they can within their means.

The principle differs from that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to "respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction" the rights in that Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICCPR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |pages=Article 2.1 |publisher=UN |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to "take steps" imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, {{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(symbol)/CESCR+General+comment+3.En?OpenDocument |title=CESCR General Comment 3 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=14 December 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 10.&lt;/ref&gt; If resources are highly constrained, this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 3'', paragraphs 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour rights===
{{main|Labour rights}}
'''Article&amp;nbsp;6''' of the Covenant recognises the [[right to work]], defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties are required to take "appropriate steps" to safeguard this right, including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately [[full employment]]. The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment. They must prevent [[workplace discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]] and ensure access for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/493bee38093458c0c12571140029367c/$FILE/G0640313.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 18: The Right to Work |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=6 February 2006|pages=paragraph 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit [[Unfree labour|forced]] or [[child labor]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work referred to in Article&amp;nbsp;6 must be ''[[decent work]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 18'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This is effectively defined by '''Article&amp;nbsp;7''' of the Covenant, which recognises the right of everyone to "just and favourable" working conditions. These are in turn defined as fair wages with [[equal pay for equal work]], sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants; [[Occupational safety and health|safe working conditions]]; equal opportunity in the workplace; and sufficient rest and leisure, including limited [[working hours]] and regular, [[paid holidays]].

'''Article&amp;nbsp;8''' recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the [[right to strike]]. It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico]]), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as [[firefighter]]s (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Constitution of Japan|Japan]]).&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

===Right to social security===
{{main|Social security}}
'''Article 9''' of the Covenant recognizes "the right of everyone to [[social security]], including [[social insurance]]".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; and to ensure that families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|title=CESCR Draft General Comment 19: The right to social security|accessdate=13 July 2008|publisher=UN Economic and Social Council|date=4 February 2008|at=paragraphs 1 – 4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520002906/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CESCR,,,47b17b5b39c,0.html|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and non-contributory schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right, with very low levels of access.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several parties, including France and Monaco, have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions, provided they are proportionate and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR Draft General Comment 19'', paragraph 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to family life===
{{main|Children's rights|Fathers' rights|Mothers' rights|Reproductive rights}}
'''Article 10''' of the Covenant recognises the family as "the natural and fundamental group unit of society", and requires parties to accord it "the widest possible protection and assistance".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not [[forced marriage|forced]].&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |title=Fact Sheet No.16 (Rev.1), The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=July 1991 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501050654/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs16.htm#6 |archivedate = 1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties must also provide [[parental leave|paid leave]] or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth, an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9. Finally, parties must take "special measures" to protect children from economic or social exploitation, including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations.&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to an adequate standard of living===
{{main|Right to food|Right to water|Right to housing|Right to clothing}}
'''Article 11''' recognises the [[right to an adequate standard of living|right of everyone to an adequate standard of living]]. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and "the continuous improvement of living conditions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 11.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate [[world hunger]].

The '''right to adequate food''', also referred to as the [[right to food]], is interpreted as requiring "the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3d02758c707031d58025677f003b73b9?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 12: The right to adequate food |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 May 1999|pages=paragraph 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 12'', paragraph 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world [[food supply|food supplies]] in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;''''ICESCR, Article 11, 2 (b)&lt;/ref&gt; The right to adequate food also implies a [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=4538838d11&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;advsearch=y&amp;amp;process=y&amp;amp;allwords=comment%2015&amp;amp;exactphrase=&amp;amp;atleastone=&amp;amp;without=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;monthfrom=01&amp;amp;yearfrom=2003&amp;amp;monthto=01&amp;amp;yearto=2003&amp;amp;coa=&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;citation=|title=CESCR General Comment 15: The right to water |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=20 January 2003|pages=paragraph 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate housing''', also referred to as the [[right to housing]], is "the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/469f4d91a9378221c12563ed0053547e?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 4: The right to adequate housing |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=13 December 1991|at= paragraph 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires "adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost".&lt;ref name=ohchr-gc4-p7/&gt; Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as "the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/959f71e476284596802564c3005d8d50?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 7: The right to adequate housing: forced evictions |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=20 May 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate clothing''', also referred to as the [[right to clothing]], has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion. What is considered "adequate" has only been discussed in specific contexts, such as refugees, the disabled, the elderly, or workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Stephen James, [http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf ''"A Forgotten Right?

===Right to health===
{{main|Right to health}}
'''Article 12''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 12.1&lt;/ref&gt; "Health" is understood not just as a right to be healthy, but as a right to control one's own health and body (including reproduction), and be free from interference such as [[torture]] or medical experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/40d009901358b0e2c1256915005090be?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=11 August 2000|pages=paragraph 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, sanitation, food, nutrition and housing, and through a comprehensive system of healthcare, which is available to everyone without discrimination, and economically accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraphs 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 12.2''' requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens, including reducing infant mortality and improving child health, improving environmental and workplace health, preventing, controlling and treating epidemic diseases, and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all. These are considered to be "illustrative, non-exhaustive examples", rather than a complete statement of parties' obligations.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women's' [[reproductive rights]], by not limiting access to [[contraception]] or "censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting" information about sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 14'', paragraph 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ Human Rights and the Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306185240/http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-project/humanrightscasesandmaterials/humanrightsconceptsideasandfora/humanrightsinrlationtoothertopics/humanrightsandtheenvironment/ |date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to free education===
{{main|Right to education}}
'''Article 13''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to [[free education]] (free for the [[primary education|primary]] level and "the progressive introduction of free education" for the [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher levels]]). This is to be directed towards "the full development of the human personality and the sense of its [[dignity]]",&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1/&gt; and enable all persons to participate effectively in society. Education is seen both as a human right and as "an indispensable means of realizing other human rights", and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/ae1a0b126d068e868025683c003c8b3b?Opendocument |title=CESCR General Comment 13: The right to education |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=8 December 1999|pages=paragraph 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 13.2''' lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of [[Right to education|free, universal and compulsory]] primary education, "generally available and accessible" secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop a school system (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; "[p]rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all"; secondary education "shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of [[free education]]"; and "[h]igher education shall be made [[universal access to education|equally accessible to all]], on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education".

'''Articles 13.3 and 13.4''' require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children, also referred to as [[freedom of education]]. It also recognises the right of parents to "ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.3&lt;/ref&gt; This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non-discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the [[academic freedom]] of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers [[corporal punishment]] in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 13'', paragraph 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 14''' of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free [[compulsory education|compulsory]] primary education, to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction "within a reasonable number of years".&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to participation in cultural life===
{{main|Right to science and culture}}
{{main|Right to development}}
{{main|Right to public participation}}
'''Article 15''' of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life, enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created. The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property, but the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of authors and "proclaim[ing] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/03902145edbbe797c125711500584ea8/$FILE/G0640060.pdf |format=PDF|title=CESCR General Comment 17: The right of everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN Economic and Social Council |date=12 January 2006|at= paragraph 12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work. The material rights are interpreted as being part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and "need not extend over the entire lifespan of an author."&lt;ref&gt;''CESCR General Comment 17'', paragraph 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties must also work to promote the conservation, development and diffusion of science and culture, "respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity",&lt;ref&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage international contacts and cooperation in these fields.

==Reservations==
A number of parties have made [[reservation (law)|reservations]] and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant.

'''Algeria''' interprets parts of Article 13, protecting the liberty of parents to freely choose or establish suitable educational institutions, so as not to "impair its right freely to organize its educational system."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Bangladesh''' interprets the self-determination clause in Article 1 as applying in the historical context of [[colonialism]]. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within the context of its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Belgium''' interprets non-discrimination as to national origin as "not necessarily implying an obligation on States automatically to guarantee to foreigners the same rights as to their nationals. The term should be understood to refer to the elimination of any arbitrary behaviour but not of differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations, in conformity with the principles prevailing in democratic societies."&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''China''' restricts labour rights in Article 8 in a manner consistent with its constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Egypt''' accepts the Covenant only to the extent it does not conflict with Islamic [[Sharia]] law. Sharia is "a primary source of legislation" under Article 2 of both the suspended [[s:Constitution of Egypt|1973 Constitution]] and the [[s:2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt|2011 Provisional Constitutional Declaration]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''France''' views the Covenant as subservient to the [[UN Charter]]. It also reserves the right to govern the access of aliens to employment, social security, and other benefits.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''India''' interprets the right of self-determination as applying "only to the peoples under foreign domination"&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and not to apply to peoples within sovereign nation-states. It also interprets the limitation of rights clause and the rights of equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Indonesia''' interprets the self-determination clause (Article 1) within the context of other international law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation-state.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Ireland''' reserves the right to promote the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Japan''' reserved the right not to be bound to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education, the right to strike for [[civil service|public servant]] and the remuneration on public holidays.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Kuwait''' interprets the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its constitution and laws, and reserves the right to social security to apply only to Kuwaitis. It also reserves the right to forbid strikes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Mexico''' restricts the labour rights in Article 8 within the context of its constitution and laws.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Monaco''' interprets the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of national origin as "not necessarily implying an automatic obligation on the part of States to guarantee foreigners the same rights as their nationals",&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt; and reserves the right to set residence requirements on the rights to work, health, education, and social security.

'''New Zealand''' reserved the right not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were incompatible with it.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Norway''' reserves the right to strike so as to allow for compulsory arbitration of some labour disputes.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Pakistan''' has a general reservation to interpret the Covenant within the framework of its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Thailand''' interprets the right to self-determination within the framework of other international law.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''Trinidad and Tobago''' reserves the right to restrict the right to strike of those engaged in essential occupations.

'''Turkey''' will implement the Covenant subject to the UN Charter. It also reserves the right to interpret and implement the right of parents to choose and establish educational institutions in a manner compatible with its constitution.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United Kingdom''' views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter. It made several reservations regarding its overseas territories.&lt;ref name=reservations/&gt;

'''United States''' – [[Amnesty International]] writes that "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The '''[[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]''' is a side-agreement to the Covenant which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing a historic gap in human rights |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D39BD9ED5406650FC125751C0039FE08?opendocument |publisher=United Nations |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights==
{{main|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

The '''Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights''' is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/ECOSOC/resolutions/E-RES-1985-17.doc |title=ECOSOC Resolution 1985/17 |accessdate=2 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=28 May 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other human rights monitoring bodies, the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees. Rather, it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies.&lt;ref name=ohchr-fs16/&gt;

All states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant. The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant; thereafter reports are due every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/index.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations".

The Committee typically meets every May and November in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |title=Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – Sessions |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=UN OHCHR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611184428/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/sessions.htm |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Kent was born 30 April 1925 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Gladys and Richard Kent of Tuxedo Park, New York.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Negri |first=Gloria |date=16 March 2009 |title=Joan Kent Dillon, at 83; Was Theater Preservation Activist |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/03/16/joan_kent_dillon_at_83_was_theater_preservation_activist/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |location=Boston, Mass. |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituaries: Joan Kent Dillon, 83 |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090129/OBITS02/901290337 |newspaper=Cape Cod Times |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. She attended [[Wheeler School]] in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Mary Institute]] in St. Louis in 1943.  Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Smith College]] in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening &amp; Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="GeorgeObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: George C. Dillon |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/wickedlocal-orleans/obituary.aspx?pid=163242974 |newspaper=Cape Codder |location=Orleans, Mass. |publisher=Gatehouse Media, Inc. |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dillons had two daughters and a son. Joan Dillon went on to complete a Masters Degree in Medieval History at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit" /&gt; From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now [[The Pembroke Hill School]]).

===The Folly Theater===
[[File:Folly Theater burlesk.jpg|thumb|280p|right|The [[Folly Theater]] in 1973 as a burlesque house, 300 W. 12th St., Kansas City, Missouri, as documented by the [[Heritage Documentation Programs|Historic American Buildings Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/pictures/item/mo0438/ |title=Standard Theatre, 300 West Twelfth Street, Kansas City, Jackson County, MO |date= |series=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Folly Theater]] is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit.  Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028192142/http://www.follytheater.com/history_restoration.html |archive-date= 28 October 2002 |url=http://www.follytheater.org/history_restoration.html |deadurl=yes |title=Folly Theater History: Restoration / Renovation (1974-November 1981) |author= |website=Folly Theater |accessdate=22 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater again closed in January 1974.  The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt;

Folly Theater was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri: Downtown Kansas City|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.

But preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1439 |title=Folly Theater |last1=Francis |first1=Donna |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A national role===
Her work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the [[The Broadway League|League of Historic American Theaters]] from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] from 1980-1990, President Reagan's [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities|Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995.&lt;ref name="StarObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: Joan Dillon |newspaper=Kansas City Star |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C.

===''American Theaters''===
For a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters.  Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian [[David Arthur Naylor (architectural historian)|David Naylor]]. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, ''American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy'' (1981) and ''Great American Movie Theaters'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sah.org/about-sah/sah-news/2013/03/01/obituary-david-naylor |title=Obituary: David Naylor |last1=Maddex |first1=Diane |date=1 March 2013 |website=Society of Architectural Historians |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1344 |title=Joan Dillon papers, |last1=Curtis |first1=Peter |last2=Archer |first2=Joanne |date=October 2003 |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Naylor |first2=David |date=1997 |title=American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-14393-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)#American Theaters 2|next section]] for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, ''American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1997.

===Later life===
Throughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the [[Cape Cod Museum of Art]] from 2007-2009.&lt;ref name="StarObit" /&gt; In 2007 she published ''Barns of Cape Cod'' with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin.&lt;ref name="barns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Dillon |first2=Kent C. |last3=Belushin |first3=Blandon |date=2007 |title=Barns of Cape Cod |location=Atglen, Penn. |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=9780764325649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently&lt;ref name="CCTObit" /&gt; and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009.

==American Theaters==
After a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, "A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters." From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following.

The '''Lottery League 2008''' was a musical event that took place from February 2 through April 12 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

The organizers of the event, a group of Cleveland [[musician]]s known as "the Council of Chiefs," held a [[lottery]] wherein roughly 150 musicians were placed in 33 semi-randomly generated bands.  One of the few guidelines was that none of the people in the bands were to have played with, worked with, or had "intimate relationships" with one another.

The Lottery League 2008 began with a Draft Night.  Shortly thereafter, the participants had 10 weeks to create and rehearse music to be performed at Cleveland [[music venue]], [[The Beachland Ballroom|The Beachland Ballroom and Tavern]].  The showcase was given the name of The Big Show, and would feature all participating bands on three stages within the span of six hours.  This show took place on April 12, 2008, to a crowd of several hundred people.

As part of the Lottery League 2008, each band was to submit [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s for their work.  Additionally, video and photo footage of band [[rehearsal]]s, [[interview]]s, and [[footage]] from the Big Show was also taken.  All of these will be gathered into a special CD/DVD release, slated for Fall 2008.

While many Lottery League groups made no plans to continue performing beyond the night of the Big Show, others have chosen to forge ahead, writing songs, booking shows, and recording more new music.

'''''Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo''''' ({{lang-es|Mariano Moreno at his work desk}}) is a portrait by the [[Chile]]an artist [[Pedro Subercaseaux]]. It shows the [[artist's interpretation]] of [[Mariano Moreno]], Secretary of War of the [[United Provinces of the River Plate|Argentine]] [[Primera Junta]], the first national government, working at his desk. It is currently regarded as the canonical image of Moreno.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"&gt;{{cite book |title= Historias de corceles y de acero|last= Balmaceda|first= Daniel|authorlink= Daniel Balmaceda|year= 2010|publisher= Sudamericana|location= Buenos Aires|isbn= 978-950-07-3180-5|pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
[[File:Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (borrador).JPG|thumb|left|Draft version of the portrait.]]

The portrait was requested to Subercaseaux by [[Antonio Carranza]] in 1908, in the context of the proximity of the [[Argentina Centennial]] two years later. His instructions were that the portrait should represent Mariano Moreno while working hard, late in the night, writing with a [[quill]], with many papers scattered around, and worried by the gravity of the measures being taken.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"/&gt; 

Subercaseaux was not very satisfied with his work, thinking that his version of Moreno was not as thin as Moreno was reported to be.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"/&gt;

The portrait is currently kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]].

'''Nakskov Church''' ({{lang-da|Sankt Nikolai Kirke}}) is the largest church in [[Nakskov]] on the west coast of the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. As Nakskov was mentioned in [[Danish Census Book|Valdemar's Census Book]] in the 13th century, the church probably dates to the same period.

==History==
Remains of a wooden church from c. 1000 were unearthed in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanktnikolaikirke.dk/index.php/historie/historie-om-kirken "Om kirken"], Sankt Nikolai Kirke Nakskov. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was replaced by a brick church dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]] which is first mentioned in 1398 although its oldest sections probably date from the early 13th century. It was completed in the second half of the 17th century. Major repairs were carried out in 1746 but further work proved necessary in 1825. Before the [[Danish Reformation]], the church had a series of chapels and altars, each connected with the craftsmen's guilds in the town. Much of the documentation was destroyed when the Lübeckers plundered Nakskov in 1510.&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0089-0126.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Nakskov Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 89-126. {{da icon}} Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Built of light red brick, the original [[chancel]] and [[nave]] were in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Parts of these remain in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] additions from the first half of the 15th century. Major extensions were added to both east and west, resulting in aisles on either side of the nave which virtually encapsulated the older construction. A large tower was also built at the west end of the former nave at the beginning of the 15th century. In the mid-17th century, after a period of some 200 years without further construction work, Gothic additions were completed. The Romanesque chancel was demolished while rectangular arches were added in the former walls. The spire which was repeatedly damaged by lightning was finally redesigned by [[H.C. Glahn]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

==Interior==

The carved [[altarpiece]] in the [[auricular style]] from 1656 is the work of [[Anders Mortensen]] from [[Odense]]. The central painting of the [[Last Supper]] (which contains an image of Nakskov Church in the background) is topped by depictions of the [[Crucifixion]] and Christ's removal from the cross. There are also figures of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]] and the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|Christ Resurrected]] and also of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanktnikolaikirke.dk/index.php/inventar/altertavle "Altertavle"], Sankt Nikolai Kirke Nakskov. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt; The [[pulpit]], also in the Baroque auricular style, was completed by [[Jørgen Ringnis]] in 1630.

'''Native Earth Performing Arts''' is a Canadian [[theatre]] company located in [[Toronto]]. Canada’s oldest professional Indigenous theatre company, Native Earth is dedicated to developing, producing and presenting professional artistic expressions of the Indigenous experience in Canada.

Through stage productions (theatre, dance and multi-disciplinary art), new script development, apprenticeships and internships, Native Earth seeks to fulfill a community of artistic visions. It is a vision that is inclusive and reflective of the artistic directions of members of the Indigenous community who actively participate in the arts.

Native Earth Performing Arts helms Aki Studio, a 120-seat black box creation/rehearsal/performance space in Regent Park's Daniels Spectrum.

==Background==
Founded in 1982, it is the oldest professional Indigenous performing arts company in Canada. They have been central in the development of a community of Indigenous artists, and have contributed to the creation of several plays which have become canonical in Canadian drama, such as [[Tomson Highway]]'s award-winning ''[[The Rez Sisters]]'' and ''[[Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing]]'', [[Daniel David Moses]]'s ''Almighty Voice and His Wife'', [[Drew Hayden Taylor]]'s ''Someday'', and Cliff Cardinal's ''Huff''.  Native Earth hosts the annual Weesageechak Begins to Dance festival which is a showcase for emerging Indigenous theatre, dance, and multi-discipline artists.&lt;ref name = "canencyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Native Earth was able to secure government funding, which brought stability to the organization. This funding allowed Native Earth the possibility to program a season and open its own office with full-time staff.

In the same year Native Earth presented its first scripted work, [[Tomson Highway]]'s [[The Rez Sisters]] which became a hit and attracted large audiences across Canada. The Play was so successful that it was also invited to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and received the [[Dora Mavor Moore Award]] and the [[Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award]].

In 1989 Native Earth created Weesageechak Begins to Dance an annual play festival which developed plays that often turned into full production the following year. One of the plays which was developed through this process was John McLeod's Diary of a Crazy Boy.

In 2012, the organization was described as "a formidable artistic hub for all things related to contemporary Indigenous performing arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2012, Native Earth moved their administrative headquarters to the Daniels Spectrum, an arts and cultural centre located in Toronto's revitalized Regent Park (part of the [[Regent Park Revitalization Plan]]). They also launched Aki Studio – a 120-seat creation and performance black box space located on the main floor of the Daniels Spectrum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">A national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation; not necessarily a nation state, but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or autonomy. National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols.

==Supranational Epics==
*[[The Americas]] - ''[[The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]
*[[Indic Civilization]] – the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''
*[[Mesoamerican Civilization]] – the ''[[Popol Vuh]]''
*[[Sinic world]] – the [[Four Great Classical Novels]]: ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]],'' ''[[Water Margin]],'' ''[[Journey to the West]],'' and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]
*[[Western Civilization]] – the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' of Homer and the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of Vergil

==Language Epics==
{{see|National epic}}
For languages spread across various nations, earlier [[national epic]]s of the older nation work as language epics. For example, national epics of England, such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]],'' or the works of ''[[Shakespeare]]'' are used as language epics across the English-speaking world, and the ''[[Shahnameh]],'' the national epic of Iran (Persia) is used as a language epic by other [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking communities, in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. See [[national epic]]s for more examples.

Religious texts such as ''[[The King James Bible]]'' (English), ''[[Luther Bible]]'' (German), ''[[Quran]]'' (Arabic), and ''[[Tanakh]]'' (Hebrew) have similar impact within a specific language, while the Bible itself (in all translations) is instead a supranational epic of Western civilization.

'''Performing arts center/centre''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]), often abbreviated as PAC, is used to refer to: 

* A multi-use performance space that is intended for use by various types of the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]]. 

:The intended multiple use of performing arts centers in this sense differentiates them from single-purpose [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], [[opera house]]s or [[theater (structure)|theatres]], although the actual use of single-purpose spaces for other than their intended use is widespread. This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman [[Colosseum]] and Greek amphitheatres.

* A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as [[orchestra|symphonic music]] or [[chamber music]] or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole. The modern version of this came into being only in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Steven A.|title=The evolution of the performing arts center|url=http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|publisher=AMS Planning &amp; Research Corp|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=October 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114201139/http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:Examples of this type of PAC are the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Sydney Opera House]], and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York City.

Some performing arts center organizations act as sole presenter for events using the venues within the center, but most also frequently rent their performance spaces to other [[performing arts presenters]] or self-presenting performing arts groups. Examples of this practice is the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] renting venues in Boston's [[Boch Center]].

New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses. PACs became a draw for touring shows and eventually included visual art in their facilities. Today, these centers are valuable civic resources that provide education, access, exchange of creative discourse, opportunities for cultural expression and awareness.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

'''''Rumpelstiltskin''''' is a fairytale popularly associated with Germany (where he is known as '''''Rumpelstilzchen'''''). The tale was one collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in the 1812 edition of ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]''. According to researchers at [[Durham University]] and the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]], the story originated around 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Sara Graça da Silva, Jamshid J.

==Plot==


In order to appear superior, a [[miller]] lies to the king, telling him that his daughter can [[Spinning (textiles)|spin]] straw into [[gold]] (some versions make the miller's daughter [[blond]]e and describe the "straw-into-gold" claim as a careless boast the miller makes about the way his daughter's straw-like blond hair takes on a gold-like lustre when sunshine strikes it). The king calls for the girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a [[spinning wheel]], and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will [[Decapitation|cut off her head]] (other versions have the king threatening to lock her up in a dungeon forever). When she has given up all hope, an [[imp]]-like creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace (since he only comes to people seeking a deal/trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which to pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her firstborn child and so he spins the straw into gold a final time (In some versions, the imp appears and begins to turn the straw into gold, paying no heed to the girl's protests that she has nothing to pay him with; when he finishes the task, he states that the price is her first child, and the horrified girl objects because she never agreed to this arrangement).

The king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: "Now give me what you promised." She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. 

He finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days (some versions have the imp limiting the number of daily guesses to three and hence the total number of guesses allowed to a maximum of nine). 

Her many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into the woods (in some versions, she sends a servant into the woods instead of going herself in order to keep the king's suspicions at bay), searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics, "tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name'", he reveals his name.

When the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then "ran away angrily, and never came back". The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin "in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two". Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.

==Name origins==
[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration by Walter Crane from ''Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm'' (1886)]]

The name ''Rumpelstilzchen'' in [[German language|German]] means literally "little rattle stilt", a ''stilt'' being a post or pole that provides support for a structure. A ''rumpelstilt'' or ''rumpelstilz'' was consequently the name of a type of goblin, also called a ''pophart'' or ''poppart'', that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to ''rumpelgeist'' ("rattle ghost") or ''[[poltergeist]]'', a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are ''mummarts'' or ''[[boggart]]s'' and ''[[Hob (folklore)|hobs]]'', which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.)  The ending ''-chen'' is a German diminutive cognate to English ''-kin''.

The earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in [[Johann Fischart]]'s ''Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua'' of 1577 (a loose adaptation of [[François Rabelais|Rabelais']] ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'') which refers to an "amusement" for children, i.e. a children's game named "Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart".&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary article on [[wikt:Rumpelstilzchen|''Rumpelstilzchen'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names used in translations==
[[File:The heart of oak books (1906) (14750176241).jpg|thumb|Illustration for the tale of "Rumpel-stilt-skin" from ''The heart of oak books'' (Boston 1910)]]

Translations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is ''[[wikt:Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstilzchen]]''. For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: ''Rumpelstiltskin'' or ''Rumplestiltskin'' in English, ''Repelsteeltje'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Rumpelstichen'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Rumpelstinski'' or ''Rumpelestíjeles'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Rumplcimprcampr'' or ''Rampelník'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] it is called  ルンペルシュティルツキン (''Runperushutirutsukin''). [[Russian language|Russian]] might have the most accomplished imitation of the German name with Румпельшти́льцхен (''Rumpelʹštílʹcxen'').

In other languages the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way. Thus ''Rumpelstilzchen'' is known as ''Päronskaft'' (literally "Pear-stalk") in [[Swedish language|Swedish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bröderna Grimms sagovärld |last=Grimm |first=Jacob |last2=Grimm |first2=Wilhelm |publisher=Bonnier Carlsen |year=2008 |isbn=91-638-2435-3 |language=Swedish |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the sense of ''stilt'' or ''stalk'' of the second part is retained. Likewise, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Rumleskaft'' (literally "Rumble-shank"). [[Italian language|Italian]] has ''Tremotino'' (which loosely means "Little Earthquake"). [[French language|French]] has&amp;nbsp;– besides other names&amp;nbsp;– ''Tracassin'' (like ''[[wikt:tracasser|tracasser]]'' "to pester"). In other translations an entirely different and generally meaningless name was selected, such as ''Barbichu'', ''Broumpristoche'', ''Grigrigredinmenufretin'', ''Outroupistache'' or ''Perlimpinpin'' in various translations to [[French language|French]]. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translations use "Hariparibuşki Baripinpon" which does not mean anything and was chosen just because the name was complicated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Slovak language|Slovak]] translations use ''Martinko Klingáč''. [[Polish language|Polish]] translations use ''Titelitury'' (or ''Rumpelsztyk'') and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ones ''Tittelintuure'', ''Rompanruoja'' or ''Hopskukkeli''. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''Cvilidreta'' ("Whine-screamer"). For [[Hebrew]] the poet [[Avraham Shlonsky]] composed the name {{lang|he|עוץ לי גוץ לי}} (''Ootz-li Gootz-li'', a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, "My adviser my midget"), when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children's [[musical theatre|musical]], now a classic among Hebrew children's plays. [[Greek language|Greek]] translations have used Ρουμπελστίλτσκιν (from the English) or Κουτσοκαλιγέρης (''Koutsokaliyéris'') which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle κούτσο- (''koútso-'' "limping"), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name. [[Urdu]] versions of the tale used the name ''Tees Mar Khan'' for the imp.

===Television===
*In the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Rumplestiltskin [sic] (also known as [[Mr. Gold]] and Detective Weaver) is played by [[Robert Carlyle]] and is one of the central characters, and is shown as a malevolent trickster who can spin straw into gold and enjoys making deals with those he comes across. Throughout the first seasons he concentrates on searching for his son, Baelfire. An expert on black magic and the dark arts (known as the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark One]]), this man has wizardly powers to make him a fair match for anyone in the land, even the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]]. In the course of the series, he is also revealed to have taken on the role of Cinderella's fairy 'godmother', and is also essentially the [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]], falling in love with Belle after he demanded her as a price for saving her kingdom from a war. In the season three episode ''[[Think Lovely Thoughts]]'', he is revealed to be the son of a man named Malcolm, who became [[Peter Pan]]. He also acts as the crocodile, cutting off Captain Hook's hand after killing Milah, the mother of Baelfire, who left him when he was still a powerless coward. Eventually, Belle banishes him from Storybrooke when his own nature turns against him, prompting him to ally with various other villains to try and ensure their own happy endings. He is briefly purified of his darkness when it is revealed that he is dying of the dark magic in his heart, but despite Emma attempting to help him become a hero while she takes on the Dark One role, he eventually reclaims his powers, and he goes way too far from being a beast. In the sixth season, Rumplestiltskin's mother is revealed to be the Black Fairy, who had abandoned him and Malcolm after choosing power over love. In the same season, he has a son with Belle named Gideon. In season 7 he is on a quest to find the Guardian to rid him of his dark powers so he can be reunited with Belle. He gains the help of Alice. In the final episode, Rumplestiltskin sacrifices himself to defeat his evil Wish Realm counterpart and save Hook (who had a cursed heart) by giving Hook his heart, causing his Wish Realm counterpart to die too. Afterwards, Rumplestiltskin is reunited with Belle in the afterlife.

A '''secret history''' (or '''shadow history''') is a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] interpretation of either fictional or real [[history]] which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. "Secret history" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.

==Secret histories of the real world==
{{main article|Historical revisionism}}
Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]": one such example is ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. Secret histories can range from standard [[historical revisionism]] with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negative historical revisionism]] wherein facts are deliberately omitted, [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] or distorted.

The quintessential example secret history is the ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Anecdota]]'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (known for centuries as the ''Secret History''). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the [[Vatican Library]] and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ("the unpublished composition"). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html The Secret History], English translation (Dewing, 1935) at [[LacusCurtius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional secret histories==
Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] universe to preserve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the present by reconciling [[paranormal]], [[anachronistic]], or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' cast the devastating [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] during the 1990s, and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] were all part of one wider conflict.

===Secret history thrillers===
A certain type of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando ''nearly'' carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not [[alternate history]] but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.

Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:

* ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' by [[Ken Follett]]: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling [[D-Day]];
* ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing [[Charles De Gaulle]], president of France, in 1963.

These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.

Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with [[World War II]] backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:
* ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'': a German spy in [[Cairo]] nearly succeeds in letting [[Erwin Rommel]] win at [[El Alamein]].
* ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'': a [[Russian anarchist]] in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the [[First World War]].

Works of other writers fitting within this type include:
* ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages.
* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' by [[Jack Higgins]]: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] out of wartime England.
* ''[[The Romanov Succession]]'' by [[Brian Garfield]]: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, [[Russia]]n exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and restore the monarchy.
* ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]]: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into not running for a third term.
* ''[[The Ninth Man]]'' by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt.
* ''[[Stalag Texas]]'', also by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].
* ''An Exchange of Eagles'' by [[Owen Sela]]: In 1940, senior officers of the German [[Abwehr]] and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army) |American Military Intelligence]] make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] with the assumption that they would be replaced by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating.
* In the 2006 [[historical detective]] novel, ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' by [[Jason Goodwin]], a power-mad [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan [[Mehmet II]] and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of [[Ataturk]].
* In the thriller ''[[The Redbreast]]'' by [[Jo Nesbø]], a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince.

Different types of secret history thriller include:

* ''[[The Leader and the Damned]]'' by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]]: [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a [[Look-alike|double]]. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of [[Martin Bormann]] in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. 
* ''[[XPD]]'' by [[Len Deighton]]: [[Winston Churchill]] was far more of an [[appeaser]] than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle.
* The mystery series by [[Elliott Roosevelt]] in which his mother, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], is the detective – placing murder mysteries in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, ''[[Murder at the Chateau]]'', Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high-level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941.
* ''[[The Berkut]]'' by Joseph Heywood. [[Adolf Hitler]] did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with [[Eva Braun]]. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the [[Kremlin]] basement until the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, when he was secretly executed.
* Many of the "Blackford Oakes" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in ''[[Who's on First (novel)|Who's on First]]'', Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching [[Sputnik]] ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in ''[[Marco Polo, if You Can]]'', Oakes is the real-life [[U2]] pilot [[Gary Powers]], and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the [[U2 incident]] was actually planned from the start, [[Gary Powers]] was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never happened).
* The plot of [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is based on the assumption that on the eve of [[World War I]] in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], with the cooperation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] – to sell [[Canada]] to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records – to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing).
* An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the [[BBC]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Imperial Moon]]'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his companions [[Vislor Turlough]] and [[Kamelion]] learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.
* Another example of a science-fiction secret history is ''[[The Proteus Operation]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of [[World War II]]: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] and provided invaluable  information about how the Germans won in their history – which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to  Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as [[Harry Hopkins]], and to a few scientists such as [[Einstein]]. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy – and strictly kept it until their deaths – and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told.
* [[James A. Hetley]]'s [[Contemporary Fantasy]] books ''Dragon's Eye'' and ''Dragon's Teeth'' are based on the assumption that in the Fourteenth Century several boatloads of rebellious [[Welsh people|Welsh]], opposing the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages| English conquest of their homeland]], secretly crossed the Atlantic and established themselves at what would become the State of [[Maine]]. Being not very numerous and not the harbingers of further immigrants, they were able to reach a reasonable accommodation with the matrilineal leadership of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. Centuries later they blended with later European immigrants, stating truthfully that their name was Morgan and that they were of Welsh origin, while being vague on when they had come to America. In the 17th and 18th Century they were involved in piracy, later shifted to other lucrative (and highly illegal) activities. By the present time, the Welsh Morgans along with the Native American Haskells are still the two leading families of Stonefort, Maine. In their well-guarded home are preserved various artifacts of their ancestors, and manuscripts in Medieval Latin and Welsh  - which historians would have loved to see, but the Morgans prefer not to share them with outsiders.

===Fictional "secret" versions of historical events===
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' last major work, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'' asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. 
* Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] by the junior officer [[John Felton (assassin)#In fiction| John Felton]]. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French [[Cardinal Richelieu]], while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. 
* [[Elizabeth Bear]]'s "Promethean Age" series constitutes a massive secret history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monette|first=Sarah|title=An Interview with Elizabeth Bear, conducted by Sarah Monette|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=fGCbg3M4XX5PLux3JCZiJA&amp;pq=elizabeth%20bear%27s%20%22promethean%20age%22%20%22secret%20history%22%20review&amp;cp=51&amp;gs_id=iw&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=22adff2dc2288598&amp;biw=840&amp;bih=359&amp;bs=1|publisher=Subterranean Press|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Elizabethan]] England, with considerable [[fantasy]] elements. Among other things the series asserts that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] was a secret illegitimate son of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]; that Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]] were dedicated to Marlowe; that [[Edmund Spencer]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch [[Morgan le Fay]]; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* The [[The Black Adder|first series]] of ''[[Blackadder]]'', in which [[Henry VII of England]] comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of "Richard IV" from the history books.  Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.
*The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" organization that originated with the [[Knights Templar]]. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret "First Civilization", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.
* The background of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series of [[contemporary fantasy]] detective thrillers includes the assertion that [[Isaac Newton]], in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who codified the basic principles of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis'' ([[Latin]] for "Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the [[Bodleian Library]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, [[World War II]] had also been fought by magical means, with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany – where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash [[vampire]]s and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of [[Caroline of Ansbach]]; during the [[War of 1812]] British wizards trained [[Tecumseh]]'s [[medicine men]] in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; [[Maynard Keynes]], though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the [[Iraq War]] suffered a major fiasco at [[Falluja]] which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.  
* [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' suggests that Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], who died while on the [[Second Crusade]], had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.
* Gore Vidal's novel "Creation", purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entagling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persian counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted.  Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly greatly influenced India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also the character of Buddhism, a major world religion.

* The books of [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]] often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, ''The Jefferson Key'', part of Berry's [[Cotton Malone]] series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President ([[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881,[[William McKinley]] in 1901 and [[John Kennedy]] in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret "Commonwealth" of pirates (or "privateers"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] during WWI and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth "a perpetual authorization" to act as [[privateer]]s. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], secret survivals of the [[Knights Templar]] and the fate of the books of the [[Alexandrine Library]].

==Secret histories of fictional worlds==
"[[Retcon]]", alteration of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] breach might be "revealed" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running [[superhero]] comic books.

===Examples===
* When [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote ''[[The Final Problem]]'' he fully intended to kill off [[Sherlock Holmes]] and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody – including even his close friend Dr. Watson – believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place : the "death" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' also alludes to hidden ''fictional'' history, establishing that during the events of the serial ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', the [[First Doctor]] had in his possession a super-weapon, the [[Hand of Omega]] stolen from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s. The story also implies that he knew of the [[Daleks]] before he "first" met them.
* [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' made years of "established" events and characters from the [[DC Universe]] (for example the existence of [[Krypto]]) "un-happen". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it "secret".
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family|Wold Newton]] universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways.
* [[Warren Ellis]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes.
* [[Philip José Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'' reinterprets [[Jules Verne]]'s famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf.
* Many of the novels by American [[Tim Powers]] are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' had a different interpretation of pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the [[Fountain of Youth]], Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as "Edmund Morcilla" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel ''[[Declare]]'' presents a secret history of the Cold War, with America and the U.K. jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces.

==Time travel secret histories==

The plots of some [[Time travel]] books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.

For example, [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "Brave to be a King" asserts that King [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is "cancelled out" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, "The Sorrow of Odin the Goth", asserts that also the Nordic god [[Odin]]/[[Wodan]] was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient [[Goths]] and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. 

[[Paul Levinson]]'s "[[The Plot to Save Socrates]]" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher [[Socrates]] did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general [[Alcibiades]] had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician [[Hypatia]] of [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher [[William Henry Appleton]] had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited [[Classical Greece]] and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.

According to [[David Drake]]'s novel "[[Birds of Prey (Drake novel)|Birds of Prey]]", the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Third Century Crisis]] was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named [[Diocletian]], realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Bĺake's Progress'' assumes that the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife [[Catherine Blake| Kate]] were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various [[alternate timeline]]s, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of [[John Milton]], the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. [[William Blake's mythology]] is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom  Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character [[Urizen]] was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.

'''SimpsonHaugh and Partners''' (formerly '''Ian Simpson Architects''') is an English architecture practice established in 1987 by [[Ian Simpson (architect)|Ian Simpson]] and [[Rachel Haugh]]. The practice is based in [[Manchester]] with offices in [[London]]. In 2014 the practice re-branded as Simpson Haugh &amp; Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Waite | first = Richard | title = Ian Simpson Architects to rebrand to recognise Rachel Haugh | url = http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/ian-simpson-architects-to-rebrand-to-recognise-rachel-haugh/8669344.article | date = 8 September 2014 |access-date= 1 October 2015 | work = [[Architects' Journal]] | publisher = [[EMAP|Emap Ltd]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[1996 Manchester bombing]] by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], Ian Simpson Architects have played a large role in the reconstruction of Manchester, with many of the city's most notable new buildings having been designed by the firm. The firm has also been appointed to design major new mixed-use schemes in [[Glasgow]], [[Leicester]] and [[South Bank|London’s South Bank]] &lt;ref name='bd-3044581'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3044581 |title=Ian Simpson attacks ordinary architecture |accessdate= 28 May 2009 |last=Hurst |first=Will |date=10 December 2004 |work= [[Building Design]] | publisher = [[United Business Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skopje 2014 - Museum of the Macedonian Struggle and National Theatre.JPG|thumb|500px|View of the buildings finished after the 1963 earthquake (2014).]]
'''Skopje 2014''' ({{lang-mk|Скопје 2014}}) is a project financed by the [[Government of the Republic of Macedonia]], with the main ideology being based on that of the then-ruling party [[VMRO-DPMNE]],&lt;ref&gt;EastWest Institute (2000). Jonathan P. Stein, ed. The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-Communist Europe: State-Building, Democracy, and Ethnic Mobilization. M.E. Sharpe. p. 91. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0528-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of giving the capital [[Skopje]] a more classical appeal. The project, officially announced in 2010, consists mainly of the construction of colleges, museums and government buildings, as well as the erection of monuments depicting historical figures from the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Around 20 buildings and over 40 monuments are planned to be constructed as part of the project.&lt;ref name="Marusic2" /&gt; 

In fact this political project is [[nation-building]] one and tries to impose a new [[Macedonian historiography|revisionist narrative of the Macedonian history]], promoting  Macedonian identity, with  unbroken continuity from the antiquity over the middle ages to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Janev, G. (2015). ‘Skopje 2014’: erasing memories, building history. In M. Couroucli, &amp; T. Marinov (Eds.), Balkan heritages: Negotiating history and culture (pp. 111-130). Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced for constructing nationalistic [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Couroucli and Tchavdar Marinov eds., Balkan Heritages: Negotiating History and Culture, British School at Athens - Modern Greek and Byzantine Studies, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost, for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros.&lt;ref name="Bugjevac"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=C18D740B2343534A8B173AAD06639F3A|title=СКОПЈЕ ЌЕ УМРЕ ОД  НЕВКУС|last=Bugjevac|first=Dejan|year=2007|work=Globus|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koteska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/655-troubles-with-history-skopje-2014|title=Troubles with History: Skopje 2014|last=Koteska|first=Jasna|date=29 December 2011|work=Art Margins Online|accessdate=8 June 2012|location=Republic of Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skopje 2014 project encompasses the construction, from 2010 to 2014, of 136 structures built at a cost of more than US$700 million.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times International Edition, October 14, 2016, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the authorities and institutions of the country announced the halt of the project and then set up a Commission for envisaging the removal of its controversial monuments and statues.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

==Background==
[[File:Skopje-razglednica 014.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Theatre and Kale Fortress before the 1963 earthquake]]
[[File:Wodno.jpg|thumb|250px|View toward [[Macedonia Square, Skopje|Macedonia Square]] from the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]] in July 2011. Visible are the statues of Dame Gruev, Goce Delčev, Tsar Samuil, and the under construction Warrior on a Horse monument]]

The [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] destroyed approximately 80% of the city, including most of the neoclassical buildings in the central part of Skopje.&lt;ref name="MRT"&gt;[http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 Marking the 44th anniversary of the catastrophic 1963 Skopje earthquake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210952/http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2007-09-30 }} [[Macedonian Radio-Television|MRT]], Thursday, 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding that followed saw the construction of mostly plain [[modernist architecture]]. This is one of the reasons given by the VMRO-DPMNE government for the necessity of the project, to give Skopje a more monumental and visually pleasing image. Another reason is to restore the missing sense of national pride and create a more metropolitan atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Marusic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/gallery/skopje-2014|title=Skopje 2014: The new face of Macedonia, updated|last=Marusic|first=Siniša|date=11 May 2012|publisher=BalkanInsight|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the opening of [[Porta Macedonia]] in January 2012, then Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]] stated that Skopje 2014 was his idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/20045/45/|title=PM Gruevski: Yes, Skopje 2014 was my Idea|date=7 January 2012|publisher=MINA|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
{{see also|Antiquization}}
The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced. The cost of the project is estimated at anywhere from 80 to more than 500 million euros&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?], CNN, October 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonian-culture-strategy-milestone-or-wish-list  Macedonian Culture Strategy: Milestone or Wish List?], BalkanInsight, 15 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by many as a waste of resources in a country with high unemployment and poverty. The project is also believed by critics to be a distraction from these problems.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia]], the main opposition party, opposes the project and has alleged that the monuments could have cost six to ten times less than what the government paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104174531/http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 January 2013|title=SDSM Allegations at Government on Skopje 2014 Project|date=30 March 2011|publisher=SkopjeDiem|accessdate=30 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is seen as a part of the government's "antiquisation" policy, in which the country seeks to claim [[Ancient Macedonians|ancient Macedonian]] figures like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]] for itself. The timing of the project, following the country's non-invitation to NATO due to its continued [[Macedonia naming dispute|naming dispute]] with [[Greece]], has led to speculation that it is retaliation or an attempt to put pressure on Greece.&lt;ref name="Georgievski"&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, October 27, 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents see the scheme as the embodiment of nationalism by a conservative government focused as much on giving the metropolis a facelift as changing the nation's history and have described it as a mini-[[Las Vegas]]&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?], Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while others appreciate its classical nod to the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2011/05/05/the-changing-face-of-skopje/ The Changing Face of Skopje], Euronews.com, May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Vaknin]], a former adviser to Nikola Gruevski, has stated that the project is not anti-Greek or anti-Bulgarian, but anti-Albanian. In an interview, he said "Antiquisation has a double goal, which is to marginalise the Albanians and create an identity that will not allow Albanians to become Macedonians."&lt;ref name="Georgievski" /&gt; The project, however, later included depictions of ethnic Albanians in the monuments including [[Nexhat Agolli]], [[Josif Bageri]], and [[Pjetër Bogdani]], as well as others on the [[Art Bridge]], and includes the construction of [[Skanderbeg Square (Skopje)|Skanderbeg Square]].

Architects have criticized the aesthetics of the project and believe the money could have been spent on constructing modern buildings.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt; It has also been described as nationalist [[kitsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/spip.php?page=dossier&amp;id_article=18171|title=Macédoine : Skopje 2014, kitsch nationaliste et foire aux antiquités|year=2012|publisher=Le Courrier des Balkans|language=French|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "brings unknown history" to the citizens&lt;ref&gt;Borian Jovanovski Al Jazeera, 18 March 2015, [http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/03/macedonia-facade-150318135440964.html]: "Talking about this project Skopje 2014, yes it's damaging to inter-ethnic relations, it's not reflecting the multi-cultural society that Macedonia is. But on the other hand you have an Albanian party in the government - and they agree - so in a way they have responsibility for what's going on too. It's obvious that it is damaging inter-ethnic relations which are anyway fragile and damaging Macedonian national identity too because it brings us to history that is unknown to us, in which we are a kind of successor to Alexander the Great. This is not true because Alexander the Great is famous because he enlarged the Hellenic culture. We are Slavs who are not Hellenic at all."&lt;/ref&gt; and current prime minister [[Zoran Zaev]] has labeled it an "idiotic project".&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Zaev, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 27 December 2016, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/mazedonien-hinter-neuen-fassaden-1.3311464]: "Mit dem idiotischen Skopje-2014-Projekt und der zusammenhängenden Pseudo-Geschichtsschreibung, die Alexander den Großen für Mazedonien reklamiert, haben wir nicht nur Griechenland provoziert, sondern auch viel internationale Unterstützung für unsere Position verloren." (English translation: With the idiotic Skopje 2014 project and the related pseudo-historiography that claims Alexander the Great for Macedonia, we have not only provoked Greece, but also lost much international support for our position.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
In late February 2018, the government and institutions of the Republic of Macedonia announced the halt of the Skopje 2014 program and begun removing its [[Macedonian nationalism|controversial]] monuments and statues. The [[Ministry of Culture (Macedonia)|Macedonian Ministry of Culture]] also has set up a Commission to envisage the possibility of removing the rest of them, such as of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]]. As a first step, the monument of [[Andon Kyoseto]] was dismantled, as one of the mostly disputed of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mia.mk/EN/Inside/RenderSingleNews/289/134124689/|title=City of Skopje starting to take action on Skopje 2014 project: Mayor|publisher=Macedonian Information Agency|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/a-skopje-2014-monument-is-removed/|title=A “Skopje 2014” monument is removed|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2018/2/22/statue-removed-macedonia|title=Macedonia Removes the Skopje 2014 Statue of Andon Kyoseto|publisher=EUscoop|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amna.gr/en/article/232954/Skopje-starts-removal-of-irredentist-statues-put-up-by-Gruevski-government|title=Skopje starts removal of 'irredentist' statues put up by Gruevski government|publisher=AMNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/removal-of-monuments-in-skopje-whose-turn-is-next/|title=Removal of monuments in Skopje, whose turn is next?|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.protothema.gr/skopje-authorities-start-to-tear-down-nationalistic-statues/|title=Skopje authorities start to tear down nationalistic statues|publisher=Proto Thema|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-removes-divisive-court-statue-02-22-2018|title=Divisive Revolutionary's Statue Vanishes from Macedonian Capital|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Macedonian Government announced that the monuments would be renamed and marked with inscriptions honouring Greek-Macedonian friendship. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/divisive-skopje-2014-landmarks-find-new-purpose-06-14-2018|title=Macedonia to Rename Divisive Statues that Irked Greece|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==

===Bridges===

====New bridge constructions====

=====Art Bridge=====

{{main|Art Bridge}}

The Skopje 2014 project calls for two new pedestrian bridges to be built across the [[Vardar River|Vardar]] in the centre of the city. One is the Art Bridge, which is being constructed between the Freedom Bridge and the also under-construction Eye Bridge. It is expected to cost 2.5 million euros. The bridge will include 29 sculptures, with 14 at each end and one in the centre. It will be 83 metres (272.3 feet) in length and 9.2&amp;nbsp;m (30.2&amp;nbsp;ft) in width, while the central part of the bridge will be 12&amp;nbsp;m (39.4&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|title=Мостот на уметноста се искачи на конструкцијата|date=April 8, 2012|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613224413/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye Bridge=====
The other bridge being constructed as part of the project is the Eye Bridge. Situated between the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]] and the under-construction Art Bridge, it began construction in 2011. The pedestrian bridge will include 28 sculptures and will cost around 1.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.mk/skopje-mostot-oko-konechno-pochna-da-se-gradi?forward=802275|title=Мостот Око конечно почна да се гради|date=July 29, 2011|publisher=Daily.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existing bridge renovations====

=====Freedom Bridge=====
[[File:Puente Goce Delcev, Skopie, Macedonia, 2014-04-16, DD 52.JPG|thumb|250px|Aerial view of the renovated Goce Delčev Bridge]]

The project also includes plans to renovate existing bridges in central Skopje, one of which is the Freedom Bridge, which connects Vojvoda Vasil Adžilarski Street in [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar Municipality]] to Stiv Naumov Street in [[Čair Municipality]]. First constructed in 1936, the renovation began in 2011 and is expected to be completed in May, 2014. The total cost will be roughly 1.15 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirilica.com.mk/vest.asp?id=69962|title=1.140.000 евра за оградата на мостот кај Холидеј Ин|date=May 9, 2012|publisher=Кирилица|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Goce Delčev Bridge=====
The renovation of the Goce Delčev Bridge, which connects Ilinden Boulevard in Centar to Goce Delčev Boulevard in Čair across the Vardar, began on April 11, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7238|title="Барокна" ограда за мостот Гоце Делчев|date=4 November 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished later in the year. The renovation included new gold-coloured fencing and 26 lampposts. The project cost roughly 500,000 euros, including 60,000 euros for the new lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=10183|title=Мостот Гоце Делчев во ново светло|date=23 October 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four statues depicting lions, two at each end, were also placed on the bridge in 2010. The ones on the western side were cast in [[Florence]] and cost 1.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=4837|title=Поставени два лава на мостот Гоце Делчев|date=24 August 2010|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Revolution Bridge=====
The Revolution Bridge, first built in 1963 across the Vardar connecting Kočo Racin Boulevard in Centar to Krste Misirkov Boulevard in Čair, was also renovated as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It began on December 9, 2010 and was completed in May, 2011. The renovation included basic repairs as well as the installation of 22 lampposts and iron-wrought fencing. The renovation cost 450,000 euros.&lt;ref name="сител"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitel.com.mk/dnevnik/makedonija/pushten-vo-upotreba-rekonstruiraniot-%E2%80%9Emost-na-revolucijata%E2%80%9C|title=Пуштен во употреба реконструираниот "Мост на Револуцијата"|last=Бошковска|first=Елена|date=May 16, 2011|publisher=Сител|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural buildings===

====Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra hall====
Notable in Skopje 2014 for its bold modern architecture as opposed to the usual neoclassical style seen in the project, the under-construction concert hall to house the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the first buildings to begin construction in the project, with the cornerstone having been laid in June 2009. The exterior of the building is nearing completion. The concert hall is planned to have excellent acoustics and will have a capacity of 900 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kurir.mk/makedonija/kultura/49599-FOTO-Kako-ke-izgleda-novata-sala-na-Makedonskata-Filharmonija|title=ФОТО: Како ќе изгледа новата сала на Македонската Филхармонија?|date=14 November 2011|publisher=Kurir|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220164605/http://www.kurir.mk/makedonija/kultura/49599-FOTO-Kako-ke-izgleda-novata-sala-na-Makedonskata-Filharmonija|archivedate=20 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Museum of Archaeology====
[[File:MuseumofArchaeologySkopje.jpg|thumb|220px|The completed Museum of Archaeology]]

{{main|Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)}}

The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle for Statehood and Independence − Museum of VMRO and Museum of the Victims of the Communist Regime exhibits the strive for an independent Macedonian nation from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. It is divided into 16 departments and includes over 100 wax figures of historical individuals. The museum lies on the eastern bank of the Vardar River just northwest of the Museum of Archaeology, opposite Macedonia Square. Construction began in June 2008 and it formally opened on September 10, 2011. The total cost of the museum, which covers 2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (26,909.8&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), was roughly 10 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=9561|title=ФОТО ВЕСТ: Свечено отворен Музејскиот комплекс "Македонска борба"|date=September 9, 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Theatre====
The former National Theatre destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] will be completely reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. Construction of the building, however, began in December 2007, three years before the official announcing of Skopje 2014. Construction was originally planned to be completed in 2009, though it ended up being completed a few years after.&lt;ref name="Factor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faktor.mk/archives/102033|title=Стариот театар уште "голта" пари|date=10 April 2014|publisher=Factor|language=Macedonian|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre stands on its original location on the eastern bank of the Vardar.

===Government buildings===
The following are new buildings being constructed to house various governmental functions.

====Agency for Electronic Communications====
[[File:Skopje 2014 - Agency for Electronic Communications and Archeological Museum.JPG|thumb|Agency for Electronic Communications (right)]]
The cornerstone for the new building to house the Agency for Electronic Communications was laid on 30 March 2011. It is being constructed on the eastern bank of the Vardar in between two other Skopje 2014 buildings, the Museum of Archaeology and the Financial Police Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7083|title=Камен темелник за новиот објект на АЕК|date=30 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of the building's construction is around 8.5 million euros, which the government claims will be fully funded by the Agency's budget. It is expected to be completed in 15 months or by the late summer of 2012.&lt;ref name="Jovanova"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221020103/http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=АГЕНЦИЈАТА ЗА ЕЛЕКТРОНСКИ КОМУНИКАЦИИ ЈА ДОБИВА СВОЈАТА ЗГРАДА|last=Jovanova|first=Sonja|date=30 March 2011|publisher=Kapital|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal Court Building====
A new Criminal Court Building is being constructed as part of the project. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 25 May 2010. The building, 10 stories tall, has been topped out. In it will be 74 judicial offices, 22 high courts, and 2 large courtrooms. The 2-story basement will contain parking. The building, reported to cost 8.3 million euros, was planned to be completed after 18 months of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=3626|title=Поставен камен темелник за новиот Кривичен суд|date=29 May 2010|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=3 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial Police Building====
[[File:MFAandFinancialPoliceBldgSkopje.jpg|220px|thumb|The completed Financial Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs buildings]]
On 11 October 2010 the cornerstone for the new building to house the Financial Police of the Republic of Macedonia was laid. The site is located between the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the new Agency for Electronic Communications. The building, currently several months from completion, is cylindrical in shape and is capped by a dome-shaped roof. The total cost of construction will be roughly 13 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=5216|title=Камен темелник за зграда на Обвинителството и Финансиската полиција|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Finance====
The government, in March 2011, invested 8.9 million euros into transforming an abandoned uncompleted building in central Skopje into a new home for the Ministry of Finance. Like the other governmental buildings in Skopje 2014, it will have a neoclassical appearance. Though it was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2012, the building remains far from completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6871|title=Министерството за финансии ќе се сели во "Југобанка"|date=8 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Foreign Affairs====
Construction of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs building began in January 2010. It is located on the eastern bank of the Vardar between the Financial Police Building and Stiv Naumov Street. It will have two basement levels, seven above-ground levels, and a terrace atop the building. The building, which is nearly complete on the exterior, stands at a height of 27&amp;nbsp;m (88.6&amp;nbsp;ft) and will have costed 13.5 million euros when completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=2837|title=Официјален камен темелник за новото МНР|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New City Hall====
A new city hall for Skopje is being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]], on the eastern bank of the Vardar. It is being constructed, as most other buildings in the project, in the neoclassical style and will cost roughly 15 million euros. It will be 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, with six above-ground floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7984|title=Се гради објект за скопската градска администрација|date=3 June 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old City Hall====
Although a new city hall for Skopje is being constructed, the former one destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] will be fully reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It will be built on its original location at the north side of Macedonia Square, to the west of the Vardar Quay. A Greek investor will be building the Old City Hall, as well as a Marriott Hotel to the immediate left of the building, after purchasing the land in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6920|title=Грчки инвеститор ќе ги гради Офицерскиот дом и хотелот на Плоштад Македонија|date=12 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Management Building====
Among the buildings being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]] on the eastern bank of the Vardar is the Water Management Building. Construction of the building began in December 2011. It is expected to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 10 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221032952/http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=Поставен камен-темелник на новата зграда на ЈП "Водовод и канализација"|date=4 December 2011|publisher=[[Macedonian Radio-Television]]|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trajkovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219022739/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 February 2013|title=Градската администрација ќе добие зграда под Кале|last=Trajkovska|first=Despina|date=13 December 2010|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===

====Justinian I====
[[File:Justinian I . 2 . Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|180px|Justinian I monument]]

The monument of [[Justinian I]], born in [[Tauresium]] just outside modern Skopje, arrived at Macedonia Square on June 16, 2011. Similar to the monument of Tsar Samuil, also on Macedonia Square, it consists of Justinian I sitting on a throne, which is placed on a pedestal. The monument is made of white marble with the exception of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal, also characteristics it shares with the Tsar Samuil monument. The pedestal is 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, while Justinian upon his throne measures a further 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height.

The monument sits just north of the Stone Bridge, at the western bank of the Vardar River. It was made in Florence and cost over 1 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|title=Се поставува Јустинијан Први|date=17 June 2011 &lt;!--13:55--&gt;|publisher=Sky.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203085300/http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mother Teresa====
The construction of a monument consisting of a statue of Skopje native [[Mother Teresa]] and a fountain is planned. The monument will be located near the MEPSO building, which is north of Macedonia Square near the Vardar Quay, though location on the roundabout near the Goce Delčev Bridge is also a possibility. It is planned to stand around 30&amp;nbsp;m (98.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, even taller than the Warrior on a Horse monument.

It has been reported that a donation from India will fund the construction of the new Mother Teresa monument, who is already memorialized in the city with the [[Memorial House of Mother Teresa]] and a plaque marking the spot of her birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bukvar.mk/news/kje-se-gradi-spomenik-na-majka-tereza-povisok-od-voinot-na-konj?newsid=9SxW|title=ЌЕ СЕ ГРАДИ СПОМЕНИК НА МАЈКА ТЕРЕЗА ПОВИСОК ОД ВОИНОТ НА КОЊ|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Fakulteti.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=30 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pavilion at Macedonia Square====
[[File:Летниковецот на Плоштад (8).JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Pavilion at Macedonia Square]]

The Pavilion at Macedonia Square is situated on the north side of Macedonia Square. Construction began in early 2011 and was completed later that year at a cost of 350,000 euros.&lt;ref name="Dimitrievski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.mk/i-letnikovec?forward=567090|title=И летниковец ...|last=Dimitrievski|first=Aleksandar|date=26 January 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion consists of a dome supported by several columns, covering a statue of a romantic couple.

{{Main|Porta Macedonia}}

One of the main symbols of the project is Porta Macedonia, a [[triumphal arch]] situated on 11 October Street, near Macedonia Square. The arch is meant to commemorate the long struggle for Macedonian independence. It is 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and contains 32 reliefs carved on the outside, depicting events from pre-history to the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. The inside of the arch consists of two levels, in which a souvenir shop and a gallery are located, and a rooftop observation deck. It formally opened to the public on Christmas Eve, January 6, 2012. The construction of Porta Macedonia is estimated at 4.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=11623|title="Порта Македонија" свечено претставена на јавноста|date=January 6, 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=22 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tsar Samuil====
[[File:Samuil 1. Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Tsar Samuil monument]]

The monument to [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] is among the new focal points of Macedonia Square. Officially unveiled on 28 June 2011, it is situated in front of the Pelister building, to the right of where Macedonia Street meets Macedonia Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=139834|title=Поставен споменикот на Цар Самоил|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!--  15:23 --&gt; |publisher=А1|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument, mostly in white marble, consists of a depiction of Tsar Samuil sitting on a throne, totaling 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, and is placed on a pedestal which itself is a further 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The reliefs on the sides of the pedestal are bronze.  Tsar Samuil, in the monument, holds a scepter. Made in Florence, the total cost of the Tsar Samuil monument was roughly 3.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219045443/http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=Споменикот на Цар Самоил стигна на плоштадот "Македонија"|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!-- , 11:11 --&gt;|publisher=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side of the Stone Bridge from Macedonia Square is Karpoš's Rebellion Square, which serves as a main entrance to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. It is undergoing a major reconstruction, as part of Skopje 2014, and its new centerpiece will be the statue and fountain officially named "Warrior," though it is widely believed that the statue is a depiction of [[Philip II of Macedon]], not to be confused with the equestrian statue of Philip II in Skopje's Avtokomanda neighborhood. The statue was placed onto the square on 22 May 2012.

Made in Vicenza, the statue is 15&amp;nbsp;m (49.2&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and is placed on a 13&amp;nbsp;m (42.7&amp;nbsp;ft) tall pedestal. The entire monument will cost roughly 2 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=15338|title=Филип Втори поставен на плоштадот "Карпошово востание"|date=22 May 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=29 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the main symbol of the Skopje 2014 project is the Warrior on a Horse ({{lang-mk|Воин на коњ}}) statue and fountain in the centre of Macedonia Square. It is typically thought to depict [[Alexander the Great]], though it is not officially named for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?] CNN International, 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?] The Guardian, Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statue was sculpted by [[Valentina Stevanovska]] and cast in Florence. "Alexander" was officially completed on September 8, 2011 to commemorate 20 years of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. It is 14.5&amp;nbsp;m (47.6&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and it sits on a cylindrical column, which itself is 10&amp;nbsp;m (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height. The column consists of three large ivory sections, each separated by a thinner bronze ring. Each section contains reliefs. The column stands in a fountain. At the base of the column are 8 bronze soldiers, each 3&amp;nbsp;m (9.8&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. There are also 8 bronze lions, each 2.5&amp;nbsp;m (8.3&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, around the edges of the fountain pool, four of which act as part of the fountain, releasing water from their mouths. The fountain also plays music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|title=Пуштање во употреба фонтана со споменикот "Воин на коњ"|date=8 September 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723123128/http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===

====Docked boats in Vardar River====
[[File:Ship in Vardar, Skopje.jpg|thumb|200px|One of building-boats in the Vardar River]]
The first of four building-boats as restaurants and cafes just in the Vardar River opened in July 2014. The boats are erected into the riverbed and, thus, will remain in their planned spots permanently. The boats, all to be situated in central Skopje, were intended to be in the Baroque style.&lt;ref name="plusinfo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/144687/Zaplovi-prvata-galija-vo-Vardar|title="Заплови" првата галија во Вардар|date=21 July 2014|language=Macedonian|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sitel.com.mk/dnevnik/makedonija/izbrani-idejnite-reshenija-za-splavovi-na-vardar|title=Избрани идејните решенија за сплавови на Вардар|date=3 March 2012|publisher=Sitel|language=Macedonian|accessdate=20 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ferris wheel====
The erection of a Ferris wheel is foreseen on the Vardar River. It will require the construction of a new pedestrian bridge, to run from the [[Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)|Museum of the Macedonian Struggle]] to the MEPSO Building, upon which it will stand. No final plan for the project has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/27264/Panoramskoto-trkalo-kje-se-gradi-na-nov-most|title=Панорамското тркало ќе се гради на нов мост|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Plusinfo|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fountains in Vardar River====
The addition of fountains on the Vardar River was planned early on in the project. They were completed in 2010. The fountains have been criticized for reportedly releasing mud, as well as for acting as a filter for trash flowing down the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kirilica.com.mk/vest.asp?id=66369|title=Потскокна и фонтаната во Вардар|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Kirilica|language=Macedonian|accessdate=17 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kale Fortress reconstruction====
Director of Cultural Heritage and archaeologist [[Pasko Kuzman]] has announced a plan to restore and reconstruct the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]]. The plan also includes the construction of a museum to house Byzantine archaeological finds from the fortress, as well as reconstructions of a prehistoric house and an Ottoman guard tower to be built on the place of their ruins. Souvenir shops and cafes are also foreseen additions. The most controversial part of the restoration of the fortress is the construction of a church, which has been protested by ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref name="Trpčevska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=5CE5FDEADB1BF94B8543DC889925F25D|title=Отомански кули и праисториски куќи ќе никнат на Кале|last=Trpčevska|first=Daniela|date=24 August 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karpoš's Rebellion Square reconstruction====
Karpoš's Rebellion Square is situated opposite the Vardar River of Macedonia Square and is undergoing a significant reconstruction. Plans include the erection of a statue and fountain depicting Phillip II of Macedon, though officially named "Warrior," at the far northeast side of the square. Another monument consisting of a fountain and statues representing the Mothers of Macedonia is being constructed in front of the Warrior monument. In front of this will be two monuments, also consisting of a fountain and statues, depicting horses. The two will be situated on either side of the entrance to the square from the Stone Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=8540|title=Почнува уредувањето на плоштадот Карпошово востание|date=6 July 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office building on Macedonia Square====
[[File:OfficeBldgMacedoniaSquare.jpg|thumb|220px|The office building]]

A new office building was constructed on the south side of Macedonia Square, on the Vardar Quay. It stands on the same place as the former headquarters of the National Bank, which was destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]]. The new office building is similar in shape to the former bank building, though it is not in the neoclassical style, which also makes it somewhat unusual in the Skopje 2014 project.&lt;ref name="Naumovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=4048432E7DF51C4B886B49D49DB3C216|title=Новата зграда во Скопје само ќе личи на Народната банка|last=Naumovska|first=Sanja|date=8 August 2008|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skanderbeg Square construction====

[[File:Skopje, Daut Pasuv hamam (turecke lazne) ve Skopji, bila budova v.jpg|thumb|220px|Macedonian Opera]]
An existing statue of [[Skanderbeg]], an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, will be the main fixture of an under construction square that will bear his name in Skopje's [[Čair Municipality]]. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and is expected to be completed in 2014. The square will cover 28,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (301,389&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and will extend from Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. This will require building a portion of the square on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty of open space, the square will contain an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37&amp;eventId=83549&amp;egId=13|title="Скендер Бег" готов до 2014 - та|date=28 November 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726135632/http://kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|title=Плоштадот Скендерг-бег ќе чини 10 милиони евра|date=21 October 2011|publisher=Time.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219034051/http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|archivedate=19 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Still Got the Blues''''' is the eighth solo [[studio album]] by Northern [[Irish people|Irish]] [[guitarist]] [[Gary Moore]], released in 1990. It marked a substantial change in style for Moore, who, prior to this album, was predominantly known for [[Rock music|rock]] and [[hard rock]] music with [[Skid Row (blues-rock band)|Skid Row]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[G-Force (Gary Moore album)|G-Force]], [[Greg Lake]] and during his own extensive solo career, as well as his [[jazz-fusion]] work with [[Colosseum II]]. As evidenced by its title, ''Still Got the Blues'' saw him delve into an [[electric blues]] style.

The album features guest contributions from [[Albert King]], [[Albert Collins]] and [[George Harrison]]. 

The title track was released as a single and reached No. 97 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on 16 February 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=gary moore|chart=Hot 100}}|title=Gary Moore - Chart History|publisher=Crapfromthepast.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, it is the only single of Moore's to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

The album reached No. 83 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] on 16 February 1991, then was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[RIAA]] on November 1995. This was the most successful album both in sales and chart positions from Gary Moore in the US.

[[File:TerraSigillataRGM.jpeg|thumb|270px|Terra sigillata beaker with [[barbotine]] decoration]]
'''Terra sigillata''' is a term with at least three distinct meanings:  as a description of medieval medicinal earth;  in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red [[Ancient Roman pottery]] with glossy surface [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]] made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary [[studio pottery]] technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery.  Usually roughly translated as 'sealed earth', the meaning of 'terra sigillata' is 'clay bearing little images' (Latin ''sigilla''), not 'clay with a sealed (impervious) surface'.  The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in [[relief]].

Terra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire.  These vessels have glossy surface [[Slip (ceramics)|slips]] ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported.  The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as '''Aretine ware''' from [[Arezzo]] and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance.  The wares made in the [[Gaul]]ish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as '''samian ware'''.  Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. [[African red slip ware]]s.  All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists:  they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.

Modern "Terra sig" should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, http://archeologie.pagesperso-orange.fr/experimental/morla.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters can be made from most [[clay]], mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, "terra sig" can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this [[burnishing (pottery)|burnishing]] or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them.  The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.

==Medicinal earth==
The oldest use for the term terra sigillata was for a [[medicinal clay]] from the island of [[Lemnos]].  The latter was called "sealed" because cakes of it were pressed together and stamped with the head of [[Artemis]]. Later, it bore the seal of the [[Ottoman sultan]].  This soil's particular mineralic content was such that, in the [[Renaissance]], it was seen as a proof against poisoning, as well as a general cure for any bodily impurities, and it was highly prized as a medicine and medicinal component.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold traveled around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata made from a special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now [[Strzegom]], Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1588 English ethnographer and translator [[Thomas Harriot]] wrote in ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia'' that [[Algonquians]] of the mid–Atlantic region treated various sores and wounds with ''wapeih'', a kind of terra sigillata that English surgeons and physicians found to be of the same kind "of vertue and more effectuall" than the contemporary European sort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=etas A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia], Thomas Hariot, 1588.

==Roman red gloss pottery==
[[File:201005151401 NE CSM Aretinische TS.jpg|thumb|260px|left|A decorated Arretine vase (Form Dragendorff 11) found at Neuss, Germany]]
In archaeological usage, the term ''terra sigillata'' without further qualification normally denotes the Arretine ware of Italy, made at [[Arezzo]], and Gaulish samian ware manufactured first in South [[Gaul]], particularly at [[La Graufesenque]], near [[Millau]], and later at [[Lezoux]] and adjacent sites near [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and at east Gaulish sites such as [[Trier]], Sinzig and [[Rheinzabern]].  These high-quality tablewares were particularly popular and widespread in the Western Roman Empire from about 50 BC to the early 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;King 1983, p.253 (definition) and pp. 183–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Roberts, 'Mass-production of Roman Finewares', in Ian Freestone &amp; David Gaimster, ''Pottery in the Making: World Ceramic Traditions'', London 1997, pp. 188–193&lt;/ref&gt;  Definitions of 'TS' have grown up from the earliest days of antiquarian studies, and are far from consistent; one survey of Classical art says: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Terra sigillata'' ... is a Latin term used by modern scholars to designate a class of decorated red-gloss pottery .... not all red-gloss ware was decorated, and hence the more inclusive term 'Samian ware' is sometimes used to characterize all varieties of it.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, pp. 276-77&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

- whereas Anthony King's definition, following the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, makes no mention of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is 'alternatively known as samian ware'.  However, 'samian ware' is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. ''terre sigillée''), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products.&lt;ref&gt;King 1983, p.253. See also the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/r/roman_pottery_terra_sigillata.aspx British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The meaning and etymology of 'samian ware' is a somewhat complex matter, fully addressed in King 1980.  There is ancient authority for the use of  ''samia vasa'' to describe pottery with a polished surface in literary usage (Pliny, ''Nat. Hist.'' 35, 160), and the verb ''samiare'', 'to polish' is probably connected.  However, it would be unwise to exclude all possible historical associations with the island of [[Samos]], though of course the pottery known as samian ware to present-day archaeologists has nothing to do with that region.  The modern parallel of the English term 'china' may be an apt one:  'china' refers to a class of ceramic that no longer has any direct connection with the country, China, but it was originally developed as part of the European attempts to imitate imported [[Chinese porcelain]] in the 18th century.  The parallel with 'china' is the reason why the late Professor Eric Birley favoured the use of a lower-case initial for 'samian'. (Birley ''pers.comm'', 1960s, and see also Stanfield and Simpson 1958, p.xxxi, footnote 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms that we would not choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study of the history of the terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only.  Scholars writing in English now often use "red gloss wares" or "red slip wares", both to avoid these issues of definition,&lt;ref&gt;As both King and Boardman do in their main texts.&lt;/ref&gt;  and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.
[[File:Roman pottery samian form Dr 29 edit.jpg|thumb|Profile drawing of form Dragendorff 29. 1st century AD.]]

Italian and Gaulish TS vessels were made in standardised shapes constituting services of matching dishes, bowls and serving vessels.  These changed and evolved over time, and have been very minutely classified; the first major scheme, by the German classical archaeologist [[Hans Dragendorff]] (1895), is still in use (as e.g. "Dr.29"),&lt;ref&gt;H. Dragendorff, 'Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der griechischen und römischen Keramik', ''Bonner Jahrbücher'' 96 (1895).&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many others, such as the classifications of Déchelette, Knorr, Hermet, Walters, Curle, Loeschcke, Ritterling, Hermet and Ludowici, and more recently, the ''Conspectus'' of Arretine forms and Hayes's type-series of African Red Slip and Eastern sigillatas.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald &amp; Pryce 1920 covers the main typologies of the early 20th century. Ettlinger 1990 is the current reference system for Arretine, and Hayes 1972 and 1980 for the late Roman material.&lt;/ref&gt;  These reference sometimes make it possible to date the manufacture of a broken decorated sherd to within 20 years or less.

Most of the forms that were decorated with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces of which had been decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as ''poinçons'') and some free-hand work using a [[stylus]].  The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it.  As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip.  [[Barbotine]] and [[appliqué]] ('sprigged') techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms.&lt;ref&gt;Closed forms: shapes such as vases and flagons/jugs that cannot be made in a single mould because they have a swelling profile that tapers inwards from the point of greatest diameter. Some large [[flagon]]s were made at La Graufesenque by making the lower and upper bowl-shaped portions in moulds, and then joining these and adding the neck.  Obviously the open forms, namely bowls that could be formed in, and extracted from, a single mould, were quicker and simpler to make.&lt;/ref&gt;   Study of the characteristic decorative [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the [[cursive]] signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry.  Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken [[sherd]]:  a potter's stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 &lt;ref&gt;Felix Oswald &amp; T.D. Pryce, ''An Introduction to the study of terra sigillata'', London 1920&lt;/ref&gt; set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject goes back into the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Knorr 1919; Knorr 1952; Hermet 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The site reports on the German forts at [[Haltern]] and [[Hofheim, Hesse|Hofheim]] in the early 20th century included form-classifications which are still in use for forms that were absent from Dragendorff's original list: Loeschcke 1909; Ritterling 1913&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Graufesenque samian kiln.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The remains of the ''grand four'' ("big [[kiln]]") at La Graufesenque]]

The motifs and designs on the [[relief]]-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman decorative arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes.  Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, and in many cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops.  Some of the decoration relates to contemporary architectural ornament, with [[egg-and-tongue]] (ovolo) mouldings, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and vine [[scrollwork|scrolls]] and the like.  While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of '[[Romanization (cultural)|romanisation]]', the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.

Many of the Gaulish manufacturing sites have been extensively excavated and studied.  At [[La Graufesenque]] in southern Gaul, documentary evidence in the form of lists or tallies apparently fired with single kiln-loads, giving potters' names and numbers of pots have long been known, and they suggest very large loads of 25,000–30,000 vessels.  Though not all the kilns at this, or other, manufacturing sites were so large, the excavation of the ''grand four'' (big kiln) at La Graufesenque, which was in use in the late 1st and early 2nd century, confirms the scale of the industry.  It is a rectangular stone-built structure measuring 11.3 m. by 6.8 m. externally, with an original height estimated at 7 metres. With up to nine 'storeys' within (dismantled after each firing), formed of tile floors and vertical columns in the form of clay pipes or tubes, which also served to conduct the heat, it has been estimated that it was capable of firing 30,000–40,000 vessels at a time, at a temperature of around 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 1996, pp. 9–12 provides a useful summary.  For a report on the ''grand four'', see Vernhet 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 work has shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and aluminium oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix.  The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe[III] for the red and Fe[II] for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears as a result of this recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.&lt;ref&gt;Sciau, P. et al 2005, pp.006.5.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forerunners===

Arretine ware, in spite of its very distinctive appearance, was an integral part of the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the [[Hellenistic]] and early Roman period.  That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver.  Centuries before Italian  terra sigillata was made, [[Black-figure pottery|Attic painted vases]], and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing.  Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.&lt;ref&gt;Noble 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megarian bowl.JPG#Summary|thumb|230px|A black Megarian bowl, 2nd century BC]]
Glossy-slipped black pottery made in [[Etruria]] and [[Campania]] continued this technological tradition, though painted decoration gave way to simpler stamped motifs and in some cases, to applied motifs moulded in relief.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1997, pp. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition of decorating entire vessels in low relief was also well established in Greece and Asia Minor by the time the Arretine industry began to expand in the middle of the 1st century BC, and examples were imported into Italy.  Relief-decorated cups, some in lead-glazed wares, were produced at several eastern centres, and undoubtedly played a part in the technical and stylistic evolution of decorated Arretine, but Megarian bowls, made chiefly in Greece and Asia Minor, are usually seen as the most direct inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Garbsch 1982, pp.30-33&lt;/ref&gt;  These are small, hemispherical bowls without foot-rings, and their decoration is frequently very reminiscent of contemporary silver bowls, with formalised, radiating patterns of leaves and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1997, pp.40-41:  Garbsch 1982, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  The crisp and precisely profiled forms of the plain dishes and cups were also part of a natural evolution of taste and fashion in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century BC.

===Arretine ware===
[[File:Arretine ware poinçon.JPG|thumb|190px|left|An Arretine stamp used for impressing a mould]]

Arretine ware began to be manufactured at and near [[Arezzo]] (Tuscany) a little before the middle of the 1st century BC.  The industry expanded rapidly in a period when Roman political and military influence was spreading far beyond Italy:  for the inhabitants of the first provinces of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Emperor Augustus (''reg.'' 27 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 14), this tableware, with its precise forms, shiny surface, and, on the decorated vessels, its visual introduction to Classical art and mythology, must have deeply impressed some inhabitants of the new northern provinces of the Empire.  Certainly it epitomised certain aspects of Roman taste and technical expertise.   Pottery industries in the areas we now call north-east France and [[Belgium]] quickly began to copy the shapes of plain Arretine dishes and cups in the wares now known as Gallo-Belgic,&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, pp.161–166&lt;/ref&gt; and in South and Central Gaul, it was not long before local potters also began to emulate the mould-made decoration and the glossy red slip itself.

The most recognisable decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet on a high pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table vessels of the same period, such as the [[Warren Cup]].  The [[iconography]], too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo ([[egg-and-tongue]]) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the ''poinçons'' (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6&amp;nbsp;cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists.  Major workshops, such as those of M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Oxé-Comfort 1968 / 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arretine mould.JPG|thumb|230px|Mould for an Arretine Dr.11, manufactured in the workshop of P. Cornelius]]

Italian sigillata was not made only at or near Arezzo itself:  some of the important Arezzo businesses had branch factories in [[Pisa]], and by the beginning of the 1st century AD, the Ateius and Rasinius workshops had set up branch factories at La Muette, near [[Lyon]] in Central Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1996, pp.191–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor were the classic Arretine wares of the Augustan period the only forms of terra sigillata made in Italy:  later sigillata industries in the [[Po Valley]] and elsewhere continued the tradition.  The history of sigillata manufacture in Italy is succinctly summarised in Hayes 1997, pages 41–52.

In the Middle Ages, examples of the ware that were serendipitously discovered in digging foundations in Arezzo drew admiring attention as early as the 13th century, when [[Restoro d'Arezzo]]'s massive encyclopedia included a chapter praising the refined Roman ware discovered in his native city, "what is perhaps the first account of an aspect of ancient art to be written since classical times".&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:13 and note.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] also mentioned the ware.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss 1973:13 note 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study of Arretine ware was that of Fabroni in 1841,&lt;ref&gt;Fabroni 1841&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German scholars in particular had made great advances in systematically studying and understanding both Arretine ware and the Gaulish samian that occurred on Roman military sites being excavated in Germany.  Dragendorff's classification was expanded by other scholars, including S. Loeschcke in his study of the Italian sigillata excavated at the early Roman site of [[Haltern]].&lt;ref&gt;Loeschcke 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  Research on Arretine ware has continued very actively throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, for example with the publication and revision of Oxé-Comfort and the ''Conspectus'' of forms, bringing earlier work on stamps and shapes up to date.&lt;ref&gt;Oxé-Comfort 1968/2000; Ettlinger 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all ancient pottery studies, each generation asks new questions and applies new techniques (such as analysis of clays) in the attempt to find the answers.

===South Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:South Gaulish samian Dr 29 2.JPG|thumb|270px|left|South Gaulish Dragendorff 29, late 1st century AD]]
Sigillata vessels, both plain and decorated, were manufactured at several centres in southern France, including [[Bram, Aude|Bram]], [[Montans]], La Graufesenque, [[Le Rozier]] and [[Banassac]],&lt;ref&gt;see Tyers 1996, p. 106,  fig.90 for a map of the Gaulish production sites&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 1st century BC:  of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter.  Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and other regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire.  One of the finds in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], destroyed by the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, D., 'A hoard of samian ware from Pompeii', ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 4 (1914), pp. 26–64&lt;/ref&gt; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.
[[File:Roman pottery South Gaulish samian ware.jpg|thumb|250px|South Gaulish plain forms, showing standardisation of size]]
South Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata.  The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the [[Emperor Claudius|Claudian]] and early [[Nero]]nian periods (Claudius, ''reg''. AD 41–54;  Nero, ''reg''. AD 54–68).  At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977, p. 12, Pl.II&lt;/ref&gt;  Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, and even the characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made.  But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by the second half of the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile.  The footring is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names.  The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration,&lt;ref&gt;'Rouletted' decoration: this is a regular, notched surface texture, created by using a tool with a toothed wheel (''roulette'') to impress the pattern on the bowl before the clay was hard.  It is also possible that it was sometimes made by holding a blade-like tool against the vessel as it turned on the wheel, allowing the tool to judder against the surface of the clay.&lt;/ref&gt; and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones.  These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls.  Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century.  Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.
[[File:Samian ware bowl by Mercato.JPG|thumb|220px|South Gaulish bowl, Dr.37, from the late 1st century AD, with a stamp of the potter Mercato in the decoration]]
In the last two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity.  This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century.  Small relief-decorated [[Beaker (archaeology)|beakers]] such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of these may be found in Hermet's own type-sequence, Hermet 1934, Pl.4—5&lt;/ref&gt;  But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.

A local industry inspired by Arretine and South Gaulish imports grew up in the [[Iberia]]n provinces in the 1st century AD. ''Terra sigillata hispanica'' developed its own distinctive forms and designs, and continued in production into the late Roman period, the 4th and 5th centuries AD.  It was not exported to other regions.

===Central Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:Central Gaulish samian Dr.30.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Central Gaulish Dr.30, stamped by Divixtus]]
The principal Central Gaulish samian potteries were situated at Lezoux and [[Les Martres-de-Veyre]], not far from [[Clermont-Ferrand]] in the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].   Production had already begun at Lezoux in the [[Emperor Augustus|Augustan]] period (Augustus, ''reg''. 27 BC–AD 14), but it was not until the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98–117), and the beginning of a decline in the South Gaulish export trade, that Central Gaulish samian ware became important outside its own region.  Though it never achieved the extensive geographical distribution of the South Gaulish factories, in the provinces of Gaul and [[Roman Britain|Britain]], it was by far the most common type of fine tableware, plain and decorated, in use during the 2nd century AD.  The quality of the ware and the slip is usually excellent, and some of the products of Les Martres-de-Veyre, in particular, are outstanding, with a lustrous slip and a very hard, dense body.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977, p. 24:  Tyers 1996, 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The surface colour tends towards a more orange-red hue than the typical South Gaulish slips.

Vessel-forms that had been made in South Gaul continued to be produced, though as the decades passed, they evolved and changed with the normal shifts of fashion, and some new shapes were created, such as the plain bowl with a horizontal flange below the rim, Dr.38.  [[Mortarium|Mortaria]], food-preparation bowls with a gritted interior surface, were also made in Central Gaulish samian fabric in the second half of the 2nd century (Dr.45).  There is a small sub-class of Central Gaulish samian ware with a glossy black slip, though the dividing line between black terra sigillata and other fine black-gloss wares, which were also manufactured in the area, is sometimes hazy.  When a vessel is a classic samian form and decorated in relief in the style of a known samian potter, but finished with black slip rather than a red one, it may be classed as black samian.
[[File:Roman pottery Central Gaulish samian jar.JPG|thumb|230px|Central Gaulish samian jar with 'cut-glass' decoration]]

Though the Central Gaulish forms continued and built upon the South Gaulish traditions, the decoration of the principal decorated forms, Dr.30 and Dr.37, was distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;The basic study remains Stanfield &amp; [[Grace Simpson|Simpson]] 1958 / 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  New human and animal figure-types appeared, generally modelled with greater realism and sophistication than those of La Graufesenque and other South Gaulish centres.  Figure-types and decorative details have been classified, and can often be linked to specific workshops&lt;ref&gt;Many of the Central Gaulish types were first drawn and classified in Déchelette 1904.  Oswald's classification (Oswald 1936–7) is much fuller, covering South, Central and East Gaulish types, but is marred by the poor quality of the drawings.&lt;/ref&gt; Lezoux wares also included vases decorated with [[barbotine]] relief, with appliqué motifs, and a class usually referred to as 'cut-glass' decoration, with geometric patterns cut into the surface of the vessel before slipping and firing.  Two standard 'plain' types made in considerable numbers in Central Gaul also included barbotine decoration, Dr.35 and 36, a matching cup and dish with a curved horizontal rim embellished with a stylised scroll of leaves in relief.

During the second half of the 2nd century, some Lezoux workshops making relief-decorated bowls, above all that of Cinnamus, dominated the market with their large production.&lt;ref&gt;Stanfield &amp; Simpson 1958, pp. 263–271&lt;/ref&gt;  The wares of Cinnamus, Paternus, Divixtus, Doeccus, Advocisus, Albucius and some others often included large, easily legible name-stamps incorporated into the decoration, clearly acting as brand-names or advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1977,pp.16–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Though these vessels were very competently made, they are heavy and somewhat coarse in form and finish compared with earlier Gaulish samian ware.

From the end of the 2nd century, the export of sigillata from Central Gaul rapidly, perhaps even abruptly, ceased.  Pottery production continued, but in the 3rd century, it reverted to being a local industry.

===East Gaulish samian ware===
[[File:Rheinzabern samian vase.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Rheinzabern barbotine-decorated vase, form Ludowici VMe]]
There were numerous potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included [[Alsace]], the [[Saarland]], and the [[Rhine]] and [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]] regions, but while the samian pottery from [[Luxeuil]], [[Laneuveville-devant-Nancy|La Madeleine]], Chémery-Faulquemont, [[Lavoye]], [[Remagen]], [[Sinzig]], Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely [[Rheinzabern]], near [[Speyer]], and [[Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;For a good selection of examples, see Garbsch 1982, pp. 54–74&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trier potteries evidently began to make samian vessels around the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and were still active until the middle of the 3rd century.  The styles and the potters have been divided by scholars into two main phases, Werkstatten I and II.&lt;ref&gt;Huld-Zetsche 1972;  Huld-Zetsche 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the later mould-made Dr.37 bowls are of very poor quality, with crude decoration and careless finishing.

The Rheinzabern kilns and their products have been studied since Wilhelm Ludowici (1855–1929) began to excavate there in 1901, and to publish his results in a series of detailed reports.&lt;ref&gt;Ludowici 1927; Ricken 1942; Ricken &amp; Fischer 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  Rheinzabern produced both decorated and plain forms for around a century from the middle of the 2nd century.  Some of the Dr.37 bowls, for example those with the workshop stamp of Ianus, bear comparison with Central Gaulish products of the same date:  others are less successful. But the real strength of the Rheinzabern industry lay in its extensive production of good-quality samian cups, beakers, flagons and vases, many imaginatively decorated with barbotine designs or in the 'cut-glass' incised technique.  Ludowici created his own type-series, which sometimes overlaps with those of other sigillata specialists.  Ludowici's types use combinations of upper- and lower-case letters rather than simple numbers, the first letter referring to the general shape, such as 'T' for ''Teller'' (dish).

In general, the products of the East Gaulish industries moved away from the early imperial Mediterranean tradition of intricately profiled dishes and cups, and ornamented bowls made in moulds, and converged with the later Roman local traditions of pottery-making in the northern provinces, using free-thrown, rounded forms and creating relief designs with freehand slip-trailing.  Fashions in fine tablewares were changing.  Some East Gaulish producers made bowls and cups decorated only with rouletted or stamped decoration, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries, [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] ware, decorated with all-over patterns of small stamps, was made in the area east of Rheims and quite widely traded.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, pp. 136–7.  The stamps have been classified in Chenet 1941 and Hübener 1968&lt;/ref&gt;   Argonne ware was essentially still a type of sigillata, and the most characteristic form is a small, sturdy Dr.37 bowl.  Small, localised attempts to make conventional relief-decorated samian ware included a brief and unsuccessful venture at [[Colchester]] in Britain, apparently initiated by potters from the East Gaulish factories at Sinzig, a centre that was itself an offshoot of the Trier workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996. pp. 114–116; Hull 1963; Fischer 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern sigillatas===
In the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, there had been several industries making fine red tablewares with smooth, glossy-slipped surfaces since about the middle of the 2nd century BC, well before the rise of the Italian sigillata workshops.  By the 1st century BC, their forms often paralleled Arretine plain-ware shapes quite closely.  There were evidently centres of production in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]; in western Turkey, exported through [[Ephesos]]; [[Pergamon]]; [[Çandarlı]], near Pergamon; and on [[Cyprus]], but archaeologists often refer to [[eastern sigillata A]] from Northern [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[eastern sigillata B]] from [[Tralles]] in Asia Minor, [[eastern sigillata C]] from ancient [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]], and [[eastern sigillata D]] (or Cypriot sigillata) from Cyprus, as there is still much to be learnt about this material.  While eastern sigillata C is known to come from Çandarli (ancient [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]]), there were likely other workshops in the wider region of [[Pergamon]].&lt;ref&gt;The summary in Hayes 1997, pages 52–59 illustrates the main forms and describes the characteristics of wares.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2nd century AD, when Gaulish samian was completely dominating the markets in the Northern provinces, the eastern sigillatas were themselves beginning to be displaced by the rising importance of African Red Slip wares in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Empire. In the fourth century AD, [[Phocaean red slip]] appears as a successor to Eastern sigillata C.

In the 1980s two primary groups of Eastern Terra Sigillata in the Eastern Mediterranean basin were distinguished as ETS-I and ETS-II based on their chemical fingerprints as shown by analysis by instrumental [[neutron activation analysis]] (INAA).  ETS-I originated in Eastern [[Cyprus]], whereas the ETS-II was probably made in [[Pamphylia]], at [[Perge]], [[Aspendos]] and [[Side, Turkey|Side]]. &lt;!-- "Also the chronology of Eastern Terra Sigillata has changed in the light of the origin of the ETS pottery, i.e. 150 BC – 70 AD (the destruction of Eastern Cyprus and the Temple of Jerusalem." Too incoherent to use – please clarify. what about these dates? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gunneweg, 1980 Ph.D.Thesis, Hebrew University; Gunneweg, Perlman and Yellin, 1983, ''The Provenience, Typology and Chronology of Eastern Terra Sigillata of the eastern Mediterranean'', QEDEM 17, Jerusalem, Ahva Press&lt;/ref&gt;  However this classification has been criticized, and is not universally accepted.

===African red slip ware===
{{main|African red slip ware}}
[[File:Roman pottery African Red Slip.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Late Roman African Red Slip dish, 4th century AD]]
African red slip ware (ARS) was the final development of terra sigillata.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980 are the standard reference works:  Hayes 1997, pp. 59–64 provides a succinct summary.&lt;/ref&gt;   While the products of the Italian and Gaulish red-gloss industries flourished and were exported from their places of manufacture for at most a century or two each, ARS production continued for more than 500 years.  The centres of production were in the Roman provinces of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]], [[Byzacena]] and [[Numidia]]; that is, modern [[Tunisia]] and part of eastern [[Algeria]].  From about the 4th century AD, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including [[Asia Minor]], the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt.   Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics.  Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul),&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1972, p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.
[[File:African Red Slip vessels.JPG|thumb|220px|African Red Slip flagons and vases, 2nd-4th century AD]]
There was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171).  The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56),  were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form.  Decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of [[Christianity]] as well. There is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps.

==Modern pottery==
In contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term ''terra sigillata'' refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary [[ceramic art]], 'terra sigillata' describes only a  watery refined slip used to facilitate the [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing of raw clay surfaces to promote glossy surface effects in low fire techniques, including [[Pit fired pottery|primitive]] and unglazed alternative western-style [[Raku ware|Raku]] firing. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] ceramic techniques.

In 1906 the German potter '''Karl Fischer''' re-invented the method of making terra sigillata of Roman quality and obtained patent protection for this procedure at the ''[[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt|Kaiserliche Patentamt]]'' in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Patent No. 206 395, Class 80b, Group 23; according to: Heinl, Rudolf; ''Die Kunsttöpferfamilie Fischer aus Sulzbach'', Sulzbach-Rosenberg 1984; Patents in the UK, France and the USA are reported in the source, yet without patent-number&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making modern terra sigillata===
Modern terra sigillata is made by allowing the [[clay]] particles to separate into layers by particle size. A [[deflocculant]] such as [[sodium silicate]] is often added to the watery clay/water slip mixture to facilitate separation of fine particle [[flocculation|flocs]] or aggregates. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining larger clay-particle layers are discarded.

Terra sigillata is usually brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then burnished with a soft cloth before the water in the terra sigillata soaks into the porous body or with a hard, smooth-surfaced object . The burnished ware is fired, often to a lower temperature than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900&amp;nbsp;°C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect because the clay particles start to recrystalize.

===Reuse of Roman pottery===
Since the 18th century Samian ware pots have been found in sufficient numbers in the sea near [[Whitstable]] and [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] that local people used them for cooking.&lt;ref name=Canterbury&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canterbury.co.uk/museums/roman-museum/Roman-pottery.aspx |title=Roman pottery |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Visit Canterbury |publisher=canterbury city council |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/archaeology/research/materials/samian/wks-three.aspx |title=Workshop Three: Research Partnerships |last1=Christoph |first1=Rummel|publisher= The University of Nottingham Department of Archaeology |access-date=15 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dance Class''''' is an 1874 painting by [[Edgar Degas]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times - 2 September 2008 - Degas's Ballet Students Teach the Lessons of Their Art"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/dance/03dega.html?pagewanted=all|title=Degas's Ballet Students Teach the Lessons of Their Art|last=[[Alastair Macaulay]]|date=September 2, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Collection Online - The Dance Class - Edgar Degas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/438817?=&amp;imgNo=0&amp;tabName=object-information|title=The Collection Online - The Dance Class - Edgar Degas|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting and its companion work in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris are amongst the most ambitious works by Degas on the theme of ballet. The imaginary scene depicts a dance class being held under the supervision of [[Jules Perrot]], a famous ballet master, in the old Paris Opera, which had actually burnt down the previous year.
The poster on the wall for [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]’s [[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]] is a tribute to the operatic singer [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], who had commissioned the work.

The picture is on view in the Met Museum's Gallery 815.

'''Toyo straw''' is a type of shiny smooth [[straw]] made chiefly in [[Japan]] with [[shellac]]ked [[rice paper]]. This material is commonly used for [[straw hat]]s and [[fedora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toyo |title=toyo |publisher=Merriam-Webster |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These straws are smooth to feel and turn to a shiny, viscose white or a golden copper when the product is finished. Soft to touch and light to wear and normally finished with a plastic glaze. Hats made from Toyo straw are mostly machine-made, and so they are generally sold in the medium to low price range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ultrafino.com/hats/2017/11/types-straws-used-hat-making/|title=Types of Straws Used in Hat Making {{!}} Ultrafino|last=|first=Ultrafino|date=2017-11-30|work=Ultrafino|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|[[Flag of UNESCO]]]]
UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a Commission to study feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = League of Nations | series = Records of the Second Assembly | title = Plenary Meetings | date = 5 September – 5 October 1921 | place = Geneva}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (ICIC) was officially created on 4 January 1922, as a consultative organ composed of individuals elected based on their personal qualifications.  The International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris on 9 August 1925, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC | title = A Chronology of UNESCO: 1945–1987|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000790/079049eb.pdf | place = Paris | date = December 1987 | id = LAD.85/WS/4 Rev | series = UNESDOC database |format= PDF | ref = {{Harvid | UNESCO |1987}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 December 1925, the [[International Bureau of Education]] (IBE) began work as a [[non-governmental]] organization in the service of international educational development.{{Sfn | UNESCO | 1987}}  However, the onset of [[World War II]] largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.

After the signing of the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Declaration of the United Nations]], the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945.  On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR.  This was followed by the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] proposals of 9 October 1944.  Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April–June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1–16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by [[Rab Butler]], the [[Minister of Education]] for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1949/jan/26/the-work-of-unesco  The work of U.N.E.S.C.O. (Hansard, 26 January 1949)].  Millbank systems. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | ref = {{Harvid | Unesco | 1945}} |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001176/117626e.pdf |title= United Nations Conference for the Establishment of an Educational and Cultural Organisation.

The first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Dr. [[Julian Huxley]] to Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114580e.pdf | publisher =UNESCO | year = 1947 | title = General Conference, First Session | place = UNESCO House, Paris, from 20 November to 10 December 1946.

As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the USSR.

Among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential [[The Race Question|statements on race]] starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]) and other scientists in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001269/126969eb.pdf |title = UNESCO.

In 1956, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO claiming that some of the organization's publications amounted to "interference" in the country's "racial problems."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

UNESCO's early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, started in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;The Haiti pilot project: phase one, 1947–1949. (1951). Monographs on Fundamental Education IV. UNESCO: Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;
This project was followed by expert missions to other countries, including, for example, a mission to Afghanistan in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0005/000590/059046eb.pdf |title = Debiesse, J., Benjamin, H. and Abbot, W.

In 1948, UNESCO recommended that Member States should make free primary education compulsory and universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114591e.pdf#xml=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=4CFE6AEC_1_103&amp;hits_rec=1&amp;hits_lng=eng |title=UNESCO.

In 1990, the World Conference on Education for All, in [[Jomtien]], Thailand, launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000975/097551e.pdf |title=UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, and The World Bank.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ten years later, the 2000 [[World Education Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal, led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001211/121147e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESCO's early activities in culture included, for example, the Nubia Campaign, launched in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000419/041943eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The purpose of the campaign was to move the [[Great and Small Temples of Abu Simbel|Great Temple of Abu Simbel]] to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including [[Mohenjo-daro]] (Pakistan), [[Fes]] (Morocco), [[Kathmandu]] (Nepal), [[Borobudur]] (Indonesia) and the [[Acropolis]] (Greece).
The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114044e.pdf |title=Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.

The [[World Heritage Committee]] was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000347/034793eb.pdf |title=UNESCO.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate = 8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001331/133171e.pdf |title=Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

An intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001137/113790e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Item 7 Programme, Resolution 7.2.2.1, p. 9. UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954.

Arid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114593e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

Volume II: Resolutions. (UNESCO: Paris). 2 C/Resolution 3.7, page 23. UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000677/067785eo.pdf |title="Use and conservation of the biosphere: Proceedings of the intergovernmental conference of experts on the scientific basis for rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere.

In the field of communication, the "free flow of ideas by word and image" has been in UNESCO's constitution from its beginnings, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002269/226924e.pdf#page=6|title=Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148006eb.pdf |title=UNESCO. (1955).

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to calls for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000323/032363eb.pdf |title=UNESCO. General Conference, 19th Session. (1977). Approved Programme and budget for 1977–1978. Paris, February 1977. 19 C/5, p. 332, paragraphs 4154 and 4155. UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the 1980 [[MacBride report]] (named after the Chair of the Commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Seán MacBride]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000400/040066eb.pdf |title=MacBride, S.

UNESDOC database |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year, UNESCO created the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/about-ipdc/|title=About IPDC {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/intergovernmental-programmes/ipdc/homepage/|title=International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the [[Windhoek Declaration]] on [[media independence]] and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as [[World Press Freedom Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2016/|title=World Press Freedom Day 2016|website=UNESCO|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] every 3 May. In the lead up to the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in 2003 ([[Geneva]]) and 2005 ([[Tunis]]), UNESCO introduced the [[Information for All Programme]].

UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/general_conference_admits_palestine_as_unesco_member_state/|title=General Conference admits Palestine as UNESCO Member |date = 31 October 2011 |accessdate = 11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8860951/US-withdraws-Unesco-funding-after-it-accepts-Palestinian-membership.html |title = US withdraws Unesco funding after it accepts Palestinian membership |first = Adrian |last=Blomfield |work=The Telegraph |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://opendata.unesco.org UNESCO transparency portal] has been designed to enable public access to information regarding Organization's activities, such as its aggregate budget for a biennium, as well as links to relevant programmatic and financial documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative|IATI]] registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.

There have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the [[Jōmon Venus]] of [[Japan]], the [[Mona Lisa]] of [[France]], the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] of [[Egypt]], [[The Ninth Wave]] of [[Russia]], the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] of [[Turkey]], the [[David (Michelangelo)]] of [[Italy]], the [[Mathura Herakles]] of [[India]], the [[Manunggul Jar]] of the Philippines, the [[Crown of Baekje]] of [[South Korea]], [[The Hay Wain]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Benin Bronzes]] of [[Nigeria]]. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species, such as the [[Komodo Dragon]] of [[Indonesia]], the [[Panda]] of China, the [[Bald eagle]] of [[North America]]n countries, the [[Aye-aye]] of [[Madagascar]], the [[Asiatic Lion]] of [[India]], the [[Kakapo]] of [[New Zealand]], and the [[Mountain tapir]] of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/cairo/culture/tangible-cultural-heritage/|title=Tangible Cultural Heritage - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/114908|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Document - Discovered artifacts under preservation, Archaeological Site, 18 Hoang Dieu street|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
UNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.

''The UNESCO Courier'' magazine states its mission to "promote UNESCO’s ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate." Since March 2006 it is available online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/archives|title=Archives|website = The UNESCO Courier|publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review ''Impact of Science on Society'' (also known as ''Impact'') to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/education/nfsunesco/brochure/E29.PDF |title = Science and Technology Education|publisher = UNESCO |date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO also published museum international quarterly from the year 1948.

==Official UNESCO NGOs==
UNESCO has official relations with 322 [[international non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |title=Quoted on UNESCO official site |publisher=Ngo-db.unesco.org |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625221827/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/s/or/en |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are what UNESCO calls "operational"; a select few are "formal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35293&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Full list of NGOs that have official relations with UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing bodies==

===Director-General===
There has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.

The Director-Generals of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Director-Generals since inception, women have held the position only twice. [[Qatar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Iran]] are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The [[ASEAN]] bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Madagascar]] are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.

The list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO official site: [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/directors-general/ Directors-General]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offices and Headquarters==
[[File:April 2010, UNESCO Headquarters in Paris - The Garden of Peace (or Japanese Garden) in Spring.jpg|thumb|The Garden of Peace, UNESCO headquarters, Paris.

==Controversies==

===New World Information and Communication order===
UNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a "[[New World Information and Communication Order]]" and its [[MacBride report]] calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb [[freedom of the press]].  UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grahm |first=S. E. |date= April 2006 |title= The (Real)politiks of Culture: U.S. Cultural Diplomacy in UNESCO, 1946–1954 |journal=Diplomatic History |volume= 30 |issue=2 |pages=231–51 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00548.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A4079804/AONE?u=tamp44898&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ef6d5640 | title = UNESCO asks states considering withdrawal to 'reconsider their position' | journal = [[UN Chronicle (journal)|UN Chronicle]] | date = January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19841228&amp;id=Y5srAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qPoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5684,5359479 | title = Singapore to withdraw from UNESCO | newspaper = [[The Telegraph (newspaper)|The Telegraph]] | date = 28 December 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/UNESCO | title = UNESCO | website = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = 14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[Israel]] was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since 1949.
In 2010, Israel designated the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], [[Hebron]] and [[Rachel's Tomb]], [[Bethlehem]] as [[List of National Heritage Sites of Israel|National Heritage Sites]] and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the United States and protests from Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hebron clashes over Israel's West Bank heritage list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538948.stm|date=26 February 2010|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, UNESCO's Executive Board voted to declare the sites as "al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs" and "Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb" and stated that they were "an integral part of the [[occupied Palestinian Territories]]" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/executive_board_adopts_five_decisions_concerning_unescos_work_in_the_occupied_palestinian_and_arab_territories/|title=Executive Board adopts five decisions concerning UNESCO's work in the occupied Palestinian and Arab Territories|date=21 October 2010|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNESCO described the sites as significant to "people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE TWO PALESTINIAN SITES OF AL-HARAM AL-IBRAHIMI/TOMB OF THE PATRIARCHS IN AL-KHALIL/HEBRON AND THE BILAL BIN RABAH MOSQUE/RACHEL'S TOMB IN BETHLEHEM|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001873/187356e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Israel in turn accused UNESCO of "detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage", and accused it of being politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140377 |title=UNESCO Erases Israeli Protests from Rachel's Tomb Protocol |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Arutz Sheva |author=Hillel Fendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Shmuel Rabinovitch|Rabbi of the Western Wall]] claimed that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/140345|title=UN Org.: Rachel's Tomb is a Mosque |date=29 October 2010|publisher=Arutz Sheva|author=Maayana Miskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] declared that the resolution was a "part of Palestinian escalation".
[[Zevulun Orlev]], chairman of the [[Knesset]] Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=193893 |title=Ayalon: Israel will no longer cooperate with UNESCO |date=3 November 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalom |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=194090 |title=Cooperation with UNESCO only partially suspended |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at [[Jordan]]'s insistence, censured{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the [[Mughrabi-Bridge|Mughrabi Gate]] Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088221,00.html |title=UNESCO censures Israel over Mughrabi Bridge – Israel News, Ynetnews |work=Ynetnews |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]], "indefinitely postponed" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] entitled "The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel|Jewish people and the Land of Israel]]." The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would "harm the [[Arab-Israeli peace process|peace process]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Lazar|title=UNESCO cancels event on Jewish ties to Land of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-cancels-event-on-jewish-ties-to-land-of-israel/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the exhibition, Professor [[Robert Wistrich]] of the [[Hebrew University]]'s [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism]], called the cancellation an "appalling act," and characterized Bokova's decision as "an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history." UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Author of UNESCO's nixed Israel exhibit decries 'appalling betrayal'|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/author-of-unescos-nixed-israel-exhibit-decries-appalling-betrayal|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupied Palestine Resolution====
{{Main article|Occupied Palestine Resolution}}
On 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for "aggressions" by Israeli police and soldiers and "illegal measures" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO adopts anti-Israel resolution on al-Aqsa Mosque|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-adopts-anti-israel-resolution-al-aqsa-mosque-161018120610946.html|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the text acknowledged the "importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name "Al-Haram al-Sharif", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words "Temple Mount" or "Har HaBayit," stating that it [[Temple denial|denies Jewish ties to the key holy site]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002462/246215e.pdf |title=Commission report|website=unesdoc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Ayelet Shaked]], Israel froze all ties with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4866113,00.html|title=UNESCO fails to acknowledge Jewish ties to Temple Mount|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-leads-angry-denunciations-of-absurd-unesco-decision/|title=Netanyahu leads angry denunciations of ‘absurd’ UNESCO decision|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was condemned by [[Ban ki-Moon]] and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and "to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =  UNESCO chief ‘received death threats’ for opposing Jerusalem motion|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/unesco-chief-received-death-threats-for-opposing-jerusalem-motion/|date = 17 October 2016|work= Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/statement_by_the_director_general_of_unesco_on_the_old_city-1/#.WAQnmeUrLb3|title=Statement by the Director-General of UNESCO on the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls on the occasion of the 40th session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO in Istanbul - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Aqsa Mosque is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.747466|title=UNESCO Director Criticizes Resolution: Temple Mount Sacred to Both Jews, Muslims|work=Haaretz|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a "hateful [[anti-Israel]] sentiment",&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/czech-mps-slam-hateful-unesco-jerusalem-resolution/|title=Czech MPs slam ‘hateful’ UNESCO Jerusalem resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt; On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous "refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO approves new Jerusalem resolution|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/unesco-approves-anti-israel-resolution-jerusalem-161026173149575.html|work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Peter|title=Unesco adopts controversial resolution on Jerusalem holy sites|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/unesco-adopts-controversial-resolution-on-jerusalem-holy-sites-israel|work=The Guardian|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: "This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO resolution on Jerusalem holy sites draws criticism from U.S., Israel|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unesco-resolution-holy-sites-un-1.3821919|work=CBC/Radio-Canada|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm|title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|last2=Erlangeroct|first2=Steven|title=U.S. Will Withdraw From Unesco, Citing Its ‘Anti-Israel Bias’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|agency=The New York Times|date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===

====Palestinian youth magazine controversy====
In February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role-models as [[Adolf Hitler]]. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8975423/Unesco-cuts-funding-for-Palestinian-youth-magazine-over-Hitler-praise.html |title=Unesco cuts funding for Palestinian youth magazine over Hitler praise |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic University of Gaza controversy====
In 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the [[Islamic University of Gaza]] in the field of [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], and [[space science]]s,&lt;ref name="UNESCOIslamicUniversity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/en/university-twinning-and-networking/access-by-region/arab-states/palestine/unesco-chair-in-astronomy-astrophysics-and-space-sciences-964/ | title=UNESCO Chair in Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Sciences (964), established in 2012 at The Islamic University of Gaza (Palestine). | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fueling controversy and criticism. [[Israel]] bombed the school in 2008 claiming they develop and store weapons there, a claim Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's move.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=OsM94e1GHxAC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=destruction+caused+at+the+Islamic+University&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX1IWTmuzWAhXn54MKHT7JAGQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=destruction%20caused%20at%20the%20Islamic%20University&amp;f=false The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict] By Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner and Philip Weiss (2011).

===Wikileaks===
On 16 and 17 February 2012, UNESCO held a conference entitled "The Media World after [[WikiLeaks]] and [[News of the World]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_journalism_in_a_digital_world/ |title=News journalism in a digital world |publisher=UNESCO |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all six panels being focused on WikiLeaks, no member of WikiLeaks staff was invited to speak. After receiving a complaint from WikiLeaks spokesman [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]], UNESCO invited him to attend, but did not offer a place on any panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://issuu.com/unesconow/docs/unescoleaks_to_refute_wikileaks_accusations |title=UNESCO-leaks to refute wikileaks accusation| publisher=UNESCO | date=16 February 2012 | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer also came only a week before the conference, which was held in Paris, France. Many of the speakers featured, including [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and [[Heather Brooke]], had spoken out openly against WikiLeaks and its founder [[Julian Assange]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/mar2011/wiki-m10.shtml |title=The Guardian's hatchet job on Julian Assange |publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]] |date=10 March 2011 |access-date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks released a press statement on 15 February 2012 denouncing UNESCO which stated, "UNESCO has made itself an international human rights joke. To use 'freedom of expression' to censor WikiLeaks from a conference about WikiLeaks is an Orwellian absurdity beyond words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-denounces-UNESCO-after.html |title=WikiLeaks denounces UNESCO after WikiLeaks banned from UNESCO conference on WikiLeaks |publisher=WikiLeaks |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Che Guevara===
In 2013, UNESCO announced that the collection "The Life and Works of Ernesto [[Che Guevara]]" became part of the [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]]. [[United States Congress|US Congresswoman]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] condemned this decision, saying that the organization acts against its own ideals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-release/unesco-once-again-makes-mockery-its-own-ideals-glorifying-mass-murderer-che-guevara | type = press release | title = UNESCO Once Again Makes a Mockery of its Own Ideals by Glorifying Mass Murderer Che Guevara, Says Ros-Lehtinen | publisher = House of representatives | date = 22 July 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|This decision is more than an insult to the families of those Cubans who were lined up and [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by Che and his merciless cronies but it also serves as a direct contradiction to the UNESCO ideals of encouraging peace and universal respect for human rights.}}

[[UN Watch]] also condemned this selection by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwatch.org/unesco-honors-executioner-che-guevara/  UNESCO honors executioner Che Guevara], ''UN Watch'', 21 July 2013 (retrieved 11 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listing Nanjing Massacre documents===
In 2015, [[Japan]] threatened to halt funding for UNESCO over the organization's decision to include documents relating to the 1937 [[Nanjing massacre]] in the latest listing for its "Memory of the World" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/japan-furious-at-unesco-listing-nanjing-massacre-documents/a-18790477|title=Japan furious at UNESCO listing Nanjing Massacre documents - Asia - DW.COM - 19.10.2015|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan halts Unesco funding following Nanjing massacre row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/japan-halts-unesco-funding-nanjing-massacre-row|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US withdrawals===
After withdrawing from UNESCO in 1984, the United States rejoined January 10, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/europe-and-north-america/united-states-of-america/|title=United States of America - United Nations Educational Scientific Cooperation Organization|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Leach]] stated before a Congressional subcommittee:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher = Library of Congress | series = Congressional subcommittee on International operations | date = September 19, 1989 | title = Expert Witness Statement transcript}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |The reasons for the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 1984 are well-known; my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted to radicalize UNESCO, and the calls of others who wanted the United States to lead in emasculating the UN system. The fact is UNESCO is one of the least dangerous international institutions ever created. While some member countries within UNESCO attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to the values of the west, and engage in Israel bashing, UNESCO itself never adopted such radical postures. The U.S. opted for empty-chair diplomacy, after winning, not losing, the battles we engaged in…  It was nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.}}

He concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before the UNESCO withdrawal, a withdrawal from the [[IAEA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?9189-1/united-states-unesco-part-1|title=United States &amp; UNESCO Part 1, Sep 19 1989 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been pushed on him. The United States rejoined UNESCO shortly thereafter.

On 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 December 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019. The [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] cited "mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm |title=The United States Withdraws From UNESCO| publisher =U.S. Department of State |access-date= 2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has not paid its $80 million annual UNESCO dues since Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the US were among only 14 votes against the membership, of 194 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S., Israel quit UNESCO over alleged bias |author=John Irish| publisher=Globe and Mail |date=October 13, 2017 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish–Kurdish conflict===
On May 25, 2016, the noted Turkish poet and human rights activist [[O. Z. Livaneli|Zülfü Livaneli]] resigned as [[Turkey]]’s only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights situation in Turkey]] and destruction of historical [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]] district of [[Diyarbakır|Diyarbakir]], the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|fighting]] between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: "To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights-abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA Turkish writer quits UNESCO to protest damage to heritage, rights abuse]".

===Information processing tools===
UNESCO develops, maintains and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1542&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150108023105/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D1542%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2015-01-08 |title= Information Processing Tools |publisher= Unesco }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CDS/ISIS – a generalised information storage and retrieval system. The Windows version may run on a single computer or in a local area network. The JavaISIS client/server components allow remote database management over the Internet and are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. Furthermore, GenISIS allows the user to produce HTML Web forms for CDS/ISIS database searching. The ISIS_DLL provides an API for developing CDS/ISIS based applications.
* OpenIDAMS – a software package for processing and analysing numerical data developed, maintained and disseminated by UNESCO. The original package was proprietary but UNESCO has initiated a project to provide it as open-source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15653&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150113175706/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php%2DURL_ID%3D15653%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2015-01-13 |title= OpenIDAMS |publisher= Unesco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Animation (WIA)''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] with the purpose of furthering, promoting, and supporting female animators in the art, science and business of [[animation]].  WIA has chapters in [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]], [[Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wiaireland.com/|title = WIA Ireland|date = |accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Women in Animation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pune]], and [[Toronto]]. WIA feels that the lack of an equal number of women and men in the animation profession is because "there has been very little work to intentionally change the [[status quo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/women-in-animation-offers-dismal-stats-on-current-state-of-affairs-proposes-paths-toward-progress-20150619|title = Women in Animation Offers Dismal Stats on Current State of Affairs, Proposes Paths toward Progress|date = 19 June 2015|accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Indiewire|publisher = |last = Kang|first = Inkoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to help women enter the animation profession, WIA has created a mentorship program,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://variety.com/2014/artisans/features/women-in-animation-seeks-members-from-toons-to-vfx-to-games-1201323027/|title = Women in Animation Seeks Members From Toons, VFX, Games|last = Torrelio|first = Sebastian|date = 7 October 2014|work = Variety|access-date = 16 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a voice over group, a scholarship, talks, and events.

== History ==
WIA was formed in 1993 by producer and journalist Rita Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://summit.kidscreen.com/2015/speakers/884499/ritastreet/ Speaker, Kidscreen Summit 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.2/articles1.2/simensky1.2.html|title = Women in the Animation Industry - Some Thoughts|date = 1996|accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Animation World Network|publisher = |last = Simensky|first = Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllis Craig was one of the founding members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://variety.com/2015/scene/news/women-in-animation-awards-its-2015-scholarship-1201568132/|title = Harvard Undergrad Receives Scholarship From 105-Year-Old Women in Animation Vet|last = Flores|first = Terry|date = 11 August 2015|work = Variety|access-date = 16 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; WIA created a scholarship to honor Craig after her death in 1997.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dean and Scanlan took over as co-presidents of WIA in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since 2013, the membership of WIA has increased from 120 to 800 active members in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/on-the-upswing/|title = On the Upswing|date = 9 January 2015|accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Animation Magazine|publisher = |last = McLean|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender Disparity in Animation Industry ==
Although female animators have come a long way from the time when Disney sent out rejection letters stating “Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men”, the climate shift within the animation industry is progressing very slowly. Back in the days, women were mostly employed as inkers by Disney, it wasn’t until 1941with the outbreak of war, that Disney started training females technically in animation to maintain a pool of worker while the men have all gone to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8978351/famous-rejection-letters-disney-animator-women|title=Read the rejection letters Disney used to send any woman who wanted to be an animator|last=Noriega|first=Margarita|date=July 16, 2015|website=Vox|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today according to Los Angeles Magazine, 70% of animation students from CalArts Valencia campus are female, 66% of animation students from UCLA and 55% of animation students from USC are all female. Despite the rapidly growing female population studying animation, industry statistics still reflect poorly and far from achieving gender parity&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamag.com/mag-features/female-animators/|title=These Female Animators are Redrawing an Industry’s Gender Lines|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=August 18, 2017|website=Los Angeles Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839|Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839]], is a union representing over 4000 animation artists, writers and technician in Los Angeles. Based on its data, in 2015, 20.6% of Guild workers were women, the number increased to 23.2% in 2016, and finally hit the quarter milestone 25.6% in 2018. While there appears to be uprising number of female professionals in the industry, a closer look into 2015 statistics in key areas of animation shows only 1% of women were art directors, 3% were directors and 5% were writers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2015/04/animation-jobs-held-by-women.html|title=Animation Jobs Held By Women|last=Hulett|first=Steve|date=April 14, 2015|website=The Animation Guild|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With the discouraging disparity, Women in Animation, has initiated the movement “50/50 by 2025”. The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], another non-profit devoted to research in gender representation in Media constantly keep tracks of the number of female characters in animated films&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Hopefully with continue efforts the animation industry will soon close the gender disparity gap and give young talented female animators the opportunities they deserve.

== Events  ==
WIA has hosted over 100 events. Examples of some of the events hosted by WIA include: "WIA Conversations"  ([[Tara Strong]] gave this talk on Nov. 19, 2015), "Voices in the Room", "The WIA Mentorship Experience", as well as many other kinds of events and talks. WIA also has hosted movie screenings, panels, workshops, and "Monthly Networking Mixers".

In 2014, WIA kicked off its first mentoring program, which was open to members of WIA in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/women-in-amination-to-launch-mentorship-program-1201266120/|title = Women in Animation to Launch Mentorship Program|last = Holman|first = Jordyn|date = 21 July 2014|work = Variety|access-date = 16 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentoring program has continued into the present. The program is intended to help mentees have greater "industry knowledge and access to information through relationships with experienced professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/one-week-left-to-apply-for-wia-mentorship/|title = One Week Left to Apply for WIA Mentorship|date = 4 September 2015|accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Animation Magazine|publisher = |last = Milligan|first = Mercedes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WIA hosts various activities and efforts aimed at raising awareness of women in the animation industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2015, WIA hosted a panel on women in animation, presenting such statistics as while 60% of students studying animation in several [[Los Angeles]] animation schools are women, only 20% of working animators are content creators, rather than support staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On November 22, 2015, WIA had a booth and a talk at CTN. People interested in WIA signed their names on a huge poster featuring their logo behind their booth. [[Floyd Norman]] also showed his support for WIA by signing his name on the poster. The subject of the discussion of the talk at CTN was “50/50 by 2025” (#5050by2025) which discussed the subject of getting the ratio of female to male animators working in the industry to 50% (equal) by the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/women-in-animation-takes-on-industry-parity-1201621608/|title = Women in Animation Org Launches Gender Equality Initiative|last = Flores|first = Terry|date = 20 October 2015|work = Variety|access-date = 16 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another goal of 50/50 by 2025 is to "bring about more varied and positive representations on screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.themarysue.com/women-in-animation-2025/|title = Women in Animation Discusses Ways to Remedy Lack of Women in Their Field|date = 19 June 2015|accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = The Mary Sue|publisher = |last = Jao|first = Charline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Phyllis Craig Scholarship Fund (PCSF) ==
Phyllis Craig was the founding member of WIA. Her death inspired the creation of an annual $1,000 scholarship fund in her honor.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.womeninanimation.org/#!phyllis-craig-scholarship/c1ivg|title = Phyllis Craig Scholarship|date = |accessdate = 16 December 2015|website = Women in Animation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig was, “... known throughout the animation industry for her commitment to young people interested in learning the art and techniques of animation".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The deadline for the scholarship is April 29, of each year (Craig's birthday).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">The '''Yuan Center of Art''' ({{zh|北京元艺术中心}}) is a multifunctional arts center and gallery located in the [[Haidian District|Haidian]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The center houses four large exhibition halls for visual art, an experimental theatre, conference and symposia spaces, and a restaurant. The design concept of the building integrates the elements of architectural [[minimalism]] with a traditional Chinese construction pattern called “jiugongge”.  A recent show, entitled ''After Culture: An Exhibition of Contemporary Chinese Painting'', featured the work of several major Chinese artists, including [[Ma Kelu]], [[Shang Yang]], [[Ma Lu]], [[Ding Fang]], and [[Peng Si]]. It was curated by [[Peng Feng]], the prominent art critic and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchhouseforasianart.org/scholars.html Western and Chinese Scholars], Research House for Asian Art, Peking University&lt;/ref&gt; who also serves on the Yuan Center's directorial board.

A leading exhibitor of contemporary [[Chinese art]], the Yuan Center is located near the center of Beijing, unlike the [[798 Art Zone]] in outlying [[Dashanzi]].
