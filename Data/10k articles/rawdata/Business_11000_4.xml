'''Area codes 213 and 323''' are [[California]] [[telephone]] [[area code]]s in the [[North American Numbering Plan]]. They contain, roughly, the area of central [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. 213/323 also includes several gateway cities of the region, including [[Bell, California|Bell]] and [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]]. Before being reunited in an overlay in 2017, they had been separate area codes since 1998, with 213 containing downtown Los Angeles and its immediately adjoining neighborhoods, with 323 containing the rest of the area.

==History==
===1998–2017: Separate areas===
Area code 213 was one of the three original area codes assigned to California in 1947. It initially covered the southern third of the state from the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] to the [[United States-Mexico border|Mexican border]]. The numbering plan area was extended to the north in 1950, requiring the southern portion of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], including [[Bakersfield]], to change over from [[area code 415]].{{Citation needed|date = June 2016}}

As a result of southern California's rapid expansion during the second half of the 20th century, 213 has been split on numerous occasions.  The first area split became necessary in 1951, when most of the southern and eastern portion, including [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and [[San Diego]], was assigned [[area code 714]]. In 1957, 213 was restricted to [[Los Angeles County]], with most of the old 213's northern and western portion becoming [[area code 805]]. In 1984, the [[San Fernando Valley]] and the [[San Gabriel Valley]] became [[area code 818]], thus making Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the US to be split between two area codes (New York City was split between [[area code 212|212]] and [[area code 718|718]] the same year). In 1991, [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|West Los Angeles]] and the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] became [[area code 310]]. 

The 323 area code was created in 1998 as yet another split of 213.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M165/K075/165075193.PDF|title=CPUC Provides For More Phone Numbers in 323 Area Code|last=Prosper|first=Terry|date=July 14, 2016|website=[[California Public Utilities Commission]] website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When 213 was divided, it kept Los Angeles exchanges 1, 7 and 10, while exchanges 2 through 6, 8, 9, and 11 through 14 went to 323. This split made 213 one of the smallest area codes in the nation, covering only [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and its immediately adjoining neighborhoods, such as [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]]. Completely surrounding 213, 323 covered most of the remainder of central Los Angeles, including Hollywood, as well as several neighboring cities, including [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]] and [[Montebello, California|Montebello]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/general.aspx?id=1163|title=323 Area Code|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=[[California Public Utilities Commission]] website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2017: Overlay codes===
Despite Southern California's continued rapid growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, 213 was not projected to exhaust until 2050. In contrast, 323 was projected to exhaust in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since 213 still had an abundance of numbers available, and rather than add yet another area code to California's 30+ area codes already in service, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] approved a plan that "erased" the 213-323 boundary, converting them into [[overlay plan|overlay]] area codes for all of central Los Angeles. Since this change went into full effect on July 8, 2017, telephone companies have been able to assign any available 213 numbers in the former 323 area and vice versa, and customers with 213 or 323 phone numbers have been required to dial the area code even to call other 213 or 323 numbers (10/11-digit dialing), even for a number next door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/NRUF/April_2015_NPA_Exhaust_Projections.pdf Nanpa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M156/K071/156071980.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; This change returned 213 to some areas that had used it for more than half a century prior to 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
An American hip-hop [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] from [[Long Beach, California]] consisting of [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Warren G]], and [[Nate Dogg]] was called [[213 (group)|213]], based on the area code.

Area code 213 is referenced in [[Warren G]] and [[Nate Dogg]]'s song "[[Regulate (song)|Regulate]]", [[Dr. Dre]]'s "[[Still D.R.E.]]", the [[Electric Six]] song "I'm the Bomb", [[LL Cool J]]'s song "Going Back to Cali", [[Whitney Houston]]'s song "[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]", and [[Eminem]]'s "[[Shake That]]". It is also referenced in "Area Codes" by Ludacris featuring Nate Dogg.

The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] mascot, Chuck the [[California condor|Condor]], has the jersey number 213.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/la-clippers-new-mascot-chuck-20000-chuck-taylor-giveaway LA Clippers Introduce New MascottXX Chuck]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Business Intelligence Competency Center''' (BICC) is a cross-functional organizational team that has defined tasks, roles, responsibilities and processes for supporting and promoting the effective use of [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) across an organization.

[[Gartner]] started advocating that companies need a BICC to develop and focus resources to be successful using business intelligence in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, K. H., Hostmann, B.  (22 July 2003), BI Competency Center Is Core to BI Success, Gartner Research&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the BICC concept has been further refined through practical implementations in organizations that have implemented BI and analytical software.

In practice, the term "BICC" is not well integrated into the nomenclature of business or public sector organizations and there are a large degree of variances in the organizational design for BICCs.  Nevertheless, the popularity of the BICC concept has caused the creation of units that focus on ensuring the use of the information for decision-making from BI software and increasing the [[return on investment]]  (ROI) of BI.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G., Queisser, T (2008), The Modern BI Organization, Heidelberg, MaxMetrics GmbH&lt;/ref&gt;

A BICC coordinates the activities and resources to ensure that a fact-based approach to decision making is systematically implemented throughout an organization.  It has responsibility for the governance structure for BI and analytical programs, projects, practices, software, and architecture. It is responsible for building the plans, priorities, infrastructure, and competencies that the organization needs to take forward-looking strategic decisions by using the BI and analytical software capabilities.

A BICC’s influence transcends that of a typical business unit, playing a crucial central role in the organizational change and strategic process.  Accordingly, the BICC’s purpose is to empower the entire organization to coordinate BI from all units.  Through centralization, it "…ensures that information and best practices are communicated and shared through the entire organization so that everyone can benefit from successes and lessons learned."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G., Bräutigam, B, &amp; Gerlach, S. (2006). Business Intelligence Competency Centers:  A Team Approach to Competitive Advantage. Hoboken: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

The BICC also plays an important organizational role facilitating interaction among the various cultures and units within the organization.  Knowledge transfer, enhancement of analytic skills, coaching and training are central to the mandate of the BICC.  A BICC should be pivotal in ensuring a high degree of information consumption and a ROI for BI.

'''Business Intelligence Competency Centers in U.S. Healthcare'''

Next to the U.S. government, the American [[healthcare industry]] generates the second largest amount of information every year. However, despite having complex information management needs, a KLAS report revealed that one-third of healthcare organizations do not have the appropriate business intelligence tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashrafi|first1=N|title=The impact of business intelligence on healthcare delivery in the USA.|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management|date=2014|volume=9|pages=117–130|url=http:// www.ijikm.org/Volume9/IJIKMv9p117-130Ashrafi0761.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since finance and energy industries have successfully implemented business intelligence competency centers (BICCs) and have produced financial returns on their investment and accelerated decision-making speed, the healthcare industry is initiating use of BICCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business analytics returns $13.01 for every dollar spent, up from $10.66 three years ago, Nucleus Research finds.|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-analytics-returns-13-01-151800882.html|publisher=Nucleus Research|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a business intelligence competency center in healthcare involves prioritizing information needs, creating data governance structures, identifying data stewards to provide data quality assurance, establishing ongoing education programs, and defining predictive modeling, analytics, data warehouse, and cloud storage tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=B.|title=Creating a Business Intelligence Competency Center to Accelerate Healthcare Performance Improvement|url=http://www.beaconpartners.com/resources/topic/white-paper|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153145/http://www.beaconpartners.com/resources/topic/white-paper|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skills Needed'''

Information technology specialists in SQL design, relational databases, programming, reporting software, and analytics can provide the necessary technical information management skills. Data stewards, such as data analysts and scientists, understand the creation, capture, storage, and access processes needed to ensure high quality data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=B.|title=Why do Healthcare Organizations Need a Business Intelligence Competency Center?|url=http://www.beaconpartners.com/blog/why-healthcare-organizations-need-a-business-intelligence-competency-center-0|publisher=Beacon Partners|accessdate=16 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153322/http://www.beaconpartners.com/blog/why-healthcare-organizations-need-a-business-intelligence-competency-center-0|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytics Competency Center (ACC) ==

In recent years  knowledge-oriented shared service centres with primary focus on offering analytics and data mining as an internal service across the organization have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=H.J.|date=2015|title=How Big Data Applicaton are Revolutionizing Decision Making|url=|journal=International Journal of Database Theory &amp; Application|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These centres are often referred to as Analytics Competency Center (ACC), Analytics Center of Excellence, Analytics Service Center, Big Data CoC or Big Data Lab. It is predicated, that by the end of 2017 already a quarter of all large firms will have such a dedicated unit for data and analytics &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3645332?srcId=1-6595640781|title=Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2017: A Gartner Trend Insight Report|last=Cearley|first=David|date=2017|work=Gartner|access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to classic BICC these centres do not place emphasis on reporting, historical analysis and dashboards. While BICC usually create enterprise-wide data marts and warehouses to establish a foundation for trusted information,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/big-data-analytics-and-the-path-from-insights-to-value/|title=Big Data, Analytics and the Path From Insights to Value|work=MIT Sloan Management Review|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ACC follows a more strategic objective.

[[File:Cbs-studio.jpg|thumb|250px|Current CBS Studio Building]]
The '''CBS Studio Building''' is a seven-story office building at 49 East [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], New York City. It has had various uses at different times, including serving as a [[Vanderbilt family]] guest house, the first graduate school of the [[Juilliard School]], [[CBS Radio]] studios, and [[Columbia Records]] studio.

It is currently owned by the [[Fisher Brothers]], who converted it to an office building in conjunction with construction of the 45-story Park Avenue Plaza to its east.

==Vanderbilts==
It was built in 1908 as a guest house for the Vanderbilts who had a home a block away at [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)]] and 52nd. It was designed by [[Warren &amp; Wetmore]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;Gray, Christopher, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/realestate/streetscapes-cbs-studio-on-52d-at-one-time-the-last-word-in-broadcasting-design.html?pagewanted=1 "STREETSCAPES: CBS Studio on 52d; At One Time, the 'Last Word in Broadcasting Design'"], ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Juilliard==
In 1924 the Vanderbilts sold it to the Juilliard Musical Foundation where it became Juilliard's first graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiciansgallery.com/start/youth/schools/juilliard/school.htm The Juilliard School: A Brief History]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CBS Radio==
In 1939, [[CBS]], which had its corporate headquarters around the corner at 485 Madison Avenue, bought the building at 49 East 52nd Street, to move its radio operations, except for the main network newsroom.

Architects [[Fellheimer &amp; Wagner]] extensively renovated the building—including eliminating the earlier Vanderbilt ornate external features and eliminating windows for soundproofing—and carved up the building into seven studios, including one which could accommodate audiences of 300 as well as symphony orchestras that could broadcast. [[Arthur Godfrey]] broadcast from Studio 21 in the building and had his main office there.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com" /&gt; From 1974 until 1982, "CBS Radio Mystery Theatre" originated in Studio 27, renamed Studio G in honor of [[Arthur Godfrey]].

==Columbia Records==
With the advent of television, large radio studios that could accommodate audiences were no longer needed. The facility became recording studios for [[Columbia Records]].  [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Laura Nyro]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartofsound.net/images/aos_images/beechwoods/LauraThousandMikes.jpg] Laura Nyro at the Columbia 49 E. 52nd Street studio&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Bob Dylan]] (in spring 1970 for part of his [[New Morning]] album),&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Heylin|Heylin, Clinton]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=c9d62SgEJpkC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions 1960-94'']. Penguin. UK; St Martin’s Press, US, 1995. {{ISBN|0-312-13439-8}}. Cf. p.84 on use of Studio B and Studio E in New York City in 1970 which were at the Columbia Studio Building.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Simon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] recorded music there.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com" /&gt;

The facility contained Columbia's "Studio B" on the second floor and "Studio E" on the sixth floor.&lt;ref name="SIMONS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=David|title=Studio Stories - How the Great New York Records Were Made | location = San Francisco | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uEmmAK1qjbYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisher Brothers==
In 1965 CBS sold its 485 Madison Avenue headquarters building as well as the 49 East 52nd Street studios and moved to a new office tower two blocks west at 51 West 52nd Street in the
[[CBS Headquarters Building]]. Radio operations moved to the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] at 524 West 57th Street.

In 1979 the Fisher Brothers acquired the building in conjunction with construction of the Park Avenue Plaza building to its east. In 1988 the building was leased to Sony. A [[Duane Reade]] store opened on the ground level and second floor. For several years CBS used studio space as offices. In 1995 Fisher undid the 1930s Art Moderne style, replacing the windows and restoring the building to its original Vanderbilt appearance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35582">{{Community}}
A '''community of practice''' ('''CoP''') is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.

A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

CoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a "virtual community of practice" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dubé|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards and newsgroups, or a "mobile community of practice" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.

Communities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the "[[community of inquiry]]" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.

== Overview ==

===Origin and development===
Since the publication of "Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.

====Early years====
To understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].

The structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.

Lave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term "community of practice" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

====Later years====
In his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].

He describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72–73}}.

* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.
* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.
* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.

====Present work====
For [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger’s more recent work is on learning as social participation – the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.

The structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.

; Domain
:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.

; Community
:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.

; Practice
:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.

In many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.

An important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: 
* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees
* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries
* Reducing rework and preventing "reinvention of the wheel"
* Spawning new ideas for products and services

== Examples ==

The communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.

Lave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucatán midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).

A famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.

===Compared to functional or project teams===
Collaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.

A [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. 
* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.
* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.
* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.
* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.

By contrast,
* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.
* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.
* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.

===Versus communities of interest===
In addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).

'''Community of interest'''
* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.
* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.
* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.
* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise – one only needs to be interested in the subject.

'''Community of practice'''
* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.
* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.
* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.
* Membership is dependent on expertise – one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.
* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.

== Benefits ==

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] – especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.

=== Knowledge management ===
{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: "knowledge as object", "knowledge embedded within individuals", and "knowledge embedded in a community".&lt;ref&gt;Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). ""It is what one does": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155–173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit "expertise", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.

Because [[knowledge management]] is seen "primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].

Thus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.

== Factors ==

===Individuals===
Members of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.

Studies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database)  {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless  {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.

As members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.

====Social presence====
Communicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as "the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship" (p.&amp;nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.

====Motivation====
Motivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).

====Collaboration====
Collaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.

== Cultivating successful CoPs ==
{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}

What makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:

# Design the community to evolve naturally – Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.
# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives – While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.
# Welcome and allow different levels of participation – Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.
# Develop both public and private community spaces – While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.
# Focus on the value of the community – CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.
# Combine familiarity and excitement – CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.
# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community – CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.

{{Taxation}}
A '''corporate tax''', also called '''corporation tax''' or '''company tax''', is a [[direct tax]]* imposed by a jurisdiction on the income or capital of corporations or analogous legal entities. Many countries impose such taxes at the national level, and a similar tax may be imposed at state or local levels. The taxes may also be referred to as [[income tax]] or [[capital tax]]. [[Partnership]]s are generally not taxed at the entity level. A country's corporate tax may apply to:
* [[Incorporation (business)|corporations incorporated]] in the country,
* corporations doing business in the country on income from that country,
* foreign corporations who have a [[permanent establishment]] in the country, or 
* corporations deemed to be [[tax residence|resident for tax purposes]] in the country.

Company income subject to tax is often determined much like taxable income for individual taxpayers. Generally, the tax is imposed on net profits. In some jurisdictions, rules for taxing companies may differ significantly from rules for taxing individuals. Certain corporate acts, like reorganizations, may not be taxed. Some types of entities may be exempt from tax.

Countries may tax corporations on its net profit and may also tax shareholders when the corporation pays a [[dividend]]. Where dividends are taxed, a corporation may be required to [[withholding tax|withhold tax]] before the dividend is distributed.

Economists disagree as to how much of the burden of the corporate tax falls on owners, workers consumers and landowners, and how the corporate tax affects economic growth and economic inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://microeconomicinsights.org/benefits-corporate-tax-cuts-evidence-local-us-labour-markets/|title=Who benefits from corporate tax cuts? Evidence from local US labour markets {{!}} Microeconomic Insights|date=2017-11-02|work=Microeconomic Insights|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note:*Considered indirect because the cost of the tax can transferred to the consumer.

==Legal framework==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
A corporate tax is a tax imposed on the net profit of a corporation that are taxed at the entity level in a particular jurisdiction. Net profit for corporate tax is generally the financial statement net profit with modifications, and may be defined in great detail within each country's tax system. Such taxes may include income or other taxes. The tax systems of most countries impose an [[income tax]] at the entity level on certain type(s) of entities (company or [[corporation]]). The rate of tax varies by jurisdiction. The tax may have an alternative base, such as assets, payroll, or income computed in an alternative manner.

Most countries exempt certain types of corporate events or transactions from income tax. For example, events related to formation or reorganization of the corporation, which are treated as capital costs. In addition, most systems provide specific rules for taxation of the entity and/or its members upon winding up or dissolution of the entity.

In systems where financing costs are allowed as reductions of the tax base ([[tax deductions]]), rules may apply that differentiate between classes of member-provided financing. In such systems, items characterized as [[interest]] may be deductible, perhaps subject to limitations, while items characterized as dividends are not. Some systems limit deductions based on simple formulas, such as a [[debt-to-equity ratio]], while other systems have more complex rules.

Some systems provide a mechanism whereby groups of related corporations may obtain benefit from losses, credits, or other items of all members within the group. Mechanisms include combined or consolidated returns as well as group relief (direct benefit from items of another member).

Many systems additionally tax shareholders of those entities on [[dividends]] or other distributions by the corporation. A few systems provide for partial integration of entity and member taxation. This may be accomplished by "imputation systems" or [[franking credit]]s. In the past, mechanisms have existed for advance payment of member tax by corporations, with such payment offsetting entity level tax.

Many systems (particularly sub-country level systems) impose a tax on particular corporate attributes.  Such non-income taxes may be based on capital stock issued or authorized (either by number of shares or value), total equity, net capital, or other measures unique to corporations.

Corporations, like other entities, may be subject to [[withholding tax]] obligations upon making certain varieties of payments to others.  These obligations are generally not the tax of the corporation, but the system may impose penalties on the corporation or its officers or employees for failing to withhold and pay over such taxes. A company has been defined as a juristic person having an independent and separate existence from its shareholders. Income of the company is computed and assessed separately in the hands of the company. In certain cases, distributions from the company to its shareholders as dividends are taxed as income to the shareholders.

Corporations [[property tax]], [[payroll tax]], [[withholding tax]], [[excise tax]], [[customs duties]], [[value added tax]], and other common taxes, are generally not referred to as “corporate tax.”

===Definition of corporation===
{{Main|Corporation}}
Characterization as a [[corporation]] for tax purposes is based on the form of organization, with the exception of United States Federal&lt;ref&gt;See United States tax regulations at [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr301.7701-2.pdf 26 CFR 301.7701-2] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr301.7701-3.pdf -3].&lt;/ref&gt; and most states income taxes, under which an entity may elect to be treated as a corporation and taxed at the entity level or taxed only at the member level.&lt;ref name=26usc11&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11 26 USC 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Limited liability company]],  [[Partnership taxation]], [[S corporation]], [[Sole proprietorship]].

==Types==
Most jurisdictions tax corporations on their income, like the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880001_en_2 Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988] as amended (UK ICTA88) section 6&lt;/ref&gt; or the United States.&lt;ref name=26usc11/&gt; The United States taxes all types of corporate income for a given company at the same rate, but provide different rates of tax depending on income levels or size of the company.&lt;ref name=26usc11/&gt;

The United States taxes corporations under the same framework of tax law as individuals, with differences related to the inherent natures of corporations and individuals or unincorporated entities.  Individuals are not formed, amalgamated, or acquired; and corporations do not incur medical expenses except by way of compensating individuals.&lt;ref&gt;United States [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_B_40_VII.html itemized deductions for individuals] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_B_40_VIII.html special deductions for corporations].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most systems tax both domestic and [[Foreign corporation|foreign corporations]].  Often, domestic corporations are taxed on worldwide income while foreign corporations are taxed only on income from sources within the jurisdiction. 

===Taxable income===
The United States defines taxable income for a corporation as all [[gross income]], i.e. sales plus other income minus cost of goods sold and tax exempt income less allowable [[Tax deduction|tax deductions]], without the allowance of the [[standard deduction]] applicable to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63|title=26 U.S. Code § 63 - Taxable income defined|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' system requires that differences in principles for recognizing income and deductions differing from financial accounting principles like the timing of income or deduction, [[tax exemption]] for certain income, and disallowance or limitation of certain [[tax deductions]]  be disclosed in considerable detail for non-small corporations on Schedule M-3 to Form 1120.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf|title=M-3 to Form 1120|date=|journal=United States Internal Revenue Service|via=|author-link=irs.gov|last=United States Internal Revenue Service|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate tax rates generally are the same for differing types of income, yet the US graduated its tax rate system where corporations with lower levels of income pay a lower rate of tax, with rates varying from 15% on the first $50,000 of income to 35% on incomes over $10,000,000, with phase-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11|title=26 U.S. Code § 11 - Tax imposed|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian system imposes tax at different rates for different types of corporations, allowing lower rates for some smaller corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/type-corporation.html|title=Type of corporation - Canada.ca|last=Canada Revenue Agency|first=|date=|website=www.canada.ca|language=en-ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax rates vary by jurisdiction and some countries have sub-country level jurisdictions like provinces, cantons, prefectures, cities, or other that also impose corporate income tax like Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peachwilkinson.com/taxing-terms-corporation-tax-explained/ |title=Corporation Tax Explained |publisher=Peach Wilkinson Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions impose tax at a different rate on an alternative tax base.

Some cities:  up to 9%, deductible in computing Federal taxable income.  The Federal Alternative Minimum Tax of 20% is imposed on regular taxable income with adjustments.

===International corporate tax rates===

Corporate tax rates vary widely by country, leading some corporations to shield earnings within offshore subsidiaries or to redomicile within countries with lower tax rates. 

In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5k3wh96w246k.pdf?expires=1448516536&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=19E09DD7567FF1DA85E0EC999665FA0B|title=OECD iLibrary|last=|first=|date=|work=OECD i-Library|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|format=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2018}} 

Corporate tax rates across the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) are shown in the table. Rates within the OECD vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 34.43% in France, since the United States had recently decreased corporation tax to 22%.  The OECD average is 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Table II.1. Corporate income tax rate |publisher=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702060453/http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |archivedate=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first column in the table below represents corporate income tax rates mandated by the central government. The second column lists total combined tax rates which, in addition to the government tax rate, may also include various provincial, state and local taxes. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Corporation tax rates |url= http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/rts-eng.html |website=Canada Revenue Agency |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=2016-02-07 |author=Taxpayer Services and Debt Management Branch, Taxpayer Services &amp;#x5b;Directorate&amp;#x5d;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of earnings==
Most systems that tax corporations also impose income tax on shareholders of corporations when earnings are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61 26 USC 61(a)(7)].&lt;/ref&gt;  Such distribution of earnings is generally referred to as a [[dividend]].  The tax may be at reduced rates.  For example, the United States provides for reduced amounts of tax on dividends received by  individuals and by corporations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1 26 USC 1(h)(11)] for the reduced rate of tax for individuals, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/243 26 USC 243] (a)(1) and (c) for a deduction for dividends received by corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company law of some jurisdictions prevents corporations from distributing amounts to shareholders except as distribution of earnings.  Such earnings may be determined under company law principles or tax principles. In such jurisdictions, exceptions are usually provided with respect to distribution of shares of the company, for winding up, and in limited other situations.

Other jurisdictions treat distributions as distributions of earnings taxable to shareholders if earnings are available to be distributed, but do not prohibit distributions in excess of earnings.  For example, under the United States system each corporation must maintain a calculation of its earnings and profits (a tax concept similar to retained earnings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/312|title=26 U.S. Code § 312 - Effect on earnings and profits|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A distribution to a shareholder is considered to be from earnings and profits to the extent thereof unless an exception applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/316|title=26 U.S. Code § 316 - Dividend defined|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the United States provides reduced tax on dividend income of both corporations and individuals.

Other jurisdictions provide corporations a means of designating, within limits, whether a distribution is a distribution of earnings taxable to the shareholder or a [[return of capital]].

===Example===
The following illustrates the dual level of tax concept:

C Corp earns 100 of profits before tax in each of years 1 and 2.  It distributes all the earnings in year 3, when it has no profits.  Jim owns all of C Corp.  The tax rate in the residence jurisdiction of Jim and C Corp is 30%.

==Other corporate events==
Many systems provide that certain corporate events are not taxable to corporations or shareholders.  Significant restrictions and special rules often apply.  The rules related to such transactions are often quite complex.

===Formation===
Most systems treat the formation of a corporation by a controlling corporate shareholder as a nontaxable event.  Many systems, including the United States and Canada, extend this tax free treatment to the formation of a corporation by any group of shareholders in control of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/351 26 USC 351].  For a discussion of U.S. principles, see Bittker &amp; Eustice, below, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, in tax free formations the tax attributes of assets and liabilities are transferred to the new corporation along with such assets and liabilities.

Example:  John and Mary are United States residents who operate a business.  They decide to incorporate for business reasons.  They transfer the assets of the business to Newco, a newly formed Delaware corporation of which they are the sole shareholders, subject to accrued liabilities of the business in exchange solely for common shares of Newco.  Under United States principles, this transfer does not cause tax to John, Mary, or Newco.  If on the other hand Newco also assumes a bank loan in excess of the basis of the assets transferred less the accrued liabilities, John and Mary will recognize taxable gain for such excess.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/357 26 USC 357] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr1.357-2.pdf 26 CFR 1.367-1(b) Example].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Corporations may merge or acquire other corporations in a manner a particular tax system treats as nontaxable to either of the corporations and/or to their shareholders.  Generally, significant restrictions apply if tax free treatment is to be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368 26 USC 368] defining events qualifying for reorganization treatment, including certain acquisitions.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Bigco acquires all of the shares of Smallco from Smallco shareholders in exchange solely for Bigco shares.  This acquisition is not taxable to Smallco or its shareholders under U.S. or Canadian tax law if certain requirements are met, even if Smallco is then liquidated into or merged or amalgamated with Bigco.

===Reorganizations===
In addition, corporations may change key aspects of their legal identity, capitalization, or structure in a tax free manner under most systems.  Examples of reorganizations that may be tax free include mergers, amalgamations, liquidations of subsidiaries, share for share exchanges, exchanges of shares for assets, changes in form or place of organization, and recapitalizations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/354 26 USC 354] for tax effect on shareholders of reorganizations as defined in  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368 26 USC 368].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest deduction limitations==
Most jurisdictions allow a [[tax deduction]] for interest expense incurred by a corporation in carrying out its trading activities.  Where such interest is paid to related parties, such deduction may be limited.  Without such limitation, owners could structure financing of the corporation in a manner that would provide for a tax deduction for much of the profits, potentially without changing the tax on shareholders.  For example, assume a corporation earns profits of 100 before interest expense and would normally distribute 50 to shareholders.  If the corporation is structured so that deductible interest of 50 is payable to the shareholders, it will cut its tax to half the amount due if it merely paid a dividend.

A common form of limitation is to limit the deduction for interest paid to related parties to interest charged at arm's length rates on debt not exceeding a certain portion of the equity of the paying corporation.  For example, interest paid on related party debt in excess of three times equity may not be deductible in computing taxable income.

The United States, United Kingdom, and French tax systems apply a more complex set of tests to limit deductions.  Under the [[Corporate tax in the United States|U.S. system]], related party interest expense in excess of 50% of cash flow is generally not currently deductible, with the excess potentially deductible in future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163|title=26 U.S. Code § 163 - Interest|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of instruments as debt on which interest is deductible or as equity with respect to which distributions are not deductible can be complex in some systems.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/385 26 USC 385].  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] had proposed complex regulations under this section (see TD 7747, 1981-1 CB 141) which were soon withdrawn (TD 7920, 1983-2 CB 69).  An article in ''Tax Notes'', a publication of [[Tax Analysts]] in 1986 {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} identified 26 factors the U.S. courts have used to classify instruments as debt or equity.  Also see [http://asbbs.org/files/2008/PDF/E/Englebrecht.pdf article]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Englebrecht, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign corporation branches==
Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations differently from domestic corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast tax on domestic corporations under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11 26 USC 11] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63 26 USC 63] with tax on foreign corporations under  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_II_50_B.html 26 USC 881-885].&lt;/ref&gt;  No international laws limit the ability of a country to tax its nationals and residents (individuals and entities).  However, treaties and practicality impose limits on taxation of those outside its borders, even on income from sources within the country.

Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations on business income within the jurisdiction when earned through a branch or [[permanent establishment]] in the jurisdiction.  This tax may be imposed at the same rate as the tax on business income of a resident corporation or at a different rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/882|title=26 U.S. Code § 882 - Tax on income of foreign corporations connected with United States business|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon payment of [[dividends]], corporations are generally subject to [[withholding tax]] only by their country of incorporation.  Many countries impose a branch profits tax on foreign corporations to prevent the advantage the absence of dividend withholding tax would otherwise provide to foreign corporations.  This tax may be imposed at the time profits are earned by the branch or at the time they are remitted or deemed remitted outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/884|title=26 U.S. Code § 884 - Branch profits tax|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches of foreign corporations may not be entitled to all of the same deductions as domestic corporations.  Some jurisdictions do not recognize inter-branch payments as actual payments, and income or deductions arising from such inter-branch payments are disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] states in its [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000224779 Publication 515], “The payee of a payment made to a disregarded entity is the owner of the entity.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions impose express limits on tax deductions of branches.  Commonly limited deductions include management fees and interest.

Nathan M. Jenson argues that low corporate tax rates are a minor determinate of a multinational company when setting up their headquarters in a country. Nathan M. Jenson: Sinha, S.S. 2008, "Can India Adopt Strategic Flexibility Like China Did?", Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, vol. 9, no. 2/3, pp. 1.

==Losses==
Most jurisdictions allow interperiod allocation or deduction of losses in some manner for corporations, even where such deduction is not allowed for individuals.  A few jurisdictions allow losses (usually defined as negative taxable income) to be deducted by revising or amending prior year taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/172|title=26 U.S. Code § 172 - Net operating loss deduction|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most jurisdictions allow such deductions only in subsequent periods.  Some jurisdictions impose time limitations as to when loss deductions may be utilized.

==Groups of companies==
Several jurisdictions provide a mechanism whereby losses or [[tax credits]] of one corporation may be used by another corporation where both corporations are commonly controlled (together, a group).  In the United States and Netherlands, among others, this is accomplished by filing a single tax return including the income and loss of each group member.  This is referred to as a consolidated return in the United States and as a fiscal unity in the Netherlands.  In the United Kingdom, this is accomplished directly on a pairwise basis called group relief.  Losses of one group member company may be “surrendered” to another group member company, and the latter company may deduct the loss against profits.

The United States has extensive regulations dealing with consolidated returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1502-0|title=26 CFR 1.1502-0 - Effective dates.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such rule requires matching of income and deductions on intercompany transactions within the group by use of “deferred intercompany transaction” rules.

In addition, a few systems provide a tax exemption for dividend income received by corporations.  The Netherlands system provides a “participation exception” to taxation for corporations owning more than 25% of the dividend paying corporation.

==Transfer pricing==
{{seealso|Transfer pricing}}
A key issue in corporate tax is the setting of prices charged by related parties for goods, services or the use of property. Many jurisdictions have guidelines on transfer pricing which allow tax authorities to adjust transfer prices used. Such adjustments may apply in both an international and a domestic context.

==Taxation of shareholders==
Most income tax systems levy tax on the corporation and, upon distribution of earnings (dividends), on the shareholder.  This results in a dual level of tax.  Most systems require that income tax be withheld on distribution of dividends to foreign shareholders, and some also require withholding of tax on distributions to domestic shareholders.  The rate of such [[withholding tax]] may be reduced for a shareholder under a [[tax treaty]].

Some systems tax some or all dividend income at lower rates than other income.  The United States has historically provided a [[dividends received deduction]] to corporations with respect to dividends from other corporations in which the recipient owns more than 10% of the shares.  For tax years 2004–2010, the United States also has imposed a reduced rate of taxation on dividends received by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1 26 USC 1(h)(11)].  Note that distributions from an [[S corporation]], Regulated Investment Company (mutual fund), or Real Estate Investment Trust are not treated as dividends.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems currently attempt or in the past have attempted to integrate taxation of the corporation with taxation of shareholders to mitigate the dual level of taxation.  As a current example, Australia provides for a “franking credit” as a benefit to shareholders.  When an Australian company pays a dividend to a domestic shareholder, it reports the dividend as well as a notional tax credit amount.  The shareholder utilizes this notional credit to offset shareholder level income tax.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A previous system was utilised in the United Kingdom, called the [[Advance Corporation Tax]] (ACT).  When a company paid a dividend, it was required to pay an amount of ACT, which it then used to offset its own taxes.  The ACT was included in income by the shareholder resident in the United Kingdom or certain treaty countries, and treated as a payment of tax by the shareholder.  To the extent that deemed tax payment exceeded taxes otherwise due, it was refundable to the shareholder.

==Alternative tax bases==
Many jurisdictions incorporate some sort of alternative tax computation.  These computations may be based on assets, capital, wages, or some alternative measure of taxable income.  Often the alternative tax functions as a minimum tax.

[[Income tax in the United States|United States federal income tax]] incorporates an [[alternative minimum tax]].  This tax is computed at a lower tax rate (20% for corporations), and imposed based on a modified version of taxable income.  Modifications include longer depreciation lives assets under [[MACRS]], adjustments related to costs of developing natural resources, and an addback of certain tax exempt interest.  The U. S. state of Michigan previously taxed businesses on an alternative base that did not allow compensation of employees as a tax deduction and allowed full deduction of the cost of production assets upon acquisition.

Some jurisdictions, such as Swiss cantons and certain states within the United States, impose taxes based on capital.  These may be based on total equity per audited financial statements,&lt;ref&gt;Switzerland {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a computed amount of assets less liabilities&lt;ref name="New York"&gt;New York&lt;/ref&gt; or quantity of shares outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Delaware&lt;/ref&gt;  In some jurisdictions, capital based taxes are imposed in addition to the income tax.&lt;ref name="New York"/&gt;  In other jurisdictions, the capital taxes function as alternative taxes.

Mexico imposes an alternative tax on corporations, the IETU.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  The tax rate is lower than the regular rate, and there are adjustments for salaries and wages, interest and royalties, and depreciable assets.

==Tax returns==
Most systems require that corporations file an annual income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6012|title=26 U.S. Code § 6012 - Persons required to make returns of income|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some systems (such as the [[Tax return (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Tax return (United States)|United States]] systems) require that taxpayers self assess tax on the tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6151|title=26 U.S. Code § 6151 - Time and place for paying tax shown on returns|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other systems provide that the government must make an assessment for tax to be due.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Some systems require certification of tax returns in some manner by accountants licensed to practice in the jurisdiction, often the company's auditors.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., India {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax returns can be fairly simple or quite complex.  The systems requiring simple returns often base taxable income on financial statement profits with few adjustments, and may require that audited financial statements be attached to the return.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., UK Form [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ct600-2008.pdf CT600], which [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ct/managing/company-tax-return/returns/submit.htm requires the attachment] of audited or statutory accounts as filed with the [[Companies House]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Returns for such systems generally require that the relevant financial statements be attached to a simple adjustment schedule.  By contrast, United States corporate tax returns require both computation of taxable income from components thereof and reconciliation of taxable income to financial statement income.

Many systems require forms or schedules supporting particular items on the main form.  Some of these schedules may be incorporated into the main form.  For example, the Canadian corporate return, [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2/t2-09e.pdf  Form T-2]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, an 8-page form, incorporates some detail schedules but has nearly 50 additional schedules that may be required.

Some systems have different returns for different types of corporations or corporations engaged in specialized businesses.  The United States has 13 variations on the basic Form 1120&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html?value=1120&amp;criteria=formNumber&amp;submitSearch=Find |title=Forms and Instructions (PDF) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[S corporation]]s, insurance companies, [[Domestic international sales corporation]]s, foreign corporations, and other entities.  The structure of the forms and imbedded schedules vary by type of form.

Preparation of non-simple corporate tax returns can be time consuming.  For example, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] states in the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1120.pdf instructions for Form 1120] that the average time needed to complete form is over 56 hours, not including record keeping time and required attachments.

Tax return due dates vary by jurisdiction, fiscal or tax year, and type of entity.&lt;ref&gt;Examples:  U.S. corporations must file Federal income Form 1120 by the 15th day of the third month following the end of the tax year (March 15 for calendar years); but Form 1120-IC-DISC returns are not due until the 15th day of the ninth month; Canadian corporations must file T-2 by June 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In self-assessment systems, payment of taxes is generally due no later than the normal due date, though advance tax payments may be required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Corporations must pay estimated taxes for each quarter or face penalties under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6655 26 USC 6655].&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian corporations must pay estimated taxes monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/pymnts/nstlmnts/ddts-eng.html |title=Instalment due dates |publisher=Cra-arc.gc.ca |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each case, final payment is due with the corporation tax return.

'''Credit card hijacking''' is a form of [[credit card fraud]] and the term is used when a person’s [[credit card]] is used by an unauthorized person (e.g. a thief or overaggressive vendor) to buy goods or services.  The credit card owner usually has trouble reasserting control over the card, because usually he or she doesn't find out immediately, and the owner must distinguish legitimate purchases from illegitimate in a credible manner.

==Identity theft==
The first form of credit card hijacking is basically [[identity theft]], which is the deliberate use of another person's [[Personally identifiable information|identity]].  Identity theft is usually the result of serious breaches of [[privacy]] and often involves the victim compromising a great deal of [[financial]] and personal information&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre30.shtm FTC - ID Theft, whats it all about?]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the thief to charge an existing credit card account or open up new credit card accounts in the name of the victim. Methods of identity theft for credit card hijacking have involved mail interception or skimming of credit card data. The growth of online subscriptions and transactions have also brought along a variety of different [[phishing]] and the use of [[spyware]] and [[botnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threatmetrix.com/fraud-control-device-fingerprint/resources/article-identity_theft/identity_theft.html Identity Theft Defeats Credit Card Authorization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924071410/http://www.threatmetrix.com/fraud-control-device-fingerprint/resources/article-identity_theft/identity_theft.html |date=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods Used==
Radio-frequency identification [[RFID]] uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. There have been several demonstrations on how credit card fraud can committed through RFID scanners. Although the possibility of credit fraud using an RFID scanner is rare, it is possible for it to happen. There are more occurrences with credit card fraud that happen through PoS or [[point of sale]] that has been compromised with malware. The malware is typically installed by someone who hacks into the system from another location &lt;ref&gt;[https://usa.visa.com/support/small-business/fraud-protection.html?ep=v_sym_cisp]&lt;/ref&gt; if not always, installed through hacking by. Another well known tactic for credit card fraud is the placement of skimmers on an ATM by the person or persons committing the credit fraud. &lt;ref&gt;[https://money.howstuffworks.com/atm-skimming.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cancellation barrier==
Another form of credit card hijacking is the continued charging of a person’s credit card for a [[subscription]] to goods or [[Service (economics)|services]] no longer desired by the credit card owner. This type of credit card hijacking was pioneered by major [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], credit monitoring services and [[online dating]] services, are perfectly [[legal]], and are still common today in a wide range of subscription based goods and services. Credit card hijacking of this type came about as online subscription based [[marketers]] realized that traditional subscription systems, such as the annual subscriptions that paper [[magazines]] use, were an impediment to enrolling customers. For instance, a subscription that is US$24.95 per month, is US$299.40 annually. By breaking the subscription period into small units like months or quarters, and allowing direct monthly charging of the subscriber’s credit card, the psychological and economic conflicts subscribers see are greatly reduced. 

The issue which makes one subscription system a hijacking of the credit card is not how often it's billed, but the organization creating barriers that make it more difficult for subscriptions to be cancelled. Organizations which use credit card hijacking as part of their marketing strategy make online registration for the subscription easy, enforce default automatic renewal policies. In comparison to traditional subscription based system such as paper magazines where the subscriber has to periodically proactively reauthorize the subscription. Instead of an automatic renewal. The most common subscription exit barrier is to not provide any online subscription cancellation mechanism at all, but to instead require the user to cancel by telephone or by "on-line chats". Such organizations often add the additional barrier of making any subscription cancellation information difficult for the user to even find, thus creating an additional delay in the subscription cancellation. This is very common with internet service providers, who know the psychological barrier to making the call, which the subscriber anticipates will be unpleasant, is very high. It also allows the marketing organization to talk the subscriber into changing their minds and not cancelling the subscription. Another common subscription cancellation barrier is to have a relatively long subscription period, a no refund policy, and to require the user upon cancellation to forfeit all money covering the present subscription period. This is very common with [[online dating]] services. 

This second form of credit card hijacking was created by marketers who recognized that subscription based services generally have relatively low periodic billing amounts which will generally go unnoticed on any given credit card statement. So what happens is that long after the user loses interest in the subscription, they forget to cancel the subscription and because the periodic billing is so low, they don’t tend to notice it on their credit card statement.

A simple solution to this problem is to call the credit card company, request a new card with a different account number, and cancel the previous account.  They will transfer the debt amount from the old account to the new account. This makes companies that have the credit card information unable to continue charging the credit card of the person. 

==Negative option billing==
[[Negative option billing]] is the practice of sending goods automatically and billing the recipient unless the recipient is proactive in declining the goods before they are sent. Negative option billing reverses the usual direction of sales transactions. It assumes that unless you say 'no', you've agreed to have bought the goods. This is the common practice used in book clubs, record clubs, and magazine subscriptions with automatic renewal. Some practitioners of negative option billing prefer to call it "advance consent marketing".

==Billing for membership rather than services==
If a customer cancels services provided by a vendor, the vender would be committing fraud if they bill for services not provided (for example internet access).  Some venders avoid this problem by billing monthly for a "membership", even though no services are used by the former customer.  By retaining the membership number in an active status, the vendor makes it difficult for the customer to prove that the membership was cancelled. This is a form of credit card fraud that is not often regarded as such.

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazzei&gt;Rebecca Mazzei (11-30-2005).[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8550 Still Standing] ([https://archive.is/20140102023104/http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8550 Archive]) ''Metro Times''.

In July 2013 [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of Michigan was finalizing the purchase of the Cornice and Slate Company Building, which had the ''Metro Times'' and Paxahau, an event production and management company that produces the [[Movement Electronic Music Festival]]. The Cornice and Slate building is adjacent to the BCBS [[Bricktown, Detroit|Bricktown]] customer service facility. The acquisition of the Cornice and Slate building would add additional space to BCBS's [[Greektown]] facility. The ground floor lease to the Flood's Bar &amp; Grille would be maintained while the Cornice and Slate second and third floors would be used as office space for about 100 BCBS employees.&lt;ref name=Rupersburg&gt;Rupersburg, Nicole.

==Early life==
Mabuza-Suttle was born in [[Sophiatown]], a black neighbourhood in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, during the [[apartheid]] era. Her grandfather, Ben Mabuza, raised her and was a major inspiration for her later success. Meanwhile, her father, who owned one of the first driving schools in the nation, provided a steady income for the family. During her childhood she became interested in dance, which became a lifelong pursuit.&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/felicia-mabuza-suttle | title=Felicia Mabuza-Suttle | publisher=Gale Contemporary Black Biography | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In the 1960s and 70s, a large number of black South Africans went overseas to study to evade the apartheid regime. Mabuza-Suttle was amongst them, studying at [[Marquette University]] in the United States. In the 80s, she became the first member of her family to achieve a college degree when she earned a BA in Journalism, followed by an MA in Mass Communication.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

As well as studying, Mabuza-Suttle also wrote for the ''World Newspaper'', where she met prominent anti-apartheid activists, including [[Steve Biko]], the leader of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]. This would lead to her becoming politically involved when she returned to South Africa.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

==Career in South Africa==
Mabuza-Suttle returned for a short time to South Africa in 1982 to work for Radio Bophutatswana, where she was criticised for being politically incorrect.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

In 1990, Mabuza-Suttle returned permanently to South Africa, accepting a position at the [[South African Airways]]. In 1992, she began her television career after being offered a job as a talk show host at the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]]. Talk shows were a fairly new concept in South Africa at the time, and her show rapidly became successful. Originally known as ''Top Level'', its name was changed to ''The Felicia Show'' in 1995, and was again renamed simply ''Felicia'' in 2000 (accompanying a move to ETV, the largest South African English-language channel). The show focused mainly on social topics, but also ventured into entertainment.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

However, amidst criticisms that her show was too similar to [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], ''Felicia'' closed down in 2004. Mabuza-Suttle moved her show to the United States, where it was broadcast as ''Conversations with Felicia'' on [[The Africa Channel]]. It still focused mainly on South African personalities.&lt;ref name="Channel 24"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/What-happened-to-Felicia-Mabuza-Suttle-20090401 | title=What happened to Felicia Mabuza-Suttle? | publisher=Channel 24 | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Simpson, Ashlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Propelled by her success on television, Mabuza-Suttle founded several business ventures, including the ''Felicia'' brand of clothing and accessories, Pamodzi Investments, FMS Productions, and Back of the Moon, a restaurant. She has been involved in philanthropic activities, including donating a portion of her eyewear profits to an anti-drug and anti-crime campaign.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

However, in 2012, she liquidated Back of the Moon for various reasons, including economic and legal difficulties, and disagreements with her business partner and landlord.&lt;ref name="sundayworld" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Mabuza-Suttle married Earl Suttle in 1976. She lives in Johannesburg, while Earl Suttle lives in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. They have two children, Lindiwe and Zanele.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edgars Club"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edgarsclub.co.za/whats-new/magazine/like-mother-like-daughter/ | title=Interview with Lindiwe and Felicia Mabuza-Suttle | publisher=Edgars Club | date=9 May 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotefarm|date=February 2018}}

A '''free lunch''' is a sales enticement that offers a [[meal]] at no [[cost]] in order to attract customers and increase [[revenue]]s from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in [[Western saloon|saloons]] in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a "free" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.&lt;ref name=south/&gt; The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.

Free food or drink is sometimes supplied in contemporary times, often by [[gambling]] establishments such as [[casino]]s.

The saying "[[there ain't no such thing as a free lunch]]" refers to this custom, meaning that things which appear to be free are always paid for in some way.

== History ==
In 1875, ''[[The New York Times]] ''wrote of elaborate free lunches as a "custom peculiar to the Crescent City" ([[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]), saying, "In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the [[American Civil War|war]].... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way." As described by this reporter,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of [[social class in the United States|classes]], and when a man takes up a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either dignified or consequential. In New-Orleans all classes of the people can be seen partaking of these free meals and pushing and scrambling to be helped a second time. [At one saloon] six men were engaged in preparing drinks for the crowd that stood in front of the counter. I noticed that the price charged for every kind of [[liquor]] was fifteen cents, [[Punch (drink)|punches]] and cobblers costing no more than a glass of [[ale]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The repast included "immense dishes of butter," large baskets of bread, "a monster silver boiler filled with a most excellent [[oyster]] soup," "a round of beef that must have weighed at least forty pounds," vessels filled with potatoes, stewed [[mutton]], stewed tomatoes, and [[macaroni]] ''à la Français.'' The proprietor said that the patrons included "at least a dozen old fellows who come here every day, take one fifteen cent drink, eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant, and then complain that the beef is tough or the potatoes watery."&lt;ref name=south&gt;"Free Lunch in the South." The New York Times, Feb 20, 1875, p. 4. Re value of the lunch,  this source speaks of patrons who "take one fifteen cent drink [and] eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant." https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/02/20/82755928.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ($0.15 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|0.15|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}}; $1 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|1|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}})

== Free-lunch fiend ==
The nearly indigent "free-lunch fiend" was a recognized social type. An 1872 ''New York Times'' story about "loafers and free-lunch men" who "[[Matthew 6:28|toil not, neither do they spin]], yet they 'get along,'" visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers; "should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed."&lt;ref&gt;"The Loafer and Free-Lunch Men;" The New York Times, June 30, 1872, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[Western saloon|saloon]] bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon's free buffet. To attract business, "...many saloons lured customers with offers of a "free lunch"—usually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon "bouncer" was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hoboes.com/Politics/Prohibition/Notes/Drinking/ Drinking in America: A History - Search for Consensus: Drinking and the War Against Pluralism, 1860-1920]'' – Lender, Mark Edward &amp; Martin, James Kirby, The Free Press, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom was well-developed in [[San Francisco]]. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]] calls "the free lunch fiend the only landmark of the past." It asks "How do all these idle people live" and asserts, "It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve."&lt;ref&gt;"Old Things Passing Away," The New York Times, March 5, 1886, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudyard Kipling]], writing in 1891, noted how he

&lt;blockquote&gt;came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the "free lunch" I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a [[rupee]] a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=American Notes|publisher=Standard Book Company|year=1930}} (published in book form in 1930, based on essays which appeared in periodicals in 1891)&lt;br/&gt;
{{Gutenberg|no=977|name=American Notes by Rudyard Kipling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1919 novel compared a war zone to the free lunch experience by saying "the shells and shrapnels was flyin round and over our heads thicker than hungry [[Homelessness|bum]]s around a free [[lunch counter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie|author=Barney Stone|year=1919|publisher=The Sherwood Company}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=15544|name=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie by Barney Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The [[temperance movement]] opposed the free lunch as promoting the consumption of alcohol. An 1874 history of the movement writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold out the sign "Free Lunch." Does it mean that some [philanthropist]... has gone systematically to work setting out tables... placing about them a score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies... hiring a band of music? Ah, no!... there are men who do all this in order to hide the main feature of their peculiar institution. Out of sight is a well-filled bar, which is the centre about which all these other things are made to revolve. All the gathered fascinations and attractions are as so many baits to allure men into the net that is spread for them. Thus consummate art plies the work of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these worse than [[Moloch]] shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Years History of the Temperance Cause: Intemperance the Great National Curse|first=Jane E. |last=Stebbins|author2=T. A. H. Brown|publisher=L. Stebbins|location=Hartford, Connecticut|year=1874}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04396205&amp;id=u8dQFo3yQzwC&amp;pg=RA3-PA133&amp;vq=%22free+lunch%22&amp;as_brr=1 p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of writers, however, suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer [[William T. Stead]] commented that in winter in 1894 the suffering of the poor in need of food
&lt;blockquote&gt;would have been very much greater had it not been for the help given by the [[labor unions]] to their members and for an agency which, without pretending to be of much account from a charitable point of view, nevertheless fed more hungry people in Chicago than all the other agencies, religious, charitable, and municipal, put together. I refer to the Free Lunch of the saloons. There are from six to seven thousand saloons in Chicago. In one half of these a free lunch is provided every day of the week.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
He states that "in many cases the free lunch is really a free lunch," citing an example of a saloon which did not insist on a drink purchase, although commenting that this saloon was "better than its neighbors." Stead cites a newspaper's estimate that the saloon keepers fed 60,000 people a day and that this represented a contribution of about $18,000 a week toward the relief of the destitute in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If Christ Came to Chicago|first=William T.|last=Stead|year=1894|publisher=[[Laird &amp; Lee]]}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC02495421&amp;id=olqCOpl4SWoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;as_brr=1 pp. 139–140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1896, the New York State legislature passed the [[Raines law]] which was intended to regulate liquor traffic. Among its many provisions, one forbade the sale of liquor unless accompanied by food; another outlawed the free lunch. In 1897, however, it was amended to allow free lunches again.&lt;ref&gt;"Revolt in Clubdom; Probability of Passage of Amendments to Raines Law Causes Consternation; Free Lunch to Come Back." ''The Boston Globe,'' April 9, 1897, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
George Arthur Forrest was born in 1940 in [[Lubumbashi]] in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).&lt;ref name=Forbescustom&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.forbescustom.com/EmergingMarketsPgs/CongoInterviewsP1.html
 |title=George Forrest: Unconditional Love for DRC
 |work=Forbes Custom
 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the son of an Irish immigrant.&lt;ref name=GlobCement/&gt;
His father, Malta Forrest, had founded l'Entreprise Générale Malta Forrest (EGMF) in 1922 in Katanga Province in the south of the Belgian Congo. The company started as a transport company, then moved into mining and then into civil engineering. In 1968 it became a limited liability company, with George Forrest and his adoptive brother Victor Eskenazi-Forrest as Managing Directors. In 1986, after his brother died, George  Forrest took full control. He created the George Forrest International Group in 1995.&lt;ref name=selfhistory&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.egmforrest.com/uk/histo.html
 |title=Background history
 |publisher=Entreprise Générale Malta Forrest
 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s his company acquired several major cement production facilities, which should benefit from construction demand with the end of the [[Second Congo War]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=GlobCement/&gt;
Forrest's DRC operations grew to include 9,500 direct employees and 15,000 subcontractors.
Forrest is a sponsor of ''Dialogues'', a non-profit association that promotes the visual arts in Lubumbashi and supports the city’s museum. He also owns the Grelka Biano Ranch, with 30,000 head of cattle and 800 local employees.&lt;ref name=Forbescustom/&gt;

==Controversies==

In December 2001 the [[United Nations]] asked a panel of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The panel's report was issued in October 2002. In it they said George Forrest had long-standing ties to the establishment in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and described him as a member of the elite network of Congolese interests.

Learning piano since the age of 6, Wirjawan is an ardent jazz musician. He has performed in concerts (such as Java Jazz and Bob James Concert) and written songs for several albums.

The '''Government of [[Nova Scotia]]''' refers to the provincial government of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia is one of Canada’s four Atlantic Provinces, and the second-smallest province in Canada. The [[Capital city|capital]] of the province, Halifax, is Nova Scotia's largest city and its political capital. Halifax is where the Province House, Canada’s oldest legislative building, is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nslegislature.ca/about/timeline_event/1960/Porter_1960|title=About the Legislature|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=NS Legislature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Government of Nova Scotia consists of three branches: legislative, executive and judicial.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/treasuryboard/manuals/PDF/100/NSGov.pdf|title=Government of Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=July 18, 2018|website=NS Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its powers and structure are set out in the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. In modern Canadian use, the term "government" refers broadly to the cabinet of the day (formally the [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia]]), elected from the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] and the non-political staff within each provincial department or agency – that is, the civil service. 

The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Province]] of [[Nova Scotia]] is governed by a unicameral legislature, the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]], which operates in the [[Westminster system]] of government. In total 52 representatives are elected to serve the interests of the province. The political party that wins the largest number of seats in the legislature normally forms the government, and the party's leader becomes [[Premier of Nova Scotia|premier]] of the province (the [[Head of government|head of the government).]] The current government of the province is led by the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, headed by Premier [[Stephen_McNeil|Stephen McNeil]] who was sworn into office in October of 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadavisa.com/about-nova-scotia.html#NovaScotiaGovernment|title=Nova Scotia Government|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Canada Visa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of Canadian parliamentary institutions begins in Nova Scotia. In 1758, it was granted an elected assembly, becoming the first Canadian colony to enjoy a representative political institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Print=2&amp;Sec=Ch01&amp;Seq=2|title=CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Our Commons|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representatives of Nova Scotia's House of Assembly were elected by a limited number of individuals who were required to own property and swear on certain oaths.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This changed in 1836 when political reformer Joseph Howe started the movement for Responsible Government. Responsible Government is described as a government that is dependent on the support of an elected assembly instead of a monarch.Under the guidance of Joseph Howe, who lead the Reformers (Liberals), the first genuine political party appeared in the election of 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nova-scotia/#h3_jump_5|title=Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Canadian Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Premier of Nova Scotia ==
The Premier, or First Minister, of Nova Scotia is the head of the Executive Council of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/psc/employeeCentre/ceo/government/ns.asp|title=Government of Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Nova Scotia Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the head of government in Nova Scotia, the premier exercises a substantial amount of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/psc/employeeCentre/ceo/government/ns.asp|title=Government of Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Nova Scotia Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hon. James B. was the first Premier of Nova Scotia and led the government from 1848 to 1854.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nslegislature.ca/about/history|title=History|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=NS Legislature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Premier, Stephen McNeil, was sworn in as [[Premier of Nova Scotia|premier]] on October 22, 2013, Hon. [[Stephen McNeil]] became the 28th [[List of premiers of Nova Scotia|Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia]] since Confederation. Premier McNeil was elected Leader of the [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party]] in 2007.

== Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia ==
{{Further|Monarchy in Nova Scotia}}
The functions of the Sovereign, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen of Canada]], and known in Nova Scotia as the [[Monarchy in Nova Scotia|Queen in Right of Nova Scotia]], are exercised by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]. The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], in consultation with the [[Premier of Nova Scotia]]. In the case of unconstitutional actions, the Lieutenant Governor has the power to dismiss a government by refusing a decision of the Executive Council. This power is rarely used as it would disrupt the affairs of the elected government. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Executive Branch ==
The Executive branch is referred to as the government. The Executive Council, also called the Cabinet, makes the final decision for the Government of Nova Scotia. It is responsible for the operations and management of government as well as for making key policy decisions. The Executive Council is made up of Ministers, also called MLAs (Members in the Legislative Assembly). They are chosen by the Premier and appointed by the Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Finance==
The Nova Scotia government ended 2010-2011 with a surplus of $569 million and reduced its debt to $12.8 billion, down $217.8 million. The Nova Scotia government projects total revenues for 2018-2019 to be $10.810 billion. Expenses for fiscal year 2018-2019 are budgeted at $10.781 billion. The government budget for 2018–2019 projects a surplus of $29.4 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/budget/documents/Budget-2018-19.pdf|title=Budget|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|website=Nova Scotia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outsourcing==
In 2012 Nova Scotia signed a 10-year contract starting at $Cdn 8.4 million per year, with multinational information technology firm, IBM Canada to outsource the government's SAP information management system, which includes "payroll, procurement, human resources and other information from government departments, district health authorities, school boards, housing authorities and some municipal bodies.&lt;ref name=chronicleheraldJan2013&gt;

Kevin Quigley, the director of Dalhousie University's School of Public Administration, argued that while outsourcing may cut costs but it also leads to a dependency on an external source and a loss of control over software, capacity-building and human resource development.&lt;ref name=CBCOct2012&gt;

'''High production volume chemicals''', also referred to as HPV chemicals, are produced or imported into the United States in quantities of 1 million pounds or 500 tons per year.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt; In [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]], HPV chemicals are defined as being produced at levels greater than 1,000 metric tons per producer/importer per year in at least one member country/region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals Environment Directorate|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|pages=143|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of HPV chemicals serves as an overall priority list, from which chemicals are selected to gather data for a [[screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS), for testing and for initial [[hazard]] assessment.

==History==

===OECD countries including EU===
In 1987, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] decided to investigate existing chemicals. In 1991, they agreed to begin by focusing on High production volume (HPV) chemicals, where production volume was used as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate]] for data on occupational, consumer, and [[environmental exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;(OECD Council Acts, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Each country agreed to "sponsor" the assessment of a proportion of the HPV chemicals. Countries also agreed on a minimum set of required information, the [[Screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS). Six tests are: [[acute toxicity]], [[chronic toxicity]], [[developmental toxicity]]/[[reproductive toxicity]], [[mutagenicity]], [[ecotoxicity]] and environmental fate.  Using SIDS and detailed exposure data OECD's [[High Production Volume Chemicals Programme]] conducted initial [[risk assessment]]s to screen and to identify any need for further work.

During the late 1990s, OECD member countries began to assess chemical categories and to use [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] (QSAR) results to create OECD guidance documents, as well as a computerized QSAR toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From the HPV Chemicals Programme to the Cooperative Chemicals Assessment Programme|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/risk-assessment/historyfromthehpvchemicalsprogrammetothecooperativechemicalsassessmentprogramme.htm| work=Chemical safety and biosafety; Assessment of chemicals|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the global [[chemical industry]], organized in the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA) initiative, offered to join OECD efforts. The ICCA promised to sponsor by 2013 about 1,000 substances  from the OECD's HPV chemicals list "to establish as priorities for investigation", based on "presumed wide dispersive use, production in two or more global regions or similarity to another chemical, which met either of these criteria". OECD in turn agreed to refocus and to "increase transparency, efficiency and productivity and allow longer-term planning for governments and industry". The OECD refocus was on initial [[hazard]] assessments of HPV chemicals only, and no longer extensive [[exposure assessment|exposure information]] gathering and evaluation. Detailed exposure assessments within national (or regional) programmes and priority setting activities were postponed as post-SIDS work.

===United States===
On October 9, 1998, [[EPA Administrator]] Carol Browner sent letters to the CEOs of more than 900 chemical companies that manufacture HPV chemicals, asking them to participate in EPA's voluntary testing initiative, the so-called "HPV Challenge Program". The [[Environmental Defense Fund]], the [[American Petroleum Institute]], and [[American Chemistry Council]] joined in the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge|url=http://www.epa.gov/chemrtk/pubs/general/basicinfo.htm#creation|work=Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Pollution Prevention &amp; Toxics|publisher=EPA| accessdate=13 March 2014|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HPV chemical lists==
The OECD list of HPV chemicals keeps changing. A 2004 list of 143 pages contained 4,842 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 list was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2007 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/9/43947965.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| 2009}} the EPA's HPV list had 2,539 chemicals, while the HPV Challenge Program chemical list contained only 1,973 chemicals because inorganic chemicals and polymers were not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)|title=The HPV Voluntary Challenge Chemical List|url= http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/update/hpvchmlt.htm|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has published an online list of HPV chemicals since 2010. The list is not numerated and without footnotes.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=HPV Chemical Hazard Characterizations|url=http://iaspub.epa.gov/oppthpv/hpv_hc_characterization.get_report?doctype=2|work=High Production Volume Information System (HPVIS)|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory context==

===Europe===
The "Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management" ([[SAICM]]) is a policy for achieving safe production and use of chemicals worldwide by 2020, developed with stakeholders from more than 140 countries, signed by 100 governments, adopted by the [[UNEP]] Governing Council in February 2006. 
The [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) proposal and the [[European Chemicals Agency]] will help the EU to fulfill objectives of SAICM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st15/st15315.en06.pdf|publisher=European Union|accessdate=14 March 2014|author=Council of the European Union|pages=756|date=14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] has aimed to control production, use, trade, disposal and release of twelve [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs); the European Community has proposed five additional chemicals. The Convention bans deliberate production and use of POPs, bans the development of new POPs, and aims at minimizing releases of unintentionally produced POPs. The Convention has so far been ratified by the European Community, 18 member states and the two accession countries.

===United States===
The 1976 [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] requires the EPA to "compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed in the United States". In 1998, the EPA reported the most heavily used HPV chemicals in commerce were largely untested: 43% of 2,800 HPV chemicals had no basic [[toxicity test|toxicity data]] or screening level data at all, 50% had incomplete screening data, and only 7% of the HPV chemicals had a complete set of screening level toxicity data. However, screening level data, even if they indicated a problem, were not sufficient to restrict the use of a compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/general/hazchem.pdf|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|date=April 1998|title= Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study. What do we really know about the safety of high production volume chemicals? |author= Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1986, 2003, 2005, and in 2011 EPA issued regulations to amend and update the TSCA inventory.

As of April 2010, about 84,000 chemicals were on the TSCA inventory, per a [[GAO]] report.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web|title=TSCA Inventory Reset|url=http://www.epa.gov/champ/pubs/hpv/tsca.html|work=Chemical Assessment and Management Program (ChAMP)|publisher=EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSCA Section 4 gives EPA the authority to demand chemical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Regulation: Observations on the Toxic Substances Control Act and EPA Implementation|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655209.txt|work=GAO-13-696T|publisher=GAO|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity data==
In 1982, U.S. manufacturers, processors, and importers of 75 chemicals that the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] had found to cause cancers in animals, but the carcinogenicity of which in humans was uncertain, were surveyed. Only for 13 of the 75 chemicals had epidemiologic studies on human health been completed or were in progress. Eighteen of the 75 were HPV chemicals and only for eight HPV chemicals had epidemiologic studies been completed or were in progress. The largest number of chemicals (19) were drugs, and none of them had been epidemiologically studied. Seven chemicals that had been studied were used as pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Availability of epidemiologic data on humans exposed to animal carcinogens. II. Chemical uses and production volume|journal=Teratognesise Carcinogenesis Mutagenesis|year=1982| volume=2| issue=2|pages=151–67|pmid=6126936|author=Karstadt M |author2=Bobal R.| doi=10.1002/tcm.1770020205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] reported in “Toxic Ignorance” results of its analysis of the availability of basic health test data on HPV chemicals that only 29% of the HPV chemicals in the US met minimum data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxic Ignorance.|url=https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edf.org%2Fhealth%2Freports%2Ftoxic-ignorance|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund.|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=Summer 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 the EPA published a report CHEMICAL HAZARD DATA AVAILABILITY STUDY showing "55% of TRI chemicals have had full SIDS testing, while only 7% of other chemicals have full test data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|title=Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study: What Do We Really Know About the Safety of High Production Volume Chemicals?|publisher=EPA|pages=35|date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote 
"...of the 830 companies making HPV chemicals in the US, 148 companies have NO SIDS data available on their chemicals; an additional 459 companies sell products for which, on average, half or less of SIDS tests are available. Only 21 companies (or 3% of the 830 companies) have all SIDS tests available for their chemicals. The basic set of test data costs about $200,000 per chemical."
In 1999, the European Union (EU) published a study about how many EU-HPV chemicals were [[Publicly Available Specification|publicly available]] in a comprehensive chemical data base called [[IUCLID]]: Only 14% of the EU-HPV chemicals had data at the level of the base-set, 65% had less than base-set, and 21% had no data available. The authors concluded, "more data [were] publicly available than most previous studies" had shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R Allanou |author2=BG Hansen |author3=Y van der Bilt |title=Public Availability of Data on EU High Production Volume Chemicals|journal=EUR| year=1999| issue=18996| publisher=European Union|url=http://www.chemicalspolicy.org/downloads/DataAvailabilityEUHPV.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, one of the partners in EPA's HPV Challenge Program assessed 532 up to then unsponsored chemicals, whether they were "orphaned" or not, and found:
* 156 chemicals (29%) likely were still "orphans" – i.e., they could and should be sponsored, but had not been
* 103 chemicals (19%) had an unclear status 
* 266 chemicals (50%) were likely no longer HPV
* only 7 chemicals (1%) appeared to be in the process of becoming sponsored.&lt;ref name=ED&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Chemicals in the HPV Challenge: A Status Report|url=http://www.environmentaldefense.org.|publisher=Environmental Defense|accessdate=14 March 2014|author1=Richard A. Denison |page=12|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 2009, the EPA required companies to perform toxicity testing on merely 34 chemicals. In 2011, the EPA announced, but as of 2013 had yet to finalize, plans to require testing for 23 additional chemicals, so altogether 57 chemicals. The EPA has prioritized 83 chemicals for [[risk assessment]], and initiated seven assessments in 2012, with plans to start 18 additional assessments in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name=GAO /&gt;
In 2007, EPA began Toxcast which uses "automated chemical screening technologies (called "high-throughput screening assays") to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ToxCast™ Advancing the next generation of chemical safety evaluation|url=http://www.epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/|publisher=EPA|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=ToxCast Chemical Landscape: Paving the Road to 21st Century Toxicology|journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology|year=2016| volume=29| issue=8|pages=1225–1251|pmid=27367298|author=Richard A |author2=Judson R.| doi=10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00135}}&lt;/ref&gt;            

In 2009, EPA reported that it developed a system called ACToR (Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource) to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals.  It pooled chemical research, data and screening tools from multiple federal agencies including the National Toxicology Program/ National Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the Food and Drug Administration.

A '''hot runner''' system is an assembly of heated components used in plastic [[injection mold]]s that inject molten [[plastic]] into the cavities of the mold. (The cavities are the part of the mold shaped like the parts to be produced.)

By contrast, a cold runner is simply a channel formed between the two halves of the mold, for the purpose of carrying plastic from the [[injection molding]] machine nozzle to the cavities. Each time the mold opens to eject the newly formed plastic parts, the material in the runner is ejected as well, resulting in waste. A hot runner system usually includes a heated [[Manifold (fluid mechanics)|manifold]] and a number of heated [[Nozzle|nozzles]]. The main task of the manifold is to distribute the plastic entering the mold to the various nozzles which then meter it precisely to the injection points in the cavities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven Key Advantages of Hot Runner Systems {{!}} MoldMaking Technology|url = http://www.moldmakingtechnology.com/articles/seven-key-advantages-of-hot-runner-systems|website = www.moldmakingtechnology.com|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hot runner advantages ==
* Shorter cycle time: No runner controlling the cooling time
* Easier to start: Without runners to remove, and auto cycle occurs faster and more frequently
* Fewer sink marks and under-filled parts: Unlike when plastic flows through a cold runner and loses heat to mold plates
* Design flexibility: Can locate the gate at many points on the part
* Balanced [[Melt flow index|melt flow]]: Separate melt channels are in externally heated manifolds that are insulated from mold plates surrounding them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Hot runner systems were first developed and came into sporadic use in the early 60s with generally negative results. They gained popularity in the 80s and 90s as technological advancements allowed improved  reliability and the escalation of plastic materials prices made hot runner systems more desirable and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost effective]]. Hot runners are fairly complicated systems, they have to maintain the [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic material]] within them heated uniformly, while the rest of the injection mold is being cooled in order to solidify the product quickly. For this reason they are usually assembled from components pre manufactured by specialized companies. 

A hot runner controller is a temperature controller used to control the temperature in the hot runner. This helps  create the most consistent part(s).

Hot runners usually make the mold more expensive to manufacture and run, but allow savings by reducing [[plastic waste]] and by reducing the cycle time. (do not have to wait until the conventional runners freeze).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9380">The '''ISO 22715 standard''' provides guidelines for manufacturers in the best practices for [[cosmetic packaging|cosmetic packaging and labelling]] of all [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]]. This standard applies to products that fall under the category of cosmetics that are sold or given away as free [[Product sample|samples]]. ISO 22715 was initially published in April 2006.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics -- Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The intent of Standard ISO 22715 is to specify how cosmetic products should be packaged and labeled to maintain a certain level of standards within the [[cosmetic industry]]. This standard applies to cosmetic products whether the product is sold or given away. It is one of 26 published standards that are devoted to the cosmetic industry sector.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

ISO 22715 does not regulate what products are to be considered cosmetic. This determination is left to the national [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]] of those countries that follow the ISO 22715 and use it as a guide to best practices for packaging and labeling cosmetic products. Often, these national regulations are stricter than those provided in the standard are.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeling specifications==

ISO 22715 supports the need for consumers to know what is in the cosmetic products they purchase, how those products should be used and who has manufactured the products. To accomplish this, 22715 specifies that a product’s packaging should show certain information such as the [[ingredient]]s used in the product listed in descending order according to the percentage of each ingredient in the product. A list of coloring agents used in the product then follows the list of ingredients.

For safety purposes, ISO recommends including an explanation of what the product function is on the package, along with instructions for its use. Any precautionary or warning statements should also be printed on the package to caution consumers in the use of said product. Additional information that should appear on the packaging of cosmetic products includes:

* Manufacturer’s name and address
* Date of manufacture or batch number that can be used to identify the product
* Product’s weight or volume at the time it was packaged
* Recommendations for storage of the product
* ISO 22715 provides guidelines to be followed in how that information should appear on the packaging. If applicable, requirements are provided for primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006" /&gt;

==Relevance of ISO standards==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) was formed in 1947. It is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that is based in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The ISO has 162 members and the organization represents the interest of international standards of 196 countries. This represents almost 97 percent of the world’s population.

The ISO’s purpose is to create standards that are used to help form public policies and business objectives that benefit people throughout the world. Since May 2016, there has been over 21,500 ISO standards published. The ISO develops new standards when industry sectors and their stakeholders determine that a need exists. The standards are developed under the oversight of the ISO through cooperative efforts between other NGOs, consumer organizations, representatives from [[government agencies]], academics and testing laboratories.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

==Legal relevance of ISO 22715==

ISO 22715 is not legally binding, but it is the common denominator used for developing national regulations that address the labeling and packaging of cosmetic products. Regulators in individual countries often look to ISO standards as the benchmark for best practices for the different industry sectors in which they apply. Many regulators require businesses and manufacturers to comply with applicable ISO standards, in addition to local regulations.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

Currently, there are 26 published ISO standards devoted to the cosmetic sector, including ISO 22715. These standards are overseen by the ISO’s cosmetic product technical committee that was established in 1998.&lt;ref name="ISO-Office-and-Number"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 Cosmetics|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee%3Fcommid%3D54974|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee is composed of standardization bodies from major markets, such as leading ASEAN countries, most European counties and the United States via ANSI. Thirty-nine countries participate in the creation of standards for cosmetic products, with 27 observing countries within the committee.&lt;ref name="ISO-Countries"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 - Cosmetics_ Participating and Observing Countries|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=54974|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better distribute and update standards as needed, the ISO maintains the copyright on its standards. Most standards are reviewed and updated every five to seven years to remain relevant to the latest technologies within [[industry sector]]s.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Catherine|title=International Standards Key To Helping The World With Many Issues, ISO Says|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/05/18/international-standards-key-to-helping-the-world-with-many-issues-iso-says/|publisher=Intellectual Property Watch|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 22715 and local regulations==

Often, local regulations may exceed the requirements specified in ISO 22715. In the [[United States]], the Food &amp; Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) regulates the cosmetic industry&lt;ref name="FDA-Cosmetics&amp;US-Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with standards that are provided by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), in which the FDA is member.&lt;ref name="StandardsConformityBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council (U.S.). International Standards, Conformity Assessment, and U.S. Trade Policy Project Committee|title=Standards, Conformity Assessment, and Trade Into the 21st Century|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|pages=60|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=GkMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=ansi+and+fda+cooperation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7C7YcA94iX&amp;sig=IufKitcKO3B5-SwEbW4MGbGxpfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYz4eiibnPAhXC0hoKHSVrDdEQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=ansi%20and%20fda%20cooperation&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper_FDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], cosmetic manufacturers must abide by Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 Article 19 for the labeling of cosmetic products.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging-in-EU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Spolsky launched [[Trello]], an online project management tool inspired by [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/01/06.html |title=How Trello is different |date=January 6, 2012 |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Spolsky announced the appointment of [[Anil Dash]] as Fog Creek Software's new CEO, with Spolsky continuing as Stack Overflow's CEO and as a Fog Creek Software board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/06/anil-dash-is-the-new-ceo-of-fog-creek-software/|first=Joel|last=Spolsky|date=December 6, 2016|title=Anil Dash is the new CEO of Fog Creek Software
|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of five books, including ''User Interface Design for Programmers'' and ''Smart and Gets Things Done''. He is also the creator of "The Joel Test".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html The Joel Test]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolsky coined the term ''fix it twice'' for a process improvement method. It implies a quick, immediate solution for fixing an incident and a second, slower fix for preventing the same problem from occurring again by targeting the [[Root cause analysis|root cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html |title=Seven steps to remarkable customer service |date=February 19, 2007 |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of the term ''Shlemiel the painter's algorithm'', referring to an algorithm that is not scalable due to performing too many redundant actions, was described by ''salon.com'''s Scott Rosenberg as an example of good writing "about their insular world in a way that wins the respect of their colleagues and the attention of outsiders."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{citation|last=Rosenberg|first=Scott|title=The Shlemiel way of software|date=December 9, 2004|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2004/12/09/spolsky/|publisher=salon.com}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolsky recently made an appearance at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2017, stating how developers are writing the script for the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVHMZGnTmTs&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Spolsky talks about how software is eating the world, how it is becoming more evident in everyday life as people interact with more software on a day-to-day basis, and how developers are helping to shape how the world will work as technology keeps evolving. He uses the metaphor "we are just little vegetables floating in software soup", referring to our constant use of software for the most mundane activities, including work, social networking, and even taking a cab.

===Personal life===
Spolsky announced his marriage to his husband, Jared, on social media and his blog.&lt;ref name=JoelSpolskyNYC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html|accessdate=27 June 2015|title=About Joel Spolsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=stackoverflow|url=http://meta.stackoverflow.com/revisions/297871/1|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Untitled (Joel Spolsky on Twitter)|url=https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/265081187427569665|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives on the [[Upper West Side (Manhattan)|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=JoelSpolskyNYC/&gt;

==Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm== &lt;!-- Anchor from [[Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm] redirect; caution. --&gt;
In software development, a ''Shlemiel the painter's algorithm'' (sometimes, ''Shlemiel the painter algorithm'', not to be confused with "[[Painter's algorithm]]") is a method that is inefficient because the programmer has overlooked some fundamental issues at the very [[High and low level|lowest levels]] of [[software design]]. The term was coined in 2001 by Spolsky, who used a [[Yiddish]] joke to illustrate a certain poor programming practice: Schlemiel (also rendered Shlemiel) is to paint the dotted lines down the middle of a road. Each day, Schlemiel paints less than he painted the day before, and complains that it is because each day he gets farther away from the paint can, and it takes him longer to go back and put paint on his brush.&lt;ref name="basics"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Spolsky |first=Joel |title=Back to Basics |date=December 11, 2001 |website=Joel on Software |publisher=[[WP:SPS|Self-published]] |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inefficiency to which Spolsky was drawing an analogy was the poor programming practice of repeated [[concatenation]] of [[C (programming language)|C]]-style [[null-terminated string]]s.&lt;ref name="basics" /&gt; The first step in every implementation of the [[C standard library]] function for concatenating strings is determining the length of the first string by checking each character to see if it is the terminating [[null character]]. Next, the second string is copied to the end of the first.

In Spolsky's example, the "Schlemiels" occur when multiple strings are concatenated together:
&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
    strcat( buffer, "John" );    // Here, the string "John" is appended to the buffer
    strcat( buffer, "Paul" );    // Now the string "Paul" is appended to that
    strcat( buffer, "George" );  // ... and "George" is appended to that
    strcat( buffer, "Ringo" );   // ... and "Ringo" is appended to that
&lt;/source&gt;
After "Paul" has been appended to "John", the length of "JohnPaul" (or, more precisely, the position of the terminating null character) is known within the [[Scope (programming)|scope]] of &lt;code&gt;[[strcat]]()&lt;/code&gt; but is discarded upon the end of function. Afterwards, when &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; is told to append "George" to "JohnPaul", &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; starts at the very first character of "JohnPaul" (which is "J") all over again just to find the terminating null character. Each subsequent call to &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; has to compute the length again before concatenating another name to the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt;. Analogous to Schlemiel not carrying the paint bucket (or the string's length) with him, all the subsequent &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt;s have to "walk" the length of the string again to determine where the second string should be copied. As more data is added to &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; with each call to &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt;, that terminating null character also gets farther away from the beginning, meaning subsequent calls are increasingly slower.

The problems illustrated by Spolsky's example are not noticed by a programmer who is using a high-level language and has little or no understanding of how the language implementation works, including some basic knowledge of its underlying principles and functions.&lt;ref&gt;'''NOTE:''' For purposes of this discussion, an appropriate level of understanding of how the "language implementation" works, would usually include: having some knowledge of the "time complexity" of the compiler generated code -- including code that is ''invoked by'' the compiler generated code, such as subroutine libraries and class libraries. Understanding the relevant algorithms used within that compiler generated code, and within library routines called by it, does not necessarily mean having the knowledge required to (design, and) '''write''' that code; but it would include knowing enough to be able to '''read''' that code intelligently. When we talk about the "language implementation", typically we include the material that is provided when someone downloads the compiler and run-time package[s], and documentation, and licenses, after having decided to use (or to evaluate) a certain programming language. That material may include not only the run-time libraries that are formally part of the language implementation, but also some other subroutine libraries and class libraries that may influence some users' decisions about which language to use, even if those software packages are themselves written [or, "mostly" written] in the same language that they serve to enhance the usefulness of. There might not be a clear dividing line between "language implementation" [-type] run-time package[s], and other software that may well be [[Free and open-source software]] ([[Free and open-source software|FLOSS]]) that happens to be callable from (and "associated with") a certain language.&lt;/ref&gt; "Some of the biggest mistakes people make even at the highest architectural levels come from having a weak or broken understanding of a few simple things at the very lowest levels."&lt;ref name="basics" /&gt;

'''John Davison Rockefeller III''' (March 21, 1906 – July 10, 1978) was a philanthropist and third-generation member of the prominent [[Rockefeller family]]. He was the eldest son of the philanthropists [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. His siblings were [[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé|Abby]], [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]], [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller|Winthrop]] and [[David Rockefeller|David]].

Like his sister Abby, John III eventually settled on philanthropy as his major interest. His brothers Nelson and Winthrop devoted themselves to politics while Laurance went into conservation and David went into banking. He was a major force behind the establishment of the [[Council on Foundations]], the [[Foundation Center]] and [[Independent Sector]]. He took a leading role in organizing the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy (better known as the [[Peter George Peterson|Peterson]] Commission) and the [[Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs]] (better known as the Filer Commission). He also made the initial donation to support [[Yale University]]'s Program on Non-Profit Organizations, the first academic research center to focus on nonprofits.

In addition to his interest in philanthropy, Rockefeller made major commitments to supporting organizations related to East Asian affairs, including the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], the [[Asia Society]], and the [[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]]. He was also a major supporter of the [[Population Council]].

==Early life==
John Davison Rockefeller III was born in New York City on March 21, 1906, to the philanthropists [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] (1874–1960) and [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller|Abigail Greene "Abby" Aldrich]] (1874–1948). He had four younger brothers, [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller|Winthrop]], [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance]] and [[David Rockefeller|David]], and an elder sister, [[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé|Abby]]. Through his father, he was a grandson of [[Standard Oil]] co-founder [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] and schoolteacher [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman]]. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich|Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich]] and Abigail Pearce Truman "Abby" Chapman. He received his preparatory education at the [[Browning School]] in New York City and the [[Loomis Chaffee School]], Windsor, Connecticut, in 1925. He went to [[Princeton University]] where he received high honors in economics and graduated in 1929 with the degree of Bachelor of Science, choosing industrial relations as the subject of his senior thesis. His interest in industrial relations stemmed from the family's role in the [[Ludlow Massacre]], in which strikebreakers and security guards killed women and children of miners striking against the Rockefeller-controlled Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. Rockefeller's father worked to restore the family's public reputation by championing industrial relations and the work of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], a pioneer in the field.

Commencing a lifelong commitment to international relations, he undertook a world tour after graduating from college, which concluded with assignments for the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]] conference in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737976,00.html?iid=chix-digg "INTERNATIONAL: Pacific Parley"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', November 11, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional positions/activities==
John III was the next Rockefeller manager for all family undertakings of social relevance. Since 1929, in total he sat on twenty boards of various institutions, most of which were family-related. The more notable of these were:
*[[Rockefeller University]] - then the ''Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research'' (established by Senior);
*[[Colonial Williamsburg]] (John Jr., Abby);
*[[Riverside Church]] (John Jr.);
*[[International House of New York]] (John Jr.);
*General Education Board - later the ''International Education Board'' (Senior);
*[[China Medical Board]] (John Sr., John Jr.);
*Bureau of Social Hygiene (John Jr.);
*Industrial Relations Counselors (John Jr.).

John III was at one time a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Foreign Policy Association]] and the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], as well as being on the board of directors of [[Princeton University]]. In late 1950, he accompanied [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Douglas MacArthur]] on a trip to Japan to conclude a peace treaty, during which time he consulted with many Japanese leaders in practically every important sphere of that country's life.&lt;ref&gt;John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988 (pp.502-510)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a prominent third-generation family philanthropist in his own right and founder of the [[Asia Society]], the major institution he established in 1956 to foster greater cooperation between Asia and the United States. He also founded the [[Population Council]] in 1952, and a reconstituted [[Japan Society of New York|Japan Society]]. In addition, he set up the United Negro College Fund for the ongoing education of African Americans, carrying on the family tradition in this area with his grandfather's funding of the education of black women at [[Spelman College]] in Atlanta.

He was on his father's Advisory Committee in the [[Family Office|family office]], Room 5600. He was also president of the family's principal philanthropy run by family members, the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], from its inception in 1940 to 1956. In 1929, he joined the family's renowned [[Rockefeller Foundation]]; elected to the board in 1931 he subsequently became chairman of this major philanthropic organization for twenty years and was responsible for changing the focus of the institution.

The principal philanthropic institution he created was the JDR III Fund in 1963, its major program being the Asian Cultural Program, created in 1967 to encourage East-West cultural exchange. The Fund was wound-up upon his death in 1979, but the Cultural Program continued as the Asian Cultural Council, which has provided grant assistance to more than 4,000 Asians and Americans in the area of the arts. Funding for its programs is derived from a combination of endowment income and contributions from individuals, foundations and corporations in the United States and Asia.  	  	

In the mid-1950s, John III assumed the leadership of a committee of civic leaders who were working to create [[Lincoln Center]]. He became the key figure in the fund-raising efforts and in forging a consensus among the civic leaders and others who were essential to its success. The Center itself was built over a period from 1959 to 1966. He was its first president, commencing in 1956, and he became its chairman in 1961. He was chairman until 1970 when he was duly elected honorary chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockarch.org/bio/jdr3.php Rockefeller Archive Center biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Rockefeller III was responsible for the creation of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy (usually known as the Peterson Commission, headed by [[Peter G. Peterson]]) and the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs (usually known as the Filer Commission). He established the Rockefeller Public Service Awards in 1958. In 1959, he received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York". In 1976, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rockefeller College]] at Princeton University was named in his honor in 1982.

==Family==
On November 11, 1932, he married the socially connected [[Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller|Blanchette Ferry Hooker]] (1909&amp;ndash;1992), who was to serve as chairman of the [[Asian Cultural Council]] from 1980 to 1990, and who established the Blanchette H. Rockefeller Fellowship Fund, in Japan. They had one son and three daughters:

*Sandra Ferry Rockefeller
*[[Jay Rockefeller|John Davison "Jay" Rockefeller IV]] - a former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[West Virginia]] and a former two-term [[Governor of West Virginia|governor]] of that state
*[[Hope Aldrich Rockefeller]]
*[[Alida Rockefeller Messinger|Alida Ferry Rockefeller]]

==Death==
John Davison Rockefeller III was killed in an automobile accident in [[Mount Pleasant, New York]], (near the [[Kykuit|Rockefeller family estate]] in [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico]]), on July 10, 1978, at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John D. 3d, Manor teen killed|work=Ossining Citizen Register|date=July 11, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

'''Judaeus Bohemus Abraham''' (died 1533 ) was a Czech/Polish tax collector, banker and royal factor. In 1512 King Sigismund I the Old entrusted him with the Jewish tax collection in Wielkopolska and Mazovia. In 1514 he agreed to do it throughout the Crown, and in 1518 was given the privilege to settle in any place and conduct business. After the withdrawal from the service of the royals he settled in [[Lviv]], where he worked in the trade and credit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Polski Słownik Biograficzny]]''. T. 1.

The '''Liquid Roofing and Waterproofing Association (LRWA)''' is a UK member organisation of manufacturers of liquid applied coatings for buildings.  The association's aim is to educate and inform specifiers, contractors, and the industry as to the properties, correct applications, installation methods, and aftercare of [[liquid roofing|liquid waterproofing systems]].

==History==
The association was formed in the 1970s and was originally known as the '''BRCMA (Bituminous Roof Coating Manufacturers Association)'''. The primary purpose of the association was to promote good practice in all areas of the UK bituminous roof coatings industry.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the rise in popularity of non-bituminous products and in particular [[liquid roofing]].

Recognising this trend, the association reinvented itself as ELRA (European Liquid Roofing Association), now focusing solely on [[liquid roofing]] systems. The 'European' tag reflected the associations involvement in the drafting of European standards for all areas of [[liquid roofing]].

In 2005 a second reinvention took place as '''ELRA''' became '''ELWA (European Liquid Waterproofing Association)''' in recognition of the wider applications for liquid waterproofing products, for example the protection and [[waterproofing]] of [[car park]] decks.

In 2010 the association identified a need for an industry voice for [[liquid roofing]], which was and remains the fastest growing sector of the roofing market in the UK. The 'European' label was dropped as the association re-launched as '''LRWA (Liquid Roofing and Waterproofing Association)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrwa.org.uk/Our-History |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001231113/http://www.lrwa.org.uk/Our-History |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marketfield Street.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Marketfield Street]]

'''Marketfield Street''' is a short one-way, one-block-long [[alley|alleyway]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The street begins as a southern branch of Beaver Street, then veers east and north, ending at [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]]. Alternative past names include Exchange Street, Field Street, Fieldmarket Street, Oblique Road, and Petticoat Lane.&lt;ref name=fny&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forgotten-ny.com/1999/05/the-alleys-of-lower-manhattan-how-did-mill-lane-marketfield-strret-and-theatre-alley-get-their-names/ | title=The Alleys of Lower Manhattan | work=[[Forgotten NY]] | date=May 1999 | accessdate=21 April 2015 | author=Walsh, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Marketfield Street is a translation from the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite naming|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;  The street originally ran to the Dutch livestock market, ''Marcktveldt'', located near where [[Battery Park]] is now, which was then outside the walls of the city.&lt;ref name=fny/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;  The market operated from 1638 to 1647. In 1641, the [[Governor-General]] of [[New Netherland]], [[Willem Kieft]], opened the colony's first cattle market there.&lt;ref name=fny /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine, David T.| title = History of the City of New York | location = New York City | publisher = G. P. Putnam &amp; Company | year = 1853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By 1680, mainly poor people were living on Marketfield Street.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1688, the city's first French Huguenot church was built there.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | author = Griffiths, William Elliot | title = The Story of the Walloons: at Home in Lands of Exile and in America|year=1923|pages=205, 340|publisher=Houghton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1776, Marketfield Street was part of the area devastated by the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|Great Fire of New York]], which engulfed the southwestern tip of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, a [[hurricane]] hit the [[East Coast (United States)|East Coast]], destroying the street's dock.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | author = Ludlum, David M. | title = Early American Hurricanes, 1492-1870 | location = Boston | publisher = American Meteorological Society | year = 1963 | pages = 85, 212}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, Marketfield Street, which overlooked the [[Hudson River]], had a single name throughout its length,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | chapter= 8 | title = Laws of the State of New York | location = Albany | publisher = E. Croswell | year = 1830 | pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the 1830s, the street was renamed "Battery Place" from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] to the Hudson River.&lt;ref name=fny/&gt; The 1882 construction of the New York City Produce Exchange demolished the block of the street that contained the French church.&lt;ref name=fny/&gt; 

In the 20th century, 70 Broad Street, between Marketfield and Beaver Street, became the headquarters of the [[American Bank Note Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.45, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melchor de Concha y Toro''' (October 10, 1833 – July 21, 1892) was a Chilean [[businessman]], [[lawyer]], and politician, and the Marquis of Casa Concha by the Spanish Crown.

Son of [[Melchor Santiago de Concha y Cerda]] and of Damiana de Toro Guzmán. Studied at the [[Instituto Nacional]] (''National Institute'') and at the faculty of law of the [[University of Chile]], receiving his law degree on January 17, 1857. When he entered the [[University of Chile]] Faculty of Law, he presented a historical book commended by the university titled ''Chile during the years 1824 through 1828''.

His passion being business, he became the manager of Banco Garantizador. In 1869 he was nominated Minister of Finance by Chilean President [[José Joaquín Pérez]], until August 2, 1870.

Between 1861 and 1871 he belonged to the Conservative Party, but soon became a moderate liberal. He entered politics in 1864 after being elected representative of Melipilla. He was reelected as representative until 1886, when he was elected to the Senate representing Santiago. In 1879 he was president of the ''Bolivian Huanchaca Company''. In 1891 he resigned his post in support of the congressional side of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] against then president [[José Manuel Balmaceda]].

He died in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on July 21, 1892.

== Concha y Toro Winery ==

In 1883, the Marquis Melchor de Concha y Toro entered the wine-making industry by deciding to plant grapevines in the [[Maipo River]] valley. He brought seeds to Chilé from the Bordeaux region of France and hired a French ethnologist Monsieur Labouchere. From this personal project, the [[Concha y Toro]] winery was born.

He constructed a mansion in 1875 in [[Pirque]] to live with his wife, Emiliana Subercaseaux. The mansion stands out by its extensive gardens and its rural Chilean style as well as some French touches.

'''Mirta De Perales''' (September 2, 1922 – May 3, 2011), born '''Mirta Raya Casanova''' in [[Rancho Veloz]], Las Villas Province, Cuba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariaargeliavizcaino.com/Mirta_de_Perales.html|title=Mirta de Perales ejemplo de esfuerzo, bondad y patriotismo|first=María Argelia|last=Vizcaíno|language=Spanish|website=mariaargeliavizcaino.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a hairdresser, cosmetologist and businesswoman. She owned an eponymous brand, Mirta  de Perales beauty care products,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mirtadeperales.us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mirta grew up impoverished in Cuba, her parents could not even afford to buy her shoes. When she was 12 years old her mother left to work in Havana and left Mirta in charge of her brothers and sister. Having always been interested in women’s beauty and appearances, it was at that moment she discovered she could make a few cents cutting and styling her neighbors’ hair to help her family. After a few days of styling hair around her neighborhood she had earned a few dollars and called her mother to come home because they “were now rich”. 

She then met Benito Perales, a pharmacist whom she’d marry.  Benito helped her create the products that would eventually make her famous. She later opened her beauty salon in Havana, which grew to be one of the biggest beauty salons of Latin America.

In 1962 the Cuban government intervened and took possession of her beauty salon and took Mirta as a prisoner. She spent nine days in El Morro, a prison for those they considered anti-revolutionaries. That experience was what motivated her to leave Cuba. 

Mirta left Cuba with her two children and only five dollars in her pocket. About one week after arriving in Miami, Florida she was already cutting and styling hair again, slowly rebuilding her clientele. After a couple of years she was able to open her beauty salon in Coral Gables, Florida. During that time she also began to redevelop her hair products. Thanks to her savvy business sense and her undeniable charisma she was able to rebuild her business and begin distributing her products in Puerto Rico. Shortly thereafter Mirta quickly began distributing her products nationwide, beginning in New York, where she was able to showcase her products in Macy’s located in Herald Square. 

Always looking for a new way to connect with her audience, Mirta started her TV show “Cinco Minutos Con Mirta de Perales” (Five Minutes with Mirta de Perales). This TV show allowed Mirta to establish a relationship with her clients, explain how to use her products, and discuss day-to-day issues. At this time Mirta also created beauty contest giving children the opportunity to travel to Miami and Orlando for a week long competition to become a “Chico Mirta”. The winner of the competition would appear on Mirta’s TV show and would also have an appearance on one of Mirta’s TV commercials. 

Mirta de Perales’ legacy was recognized by President Ronald Reagan in a ceremony at the White House wherein he claimed she was “The American Dream”. 

Today, Mirta’s legacy continues through her daughter, Mirta C. Perales, “Mirtica”, who as a child worked alongside her mother with everything concerning the company. Mirtica, following her mother’s footsteps, is always looking for new products and information to help fulfill women’s hair care and skincare needs, specifically focusing on the Latin woman. 

==Death==
She died on May 3, 2011.

'''Pehr (Per) Georg Scheutz''' (23 September 1785 &amp;ndash; 22 May 1873) was a 19th-century Swedish lawyer, translator, and inventor, who is now best known for his pioneering work in computer technology.

==Life==
Scheutz studied law at [[Lund University]], graduating in 1805. He then worked as a [[Lawyer|legal expert]] and [[translator]] (he translated several works of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]]) before turning predominantly to liberal [[politics]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

[[File:Scheutz mechanical calculator.png|thumb|Scheutz's calculator]]

He is most known for his inventions; the best known of these is the '''[[Scheutzian calculation engine]]''', invented in 1837 and finalized in 1843. This machine, which he constructed with his son Edvard Scheutz, was based on [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]]. In 1851 they obtained funds from government to build an improved model, which was created in 1853 (was roughly the size of a piano), and subsequently demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|World's Fair in Paris, 1855]]. The machine was then sold in 1856 to the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut1wgt6kSBEC&amp;pg=PA12#v=snippet&amp;q=difference%20engine&amp;f=false|title=Specimens of Tables, Calculated, Stereomoulded, and Printed by Machinery|last=Scheutz|first=George|last2=Scheutz|first2=Edward|date=1857|publisher=Whitnig|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Preface 8-12,14-15; p. 3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.639.3286|title=First Printing Calculator|last=Merzbach|first=Uta C.|authorlink= Uta Merzbach |last2=Zoology|first2=Smithsonian Contributions To|last3=Ripley|first3=S.

The devices were used for creating [[logarithm]]ic tables.

While the machine was not perfect and could not produce complete tables, [[Martin Wiberg]] reworked the construction from the ground up and in 1875 created a compact device which would print complete tables.

Scheutz was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1856.

'''Product ecosystem theory''' is an emerging theory that describes how the design of [[Durable goods|manufactured products]] evolves over time and draws parallels with how [[species]] evolve within a natural [[ecosystem]]. Fundamental to this theory is that [[manufactured product]] lines respond to external threats and opportunities in much the same way that species respond to threats and opportunities. Competition and other environmental pressures may cause a species to become extinct. An example of the parallel in [[Durable goods|consumer products]] is the way in which the typewriter became displaced (or extinct) due to pressures from the personal computer. 
Products lines can be seen to incrementally change and branch over time following the principle of [[phyletic gradualism]]. Or they can be seen to have periods of stasis followed by disruptive innovation. This follows the principle of [[punctuated equilibrium]]

Ecosystem Theory provides a conceptual framework that helps designers and others understand the mechanisms underpinning product innovation in a tangible and visual way. 
 
Technology change is one of the environmental variables that provide both opportunity and threat for products in much the same way that environmental variables such as climate provide opportunity and threat for species.
Evaluating designed products from this perspective is useful as it shows that the value of a product is not contained entirely within the product itself. Value is also obtained from the rest of the ecosystem.

== History and usage of the term ==

The term was first used in this context by Tim Williams in 2013 in a paper he wrote with Marianella Chamorro-Koc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Tim|last2=Chamorro-Koc|first2=Marianella|title=Product ecosystems : an emerging methodological approach to study the implementation of disruptive innovations : the case of the CityCar.|journal=Consilience and innovation in design : proceedings and program : 5th IASDR 2013 Tokyo  Shibaura Institute of Technology.|date=2013|pages=1286–1295|publisher=5th International Congress of IASDR 2013|location=[Shuppanchi fumei]|isbn=978-4-9980776-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper proposed a methodology for understanding the difficulties of implementation for disruptive innovation based on a case study of the [[CityCar|MIT City Car]]. The term has been used non-specifically prior to this on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Feng|journal=Research in Engineering Design|date=2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=43–61|doi=10.1007/s00163-010-0096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobias|first1=Jim|title=Accessibility and Product Ecosystems|journal=The Information Society|date=26 April 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=183–186|doi=10.1080/01972240701323598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armano|first1=David|title=Building responsive and resilient brands in a connected world|url=http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/|website=Logic and Emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryszard Przecicki was born in the Free City of Danzig (present-day [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk, Poland]]) to [[Jewish]] parents Leon and Paula on 10&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1934.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/the-great-enabler/story-e6frg6z6-1225704689901|title=Richard Pratt, the great enabler|newspaper=The Australian|date=29 April 2009|publisher=News Limited|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family immigrated to Australia in 1938 seeking safe refuge from the Nazis and settled in [[Shepparton, Victoria]], changing their surname from Przecicki to Pratt. Pratt had a rough journey travelling to Australia without getting caught by the Nazis. The family faced food shortages en route. Pratt was educated at Grahamvale Primary School, [[Shepparton High School]] and [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]] and enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/honcausa/citation/pratt.html|accessdate=17 March 2007|title=Richard Pratt profile|year=2004|publisher=University Secretary's Office, [[University of Melbourne]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829195748/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/honcausa/citation/pratt.html|archivedate=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played [[Australian rules football]], as a ruckman. After starting his career at Lemnos (now the [[Shepparton Swans Football Club|Shepparton Swans]]), Pratt played for [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]]'s (VFL) under-19s competition. He was awarded the [[Morrish Medal]] in 1953 for being deemed the "[[best and fairest]]" U-19 player that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morrish Medal|work=AFL|publisher=Bigpond|url=http://www.afl.com.au/morrish%20medal/tabid/270/default.aspx|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt did not continue his footballing career to senior VFL level, instead focusing on other interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Pratt combined study with acting with the [[Melbourne Theatre Company|Union Theatre Repertory Company]] and working as salesman for the family business, [[Visy Industries|Visy Board]]. After touring London and New York in 1957 with a production of [[Ray Lawler]]'s ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'', playing the role of Johnnie Dowd, he returned to Melbourne and Visy. Following the death of his father Leon in February 1969 Pratt took over his father's business, which at that time had several hundred employees and an annual turnover of [[Australian dollar|A$]]5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy History|publisher=Visy|url=http://www.visy.com.au/?id=90|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Under Pratt's direction, Visy expanded from two factories in Melbourne to more than 55 plants across Australia, United States, New Zealand, and [[Papua New Guinea]]. From cardboard boxes and packaging, Visy moved into waste [[paper recycling]]. Later in the 1990s Pratt expanded his operations considerably into the [[New York (state)|New York]] waste paper business.

In 1993 the [[National Crime Authority of Australia|National Crime Authority]] (NCA) raided Pratt's offices in connection with an investigation into businessman [[John Dorman Elliott|John Elliott]]'s foreign exchange dealings and Elliott's spoiling domestic stake in [[Broken Hill Proprietary Company]] (BHP, now BHP Billiton) while Elliott's company, [[Elders IXL]], was insolvent.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boxed-in billionaire|publisher=News.com.au|date=22 December 2005|work=The Australian|page=009|first=Richard |last=Gluyas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, NCA paid costs and returned documents seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1536457.htm|title=Richard Pratt faces damaging investigation|work=The World Today|date=22 December 2005|first=Edmond|last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s, Visy was ordered by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) to pay a half million dollar fine for illegal anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"&gt;{{cite news|last=Washington|first=Stuart|title=Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?|newspaper=The Age|date=13 October 2007|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/who-really-foots-the-bill-for-pratts-philanthropy/2007/10/12/1191696178506.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|accessdate=29 April 2009|location=Melbourne|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105170321/http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/who-really-foots-the-bill-for-pratts-philanthropy/2007/10/12/1191696178506.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|archivedate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public career==
As well as his business interests, Pratt was known for his involvement in public service, having held posts including: foundation chancellor of [[Swinburne University of Technology]], president of the [[Victorian Arts Centre]] Trust, and Chairman of the Board of Management of the [[Mental Health Research Institute (Melbourne)|Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Through the [[Pratt Foundation]], the Pratt family are among Australia's leading philanthropists donating up to A$10 million a year. Pratt was named Environmental Visionary of the Year in 1998 by the Keep Australia Beautiful Campaign.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 8 February 2007 he was appointed president of the [[Carlton Football Club]]. On 20 June 2008, the Carlton Football Club announced that Richard Pratt would stand aside from the club until the charges of giving false and misleading evidence to [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] hearing were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spits|first=Scott|title=Pratt stands aside as Carlton chief|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 June 2008|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pratt-stands-aside-as-carlton-chief/2008/06/20/1213770889110.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175553/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pratt-stands-aside-as-carlton-chief/2008/06/20/1213770889110.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt also donated considerable funds to both major political parties (for example A$300,000 in Financial Year 2004-5),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2004/5|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|url=http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Donor.aspx?SubmissionID=7&amp;ClientID=21894|accessdate=12 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328172911/http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Donor.aspx?SubmissionID=7&amp;ClientID=21894|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to former [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]]'s  Liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Katharine|title=Howard to keep Pratt's donations|newspaper=The Age|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007/howard-to-keep-pratt-donations/2007/10/17/1192300841137.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|location=Melbourne|archivedate=5 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105170353/http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007/howard-to-keep-pratt-donations/2007/10/17/1192300841137.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 an investigation by ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper documented from internal company documents that Pratt maintained a multimillion-dollar network of advisors.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt; This included an $8,333.33 a month fee to [[Bob Hawke]] for consultation on "Asian and government matters", $27,220.03 for travel to the US for [[Gough Whitlam]] as business advisor on overseas markets, and other sums for former state premiers [[Nick Greiner]] and [[Rupert Hamer]].&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1959, Richard Pratt married Jeanne (née Lasker), a journalist, who was also a Jewish immigrant from Poland and was born in the town of lowich in Poland 1936, and before their marriage lived in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/life-after-richard/story-e6frf7jo-1225890005828|newspaper=Herald Sun|publisher=News Limited|title=Life after Richard|date=10 July 2010|author=Plant, Simon|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of Visy Industries, they enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, with a private jet and a range of apartments, including a penthouse at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York City;&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=James|last2=Stephens|first2=Tony|title=Tycoon with an immense, combative energy|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 April 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/tycoon-with-an-immense-combative-energy-20090428-alzn.html?page=-1|accessdate=29 April 2009|archivedate=4 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104091313/http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/tycoon-with-an-immense-combative-energy-20090428-alzn.html?page=-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; their main home was the historic mansion [[Raheen (estate)|Raheen]], in the Melbourne suburb of [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]],&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt; the former residence of Roman Catholic Archbishop [[Daniel Mannix]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; The Pratts have had three children, [[Anthony Pratt (businessman)|Anthony]], Heloise Waislitz, who was married to businessman and Collingwood Football club Vice President [[Alex Waislitz]], and Fiona Geminder.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another daughter, Paula, was born in 1997 to his longtime mistress, socialite Shari-Lea Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornery|first=Andrew|last2=Cubby|first2=Ben|title=Space invaders|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 June 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/spike/space-invaders/2005/06/26/1119724527096.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106175242/http://www.smh.com.au/news/spike/space-invaders/2005/06/26/1119724527096.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this affair became the subject of widespread media attention owing to a court case involving Ms Hitchcock and a nanny hired to look after her daughter. At the time, Pratt was accused of trying to pay hush money to the nanny who had launched legal action against Ms Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple speak out on mistress|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=7 August 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22540312-2,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504023357/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22540312-2,00.html|archivedate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt was the godfather of Deborah Beale, who is the former wife of [[Bill Shorten]] and daughter of [[Julian Beale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/mps-woes-pose-dilemma-for-billionaire/story-e6frg6nf-1111117577876|title=MP's marital woes pose dilemma for billionaire|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a well-publicised battle with prostate cancer, Richard Pratt died at his Kew residence on 28 April 2009,&lt;ref name="passing"&gt;{{cite news|title=billionaire Richard Pratt dies after prostate cancer battle|work=news.com.au|date=29 April 2009|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25400857-421,00.html|accessdate=28 April 2009|archivedate=2 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502003023/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25400857-421,00.html|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day after all charges against him had been dropped due to his ill-health.

==Philanthropy==
He donated A$10 million every year through the [[Pratt Foundation]] to refugees, artists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardpratttribute.com/ |title=Visy – For a better World |website=Richardpratttribute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation was established in 1978 by Jeanne and Richard Pratt as a vehicle for their philanthropy. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Pratts became known in Australia for funding the arts, medical research and higher education. Since then the Pratt family has donated about A$200 million to worthy causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Swinburne Institute of Technology|url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/chancellery/mediacentre/alumni/news/2011/08/jeanne-pratt-awarded-honorary-doctorate|title=Jeanne Pratt awarded honorary doctorate|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for price fixing==
In December 2005 the ACCC commenced a civil penalty proceeding against Visy companies, Pratt, and others, for alleged involvement in a [[cartel]] in the packaging industry.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|2617|2007|litigants=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2007, Pratt was formally accused of [[price fixing]], cheating customers and companies out of approximately A$700 million in the nation's biggest-ever cartel case.&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt cardboard deal may have cost $700m"&gt;{{cite news|last=Binnie|first=Craig|last2=Royall|first2=Ian|last3=Whinnett|first3=Ellen|last4=Mickelburough|first4=Peter|title=Richard Pratt cardboard deal may have cost $700m|publisher=Herald Sun|date=10 August 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22560327-2862,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCC alleged "very serious contraventions" of the law and that these had been "carefully and deliberately concealed" by Visy senior executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Cameron|title=Pratt buttoned up and beaten|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22599836-601,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACCC counsel further stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There can be no suggestion that Visy acted in ignorance of its obligations under the act"&lt;ref name="Watchdog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Speedy|first=Blair|title=Watchdog puts $36m bite on Pratt|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22599425-5013404,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''
and further added that the deliberate use of pre-paid [[mobile phones]] that could not be traced and the holding of meetings in private homes, motel rooms and suburban parks
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"...provides a strong indication that Visy was fully aware that the conduct was illegal".&lt;ref name="Watchdog"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

After more than a year of denials Pratt subsequently admitted his guilt, acknowledging he and his company, and "rival" company [[Amcor]] deliberately broke the law.&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt to admit breaking law"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Cameron|title=Richard Pratt to admit breaking law|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=6 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22539478-601,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt was aggrieved by the criminal prosecution and its effect on his reputation, stating:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"I feel very angry—Visy is seen as Richard Pratt's company—there is a certain amount of character assassination for me personally because I am a tall poppy in the community; it's a big scalp (for the ACCC). My reputation is something I have been building for 50 years and so I am worried that the general public will now see me as a rich person who has made his money doing something that is wrong in the eyes of the law."&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt to admit breaking law"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

On 2 November 2007, Pratt and the Visy group received an A$36 million fine, representing both the largest fine in Australian history and an estimated 0.75% of the Pratt fortune.&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt, Visy fined $36m|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=Adelaide Now|date=2 November 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22690569-911,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archivedate=13 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413015441/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22690569-911,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy in $300m cartel class action suit|publisher=NineMSN|date=29 November 2007|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=72669|accessdate=29 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226135241/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=72669|archivedate=26 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Federal Court|Federal Court]] judge Justice Heerey said Pratt and his senior executives were knowingly concerned in the cartel, which involved price fixing and market sharing.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; "''This is the worst cartel to come before the courts in 30-plus years''", Justice Heerey said. Additionally, customers of Visy initiated claims against Visy and Amcor, including a $120 million suit by [[Cadbury Schweppes]] against [[Amcor]].&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"/&gt;

===Criminal prosecution for impropriety===
On 19 June 2008, Pratt was charged with lying about his knowledge of a price-fixing scandal.&lt;ref name="billionaire Dick Pratt faces jail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Norrie|work=Herald Sun|date=20 June 2008|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23892386-2862,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|title=Billionaire Dick Pratt faces jail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt had been facing four separate charges under Section 5 of the Act, the penalty for each charge ranges from a fine of $2,200 to 12 months' jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2281400.htm|title=Pratt pledges to fight charges|work=[[PM (ABC radio)]]|date=20 June 2008|first=Samantha|last=Donovan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2009, this criminal prosecution of Pratt for charges of impropriety (lying to the ACCC during its successful investigation into the Visy/Amcor price fixing scandal) were abandoned on account of his poor health and impending death. However, Commonwealth Prosecutor Mark Dean SC told the Federal Court the [[Department of Public Prosecutions#Australia|Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions]] (CDPP) believed the prosecution would have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor drops criminal charges against dying Richard Pratt|agency=Australian Associated Press|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=27 April 2009|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dpp-drops-charges-against-dying-pratt/story-e6frg6n6-1225704339699|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt died the following day.

==Honours==
Pratt was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) in 1985, and a Companion of the Order (AC) in 1998. Jeanne Pratt is also an AC recipient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1040411&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true Companion of the Order of Australia: PRATT, Jeanne], 10 June 2002. ''For outstanding leadership in the arts, for development of opportunities for young artistic talent on stage and in the orchestral field, and for service to the community through charitable and non-profit organisations.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, he returned his awards in February 2008 after he was fined $36 million for price fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazette, Special S 40|work=Commonwealth of Australia|publisher=Attorney-General's Department|date=22 February 2008|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/file/2008GN08|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/pratt-gives-up-honours/story-e6frf7kx-1111115636502 "Billionaire Richard Pratt surrenders Order of Australia awards"], heraldsun.com.au, 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2007, he was awarded the [[Woodrow Wilson Awards#Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship|Woodrow Wilson Medal]] for [[Corporate Citizenship]].&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodrow Wilson Awards|publisher=Wilson Center|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=awards.awards|accessdate=29 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217065746/http://wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=awards.awards|archivedate=17 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is given to executives who "by their examples and their business practices, have shown a deep concern for the common good beyond the bottom line. They are at the forefront of the idea that private firms should be good citizens in their own neighborhoods and in the world at large".&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

In April 2010, to mark the first anniversary of his death, the inaugural Richard Pratt Memorial Oration was delivered at the [[University of Melbourne]] by the president of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Professor Menahem Ben-Sasson. During the oration, Pratt was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.melbourne.edu/news/n-286 "Richard Pratt to be awarded posthumous honorary doctorate from Hebrew University of Jerusalem", University of Melbourne], melbourne.edu; accessed 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry Impact ==
The Council produces original research in the form of white papers and regular surveys of its members.  This research is used by industry analysts to identify and interpret technology trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/as-collaboration-goes-social-where-will-it-thrive/1497 |title=As collaboration goes social, where will it thrive? |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrewmcafee.org/2010/04/whats_going_on/ |title=What's Going On |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/198622/enterprises_slowly_adopting_social_tech.html |title=Enterprises Slowly Adopting Social Tech |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some influential Council members have taken professional positions at enterprise collaboration vendors (ex: [[Yammer]], [http://www.moxiesoft.com/ Moxie]), which necessitated their departure from the Council due to its ongoing "no vendors allowed" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/01/thoughts-on-paul-greenbergs-cr.php |title=Thoughts on Paul Greenberg's CRM 2011 Watchlist |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/recruiting/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=229215134 |title=Yammer Beefs Up Executive Suite |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Committee of 200''' is an invitation only [[membership organization]] of the world's most successful women [[entrepreneur]]s and corporate leaders. The Committee of 200's more than 450 members represent over 100 industries in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]] and its members generate more than $200 billion in annual revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Russel Inducted to The Committee of 200|url=http://www.adeccousa.com/articles/Joyce-Russel-Inducted-to-the-Committee-of-200.html?id=118&amp;url=/pressroom/pressreleases/Archives/Forms/AllItems.aspx&amp;templateurl=/AboutUs/pressroom/Pages/Press-release.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1982, a handful of the most powerful [[women in business]] gathered in [[Los Angeles]]. Their immediate goal was to raise funds for The [[National Association of Women Business Owners]], a network dedicated to women entrepreneurs. Beyond raising $200,000 for NAWBO, the small group of women ultimately conceived a larger agenda: to create a national network that would capitalize on the experience of women at the top echelons of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNBD|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/771/000128387/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

The primary mission of C200 is success shared: to foster, celebrate and advance women's leadership in business. C200 members are uniquely connected to each other through the organization by the commonality of their careers. C200 offers current leaders access to unique programming plus a professional and personal network of their peers.

The committee takes part in reach out programs across the United States and in other select areas to MBA and college students as well as high school students. In the past they've visited colleges such as [[Stanford University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], [[Duke University]], [[University of Chicago]], and [[London Business School]]. C200 has also visited with high schools such as [[The Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders|The Ann Richards School]] and [[The Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.c200.org/C200/Our_Foundation/Campus_Reachouts/C200/Our_Foundation/Campus_Reachouts.aspx?hkey=9e6956be-602a-4b8a-b8c0-7044fd7e0473&lt;/ref&gt;

==C200 Foundation==

In 1987, C200 launched the C200 Foundation to provide women with tools to become successful entrepreneurs and corporate leaders. C200 co-sponsors one-day Reachouts for women MBA students. Seminars rotate among the nation’s top [[business school]]s, and at the seminar they award C200 Scholar Awards to enterprising first year women MBAs enrolled at the hosting school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bizologie:  The Committee of 200|url=http://www.bizologie.com/c200-the-committee-of-200/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Solid Gold Cadillac''''' is a 1956 film directed by [[Richard Quine]] and written by [[Abe Burrows]], [[Howard Teichmann]] and [[George S. Kaufman]]. It was adapted from the hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play of the same name by Teichmann and Kaufman, in which they pillory [[big business]] and corrupt businessmen. The film stars [[Judy Holliday]] and [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]]. The film is in black-and-white except for the very last scene, which is in [[Technicolor]].

==Plot==
At a [[shareholder]]s meeting for International Projects, a billion dollar corporation, John T. Blessington ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) announces that he is replacing Edward L. McKeever ([[Paul Douglas]]), the company's founder, President and Chairman of the Board, who is resigning to work for the federal government in [[Washington D.C.]] Laura Partridge ([[Judy Holliday]]), a minority [[stockholder]] with just ten shares of stock, drives its arrogant, self-serving executives to distraction with her incessant questioning during this and subsequent meetings.

Blessington comes up with the idea of hiring the struggling actress as Director of Shareholder Relations to keep her occupied answering letters from small shareholders. He assigns her a secretary, Amelia Shotgraven ([[Neva Patterson]]), with secret instructions to obstruct her as much as possible. The conscientious Miss Partridge, discovering there is nothing for her to do, decides to write the stockholders herself. She gains Amelia's friendship and wholehearted assistance by helping her develop a romantic relationship with office manager Mark Jenkins ([[Arthur O'Connell]]).

When the directors find out, they fire Amelia. However, Laura discovers that Blessington's thoroughly unqualified brother-in-law, Harry Harkness ([[Hiram Sherman]]), has driven a competitor into bankruptcy, unaware that International Projects actually owns the unfortunate company. With that as leverage, she gets Amelia rehired.

Still determined to neutralize Laura, the Board decides to send her to Washington to persuade McKeever to give them some government contracts. She agrees to go, with the secret intention of trying to convince him to return and take back control from his crooked cronies. However, the company Directors recall that he has divested himself of all his shares and is thus powerless, so they brush him off.

McKeever takes them to court, arguing that Laura was an unlicensed, illegal lobbyist; but, when she is forced to admit on the stand that she had another, romantic, reason for seeing him, the case is dropped. However, Laura has forged a warm relationship with many of the smaller investors while working at the company; they responded and sent in their [[Proxy voting|proxies]], giving her the right to vote their shares. McKeever uses these votes to replace the entire Board. He marries Laura. As a gift to "The Girl Who Has Everything," her husband presents her a Solid Gold Cadillac for her birthday.

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Holliday highly, stating, "the invincible Miss Holliday has dared to project her youthful figure and personality into the character shaped by Miss Hull" ([[Josephine Hull]], then in her seventies, played the role in the Broadway play) and is "knocking the role completely dead."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=The Solid Gold Cadillac (1956) |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 25, 1956 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9E0DE1DE1138E033A05756C2A9669D946792D6CF&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he felt that the villains of the piece were neither particularly convincing ("not precisely representatives of the workaday financial world"), original ("cut from a fairly familiar stencil of Kaufmanesque farce"), or formidable enough ("The problems set up by the play-wrights are little barriers of cardboard farce").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He concluded, "it will give you an entertaining ride, but don't expect it to take you or your intelligence very far."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The [[Film4]] reviewer agreed that the story was not particularly convincing ("Yeah – like global capitalism gets overthrown that easily"), but "even so, it's undemanding and amusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1956/solid-gold-cadillac-the |title=Solid Gold Cadillac, The |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thor Jensen and Margrét Þorbjörg Kristjánsdóttir.png|thumb|A relief of Thor Jensen and Margrét Þorbjörg Kristjánsdóttir by Sigurjón Ólafsson from the memorial in Hallargarður, Reykjavík.]]

'''Thor Philip Axel Jensen''' (3 December 1863 – 12 September 1947) was a [[Danes|Danish]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] who moved to [[Iceland]] at an early age and became famous there for his business activities during the first half of the twentieth century: he all but introduced big business, and even modern capitalism, to the country. His company Kveldúlfur hf. was the biggest in Iceland during the inter-war years. His descendants include some of Iceland's most powerful and well known figures.

==Early life==

Thor's father, Jens Chr. Jensen, was a master builder. Thor had eleven siblings and four half-sisters. Thor did well in his studies but lost his father at the age of eight. Two years later, he was sent to a free boarding school for orphans in [[Copenhagen]]. In 1878, at the end of his studies and after reaching confirmation age, Thor was sent to [[Borðeyri]], a small trading settlement in the north-west of Iceland, because his headmaster knew an Icelandic merchant there.

Thor adapted quickly to Iceland, learning [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and reading [[Sagas of Icelanders|medieval Icelandic sagas]]. A certain widow moved to Borðeyri with two children in tow—a boy and a girl. The girl was called [[Margrét Þorbjörg Kristjánsdóttir]]; she and Thor fell in love, and remained together for over sixty years, having twelve children.

==Businesses==
[[File:Fríkirkjuvegur 11.png|thumb|The house originally built in 1908 by Thor Philip Axel Jensen, Fríkirkjuvegur 11, Reykjavík, Iceland.]]
Thor and Margrét moved to [[Akranes]] where Thor started a shop. Business went well at first, but around 1900 Thor was bankrupted when a ship carrying his goods was lost. Thor moved with his family to [[Hafnarfjörður]] where they lived until Thor got back on his feet and established a new shop in [[Reykjavík]]. Fishing at this time in Iceland was in transition from being 'a secondary occupation for farmers' to being 'an industry in its own right'.&lt;ref&gt;Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, 'The Elves' Point of View: Cultural Identity in Contemporary Icelandic Elf-Tradition', ''Fabula: Zeitschrift für Erzählsforschung/Journal of Folklore Studies/Revue d'Etudes sur le Conte Populaire'', 41 (2000), 87-104, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Thor was known for his energy and 'two of the most powerful fishing businessmen in Seltjarnarnes, Guðmundur Einarsson í Nesi and Þórður Jónasson í Ráðagerði, said that they would buy fishing equipment from him if he offered it at a competitive price'.&lt;ref&gt;'[t]veir af öflugustu útvegsbændum á Seltjarnarnesi, Guðmundur Einarsson í Nesi og Þórður Jónasson í Ráðagerði sögðust skildu kaupa af honum útgerðarvörur ef hann byði þær á samkeppnishæfu verði', Guðmundur Magnússon. ''Thorsararnir'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Guðmundur gave Thor the use of his premises on the corner of Austurstræti and Veltusund in Reykjavík, and both he and Þórður invested 500 krónur to start the company. Thor called the company Godthaab-verzlunin after the street Godthaabsvej in [[Frederiksberg]] in Copenhagen. The company did well and Thor was soon the richest person in Iceland. In 1908 he built himself a splendid house at Fríkirkjuvegur 11, by [[Tjörnin]], now in the Hallargarður sculpture park.

With Pétur J. Thorsteinsson, Thor was a founder member of the fishing and fish-processing company PJ Thorsteinsson &amp; Co, otherwise known as the [[Milljónarfélagið]], in 1907. The company's name came about because it aimed to achieve a share capital of ISK1m, which would have equalled Iceland's state budget---though that goal was never quite achieved. Through it, Thor took a role in the design of the Jóni forseti, Iceland's first trawler; established a harbour at [[Viðey]]; and built Iceland's only railway line. Pétur and Thor got on badly; Pétur left, and four years later, the company was bankrupt; both partners lost money, but Pétur the more. 'At the time, there was an investigation into the affair, where Jensen famously couldn’t remember a thing about the whole debacle.' Later, in his autobiography, Jensen argued, implausibly, that the bankruptcy was in no way his fault.&lt;ref&gt;http://uti.is/2011/08/historical-parallels-in-the-thor%E2%80%99s-saga/&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a founder member of [[Eimskip]] but was not elected to the board on account of his origins, and took no further role in the company.

In later years Thor focused on making Korpúlfsstaður the largest dairy in Iceland. He put considerable resources behind this and achieved his goal. Thor died one night after a stroke. Out of respect, his numerous businesses closed the day of his funeral, which took place on 18 September 1947.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timarit.is/?issueID=410669&amp;pageSelected=6&amp;lang=0: 'Fjöldi tilkynninga frá fyrirtækjum', ''Morgunblaðið'', 18 September 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land purchases==

Thor became noted for buying up large tracts of land.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiography, he aspired to own all the lands supposedly claimed on [[Snæfellsnes]] by the ninth-century settler [[Bjǫrn the Easterner]], so as to follow in the footsteps of the ''[[Settlement of Iceland|landnámsmenn]]''. Thus in 1914, he bought Bjarnarhöfn, along with various uninhabited plots and islands: Guðnýjarstaðir, Efrakot, Neðrakot, Hrútey, Hafnareyjar, and the inhabited Ármýrar, for 18,000 krónur. In the following years, he bought the neighbouring Fjarðarhorn, Árnabotn, Hraunsfjörð, Selvelli, Seljahraun and Kothraun. He used these lands for sheep farming. Thor also bought lands at [[Borgarnes]].&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909, Thor began buying up land and fishing rights along the Haffjarðará, one of Iceland's most famed salmon rivers, until he owned all the fishing on the river. The river became the focus of his family's summer holidays, and for line-fishing by paying visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==

Thor and Margrét had twelve children, and together the parents and children are known in Icelandic as the ''Thorsararnir''; they and their descendents include some of Iceland's most prominent figures, chronicled by Guðmundur Magnússon.&lt;ref&gt;''Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög'' (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The children were: Camilla Therese (20 April 1887 – 1968), Richard (29 April 1888 – 1970), Kjartan (26 April 1890 – 1971), [[Ólafur Thors|Ólafur (Tryggvason)]] (19 January 1892 – 1964), Haukur (21 March 1896 – 1970), Kristín (16 February 1899 – 1972), Kristjana (23 July 1900 – 1989), [[Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson|Margrét Þorbjörg]] (22 April 1902 – 1996), [[Thor Thors|Thor (Harald)]] (26 November 1903 – 1965), Lorentz (4 July 1904 – 1970), Louise Andrea (24 August 1906 – 1907), and (Louis) Hilmar (7 July 1908 – 1939).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arnastofnun.is/page/aettarnofn_a_islandi; 'Margrét Þorbjörg Thors', ''Morgunblaðið'', 10 September 1996, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thor's son [[Ólafur Thors]] was Iceland's prime minister five times; Ólafur's daughter [[Margrét Þorbjörg Thors]] was married to the pilot [[Tony Jonsson]]; another son, [[Thor Thors]], was Iceland's first Permanent Representative to the United Nations. His grandchildren include Elina Hallgrímsdottir, [[Margrét Þóra Hallgrímsson]], wife of [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] and mother of [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]]; and the author [[Thor Vilhjálmsson]], whose son [[Guðmundur Andri Thorsson]] is also a noted author.

For the most part, the period of the greatest power, wealth, and influence of the Thorsararnir had run its course by the 1970s, though the descendants of Thor and Margrét now number several hundred.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, ''Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög'' (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in popular culture==

Thor Jensen and his great-grandson [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] are the subject of the 2011 documentary film ''Thor's Saga'' by Ulla Boje Rasmussen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upfrontfilms.dk/films2.php?mit_indhold_id=2&amp;films_id=13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toy advertising''' is the [[advertising|promotion]] of [[toys]] through a variety of media.  [[Advertising campaign]]s for toys have been criticised for trading on children's [[naivete]] and for turning children into premature [[consumer]]s. [[Advertising to children]] is usually regulated to ensure that it meets defined standards of honesty and decency. These rules vary from country to country, with some going as far as banning all advertisements that would be directed to children.

==Brief history==

[[File:Mechanical Tin Toy Locomotive, 1900.png|thumb|Mechanical Tin Toy Locomotive, as pictured in a 1900 wholesale catalog]]

The commercial sale and marketing of children's toys only became popular in the mid-18th century. Prior to this, children had access to relatively few toys, and of those toys in use, most were hand-made, either by the child or a close relative. &lt;ref&gt;Kline, S., ''Out of the Garden: Toys, TV, and Children's Culture in the Age of Marketing,'' 
London, Verso, 1995, p. 145; Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 12-14 &lt;/ref&gt; Toys that were in common use from at least medieval times were very basic items such as hoops, tops, balls and dolls which could be turned out by local carpenters or coopers. A scattering of toy shops traded in 17th-century London, but were virtually unknown outside the capital. A small quantity of mechanical toys were imported from France and Germany, but these were expensive and beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest families. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader interest in children's toys and games coincided with the emergence of a middle class when fewer children were expected to work. The 18th-century attitude to toys was that they should educational. Accordingly toymakers designed their products to prepare children for adult life. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a rocking-horse taught children to balance and prepared them for horse-riding. A doll prepared girls for motherhood and child-rearing while toy soldiers taught young boys about the military. Virtually, from the outset, commercially produced toys were remarkably gendered. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, p. 52; p.67 and p.80&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Dinky 25a.jpg|thumb|left|Dinky die-cast truck with 1937 catalog]]
By the mid-nineteenth century, technological developments such as the invention of sheet metal stamping machines facilitated the mass production of inexpensive toys, notably [[tin toy]]s or [[penny toys]]. Other technological developments included the advent of papier mache and "India" rubber moulding machines which effectively lowered the costs of manufacturing dolls.  To stimulate demand for toys, it was necessary to encourage parents to purchase toys for their children. However, to do that, it was necessary to change attitudes to toys; to promulgate the idea that children were children rather than 'adults in training' and that toys were developmentally useful. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Toy manufacturers were late-comers to modern marketing and advertising techniques. The earliest commercial toymakers relied on standardised mass production manufacturing techniques, with its emphasis on achieving economies through long production. Designs and models were changed rarely. Toy design was conservative; and always aimed at securing parent approval. Toymakers rarely attended the international exhibitions. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Early advertising appeared in wholesale and retail catalogs where advertisements appeared alongside mousetraps and match holders. Advertising messages were targeted at parents and spoke of the educational value as well as the toy's durability. Toy advertising rarely showed children using the toys. The tenor of toy advertising and marketing was that adults decided what toys were appropriate for children. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic and social changes were beginning to affect attitudes to toys and children's play throughout the 19th-century. The decreasing size of families meant that children had fewer siblings and that toys became an important diversion and source of entertainment. Rising living standards and wages meant that parents had more disposable income. Middle-class children remained in education for longer periods, with the implication that they had less time to make their own toys, and were more reliant on commercially manufactured toys. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th-century, parents were beginning to appreciate the special needs of childhood and that toys were more than just the preparation for the real world, but that they could also offer a retreat from mundane realities. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dark Vador Lego Cusset.JPG|thumb|[[Lego]]'s [[Darth Vader]]]]
In the 1890s and early 1900s, a toy trade press emerged on both sides of the Atlantic. In England, the ''Toy Trades Journal'' first appeared in March, 1891; the ''Sports Trader'' appeared in 1907 and the short-lived ''Games, Toys and Amusements'' journal appeared in 1908. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; In America, ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]]'' magazine was launched in 1902. These trade-oriented journals began to publish articles advising toymakers and toy retailers on methods for optimising sales of children's toys. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, ''Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, toymakers were beginning to adopt modern marketing practices. Manufacturers and distributors began using mail-order catalogues to reach consumers directly. [[Montgomery Ward]], for example, produced a catalog listing 23,000 items including toys. The new department stores began to include toys in window displays in which goods were featured as part of an artistic fantasy. Toymakers began to develop a unique style or personality that could be linked to a company name or brand. Advertising for toys began to appear in consumer magazines. Advertising messages encouraged mothers to take their children shopping with them, and to watch how the child interacted with toys in order to identify the child's preferences. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G., ''Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood'' Harvard University Press, 2009, p.30; Brown, K.D., ''The British Toy Business: A History Since 1700,'' London, Hambledon Press, 1996, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, the traditional approach of marketing through mothers (also known as the "gatekeeper model") was waning. Children, who by this time, were the recipients of  pocket-money, made individual purchasing decisions, as part of their education in the world of consumption. &lt;ref&gt;Schor, J.B., "The Commodification of Childhood," in Stephen J. Pfohl, Van Wagenen, A., Arend, P., Brooks, A. and Leckenby, D. (eds), ''Culture, Power And History: Studies in Critical Sociology,'' Lieden, Brill, 2006, p. 100 &lt;/ref&gt; Television broadcasting in the mid-20th century provided toymakers with the ability to reach national children's audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kids' TV Grows Up: The Path from Howdy Doody to SpongeBob|last=Holz|first=Jo|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4766-6874-1|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=51-52, 69-71, 94-95, 133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th century, the merchandising of film and TV characters in the form of dolls or figurines, gave toy marketers access to international audiences. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, G. and Smits, G., "Japan, the U.S. and the Globalization of Children's Consumer Culture," ''Journal of Social History,'' Vol. 38, No. 4, 2005; Kline, S. “Toy Marketing and the Internationalization of Children’s Television,” in Paul Rutten and Monique Hamers-Regimbal, ''Internationalization in Mass Communication and Cultural Identity,'' Holland, Sommatie, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign intentions==
[[File:TipTopComicsNo178pp86.jpg|thumb|During the post-war period, toys were frequently advertised through comic books and children's magazines.]]
Toy advertisements are aimed at three target audiences: children, adults (especially close relatives such as parents or grandparents), and toy retailers. Different message and media strategies are used for each target group. To gain the attention of children, advertising messages might focus on products are often brightly coloured, fast moving designs; or associations with heroic characters from film, TV, or books. Packaging can enhance the attractiveness of a toy. When advertising toys to adults, the educational benefits to the child are often promoted. When promoting toys to retailers, the ability of a product range to generate store traffic and profits is likely to be mentioned.

Children up to the age of five can find it difficult to distinguish between the main program and [[commercial break]]s. This is particularly so when a toy range is linked to a [[television series]] they are watching. Many children do not understand the intentions of [[marketing]] and [[commercials]] until the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;Patti M. Valkenburg &amp; Joanne Cantor. "The Development of a Child into a Consumer. ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' Vol. 63, 2001, pp 655–668.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]] programmes such as Media Smart are being used to help children understand and think critically about advertising.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediasmartworld.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Children are not easily persuaded to want something. Advertising is only part of the picture. Children's interests in a particular toy are likely to arise from word of mouth and peer pressure. Two-year-olds spend about 10% of their time with other children. This rises to 40% between ages 7 to 11.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Updegraff, et al.  (2001). Parents' involvement in adolescents' peer relationships: A comparison of mothers' and fathers' roles. ''Journal of Marriage and Family 63'', 655–668.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pester power" refers to children nagging their parents to buy a product. Some children will repeatedly ask them to buy a toy they want, and such insistence often leads to a purchase. There is regulation &lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; in place that bans advertisements from directly exhorting children to buy advertised products or persuade their parents to buy the products.
Advertisers sometimes try to stimulate word of mouth promotion of products.

Many toys are directed towards one specific sex and advertising is tailored to meet their particular needs. There are biological as well as social and cultural reasons for boys' and girls' different toy preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Gerianne M. Alexander, Teresa Wilcox, &amp; Rebecca Woods. (2009). Sex differences in infants’ visual interest in toys.  Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 427–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other consumer products, toys may also be offered as sets. While each one may be affordable, it may be an investment to "collect them all".

'''Intentions'''

The natural credulity of young children means that advertising to children is almost always a sensitive issue. The average child is exposed to approximately 40,000 commercials a year.&lt;ref name="Donald L. Shifrin 2006"&gt;Donald L. Shifrin, M. C. (2006, Dec). Children, Adolescents, and Advertising. American Academy of Periatrics , 2563-2569.&lt;/ref&gt; These messages are channelled through television, the internet, bill board campaigns and print media. Toy marketers are also known for more direct approaches, targeting schools.&lt;ref name="Donald L. Shifrin 2006"/&gt; Doing so by producing toys that are advertised with ‘educational benefits’ throughout primary school catalogues and news letters. A study on child advertising during Dec 2007 examined the relationship between television commercials and children’s requests to Father Christmas. Throughout the findings there was a significant correlation between the items requested and the commercials viewed. Proportionally there was a greater number of brands requested when associated with higher television viewing time.&lt;ref&gt;Pine, K. J., Wilson, P. B., &amp; Nash, A. S. (2007, December ). The Relationship Between Television Advertising, Children's Viewing and Their Requests to Father Christmas. Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 28, 456.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings reflect the impact marketers have on children. Through the use of advertising, brands are shaping the opinions and beliefs of young children every day thus generating an unrelenting appetite for branded merchandise. The intentions of toy manufactures are to influence children while they are young to gain brand loyalty, devolving premature consumers. The consumers of the future. Marketing strategies towards child advertising are paid high attention to as the market is generating approximately 21 billion dollars into the United States economy each year.&lt;ref&gt;Statista. (2015). Statistics and Facts on the Toy Industry. Retrieved from Statista: http://www.statista.com/topics/1108/toy-industry/&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible due to the influential amount of purchasing power children have when pressuring their parents, through what marketers refer to as ‘pester power’.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, L., O'Sullivan, T., Stead, M., &amp; Hastings, G. (2006). International food advertising, pester power and its effects. International Journal of Advertising, 513-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consequence'''

Persuasive commercials achieve such proportionate amounts of revenue, as children under the age of twelve have less cognitive ability to recognise the purpose of the advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;Rozendaal, E., Opree, S. J., &amp; Buijzen, M. (2016, Jan). Development and Validation of a Survey Instrument to Measure Children's Advertising Literacy. Media Psychology, 72-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Brands sell a life style, presenting to children the idea of happiness. Children at a vulnerable age believe that the life style being sold to them is the truth,&lt;ref&gt;Lanka, S. (2011, July 7). Ethics in marketing and advertising to children. Colombo.&lt;/ref&gt; and by obtaining the products viewed they will mirror these impressions. The mind set that purchase equals an acquired identity can be dangerous. It can present low self-esteem amongst youth because their reality is not compromised by their materialistic gain. The journal of Social and Clinical Psychology conducts a model proving the relationship between materialistic values, compulsive buying tendencies, self discrepancies and low self-esteem that acts in a spiralling effect.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, H., "A NEW LOOK AT "COMPULSIVE BUYING": SELF-DISCREPANCIES AND MATERIALISTIC VALUES AS PREDICTORS OF COMPULSIVE BUYING TENDENCY, ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,'' Vol. 24, 2005, pp 832-859.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the fundamentals of human nature which involves an endless amount of wants which contrasts with a disappointing reality. An example of this is Barbie, who is globally advertised as a best friend for young woman. In commercials Barbie comes to life portraying personality. Marketers use idealistic settings to falsely advertise the lifestyle that comes with Barbie; either on the beach or in a night club. Settings are designed to convince children of this idealistic reality and an experience that they too can share with her. Yet, in reality Barbie's potential relies on a child’s imagination. The setting is not included. Mainly she has no relatable characteristics for children to look up to, establishing the argument of social pressures and self-esteem. For toy companies however this is parallel to revenue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 


'''Strategies'''

Marketers adopt certain strategies to create demand behind their products. Physically, toy packaging is generally bright attractive colours and interactive textures. They have recognisable logos and slogans which children can familiarise themselves with easily. They also have convenient shelf access in stores. Many companies also target children based on their genders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} 

'''Product placement'''

Effective advertising strategies also heavily involve product placement;&lt;ref name="Donald L. Shifrin 2006"/&gt; The marketing practice in which a business pays for its brand or products inclusion throughout a film or television programs.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, C. A., &amp; Stern, B. B. (2006 ). CONSUMERS, CHARACTERS, AND PRODUCTS: A Balance Model of Sitcom Product Placement Effects. Journal of Advertsing , 7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Theory suggests that the limited cognitive process which occurs when a child engages in television inflicts a feeling of familiarity to stimulate preference.&lt;ref&gt;Auty, S., &amp; Lewis, C. (2004). Exploring Children's Choice: The Reminder Effect of Product Placement. Psychology and Marketing , 697-713.&lt;/ref&gt; Toy Story, a famous all time Disney movie worked in association with toy makers, basing the movie characters off real life toys. Mr Potato Head, Slinky Dog and Etch a Sketch original sales needing refreshing. After the release of the film in 1995 the sales of the toys that featured in the Toy Story movie skyrocketed. In correlation, the Disney Movie Frozen is a franchise within itself generating a net worth of $2.25 billion.&lt;ref&gt;QUARTZ. (2014, August 05). Disney will keep milking "Frozen" for all it’s worth. Retrieved from QUARTZ: http://qz.com/245225/disney-will-keep-milking-frozen-for-all-its-worth/&lt;/ref&gt; Disney has capitalised on the films wide audience by constructing a profitable franchise supplying Frozen Character dolls, teddies, lunch boxes, clothing, duvet covers and more. According to Dave Hollis, executive vice president for distribution at Walt Disney Studios, Disney had troubling marketing to males. To over come this Disney found that boys respond more to humor therefore Olaf, the comedic Snowman was advertised as much as the two female lead characters were.&lt;ref name="fool.com"&gt;Kline, D. B. (2014, May 14). How Disney Will Make 'Frozen' a Billion-Dollar Franchise. Retrieved from The Motely Fool : http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/05/14/how-disney-will-make-frozen-a-billion-dollar-franc.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this strategic  marketing was reflected in the exit polls which read that 43% of the audience during opening weekend were in fact male.&lt;ref name="fool.com"/&gt; Using this particular advertising strategy Disney in theory doubled their targeted audience.

'''Celebrity and character endorsement'''

The influence of famous characters in commercials haze the lines between programmes and advertisements. An example throughout the journal ''Children as Consumers'' explains how celebrity endorsements in commercials have positive effects on a child’s response throughout the sales of toy cars.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, F., &amp; Barrie, G. (2008, January ). A Psychological Analysis of the Young People's Market. Children as Consumers, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-promotions of businesses heavily involve celebrity and character endorsements. For ten years Disney worked in collaborating with McDonald's, promoting the latest Disney films throughout the McDonald's Happy Meals. The connection between toys and fast food for young children creates a fun experience. Evident in the ''American Academy of Paediatrics'' journal, 20% of fast food restaurants advertisements now mention a complementary toy in their ads.&lt;ref name="Donald L. Shifrin 2006"/&gt; The consequence of this illusion, that fast food is fun, holds businesses accountable for exploiting children and contributing to the global epidemic of child obesity. Where one in three children are classed as obese throughout New Zealand alone &lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. (2015, December 10). Annual Update of Key Results 2014/15: New Zealand Health Survey. Wellington , New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toy premiums, games and collectibles'''

Contest and give away prizes are effective practices marketers use to entice children and increase the sales. Cereal companies are renowned for contest and giveaway prizes, directly targeted at children. Similar to fast food, cereal companies generate excitement around their brand through the use of toys and games. Competition based advertisement can increase sales traffic as consumers believe the more they buy the higher their chances of winning are. This is also effective when the prized toy is a mystery and children have to buy the product to find out what it is. An example of this is the Weetbix All Black campaign, where Weetbix released All Black collector cards. Weetbix was able to engage their targeted audience, young boys, to want to purchase Weetbix so they can get the nationally loved rugby team's trading cards. By collecting and trading the cards also enhances social benefits for young children. By using rewards schemes Weetbix has encouraged children to choose a healthier cereal for breakfast. This is counteractive towards competitive sugar based cereal brands thus benefiting both Weetbix and children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

'''Exclusive kids only'''

Marketers have been known to entice children through the use of exclusion. By directly advertising products as ‘kids only’ builds the experience feel special. This type of advertising is common throughout food companies, promoting that this drink or snack is just for kids making it immediately more engaging. The company Trix, an all-time favourite American cereal slogan reads "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids." Promoting the impression of exclusion and importance. For toy company’s exclusion is established through gender. Toys are specially designed for boys and girls and are exclusively showcased in separate aisles. Children begin to develop stereotypical, gender based knowledge during preschool and by the age of seven they have strong, established views on toy gender.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, L. C., &amp; Sung, H.-y. A. (1993). Developmental Differences in Young Children's Sex-Typing: Automatic versus Reflective Processing. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research found that when children aged seven to eleven were asked to choose a toy, most selected traditional gendered based occupational toys, reflecting role play. Children throughout this age group were also more likely to create rivalry with the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, B., ''Power Plays: Primary school children's constructions of gender, power and adult work,'' Trentham Book, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Self-identity makes toy’s distinctly gender bias progressing sale transactions.

== Packaging ==

Toys are advertised in shops and on product packaging.
The colour on the packaging of a children's toy is often carefully selected in order to appeal to a certain demographic.
The [[Educational toys|educational benefits of toys]] are also explained on packaging for the benefit of parents. Skills which a child will gain, such as hand–eye coordination, exploration and problem solving are made explicit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Channels of advertising==
Common methods of advertising include:
*Television commercial campaigns
*Print media campaigns
*[[Billboard (advertising)|Billboard]] campaigns
*[[Product placement]] in films and television programs
*Various forms of branding, including clothing
*Online marketing
*New media

The first televised toy commercial to be shown in the United States was for [[Hasbro]]'s [[Mr. Potato Head]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="BusWeek"&gt;''[[BusinessWeek]]''. January 29, 2007. "[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_05/b4019106.htm Hardly Babes In Toyland]". Accessed August 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then television has been one of the most important media for marketing toys.

The Internet has created new opportunities for advertisers and new strategies have been developed to take advantage of the new media technology. Now a significant part of [[youth culture]], new technologies enable marketing campaigns to reach children in a different way. Interactive games are a new medium which can be used to advertise toys to children.

==Regulation==
In response to the perceived dangers of advertising to children some countries and districts have highly regulated or even banned these marketing avenues.  In [[Sweden]] all advertisements aimed at children under the age of 12 have been banned and they{{who|date=December 2013}} are lobbying the [[European Union]] to do the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Similarly [[Quebec]]'s Consumer Protection Act includes provisions to ban print and broadcast advertising aimed at children under the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 248 and 249 of the [http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/P_40_1/P40_1_A.html Quebec Consumer Protection Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising impact can be lessened if parents and teachers talk to children about the purpose and nature of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Moniek Buijzen. (2009). The effectiveness of parental communication in modifying the relation between food advertising and children's consumption behaviour.  British Journal of Developmental Psychology , 27, 105–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24983">A '''work permit''' is the permission to take a [[job]] within a foreign country. It may also be a permit given to minors allowing them to work legally under [[child labor]] laws. Within an [[industry]], a work permit may be required to execute certain functions within a factory outside normal operational tasks (such as maintenance tasks) — in some places they might be called Permit to Work (PTW).

== European Union ==
{{see also|Blue Card (European Union)}}
Currently, every EU country has a different process for granting work permits to nationals of non-EU countries. To address this issue, the European Commission began work in 1999 on developing an EU-wide process for the entry of non-EU nationals into the work force.&lt;ref name="Towards a Common European Union Immigration Policy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/immigration/fsj_immigration_intro_en.htm |title=Towards a Common European Union Immigration Policy |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2007, they adopted a proposal to introduce a work permit similar to the United States' "Green Card" program, called the "Blue Card". It is similar to the UK's [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]], with the exception that it will require an employment contract in place prior to migration.  After two years in the first country, the migrant will be allowed to move and work in another EU country, and can sum the number of years spent in the EU for purposes of residency. This new card will abolish work permits across the EU and centralize the issuing from Brussels.
&lt;ref name="EU Blue Card to encourage highly-qualified non-EU citizens to work in the EU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/press_office/news_of_the_day/bluecard_en.htm |title=EU Blue Card to encourage highly-qualified non-EU citizens to work in the EU |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=European Commission, Irish Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
{{main article|Work permit (Belgium)}}

===France===
The procedure to get a work permit is quite elaborate since the applicant should prove that no French jobseeker fitted the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alain-Christian |last=Monkam|title=How to get a work permit in France|website= Village de la Justice|year= 2011|url= http://www.village-justice.com/articles/permit-France,11079.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Work permit (United Kingdom)}}
There are seven standard ways to apply for a work permit in the United Kingdom: the Business and Commercial Arrangements, the Training and Work Experience Arrangements, the Sports people and Entertainers Arrangements, Student Internships, GATS, Ancestry Visa and the Sectors Based Scheme. All applications require the work permit holder to leave the country where the work permit was issued every three months under the Work Permit Arrangements. Costs for leaving the airport are £64, per person and you must return to the airport after 24 hours or one working day to leave the country. If you remain in the airport the cost is £35 per person and you must leave the country after 24 hours or one working day in the airport.  &lt;ref name="Working in the UK - Work Permit Arrangements"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/work_permits0/applying_for_a_work.html |title=Working in the UK - Work Permit Arrangements |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these involves its own application process, and generally requires a job offer from a UK employer.

UK Work visas allow for extended visa options which may lead to permanent residence. With Europe at its doorstep and a large domestic market, the various UK work visa categories offer a gateway for thousands of applicants seeking the experience of European life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.migrationexpert.co.uk/work_visa/|title= UK Work Visa - Visa Service &amp; Advice Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK work permit system is currently being replaced by a new [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]].

==Russia==
According to the Federal Migration Service of Russia estimates, Russia's 5 million foreign nationals work today.

In order to work in Russia, foreign citizen must have a work visa (visa for arriving at the order), to obtain a work permit and get on migration registration in the Russian Federal Migration Service bodies.

For foreign citizens arriving without visas ([[CIS countries]] except [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) there is a simplified procedure. The period of temporary stay for them is 90 days but can be extended up to one year from the date of entry into the Russian Federation on presentation of the migration service of the employment contract or a contract of civil-legal nature. That is, a foreigner can obtain a work permit for up to 90 days, and then to extend it after the job. However, it is recommended to immediately impose labor or civil contract and to issue a work permit for the duration of its validity.

Issuance of work permits is carried out taking into account the established quota. The quota is divided by region, Russia and the integrated vocational qualification groups.

A work permit is divided to some categories:
*qualified professionals are employed by their existing profession (specialty), included in the approved list of professions (specialties, positions);
*highly qualified professionals engaged in labor activity in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Federal Law "On the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation."
The work permit is valid within the subject of the Russian Federation, in which it was issued.

== Ukraine ==
Foreigners and [[Statelessness|stateless]] persons can be employed in [[Ukraine]] after obtaining an appropriate permit. These requirements are established by article 42 of the Law of Ukraine "On Employment"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/work-permit-in-ukraine/|title=Work permit in Ukraine. Obtaining and legislation.|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. State Employment Service of Ukraine is the main authority to issue work permit. 

Does not require obtaining a work permit for:
* foreigners who have [[Permanent residency|residence permit]] in Ukraine;
* [[Refugee|refugees]];
* foreigners who have permission to immigrate to Ukraine;
* foreigners who are recognized as persons in need of additional protection, or who are granted temporary protection in Ukraine;
* representatives of foreign maritime (river) fleet and airlines that serve such companies on the territory of Ukraine;
* employees of foreign media who are accredited to work in Ukraine;
* professional athletes, artists and art workers to work in Ukraine;
* workers of emergency services for urgent work;
* employees of foreign representative (branch) office that are registered in the territory of Ukraine in accordance with the procedure established by the law;
* ecclesiastic who are to reside in Ukraine temporarily (on the ground of invitation of religious organization) for canonical activity only in such religious organization;
* foreigners who arrived in Ukraine to participate in the implementation of international technical assistance projects;
* foreigners who arrived in Ukraine to conduct teaching and / or scientific activities in higher education institutions;
* other foreigners in cases provided by laws and international treaties of Ukraine;
* Obtaining work permit in Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/work-permit-in-ukraine/|title=Work permit in Ukraine. Legal services and advisory - Law Firm "Capital Law Consulting"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the basics to obtain residence permit.

== United States ==
[[File:Getting_working_papers._New_York._-_NARA_-_523068.jpg|thumb|Applying for working papers, 1908 ([[United States Children's Bureau]])]]
In general, the United States does not require work permits for adult [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen]]s. However, certain aliens are required to have an [[Employment Authorization Document]] from the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS).

The [[federal government of the United States]] does not require work permits or proof-of-age certificates for a minor to be employed.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"&gt;{{cite web | title= Youth &amp; Labor: Work Permits &amp; Age Certificates | url= http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/workpermitsagecert.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the possession of an age certificate constitutes a good faith effort to comply with minimum age requirements of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt; The [[United States Department of Labor]] will issue a "certificate of age" if the minor employee's state does not issue them, or if the minor is requested by his or her employer to provide one.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|29|570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states are not listed in {{USCFR|29|570|9}}(a), such as Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah, and thus their certificates may not meet the requirements of {{USCFR|29|570|5}}(b) as being evidence of compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Many states also require them for workers of certain ages.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt; In some states, for example [[New Jersey]], permits are only required for minors 14 and 15 years old, while others such as [[Massachusetts]] require, at least in theory, work permits for all minors until they turn 18 years of age. In some states, enforcement is strict. Permits are usually issued through the school system the minor attends, and typically at a minimum is conditioned on enrollment in high school with regular attendance (no chronic absenteeism, tardiness, or truancy). Some states such as [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Indiana]] require high school students with part-time jobs to maintain a certain [[grade point average]]. Minors who are working are usually restricted in the number of hours each day or week they are permitted to work as well as the types of jobs they may hold.

The immigration in Turkey is regulated by the {{ill|General Directorate of Immigration Management|tr|Göç İdaresi Genel Müdürlüğü}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goc.gov.tr/main/Eng_3|title=Ministry Of Interior Directorate General Of Migration Management|website=www.goc.gov.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Göç İdaresi Genel Müdürlüğü) under the supervision of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mia.gov.tr/&lt;/ref&gt; while work permits are delivered by the {{ill|General Directorate of Labor Immigration|tr|Uluslararası İşgücü Genel Müdürlüğü}} (Uluslararası İşgücü Genel Müdürlüğü) under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Turkey)|Ministry of Labour and Social Security]] (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Çalışma ve Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanlığı).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csgb.gov.tr/En|title=T.C.

==South Africa==
There are three categories of South African work visa or permit available to a foreigner each with its own set of specific requirements all assisting in immigration to South Africa or working in South Africa. These are the ''General Work Visa/Permit'', the ''Critical Skills Work Visa/Permit'' and the ''Intra-Company Transfer Work Visa/Permit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Work Permits in South Africa |url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/work-permit-south-africa/ |accessdate=2015-07-08 |publisher=Immigration South Africa™}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to recent immigration law changes (May, 2014), the obtaining of work visas or permits in South Africa has become much more arduous. Furthermore, these work permits are now referred to as visas.

'''General Work Visa/Permit''' - 
The basis of a general work visa/permit is that a firm offer of employment has been made by a prospective employer to a foreigner after such employer has unsuccessfully exploited the local labour market in attempting to procure the needed skills, experiences or qualifications equivalent of such foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/general-work-visa-south-africa/|title=General Work Visa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Skills Work Visa/Permit''' - 
A critical skills work permit may be issued to a foreigner who possesses critical skills or qualifications and is able to demonstrate with supporting documentation in the form of testimonials, publications. This is based on a list published by the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa called the Critical Skills List &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/Critical_Skills_Work_Visa_List.pdf|title=South Africa's latest Critical Skills List (PDF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of motivation from an authoritative body to substantiate the benefits that those skills will bring to South Africa. This critical skills work permit is granted for up to five years and may be renewed for a further period, if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/critical-skills/|title=Critical Skills Work Visa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This visa type replaces the previously issued Quota Work Permit and the Exceptional Skills Work Permit.

'''Intra-Company Transfer Work Visa/Permit'''  - 
An intra company transfer work permit is issued to a foreigner who is normally deployed or seconded to South African branch, subsidiary or associate office of a corporate entity aboard.
There are strict controls to ensure that the foreigner remains employed in his or her specific position during the tour of duty. This type of visa is only valid for two years, and often no extension is possible. Also, any applicant must have first worked for a minimum of 6 months in the employ of the company’s foreign office before applying to relocate and immigrate to the South African branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/work-permit-south-africa/|title=Work Visas for South Africa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Canada work permits are issued under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) by Canada immigration and Citizenship.

The TFWP has four streams: high-skilled workers, low-skilled workers, the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program, and the Live-In Caregiver Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singer|first1=Colin|title=Canada Work Permit|url=http://www.immigration.ca/canada-work-visa/|website=immigration.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==
In Singapore, the work permit process is managed by the Ministry of Manpower.  There are several kinds of work permits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passes and Visas (Singapore)|url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=2012-05-06 |publisher=SingaporeMinistry of Manpower}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the type accorded generally depends on the salary range of the position, as well as on skills (including education), work experience, and the type of job being applied for. These work permit types include the Employment Pass (monthly salary of at least S$4,000), S Pass (monthly salary of at least S$2,800), and "Work Permit" (generally for unskilled workers).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

For skilled personnel such as confinement nannies from Malaysia, the work permit is short-term. Employers or appointed agencies are able to hire Malaysian confinement nanny&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nannysos.com.sg/confinement-nanny-work-permit-singapore|title= Confinement Nanny Work Permit Singapore|author=|date=|work= Confinement NannySOS |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by applying the work permit either online or manually. The validity period can be up to 16 weeks with reference to the birth time of the child. There are two situations which the pass can be extended. It is either when the required employment period is longer than the issued permit or when the confinement nanny leaves Singapore during her employment period.

Another kind of work permit available in Singapore commonly known as the EntrePass and is especially geared towards entrepreneurs who might not pass the stringent requirements regarding education and salary. The EntrePass is for foreign entrepreneurs who are planning to start up a business in Singapore. The entrepreneur must be actively involved in operations of the business. Candidates can apply for this anytime up until 6 months after they registered the business.  Generally EntrePass are awarded to individuals who have either have a proven track record of running successful businesses or who have an innovative idea.
The Singapore Personalised Employment Pass, also known as PEP is a special type of Singapore work visa issued to individuals based on their own merits. The issuance of the PEP is managed by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower. The PEP is independent of any employer, rendering a PEP holder the flexibility and freedom to switch employers without having the pass revoked. The PEP holder is also entitled to stay in Singapore for up to 6 months in between jobs and to evaluate career opportunities. It is issued for a period of 5 years, and non renewable thereafter. But, since December 2011, PEP has been discontinued by the Singaporean Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Personalised Employment Pass (Singapore) |url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/personalised-employment/before-you-apply/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=2012-05-06 |publisher=Singapore Ministry of Manpower}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hazardous ===
A work permit system is a formal written system to control certain types of work identified as potentially hazardous. The terms "P.T.W.", "permit" or "work permit" refer to the form used by a company to meet its needs. These systems aim to ensure proper planning and consideration of the risks involved in a particular job, at a specific time and place, with designated precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines on permit to Work (P.T.W.) systems |url=http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/189.pdf |accessdate=2012-09-18 |publisher=International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually categorized in "hot" work permits and "cold" work permits. Hot works are those where there is a potential of generating fire or extreme heat, cold ones are all the others.

==Australia==
Several different types of visas are available for immigrants. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

The issuance of work permits is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor of Thailand. Work without permission in the Kingdom is criminally punishable. It takes 7 working days to process the application for a permit. If the applicant is qualified and able to use "One Stop Service Center", the work permit will only take one day.

She was then admitted to the [[University of Cape Town]] in 1999, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Business Science]] in 2002.

==Career== 
From 2005 until 2008, Mhango was an economist at [[Standard Bank of South Africa]]. In June 2008, she became the head of economic research for Africa at Standard Bank, serving in that capacity until November 2010. Since November 2010, she has been the economist for sub-Saharan Africa at Renaissance Capital.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

In June 2016, following the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]]'s decision to allow the niara to freely float against other currencies, Mhango said that floating the naira freely would “release a pressure valve for the economy”, which would in turn “see the economy beginning to thaw and green shoots emerge possibly as soon as a year from now”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/20/nigerias-naira-plunges-30pc-after-central-bank-gives-up-on-dolla/ | title=Nigeria’s naira plunges 30 percent after central bank gives up on dollar peg |

In October 2016, Mhango and other economists at Renaissance Capital said that the Kenya Shilling was about 20 percent overvalued and that this was hurting [[Kenya]]'s exports to other countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Strong-shilling-hurting-Kenya-exports-in-region/539552-3403804-obiwqmz/ | title=Strong shilling hurting Kenya’s exports in region | accessdate=12 November 2016 |last=Mwaniki|location=Nairobi |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |first=Charles| date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
