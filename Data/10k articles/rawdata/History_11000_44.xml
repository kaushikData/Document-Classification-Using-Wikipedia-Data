'''Aggañña Sutta''' is the 27th [[Sūtra|Sutta]] of the [[Digha Nikaya]] collection. The sutta describes a discourse imparted by the [[Buddha]] to two [[brahmin]]s, Bharadvaja and Vasettha, who left their family and [[caste]] to become monks. The two brahmins are insulted and maligned by their own caste for their intention to become members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha explains that caste and lineage cannot be compared to the achievement of morality practice and the Dhamma, as anyone from the four castes can become a monk and reach the state of [[Arahant]]. Then, he explains about the beginning of the [[Earth]] and the birth of social order and its structure, including the castes. The Buddha emphasizes the message of [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]] and how the Dhamma is the best of all things.

==The Beginning==
The Sutta begins when the Buddha is staying in Savatthi, in the temple donated by Visakkha, the mother of Migara. At that time, two brahmins, Bharadvaja and Vasettha,  are training with the monks ([[bhikkhu]]) and aim to be a member of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. As usual in the evening, the Buddha rises from his [[meditation]] and strolls in the open yard near his dwelling. Vasettha sees his Teacher strolling, tells his friend, Bharadvaja, and suggests that they meet the Buddha to see if they can hear a Dhamma exposition from the Buddha.

They both approach the Buddha and after some formal proprieties, the Buddha asks the two if they received insults and denigration when they left their caste and layman's life in order to join the order.
Vasettha and Bharadvaja answer that they did receive a 'flood of insults'. They say that the other Brahmins maintain that the Brahmin caste is the best, as the Brahmins are of high [[social status]] and [[authority]], pure-bred, have radiant complexions, and are born from the mouth of the God Brahma, unlike the other lower castes. So, by the opinion of the other Brahmins, how can Vasettha and Bharadvaja leave this good caste and status, thus joining together with fraudulent ascetics with shaven heads from other castes, lower in status as they are born from the feet of Brahma?

To this remark, the Buddha tells them that the Brahmins have indeed forgotten about their past if they said such things. The fact is that the women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.

The Buddha then elaborates that if any of the caste does the following deeds: killing, taking anything that is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, [[slander]]ing, speaking rough words or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practise wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi); people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are not worthy of respect. They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.

While those who refrain from killing, taking anything that is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, being greedy, cruel, and practising wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi), will be seen by people as positive and will earn respect from the people and the wise ones. They would be profiting from their deeds, no matter what their caste might be.

Logically, as the four castes can do either negative (demerit) or positive (merit) deeds, so will the wise reject the statement that only the Brahmins are the best  caste. Why? Because anyone from the four castes, if they left the worldly affairs and became a monk, and due to their discipline and struggle, they become [[arahant]], people who conquered their mind's stains, have done whatever what must be done, have been relieved from the burden, have broken the bondage of birth, achieved freedom, freed due to achieved knowledge, then he is the best among others based on Truth ([[Dhamma]]).

The Buddha says, "Dhamma is the best thing for people
In this life and the next as well."

Further, the Buddha proves that Dhamma is indeed the best thing of all things in life. He takes the example of King Pasenadi of the Kosala Kingdom, who has now conquered the Sakyans. The Sakyans revere, praise, and serve him with respect.

But, towards the Buddha, who came from the Sakyan people, King Pasenadi reveres, praises, and serves the Buddha with utmost respect. Even the monarch thinks like this: "The [[Shramana]] [[Gautama Buddha|Gotama]] had perfect birth, while I am not perfect. The Shramana Gotama is mighty, while I am weak. The Shramana Gotama inspired awe and respect, while I do not. The Shramana Gotama is vastly influential and charming, while I only possess small influence." As even the King respects Dhamma, reveres Dhamma, and obeys Dhamma, therefore he bows and praises the [[Tathagatha]].

The Buddha then advises Vasettha that whoever has strong, deep-rooted, and established belief in the Tathagatha, he can declare that he is the child of [[Bhagavan]], born from the mouth of Dhamma, created from Dhamma, and the heir of Dhamma. Therefore, the titles of the Tathagatha are the Body of Dhamma, the Body of Brahma, the Manifestation of Dhamma, and the Manifestation of Brahma.

==The Beginning of Life on Earth==
In the second part of the Sutta, the Buddha tells the story of how human beings came to dwell on Earth.

The Buddha said that sooner or later, after a very long time, there would come a time when the world shrinks. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma
world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving
through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or
later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion,
the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world,  having died from there, are
mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous,
moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time.

They floated above and around the Earth. At this time, there were not yet seen the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]], there were not yet Night and Day, there were not yet names and identity or female or male. The creatures were only known as creatures.

''At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness.... And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot [[milk]] as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine [[ghee]] or heated [[butter]] and it was very sweet, like pure wild [[honey]]'' (1)

Some of the creatures of light (the Abbhasaras) who had curiosity and a greedy nature began to dive and taste the savory Earth's substance. At that moment, the creature found out that it tasted so delicious. Thus, greed started to seep in and it ate the substance voraciously, greedily, also calling its comrades (who were flying above and on earth) to join in the feast. Not long afterwards, the creatures began to eat greedily, and due to the huge amount of the mud substance they could feed on it for a very long time.

As they ate and ate, their [[luminescence|luminous]] body began to be coated by the mud substance, formed a coarser body, then suddenly, the sun and moon were seen, so were the stars, and also Night and Day began on Earth. The logical explanation of this was that the creatures were the self-illuminating, so blinding and luminous that they didn't notice the Sun. The Earth was covered in their light. So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' of mud and thus the night and day became apparent to them. Then, as the night and day became apparent, seasons and years also appeared.

Their body was still coarse and roughly shaped. Thus, after a very long time, the mud-like substance began to be exhausted. Then, [[mushroom]]-like plants began to grow so fast that they replaced the mud-like ocean. The creatures began to devour them as well, and they also found it delicious, like sweet honey and milk. Their body hardened more and details began to turn finer.

After another very long time, the mushrooms also began to be exhausted, replaced by [[cassava]] or [[turnip]]-like plants. They also began to devour them night and day, and thus they began to notice differences amongst them. As the changes of their bodies varied between each other, the concept of difference arose. The concepts of the beautiful and the ugly were born. The beautiful scorns the ugly and they became arrogant because of their appearance.

Then, after the turnips, the earth was grown with [[rice|rice plant]]s. The first rice plants were without [[husk]] and [[kernel (science)|kernel]]s. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people consumed them for a very long time. But there are people who became greedy and lazy. They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were too lazy to take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The generation time for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice.

By this time, the body of the creatures had become finely evolved. There was already the distinction between male and female. The man became preoccupied with women and vice versa. Then, as they were deeply attracted to each another, passion and desire was aroused, and they engaged in sexual relationships. The people who saw a couple engaged in sexual activity scolded them, and usually the couple were forbidden from entering the village for a certain period of time. Owing to this, the indulgent couples built closed dwellings where they indulged in sexual activity.

==The Birth of Social Order and Castes==
In the third part, the Buddha explained about the origin of Castes, their titles, and their order in the society system which were still rigidly effective in Buddha's time.

===The Khattiya Caste (Rulers)===
The rice plants, as mentioned earlier, began to grow in separate plots and people began to divide lands and tend each other's cluster of rice fief. They became preoccupied in tending their own field. Then, as the evil and greed were aroused, there were people who begin stealing others' crops. At first, the others only warned the culprit and the culprit promised that he would never repeat it again. But when it was repeated several times, the people began punishing him with fist, stones, and then sticks. That is the origin of punishment forms.
Then, people began to think that they were too busy to heed every crime and abuse that happened in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people. But most of their time had already been invested in tending their fief. So, they appointed someone to rectify what is right and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice.
So, they went to the fairest, ablest, most likeable, and most intelligent person and appointed him to do the judging and passing out sentences on the reward of a share of rice. The appointed person thus agreed and the people bestowed upon him the title : '[[Maha Sammata]]' meaning: The People's Choice. Then, they bestowed also the second title: 'Khattiya' meaning the 'Lord of the Rice Field', and finally the third title: 'Raja' which means 'Who gladdens people with Dhamma (or Truth)'.
This order was created by the people's wish and need, based on the Dhamma and not from others. The Buddha stated again that Dhamma is indeed the best of all things.

===The Brahmin Caste===
Then, amongst the people, some of them begin to think like this: "Evil deeds have risen amongst us, such as: theft, lies, murders, sexual abuses, punishment, and banishment. Now let us set aside evil, unuseful, and impolite things." The word Brahmins came, as it meant: "They who put aside Evil and unwholesome things" (1).
They set up retreats and huts in the forests and meditated there. They came to the city at morning and evening only to gather food and after finishing gathering food, they returned to their huts and meditations. People noticed this and 'Those who meditated' were called 'Jhayanti' or 'Jhayaka'.

There are other people, who can't meditate or dwell in huts in the forest. So, they settled in the cities, did not meditate, but compiled books. The people called them 'Ajjhayaka' which meant 'They who don't meditate'. At first the Ajjhayaka were viewed lower than Jhayaka but in the Buddha's time, the Ajjhayaka had been viewed higher in status than the Jhayakas.

===The Vessa (Traders) and the Sudda (Hunters)===
Among the people who had settled and had family, some began to adopt various trades.

The remainder of these people preferred the work of hunting. The Sudda caste came from the word 'Sudda' which means: 'They Are Base Who Live By The Chase' [1].

All of the castes, from Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda originated from these people, and not from others; in accordance to the Dhamma and not by others.

===The Ascetics===
But from the four clans, there were people who were not satisfied with their living, left their home and became celibate ascetics. These are the origin of the fifth caste formed from all the four castes' people who left their lay life and became an ascetic.

==Buddha's Conclusion==
The Buddha then concluded his discourse to Vasettha and Bharadvaja:
(Due to the governance of Dhamma which became the root of all castes and people) anyone, from any the caste, who did demerit and wrongdoings, lived a bad life of speech, thoughts, views, and wrongdoings, they would end up after their death, in the realm of sufferings, hell, loss, and torture.

But anyone, from any caste, who did merit and good deeds, lived a good life of speech, thoughts, and deeds; had the right view, after their death, they would end in the realm of happiness and heaven.

Anyone, from any caste, who did both merit and demerit, lived a good and bad life of speech, thoughts, and deeds; had either a right or a bad view, after their death, they could end in the realm of suffering or the realm of joy.

Anyone, from any caste, who lived a life of disciplined deeds, speeches, thoughts, who had trained and developed himself in the seven factors of Enlightenment, then he would attain the eradication from the (stains/dust/dirt/filth) of mind in this current life.

Anyone, from four castes, who became a bhikku (Monk), [[arahant]], who had eradicated stains of Mind, had done what must be done, had relieved himself from burden, who had attained freedom, who had broken the bondage of birth, who had been freed due to knowledge; then they would be declared as the best from all of them, in accordance to the Truth (Dharma) and not from the basis of not Truth (adhamma).

The Buddha quoted, "Dharma is the best thing for people
In this life and the next as well."

The Buddha quoted the verses of Brahma Sandakumara:
"''The Khattiya is the best among those who maintain their lineage;
He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.''"
then, the Buddha asserted that the verse is indeed true, according to the Dhamma, profitable, and true.

''The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan;
He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.''"

Thus the discourse ended with Vasettha and Bharadvaja rejoicing in hearing the words of Buddha.

==Digging Deeper Into the Sutta==
While the story of the world's beginning is considered a myth, on the other hand, the Buddhist doctrine requires a constant sceptical approach, where one must see and prove it before one believes it (ehipassiko). However, the profound insight of the Buddha in two major fields: science (cosmology) and social structure's origin indeed was revolutionary in his era.

On the science part, Buddha implied the theory of the Evolution of the Universe, where it is said to shrink and then expand in repeated cycles.

While on the social science part, the Buddha's words implied the equality of origin in the human race, whether by their sex, appearance, or by other categories which were founded later based on physiological differences. Buddha also emphasized that the social structure is formed voluntarily, based on righteousness and necessity, not based on Divine command as some theories stated.

The Monarchy is also formed voluntarily, and the people elect the most righteous and capable person, which implied the [[Democracy]] concept. The Monarch accepts a 'share of rice' as his reward to rectify the social order, which is the origin of voluntary reward which evolves into the taxation concept. However, the Buddha states that the Monarch is regarded worthy not because of his divine right but due to his righteousness in deeds. [2]

The Buddha's message was clear, however, that the best thing in the world is Truth (Dhamma) and everything is created, measured, and valued based on Truth and not from something other.

According to Richard Gombrich, the sutta gives strong evidence that it was conceived entirely as a satire of [[Historical Vedic religion|brahminical]] claims regarding the divine nature of the caste system, showing that it is nothing but a human [[convention (norm)|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 85: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MoOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=inauthor:Gombrich+Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a#PPA85,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David J. Kalupahana, ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā of Nāgārjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1991, page 61: [https://books.google.com/books?id=38WJRwP3nLgC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=inauthor:kalupahana+Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a#PPA61,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gombrich, the Buddha satirizes the Vedic "[[Purusha sukta|Hymn of the Cosmic Man]]" and etymologizes "reciter of the Veda" so as to make it mean "non-meditator" instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all scholars agree with Gombrich's interpretation and his view is not unanimous.

Among those who disagree is Suwanda H J Sugunasiri, a Canadian Buddhist scholar, who most recently has presented a novel interpretation of the Sutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sugunasiri |title=Devolution and Evolution in the Aggañña Sutta |journal=Canadian Journal of Buddhist Studies |date=2013 |issue=9 |pages=17-104 |url=http://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/cjbs/article/view/20926}}&lt;/ref&gt;Rejecting the view that the Sutta is a ‘satire’ (Gombrich) or ‘good humoured irony’ (Collins) [1], he shows  how “the  Discourse is  a historically and scientifically accurate characterization of  the cyclical cosmic process” [2]. He compares the stages of cosmic, vegetation,  human and linguistic  evolution as indicated by the Buddha  with those in western theory, beginning with 13.5 billion years ago of the Big Bang and ending with 150,000 years when  ‘anatomically modern humans’ appear. The Big Bang, in this interpretation, marks not the beginning of the Evolutionary phase but the ending of the earlier Devolutionary phase, when there appears seven suns (as in a different Sutta), symbolic of intense heat.  A critical point in Sugunasiri’s  reconstruction of the Buddha’s universe  is the novel take on the Abhassaras -    as photons, translating the term Abhassara  literally as ‘hither-come-shining arrow’ (ā + bhas + sara). In an expanded study [3], Sugunasiri  points to two other Suttas (Brahmajala and Patika) in which  the Buddha presents dimensions of   the cosmic process. He also shows how the Buddha cuts through the Vedic myth of creation referred to in Gombrich.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmana, Metteyya.

{{Periods in US history}}
The '''American Revolution''' was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] won independence from Great Britain, becoming the [[United States|United States of America]]. They defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) in alliance with France and others.

Members of [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial society]] argued the position of "[[no taxation without representation]]", starting with the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in 1765. They rejected the authority of [[Parliament of Great Britain|the British Parliament]] to tax them because they lacked members in that governing body. Protests steadily escalated to the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770 and the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] in 1772, followed by the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773, during which Patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a [[Intolerable Acts|series of legislative acts]] which effectively rescinded [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up [[First Continental Congress|their own alternative government]] to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the Crown and were known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|''Loyalists'']] or ''Tories''.

Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the king's army attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a [[Provincial Congress]] that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a [[Continental Army]] under the leadership of General [[George Washington]]. The Continental Congress determined [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]'s rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]], and they declared the colonies [[Lee Resolution|free and independent states]] on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.

The Continental Army [[Siege of Boston|forced the redcoats out of Boston]] in March 1776, but that summer [[New York and New Jersey campaign|the British captured and held New York City]] and its strategic harbor for the duration of the war. The Royal Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775–76]], but successfully captured a British army at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. France now entered the war as an ally of the United States with a large army and navy that threatened Britain itself. The war turned to the American South where the British under the leadership of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] captured an army at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in early 1780 but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. A combined American–French force captured a second British army [[Siege of Yorktown|at Yorktown]] in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.

Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of the [[United States Constitution]], establishing a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Wood, 1992"&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America (Canada).

As early as 1651, the [[Parliament of England|English government]] had sought to regulate trade in the [[British America|American colonies]].

[[File:1768 Boundary Line Map Treaty of Ft Stanwix.jpg|Thumb|300px|left|Boundary Line Map of 1768 move the boundary West]] Historians typically begin their histories of the American Revolution with the British coalition victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763. The North American theater of the Seven Years' War is commonly known as the [[French and Indian War]] in the United States; it removed France as a major player in North American affairs and led to the territory of [[New France]] being ceded to Great Britain. [[Lawrence Henry Gipson]] writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;It may be said as truly that the American Revolution was an aftermath of the Anglo-French conflict in the New World carried on between 1754 and 1763.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Henry Gipson, "The American revolution as an aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754–1763." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1950): 86–104.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2144276 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] may also have{{weasel inline|date=September 2018}} played a role in the separation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from England, as colonists wanted to continue migrating west to lands awarded by the Crown for their wartime service.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The Proclamation, however, cut them off. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] became Indian territory, barred to settlement for two years.

The colonists protested, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Indians. In 1768, Indians agreed to the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] and the [[Treaty of Hard Labour]], followed in 1770 by the [[Treaty of Lochaber]]. The treaties opened most of Kentucky and West Virginia to colonial settlement. The new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 which moved the line much farther to the west, from the green line to the red line on the map at right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J Campbell|title=Speculators in Empire: Iroquoia and the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_ACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118|date=29 April 2015|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=118–20|isbn=978-0806147109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parliament Stamp Act1765.jpg|thumb|Notice of Stamp Act of 1765 in newspaper]]

In 1764, Parliament passed the [[Currency Act]] to restrain the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=The Encyclopedia of Money|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2009|isbn=978-1598842517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4kgDkYxGrcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament also passed the [[Sugar Act]], imposing customs [[Duty (economics)|duties]] on a number of articles. That same year, Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Parliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing cards.

The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low.&lt;ref&gt;Englishmen paid an average 25 shillings annually in taxes, whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; They objected to the fact that they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them. [[Benjamin Franklin]] testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James A.

The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a [[standing army]] in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed in 1765. They used public demonstrations, [[boycott]], violence, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the [[vice admiralty court]] and looted the home of chief justice [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a "[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout all British possessions and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations that were completely subordinate to the British parliament and pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws binding on the colonies in the past.&lt;ref name="Lecky, William Edward Hartpole 1882 pp. 297–98"&gt;Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/297/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) pp. 297–98&lt;/ref&gt; They did not see anything in the unwritten British constitution that made taxes special&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/315/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) pp. 315–16&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that they had taxed American trade for decades. Parliament insisted that the colonies effectively enjoyed a "[[virtual representation]]" as most British people did, as only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/173/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Americans such as [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] maintained that the Americans were not in fact virtually represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan-Paul Frost and Jeffrey Sikkenga|title=History of American Political Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w81L1qAhNjoC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=55–56|isbn=978-0739106242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspee|&lt;center&gt;Burning of the ''[[Gaspee Affair|Gaspee]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]] which placed duties on a number of essential goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky and Paul Finkelman, ''A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States'' (Oxford UP, 2002) v. 1 p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.

In February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|issued a circular letter]] to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop ''Liberty'', owned by [[John Hancock]], for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the [[Treason Act 1543]] which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.

On March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell.&lt;ref name="Hiller B. Zobel 1996"&gt;Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; There was no order to fire, but the soldiers fired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by [[John Adams]]), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Hiller B. Zobel 1996"/&gt;

A new ministry under [[Lord North]] came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as [[Samuel Adams]] continuing to agitate.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

In June 1772, American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]], including [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations in what became known as the [[Gaspee Affair|''Gaspee'' Affair]]. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.

In 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on "Committees of Correspondence" at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the [[leadership|leaders]] of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.&lt;ref name="Mary Beth Norton 2001 pp 144"&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp. 144–45
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|private letters were published]] in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and Lieutenant Governor [[Andrew Oliver]] called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the Assembly petitioned for his recall. [[Benjamin Franklin]], postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and fired from his job.

Meanwhile, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]] to lower the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies in order to help the [[East India Company]] undersell smuggled Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea in order to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In most instances, the consignees were forced to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of American Indians, boarded the ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped £10,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Quebec Act|Intolerable Acts}}

The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1943) pp. 353–76
&lt;/ref&gt; The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act of 1774]], which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Massachusetts patriots issued the [[Suffolk Resolves]] and formed an alternative shadow government known as the "Provincial Congress" which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John K. Alexander|title=Samuel Adams: The Life of an American Revolutionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKxy6CQT3zUC&amp;pg=PA187|year=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=187–94|isbn=978-0742570351}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the colonies, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. During secret debates, conservative [[Joseph Galloway]] proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able to approve or disapprove of acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was not accepted. The Congress instead endorsed the proposal of John Adams that Americans would obey Parliament voluntarily but would resist all taxes in disguise. Congress called for a boycott beginning on 1 December 1774 of all British goods; it was enforced by new committees authorized by the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eT-HM6ruYTwC&amp;pg=PA143|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=143|display-authors=etal|isbn=0495915254}}

Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on 19 April 1775. The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of [[Provincial Congress]]es. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory—but at a great cost: about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey. ''"A few bloody noses"'' (2002) pp. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Continental Congress was divided on the best course of action, but eventually produced the [[Olive Branch Petition]], in which they attempted to come to an accord with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]. The king, however, issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]] which stated that the states were "in rebellion" and the members of Congress were traitors.

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]] under generals [[Benedict Arnold]] and [[Richard Montgomery]]. The attack was a complete failure; many Americans who weren't killed were either captured or died of smallpox.

In March 1776, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]], with George Washington as the commander of the new army. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. There still were many Loyalists, but they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1948) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating new state constitutions==
Following the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in June 1775, the Patriots had control of Massachusetts outside the Boston city limits, and the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive with no protection from the British army. In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared that they were states now, not colonies.&lt;ref name = "Pole-ch29"&gt;Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution. In May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; The new states were all committed to republicanism, with no inherited offices. They decided what form of government to create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. On 26 May 1776, [[John Adams]] wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia:

"Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters. There will be no end of it. New claims will arise. Women will demand a vote. Lads from twelve to twenty one will think their rights not enough attended to, and every man, who has not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other in all acts of state. It tends to confound and destroy all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks, to one common level".&lt;ref&gt;Founding the Republic: A Documentary History; edited by John J. Patrick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reason, Religion, and Democracy: Dennis C. Muelle. p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting constitutions in states such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York, and [[Constitution of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts' constitution is still in force in the 21st century, continuously since its ratification on June 15, 1780&lt;/ref&gt; featured:
* Property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications)&lt;ref name = "Pole-ch29"/&gt;
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower
* Strong [[governor]]s with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]]

In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire, the resulting constitutions embodied:
* universal manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property-owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later)
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]]
* relatively weak governors without veto powers, and with little appointing authority
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts

The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.&lt;ref name="Wood, 1992"/&gt;

==Independence and Union==

{{Further|Lee Resolution|Articles of Confederation|Committee of Five|United States Declaration of Independence}}

In April 1776, the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] issued the [[Halifax Resolves]] explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation'' (1968) pp. 678–79&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule. By June, nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. [[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On June 11, a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee; it was unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4,&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41–46&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the colonies became independent and autonomous. The next step was to form a union to facilitate international relations and alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David. ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History.'' Harvard University Press, London. 2007. "The Articles of Confederation safeguarded it for each of the thirteen states in Article II ("Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence"), but confined its international expression to Congress alone."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesesis, Alexander. ''Self-Government and the Declaration of Independence.'' Cornell Law Review, Volume 97
Issue 4. May 2012. ''(applying the Declaration in the context of state sovereignty while dealing with personal liberty laws, noting that "after the declaration of independence in 1776, each state, at least before the confederation, was a sovereign, independent body")''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Continental Congress approved the "Articles of Confederation" for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777; the Congress immediately began operating under the Articles' terms, providing a structure of shared sovereignty during prosecution of the war and facilitating international relations and alliances with France and Spain. The articles were ratified on March 1, 1781.  At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place on the following day, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klos, ''President Who? Forgotten Founders'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defending the Revolution==
{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}

===British return: 1776–1777===
{{Further|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}
According to British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]], the British had significant advantages, including a highly trained army, the world's largest navy, and a highly efficient system of public finance that could easily fund the war. However, the British were seriously handicapped by their misunderstanding of the depth of support for the Patriot position. Ignoring the advice of General Gage, they misinterpreted the situation as merely a large-scale riot. London decided that they could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force, forcing them to be loyal again:

{{quote|Convinced that the Revolution was the work of a full few miscreants who had rallied an armed rabble to their cause, they expected that the revolutionaries would be intimidated…. Then the vast majority of Americans, who were loyal but cowed by the terroristic tactics… would rise up, kick out the rebels, and restore loyal government in each colony.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2008) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Washington forced the British out of Boston in the spring of 1776, and neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army in August at the [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]]. Following that victory, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities.&lt;ref name="Schecter, Barnet 2002"&gt;Schecter, Barnet. ''The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution''. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough, 1776 2005"&gt;McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]] on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured Washington's army. They made New York their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. The city became the destination for Loyalist refugees and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].&lt;ref name="Schecter, Barnet 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough, 1776 2005"/&gt;

The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania. Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey in a surprise attack in late December 1776 and defeated [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining control of most of New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to Patriots at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.

In 1777, the British sent Burgoyne's invasion force from Canada south to New York to seal off New England. Their aim was to neutralize the [[Yankee#Early usage|Yankees]], whom the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. The British army in New York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination, capturing it from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] was much too slow and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Valentine, ''Lord George Germain'' (1962) pp.&amp;nbsp;309–10&lt;/ref&gt; The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists,&lt;ref name="Larry G. Bowman 1976"&gt;Larry G. Bowman, ''Captive Americans: Prisoners During the American Revolution'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat operations.&lt;ref name="Larry G. Bowman 1976"/&gt; At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Triumph of Freedom, 1775–1783'' (1948) p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American alliances after 1778===
{{Further|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress. Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"&gt;Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America and to unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathized with colonial grievances now turned against the Americans for allying with Britain's international rival and enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were more lucrative to British investors.

British commander [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] evacuated Philadelphia and returned to New York City. General Washington intercepted Clinton in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83"&gt;Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Us unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|&lt;center&gt;[[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] troops hired out to the British by their German sovereigns&lt;/center&gt;]]

===The British move South, 1778–1783===
{{Further|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}}

The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern states. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.&lt;ref&gt;Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p.&amp;nbsp;157–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780, they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]], as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping that the Loyalists would rally to the flag.&lt;ref name="Henry Lumpkin 2000"&gt;Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains that the British had previously made.&lt;ref name="Henry Lumpkin 2000"/&gt;

====Surrender at Yorktown (1781)====
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}

[[File:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=The Siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, paving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary War|&lt;center&gt;The [[siege of Yorktown]] ended with the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The British army under Cornwallis marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Morrissey, ''Yorktown 1781: The World Turned Upside Down'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet showed up, but so did a larger French fleet, so the British fleet returned to New York for reinforcements after the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], leaving Cornwallis trapped. In October 1781, the British surrendered their second invading army of the war, under a siege by the combined French and Continental armies commanded by Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey pp. 493–515&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of the war===
Historians continue to debate whether the odds for American victory were long or short. [[John E. Ferling]] says that the odds were so long that the American victory was  "almost a miracle".&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Joseph Ellis]] says that the odds favored the Americans, and asks whether there ever was any realistic chance for the British to win. He argues that this opportunity came only once, in the summer of 1776, and the British failed that test. Admiral Howe and his brother General Howe "missed several opportunities to destroy the Continental Army.... Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weather played crucial roles." Ellis's point is that the strategic and tactical decisions of the Howes were fatally flawed because they underestimated the challenges posed by the Patriots. Ellis concludes that, once the Howe brothers failed, the opportunity for a British victory "would never come again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph J. Ellis|title=Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4RqZJzho1QC&amp;pg=PR11|year=2013|publisher=Random House|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the Americans, but now it reached a new low.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.528&lt;/ref&gt; King George III personally wanted to fight on, but his supporters lost control of Parliament and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A final naval battle was fought on March 10, 1783 by Captain [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] and the crew of the [[USS Alliance (1778)|USS ''Alliance'']], who defeated three British warships led by HMS ''Sybille''. Martin I. J. Griffin, ''The Story of Commodore John Barry'' (2010) pp. 218–23&lt;/ref&gt; It would be three decades until war resumed again with the [[War of 1812]], which firmly established the permanence of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Langguth |first=A.

Washington could not know that the British would not reopen hostilities after Yorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''. The unrest among officers of the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783–1802'' (1975) pp. 17–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris peace treaty==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
During negotiations in Paris, the American delegation discovered that France would support independence, but no territorial gains. The new nation would be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. The American delegation opened direct secret negotiations with London, cutting the French out. British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] was in full charge of the British negotiations. He now saw a chance to make the United States a valuable economic partner.&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Ritcheson, "The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782–1783: Vision and Reality." ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322–45.&lt;/ref&gt;  The US obtained all the land east of the Mississippi River, south of Canada, and north of Florida. It gained fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed came to pass. Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their businesses flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan R. Dull|title=A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W86WS9Z0ycYC&amp;pg=PA144|year=1987|publisher=Yale up|pages=144–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British largely abandoned the Indian allies living in the new nation. They were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. However, the British did promise to support the Indians. They sold them munitions and maintained forts in American territory until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Deverell, ed.|title=A Companion to the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3q_0ZgquK4C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2008|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on Britain===
Losing the war and the Thirteen Colonies was a shock to Britain. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's [[fiscal-military state]] when they discovered that they suddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside Parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.&lt;ref name="William Hague 2004"&gt;William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeremy Black 2006"&gt;Jeremy Black, ''George III: America's Last King''(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a powerful crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.&lt;ref name="William Hague 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeremy Black 2006"/&gt; Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the [[Second British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
Britain's war against the Americans, French, and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money that it needed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) pp. 81, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]], while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers.&lt;ref name="John Brewer 1990 p 91"&gt;John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688–1783'' (1990) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London. The British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.&lt;ref name="John Brewer 1990 p 91"/&gt;

In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815'' (1962) pp. 23–44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens.&lt;ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225"&gt;Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp. 225–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin J. Perkins, ''American public finance and financial services, 1700–1815'' (1994) pp. 85–106. [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=+%22war+of+1812%22+finance&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C27 Complete text line free]&lt;/ref&gt; Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise that it would be made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225"/&gt;

Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [[Bank of North America]] to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the confederated states.&lt;ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225"/&gt;

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp. 586–89&lt;/ref&gt; Congress made two issues of paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry M. Mays|title=Historical Dictionary of Revolutionary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAgEVl8wQmsC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Volney Harlow, "Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775–1783," ''American Historical Review'' (1929) 35#1 pp. 46–68 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780, Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork, and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.&lt;ref&gt;Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775–1783'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam, lent large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776–1790'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating a "more perfect union" and guaranteeing rights===
{{see also|Federalist Party|Annapolis Convention (1786)|United States Bill of Rights}}
The war finally ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557–624&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts.

Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781–1789'' (1987) pp. 245–66&lt;/ref&gt; It adopted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, including an effective executive in a [[Separation of powers|check-and-balance]] system with the judiciary and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781–1789'' pp. 300–13&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government. The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781–1789'' pp. 300–22&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments to the Constitution were spearheaded in Congress by [[James Madison]] as assurances to those who were cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the [[inalienable rights]] that formed a foundation for the revolution. The amendments were ratified by the states in 1791.

===National debt===
{{Further|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt fell into three categories after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and factions==
The population of the 13 Colonies was not homogeneous in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely within regions and communities and even within families, and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===Ideology behind the Revolution===
{{Main| Age of Enlightenment | American Enlightenment|Liberalism in the United States|Republicanism in the United States}}
The American Enlightenment was a critical precursor of the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of Natural Law, Natural Rights, Consent of the Governed, Individualism, Property Rights, Self-Ownership, Self-Determination, liberalism, republicanism and fear of corruption. Collectively, the acceptance of these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Ferguson, ''The American Enlightenment, 1750–1820'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberalism====

[[File:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Adams is a stern middle-aged man with gray hair is wearing a dark red suit. He is standing behind a table, holding a rolled up document in one hand, and pointing with the other hand to a large document on the table.|&lt;center&gt;In this {{circa|1772}} portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]], Samuel Adams points at the [[Explanatory charter|Massachusetts Charter]], which he viewed as a constitution that protected the people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Revolutionary Politician'', 103, 136; Maier, ''Old Revolutionaries'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking behind the revolution, especially through his indirect influence on English writers such as [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]], [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], and [[Benjamin Hoadly]], whose political ideas in turn had a strong influence on the American revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), pp. 136–38&lt;/ref&gt; Locke is often referred to as "the philosopher of the American Revolution" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey D. Schultz|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dy1MNv8ou-0C&amp;pg=PA148|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood|page=148|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]] published in 1689 were especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the "consent of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in "equality by creation" and "rights by creation".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd (2010): ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'', New York, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the "[[social contract]]" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].&lt;ref name=Toth1989&gt;Charles W. Toth, ''Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite: The American Revolution and the European Response.'' (1989) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen2008&gt;Philosophical Tales, by Martin Cohen, (Blackwell 2008), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans heavily used [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]'s analysis of the wisdom of the "balanced" British Constitution ([[mixed government]]).

====Republicanism====
{{main| Republicanism in the United States}}
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
A central motivating force behind the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism",{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} which was dominant in the colonies by 1775 but of minor importance back in Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The republicanism was inspired by the "[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]" in Great Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Great Britain.&lt;ref name= Weintraub2005&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Americans feared that the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, '' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 125–37&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in London but at home, as well. The colonists associated it with luxury, and especially with inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 35, 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;Shalhope, ''Toward a Republican Synthesis'' (1972) pp. 49–80&lt;/ref&gt; which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen. John Adams wrote to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreeing with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued:

{{quote|There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society.&lt;ref name=Rahe1994&gt;Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For women, "[[republican motherhood]]" became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.&lt;ref&gt;Linda K. Kerber, ''Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fusing republicanism and liberalism=====

[[File:commonsense.jpg|thumb|alt=Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, published in 1776|&lt;center&gt;[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', published in 1776&lt;/center&gt;]]
Some republics had emerged throughout history, such as the [[Roman Republic]] of the ancient world, but none ever existed that was based on liberal principles. Thomas Paine's pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in [[Tavern#North America|taverns]], contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism together, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2000 pp. 465"&gt;Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2000 pp. 465"/&gt;

====Impact of Great Awakening====
{{main|First Great Awakening}}
[[English Dissenters|Dissenting churches of the day]] (Protestant, non-Church of England) were the "school of democracy", in the words of Patricia Bonomi.&lt;ref name=Bonomi&gt;Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 "Religion and the American Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Bible. Throughout the colonies, dissenting Protestant ministers ([[Congregationalist]], Baptist, and Presbyterian) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England clergymen preached loyalty to the king, the titular head of the English state church.&lt;ref name=Nelson1961&gt;William H. Nelson, ''The American Tory'' (1961) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Religious motivation for fighting tyranny transcended socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.&lt;ref name=Bonomi/&gt;

The Declaration also referred to the "Laws of Nature and of Nature's God" as justification for the Americans' separation from the British monarchy. Most eighteenth-century Americans believed that nature, the entire universe, was God's creation&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–6&lt;/ref&gt; and he was "Nature's God". Everything, including man, was part of the "universal order of things", which began with God and was directed by his providence.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the signers of the Declaration professed their "firm reliance on the Protection of divine Providence", and they appealed to "the Supreme Judge for the rectitude of our intentions".&lt;ref&gt;Kidd (2010), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his countrymen, [[George Washington]] was firmly convinced that he was an instrument of providence, to the benefit of the American people and of all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] argues that the evangelicalism of the era challenged traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches that all men are equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd argues that religious disestablishment, belief in God as the source of human rights, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role.&lt;ref name="Thomas S. Kidd 2010"&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Heimert argues that New Light anti-authoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial American society and set the stage for a confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Heimert, ''Religion and the American Mind: From the Great Awakening to the Revolution''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|List of clergy in the American Revolution}}

===Class and psychology of the factions===
Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:

{{quote|The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people&amp;nbsp;... This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of class, Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic connections to British merchants and government; for instance, prominent merchants in major port cities such as New York, Boston and Charleston tended to be Loyalists, as did men involved with the [[fur trade]] along the northern frontier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In addition, officials of colonial government and their staffs, those who had established positions and status to maintain, favored maintaining relations with Great Britain. They often were linked to British families in England by marriage as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

By contrast, Patriots by number tended to be [[Yeoman#United States|yeomen farmers]], especially in the frontier areas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania, Virginia and down the Appalachian mountains.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} They were craftsmen and small merchants. Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated, propertied classes. The Patriots included many prominent men of the [[Planter (American South)|planter class]] from Virginia and South Carolina, for instance, who became leaders during the Revolution, and formed the new government at the national and state levels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

To understand the opposing groups, historians have assessed evidence of their hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots.&lt;ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164–65"&gt;Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164–65&lt;/ref&gt; Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side.&lt;ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344"&gt;Hull et al., ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167"&gt;Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire).&lt;ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167"/&gt;

Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.&lt;ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167"/&gt; Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.&lt;ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164–65"/&gt;

Historians in the early 20th century, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]], examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles A. Beard]], [[Carl L. Becker|Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 50&amp;nbsp;years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution'' (1966) pp. 3–32&lt;/ref&gt; Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army.&lt;ref name="Nash 2005"&gt;Nash (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Resch 2006"&gt;Resch (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality. They were especially successful in Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.&lt;ref name="Nash 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Resch 2006"/&gt;

===King George III===
{{main|George III of Great Britain}}
The war became a personal issue for [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, "'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution." ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp. 1–46. P. D. G. Thomas, "George III and the American Revolution." ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16–31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{Further|Sons of Liberty}}
Those who fought for independence were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans" during and after the war. They included a full range of social and economic classes but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens. Newspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers) and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters, and pronouncements.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Sue Humphrey, ''The American Revolution and the Press: The Promise of Independence'' (Northwestern University Press; 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Robert Calhoon, 40–45% of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the Patriots' cause, 15–20% supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in {{cite book|author1=Jack P. Greene|author2=J. R.

He concludes that such people held a sense of rights which the British were violating, rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British response to the Boston Tea Party. The arrival in Boston of the British Army heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had faith that God was on their side.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T. H. Breen, in ''The Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#1 p. 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; The signers of the Declaration of Independence were mostly well-educated, of British stock, and of the Protestant faith.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Robbins]],  "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers."

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}
[[File:Mobbing the Tories - Project Gutenberg eText 16960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|&lt;center&gt;Mobbing of a Loyalist by American Patriots in 1775–76&lt;/center&gt;]]
The consensus of scholars is that about 15–20% of the white population remained loyal to the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in Greene and Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (1980) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1NuzpAcH8C&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who actively supported the king were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it. They were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, and often connected to the Church of England; they included many established merchants with strong business connections throughout the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in Greene and Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (1980) pp. 235–47,&lt;/ref&gt; There were 500 to 1,000 [[Black Loyalist|black loyalists]], slaves who escaped to British lines and joined the British army. Most died of disease, but Britain took the survivors to Canada as free men.

The revolution could divide families, such as [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and royal governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] who remained loyal to the Crown throughout the war. He and his father never spoke again.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila L. Skemp, ''Benjamin and William Franklin: Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]] who was a Scottish settler in the back country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Magee|title=Loyalist Mosaic: A Multi-Ethnic Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsENbI3JIo0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=1984|publisher=Dundurn|pages=137ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the great majority of the approximately 500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some became prominent American leaders, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]]. Approximately 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada; others moved to Britain (7,000), Florida, or the West Indies (9,000). The exiles represented approximately two percent of the total population of the colonies.&lt;ref name="Pole 1994"&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all black loyalists left for Nova Scotia, Florida, or England, where they could remain free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/exile/chaos.htm |title=Chaos in New York |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=Black Loyalists: Our People, Our History |publisher=Canada's Digital Collections |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117073405/http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/exile/chaos.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists who left the South in 1783 took thousands of their slaves with them to be slaves in the British West Indies.&lt;ref name="Pole 1994"/&gt;

===Neutrals===
A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile, but the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] were the most important group to speak out for neutrality, especially in Pennsylvania. The Quakers continued to do business with the British even after the war began, and they were accused of being supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Quakers attempted to remain neutral, although a sizable number of [[Quakers in the American Revolution]] nevertheless participated to some degree.

===Role of women===
[[File:Abigail Adams.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Abigail Adams|&lt;center&gt;[[Abigail Adams]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{Main|Women in the American Revolution}}

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]], fighting disguised as men. Also, [[Mercy Otis Warren]] held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eileen K. Cheng|title=The Plain and Noble Garb of Truth: Nationalism &amp; Impartiality in American Historical Writing, 1784–1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-dg5Zh8n4wC&amp;pg=PA210|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.&lt;ref name="Berkin, 2006 pp. 59–60"&gt;Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods,&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41&lt;/ref&gt; as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving their own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.&lt;ref name="Berkin, 2006 pp. 59–60"/&gt;

A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main|France in the American Revolutionary War}}
In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. American rebels obtained some munitions through the [[Dutch Republic]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{main|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}
Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]], also served as governor of Louisiana. He led an expedition of colonial troops to force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Indians===
{{main|Native Americans in the United States}}
{{further|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War}}
Most American Indians rejected pleas that they remain neutral and instead supported the British Crown.  The great majority of the 200,000 Indians east of the Mississippi distrusted the Colonists and supported the British cause, hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Those tribes that were more closely involved in trade tended to side with the Patriots, although political factors were important, as well.

Most Indians did not participate directly in the war, except for warriors and bands associated with four of the [[Iroquois]] nations in New York and Pennsylvania which allied with the British. The British did have other allies, especially in the upper Midwest. They provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining what they perceived to be a European conflict, and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed. The [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] among the Iroquois of central and western New York supported the American cause.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British provided arms to Indians who were led by [[Loyalists]] in war parties to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York. They killed many settlers on the frontier, especially in Pennsylvania and New York's Mohawk Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Karim M. Tiro, "A 'Civil' War? Rethinking Iroquois Participation in the American Revolution." ''Explorations in Early American Culture'' 4 (2000): 148-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, [[Cherokee]] war parties attacked American Colonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands throughout the [[Washington District, North Carolina]] (now Tennessee) and the Kentucky wilderness area.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H. O'Donnell, III, ''Southern Indians in the American Revolution'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; They would launch raids with roughly 200 warriors, as seen in the [[Cherokee–American wars]]; they could not mobilize enough forces to invade Colonial areas without the help of allies, most often the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]]. The [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] under [[Dragging Canoe]] allied themselves closely with the British, and fought on for an additional decade after the signing of the Treaty of Paris.

[[Joseph Brant]] of the powerful [[Mohawk nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York, was the most prominent Indian leader against the Colonial forces. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops, and stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Graymont |first=Barbara |title=Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/thayendanegea_5E.html  |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans.&lt;ref name="Colin G. Calloway 1995"&gt;Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779, the Colonists forced the hostile Indians out of upstate New York when Washington sent an army under [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] which destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New York. The [[Battle of Newtown]] proved decisive as the Patriots had a 3-1 advantage and ended significant resistance. Otherwise there was little combat. Sullivan systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that composed the winter food supply. Facing starvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to Canada. The British resettled them in Ontario, providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they did not really control, and did not consult their Indian allies. They transferred control to the United States of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:

{{quote|Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;Calloway (1995) p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British did not give up their forts in the West until 1796 in what is now the eastern Midwest, stretching from Ohio to Wisconsin; they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral Indian Zone. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith| first=Dwight L.| year=1989| title=A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea| journal=Northwest Ohio Quarterly| volume=61| issue=2–4| pages=46–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis M.

===Black Americans===
{{main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}
Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but [[Military history of African Americans#Revolutionary War|most fought for the Patriots]]. Gary Nash reports that there were about 9,000 black Patriots, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and spies.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, "The African Americans Revolution," in   ''Oxford Handbook of the American Revolution'' (2012) edited by Edward G Gray and Jane Kamensky pp. 250–70, at p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Raphael notes that thousands did join the Loyalist cause, but "a far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots."&lt;ref&gt;Ray Raphael, ''A People's History of the American Revolution'' (2001) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crispus Attucks]] was shot dead by British soldiers in the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770 and is an iconic martyr to Patriots.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Both sides offered freedom and re-settlement to slaves who were willing to fight for them, recruiting slaves whose owners supported the opposing cause.{{Citation needed|reason=Did the patriots do this?  This article includes citations for the British having done this, but I don't see anything here that the patriots did. I believe a few slave owners probably did, but those were too rare to justify this sweeping claim.|date=March 2017}}

Many black slaves sided with the Loyalists. Tens of thousands in the South used the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution, the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans.&lt;ref name="Revolutionary War: The Home Front"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[David Brion Davis]] explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves:

{{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own [[West Indies]], where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave [[insurrection]]s. The British elites also understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain's seventeenth-century civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davis underscored the British dilemma: "Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure".&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonists, however, accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.&lt;ref&gt;Schama pp. 28–30, 78–90&lt;/ref&gt;

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what was termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, at the same time that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves. [[Samuel Johnson]] snapped, "how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?"&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about "the freeing of one Negro" ([[Somersett's Case|Somersett]]) while they continued to permit the [[Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Wheatley]] was a black poet who popularized the image of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to represent America. She came to public attention when her ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' appeared in 1773.&lt;ref name="Hochschild p.50-51"&gt;Hochschild pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, slaves escaped from New England and the mid-Atlantic area to British-occupied cities such as New York. The effects of the war were more dramatic in the South. In Virginia, royal governor Lord [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Dunmore]] recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of freedom, protection for their families, and land grants. Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For instance, [[South Carolina]] was estimated to have lost about 25,000 slaves to flight, migration, or death—amounting to one third of its slave population. From 1770 to 1790, the black proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent, and from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

British forces gave transportation to 10,000 slaves when they evacuated [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], carrying through on their promise.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; They evacuated and resettled more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s from New York to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada]], and [[Lower Canada]]. Others sailed with the British to England or were resettled as freedmen in the [[West Indies]] of the Caribbean. But slaves who were carried to the Caribbean under control of Loyalist masters generally remained slaves until British abolition in its colonies in 1834. More than 1,200 of the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]], where they became leaders of the [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Krio]] ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government. Many of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone, as well as other African countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2007), see also [http://www.blackloyalist.com/ blackloyalist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of the Revolution==

===Loyalist expatriation===
Tens of thousands of Loyalists left the United States&amp;nbsp;– the current high estimate is 70,000 by Maya Jasanoff.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Jasanoff, ''Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World'' (2011). However Philip Ranlet estimates that only 20,000 adult white Loyalists went to Canada. "How Many American Loyalists Left the United States?." ''Historian'' 76.2 (2014): 278–307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some migrated to Britain. The great majority, known as [[United Empire Loyalists]], received land and subsidies for resettlement in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Stewart Wallace, ''The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329042740/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm |date=2012-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were expressly created by Britain for their benefit, where the Crown awarded land to Loyalists as compensation for losses in the United States. Britain wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada on a British colonial model. But about 80% of the Loyalists stayed in the United States and became full, loyal citizens; some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tine, ''American Loyalists'' (1902) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Needs up-to-date sources examining the Loyalists in Canada--&gt;

===Interpretations===
Interpretations vary concerning the effect of the Revolution. Contemporaries of the period referred to it as "the revolution",&lt;ref&gt;David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One modern writer argues that the events were not revolutionary because, according to his opinion, the relationships and property rights of colonial society were not significantly transformed. He posits that a distant government was simply replaced with a local one. (Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93–102)&lt;/ref&gt; although the war is sometimes known as the "American War of Independence" outside the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] view the American Revolution as a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound effect on world affairs, such as an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; John Murrin, by contrast, argues that the definition of "the people" at that time was mostly restricted to free men who were able to pass a property-qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Voting Rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|title=U.S. Voting Rights|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view argues that any significant gain of the revolution was irrelevant in the short term to women, black Americans and slaves, poor white men, youth, and American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|title=Voting in Early America|last=Crews|first=Ed|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. ''Native Vote,'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan has argued that, in terms of long-term impact on American society and values:
:The Revolution did revolutionize social relations. It did displace the deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined the way people viewed one another for centuries and still view one another in much of the world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world so different from the one in which the revolutionists had grown up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Genuine Article: A Historian Looks at Early America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ve9u9pBeB0C&amp;pg=PA246|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=246|isbn=978-0393347845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspiring all colonies===
{{Further|Atlantic Revolutions}}
After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible in the former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278–79&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/&gt; On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/&gt;

The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]]: the [[French Revolution]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) ch. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution had a strong, immediate influence in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. In Ireland, there was a profound impact; the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestants who controlled Ireland]] were demanding more and more self-rule. Under the leadership of [[Henry Grattan]], the so-called "[[Irish Patriot Party#Grattan's Patriots|Patriots]]" forced the reversal of mercantilist prohibitions against trade with other British colonies. The King and his cabinet in London could not risk another rebellion on the American model, and made a series of concessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Armed Protestant volunteer units were set up to protect against an invasion from France. As in America, so too in Ireland the King no longer had a monopoly of lethal force.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. McDowell, ''Ireland in the Age of Imperialism and Revolution, 1760–1801'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the 17th century [[English Civil War]], was among the examples of overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence influenced the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804. States such as New Jersey and New York adopted gradual emancipation, which kept some people as slaves for more than two decades longer.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole pp. 409, 453–54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of American women===
The democratic ideals of the Revolution inspired changes in the roles of women.&lt;ref&gt;Linda K. Kerber, et al. "Beyond Roles, Beyond Spheres: Thinking about Gender in the Early Republic," ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' (1989), 46#3 565–85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1922356 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[republican motherhood]] was inspired by this period and reflects the importance of [[revolutionary republicanism|Republicanism as the dominant American ideology]]. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.

The traditional constraints gave way to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate the size of their families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750–1800'' (3rd ed. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
Whatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disfranchised and usually with only the role of mother open to them. But, some women earned livelihoods as midwives and in other roles in the community, which were not originally recognized as significant by men.

[[Abigail Adams]] expressed to her husband, the president, the desire of women to have a place in the new republic:

{{quote|I desire you would remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Woody Holton|title=Abigail Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltgyHkFGF3EC&amp;pg=PA172|year=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=172|isbn=978-1451607369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Revolution sparked a discussion on the rights of woman and an environment favorable to women's participation in politics. Briefly the possibilities for women's rights were highly favorable, but a backlash led to a greater rigidity that excluded women from politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Zagarri]], ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than thirty years, however, the 1776 [[New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth, including unmarried women and blacks (not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands), until in 1807, when that state legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal ''white male'' [[suffrage]], excluding paupers.&lt;ref&gt;Klinghoffer and Elkis ("The Petticoat Electors: W omen's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159–93.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of African Americans===
In the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and individuals took actions to free numerous slaves, in part based on revolutionary ideals. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states, such as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed laws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery by a gradual method; in New York, the last slaves were freed in 1827.

While no southern state abolished slavery, for a period individual owners could free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves as a reward for service. Records also suggest that some slaveholders were freeing their own [[mixed-race]] children, born into slavery to slave mothers.

===Commemorations===

The American Revolution has a central place in the American memory&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, ''A Season of Youth: The American Revolution and the Historical Imagination'' (1978); Kammen, ''Mystic Chords of Memory: The Transformation of Tradition in American Culture'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; as the story of the nation's founding. It is covered in the schools, memorialized by a [[Independence Day (United States)|national holiday]], and commemorated in innumerable monuments. George Washington's estate at [[Mount Vernon]] was one of the first national pilgrimages for tourists and attracted 10,000 visitors a year by the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean B. Lee, "Historical Memory, Sectional Strife, and the American Mecca: Mount Vernon, 1783–1853," ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (2001) 109#3 pp. 255–300 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4249931 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution became a matter of contention in the 1850s in the debates leading to the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), as spokesmen of both the [[Northern United States]] and the [[Southern United States]] claimed that their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan B. Crider, "De Bow's Revolution: The Memory of the American Revolution in the Politics of the Sectional Crisis, 1850–1861," ''American Nineteenth Century History'' (2009) 10#3 pp. 317–32&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976 came a year after the American withdrawal from the [[Vietnam War]], and speakers stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;David Ryan, "Re-enacting Independence through Nostalgia – The 1976 US Bicentennial after the Vietnam War," ''Forum for Inter-American Research'' (2012) 5#3 pp. 26–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, more than 100 [[:Category:American Revolutionary War sites|battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution]] are protected and maintained by the government.  The [[National Park Service]] alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/revwar/contact/park_info.html National Park Service Revolutionary War Sites.] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Battlefield Trust]] preserves almost 700 acres of battlefield land in six states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/preserve/saved-land] [[American Battlefield Trust]] "Saved Land" webpage.

'''American urban history''' is the study of cities of the United States. [[Local history|Local historians]] have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2344 Online review by  Andrea Tuttle Kornbluh  1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's [[History of agrarianism|agrarianism]] and the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, ''Americans Against the City: Anti-Urbanism in the Twentieth Century'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary Sies (2003) argues:
:At the start of the twenty-first century, North American urban history is flourishing. Compared to twenty-five years ago, the field has become more interdisciplinary and intellectually invigorating.  Scholars are publishing increasingly sophisticated efforts to understand how the city as space intersects the urbanization process, as well as studies that recognize the full complexity of experiences for different metropolitan cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mary Corbin |last = Sies|title = North American Urban History: The Everyday Politics and Spatial Logics of Metropolitan Life|journal = Urban History Review/Revue d'histoire urbaine|volume = 32|number =1 |date =2003|pages = 28-42|url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/uhr/2003/v32/n1/1015740ar.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
American urban history is a branch of the [[history of the United States]] and of the broader field of [[Urban history]]. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]] [[business history]], and even [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.

In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888–1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915–2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence J. McDonald, "Theory and Practice in the 'New' History: Rereading Arthur Meier Schlesinger's The Rise of the City, 1878-1898," ''Reviews in American History'' (1992) 20#3 pp. 432-445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703171 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Handlin added a focus on groups defined by ethnicity (that is Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians Hispanics etc.) or by class (working class or middle class). The Harvard model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Zane L. Miller,  "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City." ''Reviews in American History'' 24.3 (1996) pp: 361-368. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v024/24.3miller.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New urban history ===
The "new urban history" was a short-lived movement that attracted a great deal of attention In the 1960s, then quickly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds., ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; It used statistical methods and innovative computer techniques to analyze manuscript census data, person by person, focusing especially on the geographical and social mobility of random samples of residents. Numerous monographs appeared, but it proved frustrating to interpret the results. Historian [[Stephan Thernstrom]], the leading promoter of the new approach, soon disavowed it, saying it was neither new nor urban nor history.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Monkkonen, ''America Becomes Urban: The Development of U.S. Cities and Towns, 1780-1980'' (1988) pp 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall urban history grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, stimulated by the surge of interest in social history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L. Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1990s, however, the field has been aging and has had much less attraction to younger scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Bender|title=Intellect and Public Life: Essays on the Social History of Academic Intellectuals in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=240iKp_jVjoC&amp;pg=PR11|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=11|quote= urban history, a field marked by deep decline in historiographical significance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims for urban impact ===
Historian [[Richard Clement Wade|Richard Wade]] has summarized the claims that scholars have made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The cities, especially Boston, were the seed beds of the American Revolution.  Rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads.  The cities sponsored [[entrepreneurship]], especially in terms of export and import markets, banking, finance, and the rise of the [[factory system]] after 1812.  The rapidly growing railroad system after 1840 was primarily oriented toward linking together the major cities, which in turn became centers of the wholesale trade.  The railroads allowed major cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, and San Francisco to dominate ever-larger [[hinterland]]s.

The failure of the South to develop an urban infrastructure significantly weakened it during the Civil War, especially as its border cities of Baltimore, Washington, Louisville, and St. Louis, refused to join the Confederacy.  The cities were fonts of innovation in democracy, especially in terms of building powerful political organizations and [[political machine|machines]]; they were also the main base for reformers of those machines.  They became the home base for important immigrant groups, especially the Irish and the Jews.  Cities were the strongholds of labor unions in the 19th and 20th centuries (although no longer so in the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wade, "The City in History: Some American Perspectives," in Werner Z. Hirsch, ed., ''Urban Life and Form'' (1963) pp 59-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Zane Miller argues that urban history was rejuvenated in mid-20th century by the realization that the cultural importance of the city went far beyond art galleries and museums. Historians began to emphasize "the importance of individual choices in the past and made the advocacy of lifestyle choices a hallmark of American civilization."  It was the diversity of the city, and the support it provided for diverse lifestyles, that set it so dramatically apart from towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s there was increased emphasis on racial minorities, outcasts, and gays and lesbians, as well as studies of leisure activities and sports history.&lt;ref&gt;George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: Gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world, 1890-1940'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Riess, ''City games: The evolution of American urban society and the rise of sports'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectuals against the city===
As Morton White demonstrated in ''The Intellectual versus the City: from Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Wright'' (1962), the overwhelming consensus of American intellectuals has been hostile to the city. The main idea is the Romantic view that the unspoiled nature of rural America is morally superior  to the over civilized cities, which are the natural homes of sharpsters and criminals. American poets did not rhapsodize over the cities. On the contrary they portrayed the metropolis as The ugly scene of economic inequality, crime, drunkenness, prostitution and every variety of immorality. Urbanites were set to rhyme as crafty, overly competitive, artificial, and as having lost too much naturalness and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Walker, "The Poet and the Rise of the City." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1962): 85-99. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial era and American Revolution ==
Historian [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] examined in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare.  The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive and corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure and to solve urban problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid.  Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to "democratic yearnings" for political power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955), pp 147, 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L.

Colonial powers established villages of a few hundred population as administrative centers, providing a governmental presence, as well has trading opportunities, and some transportation facilities. Representative examples include Spanish towns of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Los Angeles, California]], French towns of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; Dutch towns of [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City), and the Russian town of [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] (now Sitka).  When their territory was absorbed into the United States, these towns expanded their administrative roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (1993) 1: 113-154, 233-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous historians have explored the roles of working-class men, including slaves, in the economy of the colonial cities,&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Work in the Cities of Colonial British North America," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#6 pp 1021-1032&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Class and the History of Working People in the Early Republic."

There were few cities in the entire South, and Charleston (Charles Town) and New Orleans were the most important before the Civil War. The colony of South Carolina was settled mainly by [[Planter (American South)|planters]] from the overpopulated [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar]] island colony of [[Barbados]], who brought large numbers of African slaves from that island.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Charleston grew as a port for the shipment of rice and later cotton, so did the community's cultural and social opportunities. The city had a large base of elite merchants and rich planters. The first theater building in America was built in Charleston in 1736, but was later replaced by the 19th-century Planter's Hotel where wealthy planters stayed during Charleston's horse-racing season (now the Dock Street Theatre, known as one of the oldest active theaters built for stage performance in the United States.  Benevolent societies were formed by several different ethnic groups: the South Carolina Society, founded by French [[Huguenot]]s in 1737; the German Friendly Society, founded in 1766; and the Hibernian Society, founded by Irish immigrants in 1801. The [[Charleston Library Society]] was established in 1748 by some wealthy Charlestonians who wished to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the [[College of Charleston]] in 1770, the oldest college in South Carolina, the oldest municipal college in the United States, and the 13th oldest college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Fraser, ''Charleston! Charleston!: The History of a Southern City'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1775 the largest city was Philadelphia at 40,000, followed by New York (25,000), Boston (16,000), Charleston (12,000), and Newport (11,000), along with Baltimore, Norfolk, and Providence, with 6000, 6000, and 4400 population. They too were all seaports and on any one day each hosted a large transient population of Sailors and visiting businessmen. On the eve of the Revolution, 95 percent of the American population lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution'' (2007) [https://www.questia.com/library/120077070/rebels-rising-cities-and-the-american-revolution online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gary B. Nash]] emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, ''The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution'' (2nd ed. 1986) pp 240-47; the first edition of 1979 was entitled ''Urban Crucible: Social Change, Political Consciousness, and the Origins of the American Revolution)''&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new nation, 1783–1815 ==
The cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775-83. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy.  Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, as well as Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston for briefer periods.  During the occupations cities were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. The British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants, resume their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.  The older cities finally restored their economic basis; growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts, (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and especially Baltimore, Maryland.  The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. East, "The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763-1795," ''Journal of Economic History''  (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16-27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and financiers of the cities were especially sensitive to the weakness of the old Confederation system; when it came time to ratify the much stronger new Constitution in 1788, all the nation's cities, North and South, voted in favor, while the rural districts were divided.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, "An Agenda for Urban History," in Herbert J. Bass, ed., ''The State of American History'' (1970) pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The national capital was at Philadelphia until 1800, when it was moved to Washington. Apart from the murderous Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793, which killed about 10 percent of the population, Philadelphia had a marvelous reputation as the "cleanest, best-governed, healthiest, and most elegant of American cities." Washington, built in a fever-ridden swamp with long hot miserable summers, was ranked far behind Philadelphia, although it did escape Yellow Fever.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Blaine Nye, ''The Cultural Life of the New Nation: 1776-1830'' (1960) pp 127-28&lt;/ref&gt;

World peace only lasted a decade, for in 1793 a two-decade-long war between Britain and France and their allies broke out.  As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798-99 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807-1812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]]. The result was additional serious damage to the mercantile interests.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) remains the best economic overview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Allen Krout and Dixon Ryan Fox, ''The Completion of Independence, 1790–1830'' (1944) is a wide-ranging social history of the new nation; see pp 1-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all was gloomy in urban history, however. Although there was relatively little immigration from Europe,  the [[American frontier|rapid expansion of settlements]] to the West, and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, open up vast frontier lands. New Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States, and entirely new cities were opened in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Nashville and points west.  Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1820, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of New York City (1784–1854)|New York]], with a population of 96,000 in 1810 surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore, 178,000 in Boston (289,000 including the Boston suburbs), and 169,000 in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815-1860'' (1951) pp 388-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. It set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes; it organized a regular transatlantic packet service to England; it built a large-scale coastwise trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for reexport to Europe; it sponsored the Erie Canal, which opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Albion, "New York Port and its disappointed rivals, 1815-1860." ''Journal of Business and Economic History'' (1931) 3: 602-629.&lt;/ref&gt; The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Rubin, "Canal or railroad? Imitation and innovation in the response to the Erie canal in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1961): 1-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Roth, "The Growth of American Cities." ''Geographical Review'' (1918) 5#5 pp: 384-398. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/207468 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   Manufacturing was not a major factor in the growth of the largest cities at this point. Instead  factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities, especially in New England, having waterfalls or fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies, as in Pennsylvania.

===National leadership===
America's financial, business and cultural leadership (that is, literature, the arts, and the media) were concentrated in the three or four largest cities. Political leadership was never concentrated. It was divided between Washington and the state capitals, and many states deliberately moved their state capital out of their largest city, including New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and California.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Montès, ''American Capitals: A Historical Geography'' (2014) &amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic and scientific leadership was weak in the United States until the late 19th century, when it began to be concentrated in universities. A few major research-oriented schools were in or close by the largest cities, such as Harvard (Boston),  Columbia (New York), Johns Hopkins (Baltimore) and Chicago. However,  most were located in smaller cities or large towns such as Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; Cornell in Ithaca, New York; Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; University of Illinois in Urbana; University of Wisconsin in Madison;  University of California in Berkeley, and Stanford in the village of Stanford, California.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Meier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) pp 82-87, 212-16, 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
{{U.S. cities in the Civil War}}

The cities played a major part in the Civil War, providing soldiers, money, training camps, supplies, and media support for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union war effort]].

In the North, discontent with the 1863 [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the [[New York City draft riots]] of July 13 to July 16, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/317749.html The New York City Draft Riots] ''In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City'', 1626–1863, by Leslie M. Harris&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the small Michigan cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bratt, "A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Hershock, "Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860–1865," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederacy===
Cities played a much less important part in the heavily rural Confederacy. When the war started the largest cities in slave states were seized in 1861 by the Union, including Washington, Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville, and St. Louis. The largest and most important Confederate city, New Orleans, was captured in early 1862, and Nashville in 1863. All these cities became major logistic and strategic centers for the Union forces.  All the remaining ports were blockaded by the summer of 1861, ending normal commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting through. The largest remaining cities were Atlanta, the railroad center which was destroyed in 1864, in the national capital in Richmond which held out to the bitter end.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Slap, and Frank Towers, eds. ''Confederate Cities: The Urban South during the Civil War Era''  (University of Chicago Press, 2015). xiv, 302 pp. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in Confederate cities. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1864, the poor white women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCurry, "'Bread or Blood!'" ''Civil War Times'' (2011) 50#3 pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Crisp Williams, and David Williams, "'The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' (2002) 86#12 pp. 49–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven Confederate states in 1860 had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Paskoff, "Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy," ''Civil War History,'' (2008) 54#1 pp 35–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late 19th century growth==
{{Further|Gilded Age}}
===Street traffic===
In a horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel.  However, they produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets, so they looked to wood or granite blocks.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, "A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840-1940." ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was [[asphalt]] paving. With London and Paris as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882, and served as a model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, followed by brick construction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) p 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the largest cities, street railways were elevated, which increased their speed and lessened their dangers. Street-level trolleys moved passengers at 12 miles per hour for 5 cents a ride (with free transfers), They became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort. The working-class typically walked to nearby factories and patronized small local stores.  Big-city streets became paths for faster and larger and more dangerous vehicles, the pedestrians beware.  Underground subways were a solution, with Boston building one in the 1890s followed by New York a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Fairfield, "Rapid Transit: Automobility and Settlement in Urban America" ''Reviews in American History'' 23#1 (1995), pp. 80-85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703240 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The new West ===
After 1860, railroads pushed westward into unsettled territory. They built service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction and repair crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hudson, "Towns of the western railroads." ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 2#1 (1982): 41-54. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=greatplainsquarterly online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunfights and disorder characterized the [[railhead]] towns that were the target of major [[cattle drive]]s from Texas.  The violence was often exaggerated in [[dime novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, ''The cattle towns'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odie B. Faulk, ''Dodge City: The Most Western Town Of All'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this held for Texas as well. Railroads finally arrived in the 1880s and they shipped the cattle out; cattle drives became short-distance affairs.  However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Holden, "Law and Lawlessness on the Texas Frontier, 1875-1890." ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 44.2 (1940): 188-203. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30240564 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denver]]'s economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40 million, and the population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Leonard, and Thomas J. Noel, ''Denver: Mining Camp to Metropolis'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab12.txt|title = Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1890|publisher = U.S. Bureau of the Census|date = 15 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid "cribs" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and "crib girls" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Secrest. ''Hell's Belles: Prostitution, Vice, and Crime in Early Denver, with a Biography of Sam Howe, Frontier Lawman.'' (2nd ed., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

With its giant mountain of copper, [[Butte, Montana]] was the largest, richest and rowdiest [[mining camp]] on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation [[Anaconda Copper]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Emmons, ''The Butte Irish: class and ethnicity in an American mining town, 1875-1925'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, "an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling." It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners the Butte was a cultivated city.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Ring, "The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana," ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' (1993) 28#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;430–44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25542594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciative crowds filled the large, upscale "Belasco" opera house for full-scale operas and top-name artists.&lt;ref&gt;Archie L.

===Skyscrapers and apartment buildings===
{{Main|skyscraper|apartment|tenement}}
In Chicago and New York, new inventions facilitated the emergence of the skyscraper in the 1880s—it was a characteristic American style that was not widely copied around the world until the late 20th century. Construction required several major innovations, the elevator, and the steel beam.  The steel skeleton, developed in the 1880s, replaced the heavy brick walls that were limited to 15 or so stories in height. The skyscraper also required a complex internal structure to solve difficult issues of ventilation, steam heat, gas lighting (and later electricity), and plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Douglas, ''Skyscrapers: A social history of the very tall building in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Urban housing involved a wide variety of styles, but most of the attention focused on the tenement house for the working class, and the apartment building for the middle class.

The apartment building came first, as middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar workers realized they did not need and could scarcely afford single-family dwellings of the type that low land costs in the towns permitted. Boarding houses were inappropriate for family; hotel suites were too expensive.  In smaller cities, there were many apartments over stores and shops, usually occupied by proprietors of small local businesses. The residents paid rent, and did not own their apartments until the emergence of cooperatives in New York City in the 20th century, and condominiums around the country after World War II. Turnover was very high, and there was seldom was a sense of neighborhood community.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Kallman Epstein, "Multifamily Dwellings and the Search for Respectability: Origins of the New York Apartment House," ''Urbanism Past &amp; Present'' (1980) Issue 2, pp 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Collins Cromley, ''Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:The Dakota 1880s.jpg|left|180px|thumb|The Dakota luxury apartment building in New York, view from [[Central Park]],  1890]]

Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in New York in 1869, and [[The Dakota]] in 1884, affluent tenants discovered that full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Stephen |last = Birmingham|title = Life at the Dakota|date = 1979|publisher = Random House|isbn = 9780394410791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alpern, ''New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings'' (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The less-lavish middle-class apartment buildings provided gas lighting, elevators, good plumbing, central heating, and maintenance men on call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Elizabeth|last = Blackmar|title =Manhattan for Rent, 1785-1850|date =1989 |publisher = Cornell University Press|isbn = 9780801420245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston contractors build 16,000 "Triple-Deckers" Between 1870 and 1920. They were modern well-equipped buildings with a single large apartments on each floor. Chicago built thousands of apartment buildings, with the upscale ones close to the lake, where it was warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Harris, ''Chicago Apartments: A Century of Lakefront Luxury'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In every city, apartment buildings were built along the paths of the street railways, for the middle-class tenants rode the streetcar to work, while the working class saved a nickel each way and walked.

The working class crowded into tenement houses, with far fewer features and amenities. They were cheap and easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were typically five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, New York tenements lacked running water or indoor toilets. Garbage pickup was erratic until late in the 19th century. Rents were cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings.  Most of the tenements survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Plunz, ''A History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Social Change in the American Metropolis'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lure of the metropolis===
Jeffersonian America distrusted the city, and rural spokesmen repeatedly warned their young men away.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''The rise of the city'' pp 53-77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 ''The Evening Wisconsin'' newspaper warned cautious boys to stay on the farm. As paraphrased by historian Bayrd Still, the editor painted a grim contrast:
:Pure milk, wholesome water, mellow fruit, vegetables, and proper sleep and exercise are lacking in the city; and the "dense centers of population are unfavorable to moral growth as they are to  physical development." Sharpness and deception characterize the city merchant, mechanic, and professional man as well. How different is the situation of the "sturdy farmer removed from the dust and smoke and filth and vice of the crowded city....Content in his cottage...why should he long for the fare and follies of the madding crowd in the Gay Metropolis?"
The response came from a Milwaukee newspaper editor in 1871, who boasted that the ambitious young man could not be stopped: 
: The young man in the country no sooner elects for himself his course, than he makes for the nearest town. Scarcely has he grown familiar with his new surroundings, when the subtle attractions of the remoter city begin to tell upon him. There is no resisting it. It draws him like a magnet. Sooner or later, it is tolerably certain, he will be sucked into one of the great centers of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bayrd Still, "Milwaukee, 1870-1900: The Emergence of a Metropolis," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1939) 23#2 pp. 138-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4631304 in JSTOR] , quotes at pp 143, and 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformers===
Historians have developed an elaborate typology of reformers in the late 19th century, focusing especially on the urban reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 108-37, 218-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mugwumps]] Were reform-minded Republicans who acted at the national level in the 1870s and 1880s, especially in 1884 when they split their ticket for Democrat Grover Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. McFarland, "The New York mugwumps of 1884: A profile." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1963): 40-58 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146666 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Goo Goos" were the local equivalent:  the middle-class reformers who sought "good government" regardless of party.  They typically focused on urban sanitation, better schools, and lower trolley fares for the middle-class commuters. They especially demanded a nonpolitical civil service system to replace the "spoils of victory" approach by which the winners of an election replaced city and school employees. They often formed short-lived citywide organizations, such as The Committee of 70 in New York, the Citizens' Reform Association in Philadelphia, the Citizens' Association of Chicago, and the Baltimore Reform League. They sometimes won citywide elections, but were rarely reelected. Party regulars laughed at them for trying to be independent of the political party machines by forming nonpartisan tickets. The ridicule included suggestions that the reformers were not real men: they were sissies and "mollycoddles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin P. Murphy|title=Political Manhood: Red Bloods, Mollycoddles, and the Politics of Progressive Era Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KZ_tnz6j2EC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2013|publisher=Columbia UP|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, when historians call "structural reformers" were emerging; they were much more successful at reform, and marked the beginning of the [[Progressive era]]. They used national organizations, such as the [[National Municipal League]], and focused on broader principles such as honesty, efficiency, economy, and centralized decision-making by experts.  "Efficiency" was their watchword, they believed one of the problems with the machines was that they wasted enormous amounts of tax money by creating useless patronage jobs and payoffs to mid-level politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, ''The politics of efficiency: Municipal administration and reform in America, 1880-1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Social reformers emerged in the 1890s, most famously [[Jane Addams]] Enter large complex network of reformers based at [[Hull House]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Hull House in the 1890s: A community of women reformers." ''Signs'' (1985): 658-677 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174308 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; They were less interested in civil service reform or revising the city charter, and concentrated instead on the needs of working class housing, child labor, sanitation and welfare. Protestant churches promoted their own group of reformers, mostly women activists demanding prohibition  or sharp reductions in the baleful influence of the saloon in damaging family finances and causing family violence.  Rural America was increasingly won over by the prohibitionists, but they rarely had success in the larger cities, where they were staunchly opposed by the large German and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;Mohl, ''The New City'' pp 115-33&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] became well organized in cities of every size, and taught middle-class women the techniques of organization, proselytizing, and propaganda. Many of the WCTU veterans graduated into the woman's suffrage movement. Moving relentlessly from West to East, became the vote for women in state after state, and finally nationwide in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bordin, ''Woman and Temperance: The quest for power and liberty, 1873-1900'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth S. Clemens, "Organizational repertoires and institutional change: Women's groups and the transformation of US politics, 1890-1920." ''American journal of sociology'' (1993): 755-798. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781235 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

School reform was high on the agenda, since local machine politicians used the jobs in the contracts, promote the party interest, rather than the needs of the students. After examining late 19th century reform movements in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Chicago, historian [[David Tyack]] concludes that "what the structural reformers wanted to do, then, was to replace a rather mechanical form of public bureaucracy, which was permeated with 'illegitimate' lay influence, with a streamlined 'professional' bureaucracy in which lay control was carefully filtered through a corporate school board.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Tyack, ''The one best system: A history of American urban education'' (1974) p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanitation and public health ===
{{further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century. The worst conditions appeared in the largest cities, where the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, where sewage systems were inadequate, and the water supply was of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians took the lead in pointing out problems, and were of two minds on the causes. The older theory of contagion said that germs spread disease, but this theory was increasingly out of fashion by the 1840s or 1850s for two reasons. On the one hand it predicted too much-- microscopes demonstrated so many various microorganisms that there was no particular reason to associate any one of them with a specific disease. There was also a political dimension; a contagious theory of disease called for aggressive public health measures, which meant taxes and regulation the business community rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Neville Bonner, ''Medicine in Chicago: 1850-1950: A chapter in the social and scientific development of a city'' (1957) pp 24-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 1880s, most experts believed in the "[[Miasma theory]]" which attributed the spread of disease to "bad air" caused by the abundance of dirt and animal waste. It indicated the need for regular garbage pickup.  By the 1880s, however, European discovery of the germ theory of disease proved decisive for the medical community, although popular belief never shook the old "bad air" theory.  Medical attention shifted from curing the sick patient to stopping the spread of the disease in the first place.  It indicated a system of quarantines, hospitalization, clean water, and proper sewage disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Martin V. Melosi, ''The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr [[Charles V. Chapin]] (1856-1941), head of public health in Providence Rhode Island, was a tireless campaigner for the germ theory of disease, which he repeatedly validated with his laboratory studies.  Chapin  emphatically told popular audiences germs were the true culprit, not  filth; that diseases were not indiscriminately transmitted through the smelly air; and that disinfection was not a cure-all.  He paid little attention to environmental or chemical hazards in the air and water, or to tobacco smoking, since germs were not involved. They did not become a major concern of the public health movement until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, ''Charles V. Chapin and the Public Health Movement'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  The second stage of public health, building on the germ theory, brought in engineers to design elaborate water and sewer systems. Their expertise was welcomed, and many became city managers after that reform was introduced in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley K. Schultz, and Clay McShane. "To engineer the metropolis: sewers, sanitation, and city planning in late-nineteenth-century America." ''Journal of American History'' (1978): 389-411. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894086 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The Unheralded Triumph: City Government in America, 1870-1900'' (1984) pp 134-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century==
In the era 1890-1930, the larger cities were the focus of national attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs existed, but they Were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco dominated the West, Atlanta dominated the South, Boston dominated New England. Chicago, the nation's railroad hub, dominated the Midwest,  New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, as well as popular culture and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Goldfield and Blaine A. Brownell, ''Urban America: A History''(2nd ed. 1990), p 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive era: 1890s–1920s===
During the [[Progressive Era]] a coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts and reformers hostile to the political machines introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in Detroit Michigan, where Republican mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] first put together the reform coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments. Progressive mayors were important in many cities,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Finegold, "Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism," ''Urban Affairs Review'', (1995) 31#1 pp 20–42&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (especially Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson|Tom Johnson]]); [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. DeMatteo, "The Progressive As Elitist: 'Golden Rule' Jones And The Toledo Charter Reform Campaign of 1901," ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'', (1997) 69#1 pp 8–30&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey City, New Jersey;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Tobin, "The Progressive as Single Taxer: Mark Fagan and the Jersey City Experience, 1900–1917," ''American Journal of Economics &amp; Sociology'', (1974) 33#3  pp 287–298&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, "Progressive Reform in Los Angeles under Mayor Alexander, 1909–1913," ''California Historical Quarterly,'' (1975) 534#1, pp:37–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memphis, Tennessee]];&lt;ref&gt;G. Wayne Dowdy, "'A Business Government by a Business Man': E. H. Crump as a Progressive Mayor, 1910–1915," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly,'' (2001) 60#3 3, pp 162–175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisville, Kentucky]];&lt;ref&gt;William E. Ellis, "Robert Worth Bingham and Louisville Progressivism, 1905–1910," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'', (1980) 54#2 pp 169–195&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In [[History of Illinois|Illinois]], Governor [[Frank Lowden]] undertook a major reorganization of state government.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Hutchinson, ''Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden'' (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin was the stronghold of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], who led a wing of the Republican Party. His [[Wisconsin Idea]] used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressivism and the Wisconsin Idea|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-036/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most dramatic changes came in [[Galveston, Texas]] were a devastating hurricane and flood overwhelmed the resources of local government. Reformers abolished political parties in municipal elections, and set up a five-man commission of experts to rebuild the city. The Galveston idea was simple, efficient, and much less conducive to corruption. If lessened the Democratic influences of the average voter, but multiplied the influence of the reform minded middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, "The Galveston Plan of City Government by Commission: The Birth of a Progressive Idea." ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' (1975): 365–408.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Galveston plan was quickly copied by many other cities, especially in the West.  By 1914 over 400 cities had nonpartisan elected commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, ''Progressive Cities: The Commission Government Movement in America, 1901–1920'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dayton, Ohio]] Had its great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political [[city manager]], hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; mechanical engineers were especially preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus,  "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940." ''Management &amp; Organizational History'' (2014) 9#4 pp: 336–352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Stillman, ''The Rise of the City Manager: A Public Professional in Local Government'' (U of New Mexico Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban planning===
{{main|History of urban planning}}
The [[Garden city movement]] was brought over from England and evolved into the "Neighborhood Unit" form of development. In the early 1900s, as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time, residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic. The response, seen first in Radburn, New Jersey, was the Neighborhood Unit-style development, which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street. The neighborhood is distinctively organized around a school, with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Christensen, ''The American garden city and the new towns movement'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schaffer, ''Garden Cities for America: The Radburn Experience'' (Temple University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great Depression ===
{{main|Great Depression in the United States}}
Urban America had enjoyed strong growth and steady prosperity in the 1920s .  Large-scale immigration had ended in 1914, and never fully resumed, so that ethnic communities have become stabilized and Americanized. Upward mobility was the norm, in every sector of the population supported the rapidly growing high school system.  After the stock market crash of October 1929, the nation's optimism suddenly turned negative, with both business investments and private consumption overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that encouraged people to cut back and reduce their expectations. The economic damage to the cities was most serious in the collapse of 80 to 90 percent of the private sector construction industry.  Cities and states started expanding their own construction programs as early as 1930, and they became a central feature of the New Deal, but private construction did not fully recover until after 1945. Many landlords so their rental income drained away and many went bankrupt. After construction,  came the widespread downturn in heavy industry, especially manufacturing of durable goods such as automobiles, machinery, and refrigerators.  The impact of unemployment was higher in the manufacturing centers in the East and Midwest, and lower in the South and West, which had less manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;William H, Mullins, ''The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935.]]
One visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s, which were  ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee, who referred sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies he blamed for the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment reached 25 percent in the worst days of 1932-33, but it was unevenly distributed.  Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Jensen, "The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553-583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR] ; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  City governments in 1930-31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief.  They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.

The federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector.  FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.

The Democrats won easy landslides in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed.  The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholics, Jews, and blacks. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of beer, political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs.  The city machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilize their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief.  FDR won the vote of practically every group in 1936, including  taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However the Protestant middle class voters but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system.  However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm the out state vote.  The machines came through for him.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere.  Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898–1945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt’s efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and handed the expansion of New Deal ideas.  Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities.  In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored the GOP candidate Wendell Willkie 52%-48%.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940." ''Ethnicity. An Interdisciplinary Journal of the Study of Ethnic Relations'' (1981) 8#2: 189-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the summer of 1940, the economies of the cities rebounded.  Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation. It had the greatest impact on the cities of the West Coast, especially Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Lotchin, ''The Bad City in the Good War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929-1937.  They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

[[File:Cordeliere and Regent.jpg|thumb|A contemporary illustration of the Breton warship ''Cordelière'' and the English warship ''Regent'' ablaze at the [[Battle of St. Mathieu]] on August 10, 1512. Both are flying banderoles (the Breton [[Kroaz Du]] and the English [[flag of St. George]].)]]
A '''banderole''' ({{IPA-fr|bɑ̃dʁɔl|lang|Fr-banderole.ogg}}, "little banner") is a comparatively small but long [[flag]], historically used by knights and on ships, and as a heraldic device for representing [[bishop]]s.

'''Bannerol''', in its main uses is the same as banderole, and is the term especially applied to banners about a yard square carried at the funerals of great men and placed over the tomb.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}{{sfn|OED staff|2011}} Often it commemorated a particular exploit of the person bearing the [[coat of arms]]. 
 
==Knights, bishops and ships==
A banderole is a small flag or streamer carried on the lance of a [[knight]], or a long narrow flag, with cleft end flying from the mast-head of a ship in battle.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}{{sfn|OED staff|2011}}

[[File:Meuble Lion de gueule tenant une banderole.svg|thumb|Lion rampant holding a banderole]]

In [[heraldry]], a banderole is a streamer hanging from beneath the crook of a bishop's crosier and folding over the staff,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}{{sfn|OED staff|2011}} and for other small streamers or ribbons.{{sfn|Nelson|2010}}

==Art and architecture==
{{main|Banderole (speech scroll)}}
[[File:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|A 1506 painting by [[Bernhard Strigel]] with banderole.]]
The term is also used in [[art]] and [[architecture]] for a [[speech scroll]] or streamer, representing a roll of [[parchment]] carried by or surrounding a figure or object, for bearing an inscription, mainly during the medieval and Renaissance periods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  In particular banderoles were used as attributes for [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, as may be seen in the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]'' by [[Cimabue]], ([[Uffizi]], 1280–90), [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]]'' (1308–11), and other works.  The convention had a historical appropriateness, as the Old Testament was originally written on [[scroll]]s, whereas nearly all surviving New Testament manuscripts are [[codices]] (like modern books).  They may also be used for the words of angels, especially [[Gabriel]]'s greeting to Mary in [[Annunciation]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Ladis, Andrew &amp; Maginnis, Hayden B.

Starting in the British Army during the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763), and continuing in use in various armies throughout the later 18th, 19th, and early 20th Centuries, up to and including the Soviet Red Army in their "Great Patriotic War" (1941-1945), the term ''en banderole'' referred to soldiers wearing either their greatcoat (heavy overcoat) or blanket, rolled up along its longer edge, draped over one shoulder and across their back and breast, and fastened—sometimes with a small bespoke strap, other times with a short length of simple rope—near their waist.  The practice was begun by British light infantrymen fighting in North America during the [[Seven Years' War]], known there as the "French and Indian" war, to make carrying their equipment more convenient to fighting in the heavily-wooded terrain.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan.

While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla.

Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

===Thailand===

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the ancient Greek epic poet]]
'''Classics''' or '''classical studies''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]]. It encompasses the study of the [[Greco-Roman world]], particularly of its languages and literature (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin) but also of Greco-Roman philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the [[Western world|West]], the study of the [[Greek classics|Greek]] and [[Latin Classics|Roman classics]] was considered one of the cornerstones of the [[humanities]] and a fundamental element of a rounded education. The study of Classics has therefore traditionally been a cornerstone of a typical elite education.

Study encompasses specifically a time-period of history from the mid-2nd millennium BC to the 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[The British Library]] - [https://www.bl.uk/subjects/classics# Classics] Accessed December 13th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Classics'' is derived from the [[Latin]] [[adjective]] ''[[wikt:classicus|classicus]]'', meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens". The word was originally used to describe the members of the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Aulus Gellius]], in his ''Attic Nights'', contrasts "classicus" and "[[wikt:proletarius|proletarius]]" writers.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 19.8.15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt; Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Catullus, Itally.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bronze bust of a man. It rests on a stone plinth, on which the words "Gaius Valerius Catullus 87 AC–54 AC" are written.|The Roman poet Catullus was virtually unknown during the medieval period, in contrast to his modern popularity.]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models,&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"/&gt;

While Latin was hugely influential, however, Greek was barely studied, and Greek literature survived almost solely in Latin translation.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of even major Greek authors such as [[Hesiod]], whose names continued to be known by educated Europeans, were unavailable in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; In the thirteenth century, the English philosopher [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that "there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandys|1921|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the unavailability of Greek authors, there were other differences between the classical canon known today and the works valued in the Middle Ages. [[Catullus]], for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: [[Lucretius]], popular during the [[Carolingian renaissance|Carolingian]] period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for [[Quintilian]] the reverse is true.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt;

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance]] led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"/&gt; as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"/&gt; From the [[14th century]], first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, [[Renaissance Humanism]], an intellectual movement that "advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity",&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed. Humanism saw a reform in education in Europe, introducing a wider range of Latin authors as well as bringing back the study of Greek language and literature to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reintroduction was initiated by [[Petrarch]] (1304–1374) and [[Boccaccio]] (1313–1375) who commissioned a Calabrian scholar to translate the [[Homeric poems]].&lt;ref&gt;Pade, M. (2007). The Reception of Plutarch's Lives in Fifteenth-Century Italy. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum&lt;/ref&gt; This humanist educational reform spread from Italy, in Catholic countries as it was adopted by the Jesuits, and in countries that became Protestant such as England, Germany, and the Low Countries, in order to ensure that future clerics were able to study the New Testament in the original language.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
The late 17th and 18th centuries are the period in Western European literary history which is most associated with the classical tradition, as writers consciously adapted classical models.&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical models were so highly prized that the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were rewritten along neoclassical lines, and these "improved" versions were performed throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century, the study of Greek became increasingly important relative to that of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this period [[Johann Winckelmann]]'s claims for the superiority of the Greek visual arts influenced a shift in aesthetic judgements, while in the literary sphere, [[G.E. Lessing]] "returned Homer to the centre of artistic achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the study of Greek in schools began in the late 18th century. The poet [[Walter Savage Landor]] claimed to have been one of the first English schoolboys to write in Greek during his time at [[Rugby School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The 19th century saw the influence of the classical world, and the value of a classical education, decline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the US, where the subject was often criticised for its elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, little new literature was still being written in Latin – a practice which had continued as late as the 18th century – and a command of Latin declined in importance.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"/&gt; Correspondingly, classical education from the 19th century onwards began to increasingly de-emphasise the importance of the ability to write and speak Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"/&gt; In the United Kingdom this process took longer than elsewhere. Composition continued to be the dominant classical skill in England until the 1870s, when new areas within the discipline began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same decade came the first challenges to the requirement of Greek at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though it would not be finally abolished for another 50 years.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the influence of classics as the dominant mode of education in Europe and North America was in decline in the 19th century, the discipline was rapidly evolving in the same period.  Classical scholarship was becoming more systematic and scientific, especially with the "new philology" created at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Rommel|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope was also broadening: it was during the 19th century that ancient history and classical archaeology began to be seen as part of Classics, rather than separate disciplines.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"/&gt;

===20th century to present===
During the 20th century, the study of classics became less common. In England, for instance, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities stopped requiring students to have qualifications in Greek in 1920,&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt; and in Latin at the end of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] was introduced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 1988, it did not mention the classics.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"/&gt; By 2003, only about 10% of state schools in Britain offered any classical subjects to their students at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[AQA]], the largest exam board for [[A-Levels]] and [[GCSE]]'s in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, announced that it would be scrapping A-Level subjects in Classical Civilization, Archaeology, and Art History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/17/scrapping-archeology-classics-a-levels-barbaric-tony-robinson/| title=Scrapping of archaeology and classics A-levels criticized as 'barbaric act'| author=Sally Weale| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-17| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left just one out of five exam boards in England which still offered Classical Civilization as a subject. The decision was immediately denounced by archaeologists and historians, with Natalie Haynes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that the loss of the A-Level would deprive state school students, 93% of all students, the opportunity to study Classics, while making it once again the exclusive purview of wealthy private-school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/aqa-classics-classical-civilisation-a-level-exam-archaeology| title=Ditching classics at A-level is little short of a tragedy| author=Natalie Haynes| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-19| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study of classics has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of ''Meeting the Challenge'', a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balbo|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, but not as much as Latin.

==Sub-disciplines==
One of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of Classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world, thus expanding the studies to Northern [[Africa]] as well as parts of the [[Middle East]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

{{for|the journal|Classical Philology (journal)}}
[[File:Friedrich August Wolf - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white image of Friedrich August Wolf in profile|The eighteenth-century classicist [[Friedrich August Wolf]] was the author of ''Prolegomena to Homer'', one of the first great works of classical philology.]]
Philology is the study of language preserved in written sources; '''classical philology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is thus concerned with understanding any texts from the classical period written in the classical languages of Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roots of classical philology lie in [[the Renaissance]], as humanist intellectuals attempted to return to the Latin of the classical period, especially of [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shorey|1906|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as scholars attempted to produce more accurate editions of ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the principles of philology still used today developed during this period. For instance, the observation that if a manuscript could be shown to be a copy of an earlier extant manuscript, then it provides no further evidence of the original text, was made as early as 1489 by [[Angelo Poliziano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=173–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other philological tools took longer to be developed: the first statement, for instance, of the principle that a more difficult reading should be preferred over a simpler one, was in 1697 by [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern discipline of classical philology began in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"/&gt; It was during this period that scientific principles of philology began to be put together into a coherent whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide a set of rules by which scholars could determine which manuscripts were most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "new philology", as it was known, centred around the construction of a genealogy of manuscripts, with which a hypothetical common ancestor, closer to the original text than any existing manuscript, could be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Classical archaeology}}
[[File:Lion Gate Mykene with Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black and white photograph of the Lion Gate at Mycenae.|Schliemann and Dörpfeld's excavation at Mycenae was one of the earliest excavations in the field of classical archaeology.]]
Classical archaeology is the oldest branch of archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its roots going back to [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J.J. Winckelmann's]] work on [[Herculaneum]] in the 1760s.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the last decades of the 19th century, however, that classical archaeology became part of the tradition of Western classical scholarship.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"/&gt; It was included as part of Cambridge University's [[Classical Tripos]] for the first time after the reforms of the 1880s, though it did not become part of Oxford's [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] until much later.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt;

The second half of the 19th century saw [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann's]] excavations of [[Troy]] and [[Mycenae]]; the first excavations at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Delos]]; and [[Arthur Evans]]' work in Crete, particularly on [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the foundation of important archaeological associations (e.g. the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1879),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many foreign archaeological institutes in Athens and Rome (the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] in 1881, [[British School at Athens]] in 1886, [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1895, and [[British School at Rome]] in 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, classical archaeology has taken little part in the theoretical changes in the rest of the discipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely ignoring the popularity of "[[New Archaeology]]", which emphasised the development of general laws derived from studying material culture, in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Archaeology is still criticized by traditional minded scholars of classical archaeology despite a wide acceptance of its basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darvil|first1=Timothy|title=New Archaeology|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199534043.001.0001/acref-9780199534043-e-2752|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art history===
{{Main|Art history}}
Some art historians focus their study on the development of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. The [[Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.

Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].

===Ancient history===
With philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient philosophy}}
The English word "philosophy" comes from the Greek word φιλοσοφία, meaning "love of wisdom", probably coined by Pythagoras. Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West "philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches. For instance, Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' have been traditionally classified in the West as "ethics", but in the Arabic world were grouped with logic; in reality, they do not fit neatly into either category.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"/&gt;

From the last decade of the eighteenth century, scholars of ancient philosophy began to study the discipline historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, works on ancient philosophy had been unconcerned with chronological sequence and with reconstructing the reasoning of ancient thinkers; with what Wolfgang-Ranier Mann calls "New Philosophy", this changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception studies===
{{main|Classical reception studies}}
A relatively recent new discipline within the classics is "reception studies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulwer|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 1960s at the [[University of Konstanz]].&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"&gt;{{harvnb|Kallendorf|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reception studies is concerned with how students of classical texts have understood and interpreted them.&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"/&gt;
As such, reception studies is interested in a two-way interaction between reader and text,&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt; taking place within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the idea of an "aesthetics of reception" was first put forward by [[Hans Robert Jauss]] in 1967, the principles of reception theory go back much earlier than this.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1920, [[T.S. Eliot]] wrote that "the past [is] altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|1920|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Martindale describes this as a "cardinal principle" for many versions of modern reception theory.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt;

==Classical Greece==
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Outline of ancient Greece|Timeline of ancient Greece}}

Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], beginning in the eighth century BC, to the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC. The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], during the fifth and fourth centuries BC, has traditionally been considered the height of Greek civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical period of Greek history is generally considered to have begun with the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first]] and [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second Persian invasions of Greece]] at the start of the Greco-Persian wars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have ended with the death of [[Alexander the Great]].

Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe; thus Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.

===Language===
[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|right|thumb|alt=|Map showing the regional dialects of Greek during the Classical period]]
{{Main|Ancient Greek|Mycenaean Greek language|Koine Greek}}

Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 8th to 6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th to 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC to 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine ("common") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.

===Literature===
{{Main|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest surviving works of Greek literature are [[epic poetry]]. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are the earliest to survive to us today, probably composed in the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early epics were oral compositions, created without the use of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time that the Homeric epics were composed, the [[Greek alphabet]] was introduced; the earliest surviving inscriptions date from around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Need to put something about archaic poetry here...
Some of the earliest Greek poetry to be composed in written form was that of [[Archilochus]], around a century after the introduction of the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"/&gt; --&gt;
European [[drama]] was invented in ancient Greece. Traditionally this was attributed to [[Thespis]], around the middle of the sixth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest surviving work of Greek drama is [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', which dates to 472 BC.&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek tragedy was performed by a chorus and two actors, but by the end of Aeschylus' life, a third actor had been introduced, either by him or by [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"/&gt; The last surviving Greek tragedies are the ''[[Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]] and Sophocles' [[Oedipus at Colonus]], both from the end of the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|pp=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving Greek comedy begins later than tragedy; the earliest surviving work, [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Acharnians]]'', comes from 425 BC.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, comedy dates back as early as 486 BC, when the [[Dionysia]] added a competition for comedy to the much earlier competition for tragedy.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; The comedy of the fifth century is known as [[Old Comedy]], and it comes down to us solely in the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, along with a few fragments.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; Sixty years after the end of Aristophanes' career, the next author of comedies to have any substantial body of work survive is [[Menander]], whose style is known as [[New Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians.&lt;!-- Should talk about post-Thucydidean history: Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Arrian, Plutarch etc. --&gt; The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.&lt;!-- Socrates wrote nothing! What is he doing in this section?! --&gt;

===Mythology and religion===
{{Main|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}

Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.

Greek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A bust of Socrates|So influential was Socrates to classical philosophy that earlier philosophers are today known as [[pre-Socratics]].]]

The earliest surviving philosophy from ancient Greece dates back to the 6th century BC, when according to Aristotle [[Thales of Miletus]] was considered to have been the first Greek philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential pre-Socratic philosophers include [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]]. The most famous and significant figures in classical Athenian philosophy, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC, are [[Socrates]], his student [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], who studied at [[Plato's Academy]] before founding his own school, known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Later Greek schools of philosophy, including the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Stoics]], and [[Epicureans]], continued to be influential after the Roman annexation of Greece, and into the post-Classical world.

Greek philosophy dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[logic]], as well as disciplines which are not today thought of as part of philosophy, such as biology and rhetoric.

==Classical Rome==
{{Main|Ancient Rome|Culture of Ancient Rome}}

===Language===
{{main|Latin}}
[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a gold brooch|The [[Praeneste fibula]] is believed to bear the oldest known Latin inscription. The inscription means "Manius made me for Numerius".]]
The language of ancient Rome was Latin, a member of the [[Italic languages|Italic family of languages]]. The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a [[Praeneste fibula|brooch from Palestrina]]. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as [[Old Latin]]. Most surviving Latin literature is [[Classical Latin]], from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into [[Late Latin]], in use during the [[Late antiquity|late antique period]]. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as [[Vulgar Latin]], in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the [[Vindolanda tablets]].

===Literature===
{{main|Latin literature}}
The earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]; historians such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]; orators such as [[Cicero]]; and philosophers such as [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Lucretius]]. Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as [[Lactantius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Ambrose]]; non-Christian authors, such as the historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], are also preserved.

===History===
{{main|Timeline of ancient Rome}}
According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reality, there had been a settlement on the site since around 1000 BC, when the [[Palatine Hill]] was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was originally ruled by kings, first Roman, and then Etruscan – according to Roman tradition, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, ruled from 616 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 6th century BC, the city expanded its influence over the entirety of [[Latium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 6th century – traditionally in 510 BC – the kings of Rome were driven out, and the city became a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 387 BC, Rome was sacked by the Gauls following the [[Battle of the Allia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon recovered from this humiliating defeat, however, and in 381 the inhabitants of [[Tusculum]] in Latium were made Roman citizens. This was the first time Roman citizenship was extended in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome went on to expand its area of influence, until by 269 the entirety of the Italian peninsula was under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in 264, the [[First Punic War]] began; it lasted until 241.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Punic War]] began in 218, and by the end of that year, the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] had invaded Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war saw Rome's worst defeat to that point at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]; the largest army Rome had yet put into the field was wiped out, and one of the two consuls leading it was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome continued to fight, annexing much of Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually defeating Carthage, ending her position as a major power and securing Roman preeminence in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Three more paragraphs probably needed: one on the late Republic and civil war, one on the early empire, and one on the later empire to the fall of the Western empire --&gt;

==Legacy of the classical world==
The classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] is notable. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.

Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Romance languages]] – such as French, Spanish, and Italian – all derive from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages. The Roman empire was taken as a model by later European empires, such as the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical art has been taken as a model in later periods – medieval Romanesque architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Enlightenment-era neoclassical literature&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"/&gt; were both influenced by classical models, to take but two examples, while [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is one of the most influential works of twentieth century literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14462">{{about|the discipline concerned with the analysis and authentication of historical and other documents|the practice of conducting negotiations between groups or states|Diplomacy}}

'''Diplomatics''' (in American English, and in most anglophone countries), or '''diplomatic''' (in British English),&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|diplomatic, adj. and n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beal"/&gt; is a scholarly discipline centred on the critical analysis of [[document]]s: especially, [[historical document]]s. It focuses on the conventions, protocols and formulae that have been used by document creators, and uses these to increase understanding of the processes of document creation, of information transmission, and of the relationships between the facts which the documents purport to record and reality.

The discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official [[charter]]s and [[diploma]]s issued by royal and papal [[chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]]. It was subsequently appreciated that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and [[legal instrument]], to non-official documents such as private [[Letter (message)|letters]], and, most recently, to the [[metadata]] of electronic records.

Diplomatics is one of the [[auxiliary sciences of history]]. It should not be confused with its sister-discipline of [[palaeography]].&lt;ref name="Duranti12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duranti |first=Luciana |authorlink=Luciana Duranti |title=Diplomatics: New uses for an Old Science |journal=Archivaria |volume=28 |year=1989 |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/11567/12513 |pages=7–27 (12) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of [[textual criticism]] and [[historical criticism]].

==Etymology==
[[File:De re diplomatica 17765.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Jean Mabillon]]'s ''De re diplomatica'' (1681)]]

Despite the verbal similarity, the discipline has nothing to do with [[diplomacy]]. Both terms are derived, by separate linguistic development, from the word ''diploma'', which originally referred to a folded piece of writing material—and thus both to the materials which are the focus of study in diplomatics, and to accreditation papers carried by diplomats.

The word ''diplomatics'' was effectively coined by the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Jean Mabillon]], who in 1681 published his treatise, ''De re diplomatica'' ([[Latin]]: roughly, "The Study of Documents"). From there, the word entered the French language as ''diplomatique'', and then English as ''diplomatic'' or ''diplomatics''.

==Definitions==
''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' (1828) defines diplomatics as the "science of diplomas, or of ancient writings, literary and public documents, letters, decrees, charters, codicils, etc., which has for its object to decipher old writings, to ascertain their authenticity, their date, signatures, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'' (1828); quoted in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2d ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Cencetti (1908–1970) defined the discipline as "the study of the ''Wesen'' [being] and ''Werden'' [becoming] of documentation, the analysis of genesis, inner constitution and transmission of documents, and of their relationship with the facts represented in them and with their creators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Giorgio |last=Cencetti |chapter=La Preparazione dell'Archivista |title=Antologia di Scritti Archivistici |editor-first=Romualdo |editor-last=Giuffrida |place=Rome |publisher=Archivi di Stato |year=1985 |page=285}} Translation from Duranti 1989, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission International de Diplomatique]] has defined diplomatics as "the science which studies the tradition, the form and the issuing of written documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cei.lmu.de/VID/VID.php?1 |title=Vocabulaire Internationale de Diplomatique |editor-first=Maria Milagros |editor-last=Cárcel Ortí |edition=2nd |place=Valencia |year=1997 |publisher=Collecció Oberta |page=21 |quote=La Diplomatique est la science qui étudie la tradition, la forme et l'élaboration des actes écrits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Peter Beal defines diplomatics as "the science or study of documents and records, including their forms, language, script and meaning. It involves knowledge of such matters as the established wording and procedures of particular kinds of document, the deciphering of writing, and document analysis and authentication".&lt;ref name="beal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter|last=Beal |title=A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000 |year=2008 |place=Oxford| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo Kölzer defines diplomatics as "the teaching and the study of charters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kölzer |first=Theo |chapter=Diplomatics |title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – methods – trends |editor-first=Albrecht |editor-last=Classen |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |year=2010 |isbn=9783110184099 |volume=1 |pages=405–424 (405) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He treats the terms "charter", "diploma", and "document" as broadly synonymous, and refers to the German scholar [[Harry Bresslau]]'s definition of "documents" as "written declarations recorded in compliance with certain forms alternating according to the difference in person, place, time, and matter, which are meant to serve as a testimony of proceedings of a legal nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bresslau |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Bresslau |title=Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien |volume=1 |edition=4th |year=1969 |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly speaking, and as usually understood by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with the analysis and interpretation of the linguistic and textual elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including [[palaeography]], [[sigillography]], [[codicology]], and [[provenance]] studies, all of which are concerned with a document's physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon's original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of [[pragmatic literacy]] or [[symbolic communication]].

[[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], a distinguished teacher of diplomatics, referred to the discipline's reputation in 1970 as that of "a formidable and dismal science ... a kind of game played by a few scholars, most of them medievalists, harmless so long as it does not dominate or obscure historical enquiry; or, perhaps, most commonly of all, an aid to understanding of considerable use to scholars and research students if only they had time to spare from more serious pursuits".&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke |first=Christopher N. L. |authorlink=Christopher N. L. Brooke |title=The teaching of Diplomatic |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=4 |year=1970 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00379817009513930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:Traité de diplomatique tome 4 17008.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume 4 of [[René-Prosper Tassin|Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain|Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'' (1759)]]
In the [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] periods, the authenticity of a document was considered to derive from the document's place of preservation and storage, in, for example, temples, public offices, and archives. As a result, those with nefarious motives were able to give [[Forgery|forged documents]] a spurious authenticity by depositing them in places of authority. Diplomatics grew from a need to establish new standards of authenticity through the critical analysis of the textual and physical forms of documents.&lt;ref name="Duranti12"/&gt;

The first notable application of diplomatics was by [[Nicolas of Cusa]], in 1433, and [[Lorenzo Valla]], in 1440, who determined, independently, that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which had been used for centuries to legitimize papal temporal authority, was a forgery.  Diplomatics became important during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its emergence as a recognisably distinct sub-discipline, however, is generally dated to the publication of [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon's]] ''De re diplomatica'' in 1681. Mabillon had begun studying old documents with a view towards establishing their authenticity as a result of the doubts raised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Daniel van Papenbroek]] over supposed [[Merovingian]] documents from the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the production of spurious [[charter]]s and other documents had been common, either to provide written documentation of existing rights or to bolster the plausibility of claimed rights. Mabillon's work engendered a far livelier awareness of the potential presence of forged or spurious documents, in the fields of both [[history]] and [[law]].

Although Mabillon is still widely seen as the "father" of diplomatics, a more important milestone in the formation of the battery of practical techniques which make up the modern discipline was the publication of [[René-Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'', which appeared in six volumes in 1750–65.

The most significant work in English was [[Thomas Madox]]'s ''Formulare Anglicanum'', published in 1702. In general, however, the discipline was always studied more intensively by continental scholars than by those in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison |first=Charlotte |title=Thomas Madox and the Origins of English Diplomatic Scholarship |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=147–169 |doi=10.1080/00379810902916282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatics is often associated with the study of documents of the medieval period. However, scholars such as [[Luciana Duranti]] have argued that many of its theories and principles can be adapted and applied to contemporary [[archival science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams |first=Caroline |title=Diplomatic Attitudes: from Mabillon to Metadata |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=26 |year=2005 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1080/00039810500047417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The study of diplomatics is a valuable tool for [[historian]]s, enabling them to determine whether alleged [[historical document]]s and [[archive]]s are in fact genuine or [[forgery|forgeries]]. Its techniques may also be used to help date undated documents.

Diplomatics has many similar applications in the field of [[law]].

Some famous cases in which the principles of diplomatics have been employed have included:
* [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s proof of the forgery of the [[Donation of Constantine]]. Valla's work preceded Mabillon by roughly two centuries, and was the first application of the principles of modern, scientific diplomatics.
* The [[Hitler diaries]] [[hoax]] (1983).
* The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|National Archives forgeries]] (the Martin Allen forgeries, or [[Himmler]] forged documents) (2005).

==Diplomatic editions and transcription==
A '''diplomatic edition''' is an edition (in print or online) of an historic manuscript text that seeks to reproduce as accurately as possible in typography all significant features of the manuscript original, including spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, deletions, insertions, and other alterations. Similarly, '''diplomatic transcription''' attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs all features of a manuscript original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory A. |last=Pass |title=Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts |place=Chicago |publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries |year=2003 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''semi-diplomatic'' is used for an edition or transcription that seeks to reproduce only some of these features of the original. A diplomatic edition is thus distinguished from a ''normalized edition'', in which the editor, while not altering the original wording of the text, renders it using normal (modern) [[orthography]].

A diplomatic edition is also to be distinguished both from a ''[[facsimile]] edition'', which, in the modern era, normally employs photographic or digital images; and from a ''type facsimile'' (such as [[Abraham Farley]]'s [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley's edition (1773–1783)|edition of ''Domesday Book'']]), which seeks to reproduce the appearance of the original through the use of a [[Record type|special typeface]] or [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative|digital font]].

'''Emmanuel Bernard Le Roy Ladurie''' (born 19 July 1929) is a French historian whose work is mainly focused upon [[Languedoc]] in the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', particularly the history of the peasantry. One of the leading historians of France, Le Roy Ladurie has been called the "standard-bearer" of the third generation of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the "rock star of the medievalists", noted for his work in social history.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Le Roy Ladurie was born in [[Les Moutiers-en-Cinglais]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]].&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; His father was [[Jacques Le Roy Ladurie]], minister of Agriculture for Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] and subsequently a member of the [[French resistance]] after breaking with the Vichy regime. Le Roy Ladurie described his childhood in Normandy growing up on his family estate in the countryside as intensely Catholic and royalist in politics.&lt;ref name=Swain98&gt;{{cite web

The Le Roy Ladurie family were originally the aristocratic de Roy Laduries descending from a Catholic priest who fell in love with one of his parishioners, dropped out of the priesthood to marry her and was then ennobled by the Crown, but dropped the aristocratic ''de'' from their surname at the time of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie's grandfather was a French Army officer of Catholic royalist views who was dishonorably discharged from the Army in 1902 for refusing orders from the anti-clerical government to close Catholic schools.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; Afterwards, the former Captain Le Roy Ladurie returned to rural Normandy, being elected mayor of Villeray and was active in organising a union for rural workers.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; 

During his childhood, Le Roy Ladurie's hero was Marshal Pétain.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; Marshal Pétain's fall from grace from being the hero of Verdun and one of France's most loved men to the reviled collaborator and one of France's most hated men, sentenced to death for high treason for his collaboration with Germany had a major influence on Le Roy Ladurie's sense of history. Speaking of the rise and fall of Marshal Pétain from hero to traitor as an example of the vicissitudes of history, Le Roy Ladurie in a 1998 interview stated: "I have remained fascinated since then with what we call decline and fall. France is full of people who became very important, then became nothing. My fascination is probably due to the fact that my own family was once important and then became zero. There was a contrast between my own career and the feelings in my family."&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; Because his father had been a minister in the Vichy government, his son grew up in an atmosphere of family shame and disgrace.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; The historian was educated in [[Caen]] at the Collège Saint-Joseph, in [[Paris]] at the [[Lycée Henri-IV]] and in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] at the [[Lycée Lakanal]].&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; He was awarded an ''[[agrégation]]'' in history after studying at the École Normale Supérieure and a ''doctorat ès lettres'' from the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie has taught at the Lycée de Montpellier, the [[University of Montpellier]], the [[École Pratique des Haute Études]] in Paris, the University of Paris and at the [[Collège de France]], where he occupied from 1973 to 1999 the chair of History of Modern Civilization and became emeritus professor.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt;

Le Roy Ladurie was a member of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) between 1945 and 1956. His devoutly Catholic parents had expected him to become a Catholic priest and were scandalized that their son should become an ardent Communist and atheist.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; The Great Depression of the 1930s together with France's defeat in 1940 at the hands of Germany had caused many people in France to lose faith in both capitalism and liberal democracy. The leading role played by the French Communists in the Resistance during the German occupation and the willingness of many of the traditional French elites to support the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] together with the seemingly success achieved by the Soviet regime's planned economy and its "scientific socialism" led Le Roy Ladurie like many other people of his generation in France to embrace Communism as the best hope for humanity.&lt;ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30"&gt;Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The PCF proudly billed themselves as the "party of 75,000 shot"-a reference to the claim that the Germans had shot 75,000 French Communists between 1941-44 (the true figure was actually 10,000 French Communists executed by the Germans between 1941–44), but regardless the PCF had acquired tremendous prestige in 1940s France as a result of its role in the Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, David Scott &amp; Criddle, Byron ''The French Communist Party in the Fifth Republic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994  page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The German occupation had been a profoundly traumatic experience for the French, not the least because unlike World War I where the ''Union sacrée'' proclaimed by [[Raymond Poincaré]] in 1914 had united the left and the right together against the common German enemy, World War II had seen a civil war in France. The Resistance had fought not only the Germans, but also the policemen, gendarmes and the much feared ''[[Milice]]'' of the Vichy regime. The ''Milice'' were a collection of French fascists, gangsters and assorted adventurers used by the Vichy regime to hunt down and murder ''résistants'', who in their turn assassinated members of the ''Milice''. Given this background where many French young people had seen first-hand the pretty streets, avenues and squares of French cities, towns and villages sullied by acts of outrageous cruelty and violence, Le Roy Ladurie described his generation as a scarred one, saying: "It was dangerous for young people during the war. If we are subjected to violence, we will in turn be violent towards others. It is like someone who is sodomised and then sodomises others."&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie explained becoming a Communist as a reaction to his war-time youth.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt;

When the Hungarian writer [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1940 novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' was translated into French in 1949, Le Roy Ladurie at the time saw it as confirming the greatness of Stalinism instead of being the condemnation that Koestler had intended.&lt;ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30"/&gt; Koestler's novel concerned a prominent Soviet Communist and Old Bolshevik named Rubashov who was arrested and charged with crimes against the Soviet Union that he did not commit, but which he willingly confessed to in a show trial after hearing an appeal to Party discipline. The character of Rubashov is generally believed to be modeled by Koestler after [[Nikolai Bukharin]], a prominent Old Bolshevik and the leader of the "rightist" (i.e. moderate) faction in the Communist Party who was shot in 1938 after a show trial in Moscow which Bukharin confessed to a fantastic array of bizarre and improbable charges such as being an agent of foreign powers, sabotage, "wrecking", and working with [[Leon Trotsky]] from his exile in Mexico City and the "White Guard" leaders in Paris to overthrow Stalin. Bukharin's real crime had been to oppose Stalin in the post-Lenin succession struggle in the 1920s and for advocating continuing the New Economic Policy-which allocated control of the "commanding heights" of the Soviet economy to the state while allowing free enterprise in the rest of the economy-as a viable model for the future. It was not until 1928 when Stalin brought in the First Five Year Plan that full socialism arrived in the Soviet Union, a policy choice that Bukharin had opposed. The image of the Bukharin-like character Rubashov confessing to crimes that he did not commit in order to uphold the greatness of Communism in ''Darkness At Noon'' caused was sensational at the time, but the truth was rather more brutal and sordid in that Bukharin had been psychologically "broken" after months of torture by the NKVD, and had been reduced to such a state that he was willing to "confess" to anything. Le Roy Ladurie wrote in a 1949 essay about ''Darkness At Noon'' that: "Rubashov was right to sacrifice his life and especially his revolutionary honor so that the best of all possible regimes could be established one day".&lt;ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30"/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie was to subsequently to admit that he rather misunderstood the message of ''Darkness At Noon''. At the height of the Cold War in the early 1950s, Le Roy Ladurie described the atmosphere inside the Party as "''une intensité liturgique''".&lt;ref name="Hazareesingh, Sudhir page 139"&gt;Hazareesingh, Sudhir ''Intellectuals and the French Communist Party: Disillusion and Decline'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991 page 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Le Roy Ladurie married Madeleine Pupponi by whom he had one son and one daughter.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712&gt;Carroll, Stuart "Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel" pages 711-712 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 1, edited by Kelly Boyd, London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999 page 712.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy Laduire left the PCF after doubts caused by the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] became too much for him. Le Roy Ladurie was later to write that the sight of Soviet tanks crushing the ordinary people of Hungary in 1956 who were merely demanding basic human rights led to reject his optimism of the late 1940s that the Soviet Union represented the best hope of humanity and instead led him to the conclusion that communism was an inhumane, totalitarian ideology that oppressed people in the Soviet Union, Hungary and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hazareesingh, Sudhir page 139"/&gt; In November 1956, Le Roy Ladurie resigned from the Communist Party in protest against the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolt.&lt;ref name="Hazareesingh, Sudhir page 139"/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie's break with the PCF did not mean a break with the left and leaving the PCF, he joined the Socialist Party, running as a Socialist candidate in Montpellier in 1957, winning 2.5% of the vote.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt; In 1963, a disillusioned Le Roy Ladurie left the Socialists.&lt;ref name=Swain98/&gt;

Le Roy Ladurie has often written for ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]],'' and ''[[Le Monde]]''  newspapers, and appeared on French [[television]]. In France, historians have far more social prestige than they do in the English-speaking world, and to be a successful historian in France is become something of a celebrity.

==''Les paysans de Languedoc''==
Le Roy Ladurie first attracted attention with his doctoral thesis, ''Les paysans de Languedoc'', which was published as a book in 1966 and translated into English as ''The Peasants of Languedoc'' in 1974.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study of the peasantry of Languedoc over several centuries, Le Roy Ladurie employed a huge range of quantitative information such as tithe records, wage books, tax receipts, rent receipts and profit records, together with the use of the theories of such thinkers as [[Ernest Labrousse]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[François Simiand]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Max Weber]], to contend that the history of Languedoc was "''l'histoire immobile''."&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; He argued that the history of Langudedoc was marked by waves of growth and decline that in essence changed very little over the passage of time.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie acknowledged his debt to Braudel that had argued that it was climate and geography that shaped the course of history, but felt that Braudel had gone too far in using geography and climate as causal agents in history.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; Instead, Le Roy Ladurie felt that culture and economics were just as important as causal agents as the nature of the land and the weather over it.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; Influenced by the work of his mentor [[Fernand Braudel]], Le Roy Ladurie set out to write a ''histoire totale'' (total history) of Languedoc from the 15th to the 18th centuries that would embrace political, cultural, economic, social history and environmental history all integrated into one.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712/&gt;

Le Roy Ladurie proposed that the determining feature of life in Languedoc was the culture of the people who lived there. In his book, Le Roy Ladurie maintained that the reason why the people of Languedoc could not break the cycles of advance and decline was not so much technological factors, but was due to culture that prevented the people from developing more progressive technology and farming practices.&lt;ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/&gt; In ''Les paysans de Languedoc'', Le Roy Ladurie broke the prevailing Marxist view that dominated French historiography at the time that the history of early modern France from the 15th century to the 18th century was the ever-accelerating accumulation of property and wealthy by capitalists.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Instead, Le Roy Ladurie contended that in Languedoc there were cycles of economic advance and decline from the 15th to the 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; According to Le Roy Ladurie, there were several cycles, namely: 
*"the low water mark" in the 15th century when French society was still recovering from the massive death toll caused by the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century which had wiped out most of the population of France.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; As a consequence, there was social pressure on the survivors to have as many children as possible to repopulate France.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; With a growing population in the late 14th and 15th centuries, forests were cut down to make room for farms while poorer land that had been neglected was reclaimed to provide land for the growing number of Languedoc peasants.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Furthermore, the growing population of Languedoc meant that property was constantly being subdivided while wages declined.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; 
*The first phrase in turn led to the second phrase, the "advance" of growing prosperity that lasted until 1530.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; After 1530, Le Roy Ladurie maintained that the "stubborn inelasticity" of farming practices in Languedoc combined with a growing population led to a period of economic decline that lasted for the rest of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Peasants planted more grain, but owing to combination of cultural conservatism, a shortage of capital and a refusal to innovate, could not increase the productivity of the land to match the increasing population.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; The growing numbers of mouths to feed together with the "stubborn inelasticity" of Languedoc farming methods led a period of social misery with more and more struggling to survive on less and less.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Many peasants moved to other provinces in a search of a better life while those that remained in Languedoc tended to get married at a later age in order to limit family size.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; In the 16th century, ordinary people in Languedoc  were all too aware that they were living in very tough times, but Le Roy Ladurie wrote that they were "preoccupied to the point of self-immolation" with religious issues.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; The Reformation had badly divided ordinary people, and during the [[French Wars of Religion]], Protestants and Catholics fought one another over social domination of Languedoc society.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Between 1562-1598, a series of civil wars took place in France between Catholics and Huguenots to determine whatever France would be a Catholic or Calvinist nation, and as such Frenchmen went about killing each other with much passion and fury; both sides were convinced that their faith was the one true faith and literally France's salvation was in the balance. The Reformed Church had made great gains in the south of France, and as such Languedoc like many provinces in the south was the scene of especially vicious fighting during the Wars of Religion. Le Roy Ladurie argued that it was the devastating effect of the civil wars in France that gave birth to both anti-tax revolts as the peasants objected to the increased taxes that the series of civil wars entitled and a widespread belief in witchcraft, which held out the promise of a more just society.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie wrote that witchcraft represented the lingering survival of the beliefs of the ancient pagan religion before Languedoc had been converted to Christianity. The ancient Celts had thrown valuable objects into the water to appease the powerful water spirits that were believed to live in the waters while later on the Romans had imported the belief in [[Dryad]]s (woodland nymphs) and [[Naiad]]s (water nymphs).&lt;ref name=Ladurie64-14&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie « Naïades et dryades: Mythe de paysan français au 16ème siècle », in études françaises du 16ème siècles, numéro 9, automne 1964 pg 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite becoming nominally Christian, people in Languedoc for centuries afterwards continued to throw valuable objects into the water to please the spirits that were believed to reside in the waters.&lt;ref name=Ladurie64-14/&gt; Peasant folklore had it that certain favored young women could be invited to join the sisterhood of the Naiads and that if they accepted the invitation by diving nude into the magical waters, they would be transformed into a sensuous Naiad who would be forever young.&lt;ref name=Ladurie64-14/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie suggested that these folktales about young women turning into Dryads or Naiads reflected both female fantasies of escape from the patriarchal society of 16th century Languedoc and a way of the peasants of explaining away young women who had run away.&lt;ref name=Ladurie64-14/&gt;  Given the prevalence of such beliefs, many peasants took it for granted that certain women were witches who had magical powers and could talk to the spirts of the forest and the waters.  During the period of the Wars of Religion, that for many ordinary people repulsed in equal measure both by the brutal fanaticism of the Catholics and the Huguenots turned to these women who claimed to have magical powers, both as a rejection of the bloody mayhem caused by the Wars of Religion and of the existing social order which Christianity, whenever it be Protestantism or Catholicism upheld. Le Roy Ladurie wrote that the appeal of witchcraft with its glorification of sensuous pleasures of the human body held out the promise of a "social inversion", which it failed to deliver upon.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; In studying cultural and religious history of Languedoc, Le Roy Ladurie was very different from many other ''Annales'' historians who usually ignored these aspects of history.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie wrote that by the end of the 16th century, the "Malthusian curse" had befallen Languedoc as the heavy population growth was not matched by increased productivity of the land to provide enough food for the all the extra mouths to feed.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; 
*Starting in 1600, a third phrase that Le Roy Ladurie called "maturity" set in.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; In the 17th century, the population finally grew level with the productivity of the land in Languedoc.&lt;ref name=HW2000-195/&gt; Contrary to Marxist historians, Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was little accumulation of wealth as continuing agrarian conservatism and the drastic increase in what Le Roy Ladurie called "parasitic phenomena" both retarded efforts to build up capital.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The "parasitic phenomena" were the increasing taxes levied by the French Crown combined with increased tithes demanded by the Catholic Church and increased rents by landlords while at the same time many Languedoc peasants went deeply into debt in an effort to pay all of these taxes, tithes and rents.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; The adverse climate of the 17th century as the [[Little Ice Age]] was at its height together with the fact that France was constantly at war in the 17th century further contributed to the increasing misery of the peasantry of Languedoc.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712/&gt; 
*In the second half of the 17th century was Le Roy Ladurie called the fourth phrase of "the long period of recession".&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; As the peasants struggled to pay their loans, taxes, tithes and rents, the economy of Languedoc went into a period of steep decline.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; This period of rising unemployment and poverty together with poor hygiene, unsanitary living conditions, emigration to other provinces of France, late marriages and a rise in birth control as many men started to use primitive condoms all led to a dramatic decline in the population of Languedoc.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; During this period, many of the more wealthier families were able to embark upon land consolidation as there were able to buy the land of less successful families on the cheap.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt;

At the beginning of the 18th century, Languedoc society was not much different from where it had been two centuries earlier in Le Roy Ladurie's opinion, thus making this entire period one of "''l'historie immobile''".&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie saw this as the result of the inability of the farmers of Languedoc to increase the productivity of the land, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some have spoken of a ''natural'' ceiling on productive resources. But 'nature' in this case is actually culture; it is the customs, the way of life, the mentality of the people; it is a whole formed by technical knowledge and a system of valus, by the means employed and the ends pursued".&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; As such, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the unwillingness of the peasants of Languedoc to engage in technologically innovative farming techniques to increase the productivity of the land as was happening during the same period in England was the result of the "lack of the conscience, the culture, the morals, the politics, the education, the reformist spirit, and the unfettered longing for success" that characterized the entire culture of Languedoc during these centuries.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; However, Le Roy Ladurie pointed out that he had traced was not a cycle in the proper sense as Languedoc did not return in the 18th century back to where it had been in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; Even through this was overall a period of economic stagnation, Le Roy Ladurie noted that were "islands" of growth and change in Languedoc.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; Some of the more enterprising farmers started to grow silk and vines, with the latter laying the foundations of the Languedoc wine industry.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; Other farmers switched over to cloth manufacture.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; In conclusion, Le Roy Ladurie argued that these economic changes together with the beginning of elementary schools where the sons of farmers acquired some literary, the decline of religious fanaticism and a "a general improvement in behavior" all come together to bring about the "economic takeoff" of the 18th century, where the cycles of decline and advance were finally broken.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt;

In Le Roy Ladurie's view, there were "structures" comprising long-term and slowly changing material and mental patterns which underlined the more dramatic and, in his opinion, less important "''conjoncture''" of trends and events, upon which traditionally historians have focused.&lt;ref&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy Ladurie wrote that he was studying in ''Les paysans de Languedoc'' that was the relationship between the ''vie culturelle'' that was the "superstructure" of beliefs, politics and thought as it was changed slowly by the ''vie matérielle'' of the environment and geography that was the "base" that the superstructure rested on.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712/&gt; Like Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie believes that it is the history of the "structures" that really mattered, but unlike Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie has expressed an interest in biography and the ''histoire événementielle'' (history of events), which Braudel dismissed as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt; However, Le Roy Ladurie stated that while studying ''histoire événementielle'' is interesting, it is the "structures" of French society that explain the course of French history.&lt;ref name=HW2000-196/&gt;

==Montaillou==
{{main article|Montaillou (book)}}
Le Roy Ladurie's best-known work is ''[[Montaillou (book)|Montaillou, village occitan de 1294 à 1324]]'' (1975), a study of the village of [[Montaillou]] in the region of [[Languedoc]] in the south of France during the age of the [[Cathar]] heresy.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 197.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Montaillou'' was a bestseller in both France and after its translation into English in the United States and Great Britain, and remains Le Roy Ladurie's most popular book by far.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"/&gt; As a result of the book, the previously little-known village of Montaillou become a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"/&gt;

In ''Montaillou'', Le Roy Ladurie used the records of the [[Inquisition]] of [[Jacques Fournier]], [[Bishop of Pamiers]], to develop a multi-layered study of life in a small French village over the course of several years.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"/&gt;  Le Roy Ladurie used the records of interrogations conducted by Fournier to offer a picture of both the material and mental worlds of the inhabitants of Montaillou.  ''Montaillou'' was much praised by reviewers in both France and the English-speaking world for its vivid, atmospheric recreation of the everyday life of the people of Montaillou in the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have noted that for Le Roy Ladurie, the village priest Father [[Pierre Clergue]], an ardent womanizer whose vow of celibacy meant nothing and who apparently slept with most of the women of Montaillou seemed to be something of hero for the historian. Clergue's affair with the local aristocrat and noted beauty, the Countess [[Béatrice de Planisoles]] formed one of the central stories that Le Roy Ladurie related in ''Montaillou'' with much sympathy for the doomed couple.

Critics of Le Roy Ladurie have argued that the Holy Inquisition was an instrument of judicial repression for whom torture or the threat of torture were routine methods.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian historian [[Norman Cantor]] argued that none of the people questioned by Fournier had appeared willingly before the Holy Inquisition, and that therefore the [[Fournier Register]] which Le Roy Ladurie had used as his main source for ''Montaillou'' is not reliable.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; Other critics have noted that the people questioned by Fournier spoke in Occitan, had their remarks written down in Latin and that Le Roy Ladurie had translated the text into French and have wondered if something has been lost in the translation.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt;

==Resisting the "totalitarian temptation"==
In France, the ''intelligentsia'' has more prestige than does the ''intelligentsia'' in the English-speaking world and as such, intellectuals are expected to take stands on the major issues of the day. In January 1978, Le Roy Ladurie was a founding member of the ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' (Committee of Intellectuals for a Europe of liberties), an anti-communist group of liberal French intellectuals opposed to the powerful influence of the French Communist Party on French intellectual life and the alliance of the Socialists and the Communists which they saw as a threat to French democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 pages 268 &amp; 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' was not a conservative group, and instead was opposed to Communism from a liberal vantage-point, declaring itself opposed to both "the unarticulated cry and pure revolt on one hand and absolute knowledge and totalizing ideology on the other", damning the "fatal socialist-statist equation" as offering the end of the Republic and everything it stood for.&lt;ref&gt;Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 page 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In its founding manifesto, the ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' declared its intention "to defend the synonymy of these three words: Europe, culture, freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Scouras, Danielle The Cultural Politics of Tel Quel: Literature and the Left in the Wake of Engagement University Park: Penn State Press, 2010 page 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, the committee did not limit its remit to France or even Western Europe, instead proclaiming its intention to defend liberty in all of Europe, Western and Eastern. He analysed his political engagement and [[Communism]] in ''Ouverture, société, pouvoir: de l’Édit de Nantes à la chute du communisme'' (2004) and ''Les grands procès politiques, ou la pédagogie infernale'' (2002).

==''Carnaval de Romans''==
Another work was ''Le Carnaval de Romans: de la chandeleur au mercredi des cendres'' (translated into English as ''Carnival in Romans'') which dealt with the 1580 massacre of about twenty artisans at the annual [[carnival]] in the town of [[Romans-sur-Isère]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Le Roy Ladurie used the only two surviving eyewitness accounts of the massacre (one of which was hostile towards to the victims of the massacre by Guérin, the other sympathetic yet often inaccurate by Piémond), together with such information as plague lists and tax lists, to treat the massacre as a microcosm of the political, social and religious conflicts of rural society in the latter half of the 16th century in France.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"/&gt;  This book provides an example of a [[Microhistory|micro-historical approach]] to the social structure of the town of Romans and tax rebellions in early modern France.

==Social history==
Other more recent treatments of [[social history]] by Le Roy Ladurie have included ''La sorcière de Jasmin'' (translated into English as ''Jasmin's Witch'') and ''Le siècle des Platter, 1499-1628'' (translated into English as ''The Beggar and the Professor: A Sixteenth Century Family Drama''). In ''Jasmin's Witch'', Le Roy Ladurie following the lead of [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who argued that the idea of witchcraft as held by peasants was very different from the idea of witchcraft held by judges and churchmen.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; To understand the "total social fact of witchcraft," Le Roy Ladurie used the 1842 poem ''Françouneto'' written by Jacques Boè and based on a traditional French peasant folk tale.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie contended that the poem contains many authentic traces of popular beliefs about witchcraft in rural France during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; Le Roy Ladurie argued that the "crime" of the "witch" Françouneto was the violation of the unwritten social code of "limited wealth," namely that she increased her own wealth at the expense of others.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; In ''The Beggar and the Professor'', Le Roy Ladurie used the letters and memoirs of the Platter family to examine the social values of the 16th century, especially in regards to religion, medicine, crime, learning, and taxes.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/&gt; Another work of social history by Le Roy Ladurie was his 1982 book ''Love, Death, and Money in the Pay d'Oc, The French Peasantry: 1450-1660'', which as it title indicates examined the views held by French peasants about love, death and money.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"&gt;Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
Though best known for his work in "[[microhistory]]", Le Roy Ladurie has also examined the [[political history]] of France between 1460 and 1774 in a two-volume history. The first volume was ''L'Etat royal: de Louis XI à Henri IV, 1460-1610'' (translated into English as'' The French Royal State: 1460-1610'').&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; In this book, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the major concerns of the French Crown were the economy, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and aristocratic politics, and that the main reasons for the growth of the French state was the need to raise revenue to pay for military expansion into [[Italy]], [[Provence]] and [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and its rivalry with [[Spain]] over mastery of western Europe.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt;

In the second volume, ''Ancien Régime: de Louis XIII à Louis XV, 1610-1774'' (translated into English as ''The Ancien Régime''), Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was a close connection between the domestic and foreign policies of the French Crown.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; In particular, Le Roy Ladurie argued that periods of [[authoritarianism]] in domestic policy coincided with periods of [[aggression]] in foreign policy, and that periods of liberalism in domestic policy coincided with periods of a pacific foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; In order to pay for war, the French state had to increase taxation to raise the necessary funds. In ''Ancien Régime'' France, society was divided into three legal categories; the First Estate (the Catholic Church), the Second Estate (the nobility) and the Third Estate (the commoners). The first two estates, which comprised the more wealthier elements of French society were exempt from taxation and to make up the shortfall in revenue, the Third Estate was taxed more heavily than what had been the case if the tax burden in French society was spread with greater equality. Le Roy Ladurie argued that because war was so expensive, the French state always had to drastically increase taxation in times of conflict. And that because of the highly unequal nature of the French tax system, the increased taxes had to be accompanied with increased repression to crush the social resistance generated by the higher taxes. The three men who dominated French politics in the 17th century, namely the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]], [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] were all obsessed with winning  ''la gloire'' (the glory) of making France into the world's greatest power, which meant that the 17th century was a period of constant warfare where France was almost always at war with some other power to win ''la gloire''. As a result, anti-tax revolts frequently broke out all over France in the 17th century as the Third Estate attempted to reject the oppressively heavy taxation needed to pay for the wars intended to win ''la gloire''. All of the anti-tax revolts were crushed with ferocious brutality by the Crown to send the message that it was folly on the part of ordinary people to challenge the might of the French state. Despite certain lapses in the 1750s, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the reign of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] was characterized by liberalism at home and peace abroad while the rule of [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]] and King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was marked by aggression and authoritarianism.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; At the end of his two-volume history, Le Roy Ladurie stated that the growth of popularity of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, [[anti-clericalism]], and [[liberalism]] had by 1774 already placed France on the road to the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; The American historian Stuart Carroll commented that in these books of the 1990s, Le Roy Ladurie was according the decisions individuals and ''histoire événementielle'' a level of importance in influencing history that he had rejected in his 1973 book ''Le Territoire de l'historien'' where he had claimed the quantitative methodology and the study of long-term structural changes had replaced ''histoire événementielle'' and biographies as the main focus of the work of a historian.&lt;ref name=Carroll99-712/&gt;

==Historiography==
Ladurie's mentor was [[Fernand Braudel]], a prominent member of the [[Annales School]] and one of the most prolific contemporary historians.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Ladurie founded the movement of the "Nouvelle histoire" (New History). Le Roy Ladurie is a leading champion of "[[microhistory]]," in which a historian uses the study of an event, locality, family or life to reveal the "structures" which underlie life in the particular period under study. Some, like [[Niall Ferguson]], have questioned the value of "microhistory," arguing that it is wrong to assume that the study of one village or one incident in one town or one family reveals wider patterns of life in France, let alone the rest of Europe. Another line of criticism has centered around Le Roy Ladurie's use of the term "structures." His critics contend that he has never clearly defined the term, nor explained why "structures" change over time, or even whether the "structures" Le Roy Ladurie purports to find exist.

Le Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (''Histoire de France des régions'', 2004) and on [[anthropometric history]] as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history. Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/&gt; The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern [[environmental historian]]s because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.

'''François-Xavier Garneau''' (June 15, 1809 – February 2 or February 3, 1866)&lt;ref&gt;Savard, Pierre and Paul Wyczienski. "[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4446 Garneau, François-Xavier]", in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'', University of Toronto and Université Laval, 2000, retrieved December 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was a nineteenth-century [[French Canadian]] notary, poet, civil servant and liberal who wrote a three-volume history of the French Canadian nation entitled ''Histoire du Canada'' between 1845 and 1848.

==Biography==
Garneau was born in [[Quebec City]], educated at Quebec seminary, studied law, and was admitted as a notary in 1830. Subsequently, he became clerk of the legislative assembly, member of the council of public instruction, and city clerk of Quebec, which office he held from 1845 until his death on February 2 or February 3, 1866. Garneau was an honorary member of literary and historical societies in the United States and Canada, and for several years president of the Institut Canadien of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Garneau, François Xavier|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Histoire du Canada''==
Garneau argued that conquest was a tragedy, the consequence of which was a perpetual struggle against the forces of [[English Canada]] for the French Canadian nation; this struggle would continue into the future as long as French Canadians were under the oppressive reign of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. The book was originally written as a response to the [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Durham]] [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|report]], which claimed that French Canadian culture was stagnant and that it would be best served through Anglophone assimilation.  It was first translated in 1866 and by then "the accepted national history" of French Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=J.

'''Gerald Steinacher''' (born 2 September 1970) is an Associate Professor of History and Hymen Rosenberg Professor of Judaic Studies at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. He was a [[Joseph A. Schumpeter]] Research Fellow at Harvard University during 2010-2011 and in 2009 a Visiting Scholar at the Center for European Studies at [[Harvard University]]. He lectured at the Universities of [[Innsbruck]] (Austria), [[Luzern]] (Switzerland) and [[Munich]] (Germany). In 2006 he was a Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies Fellow at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, DC]].

Steinacher’s research focuses on 20th Century Central European History with emphasis on Italian Fascism, National Socialism, Holocaust and intelligence studies. He has published two books, edited nine volumes, and wrote a large number of book chapters and journal articles on these topics. His post-doctoral research (Habilitation) examined the postwar fate of Nazis and Holocaust perpetrators and the institutions facilitating their escape from Europe. The result of this research came out as a book entitled ''Nazis on the Run: How Hitler's Henchmen Fled Justice''. This academic book was published in several languages with the English edition put out by Oxford University Press in 2011. The book was recently awarded the 2011 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category.

The '''International Council on Archives''' ('''ICA'''; French: ''Conseil international des archives'') is an [[international non-governmental organization]] which exists to promote international cooperation for [[archive]]s and [[archivist]]s. It was set up in 1948, with [[Charles Samaran]], the then director of the [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales de France]], as chairman, and membership is open to national and international organisations, professional groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ica.org/en/timeline-international-council-archives|title=A timeline of the International Council on Archives {{!}} International Council on Archives|website=www.ica.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it grouped together about 1400 institutional members in 199 countries and territories. Its mission is to promote the conservation, development and use of the world's archives.

ICA has close partnership links with [[UNESCO]], and is part of the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] (ICBS), which works to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by wars and natural disasters, and which is based in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancbs.org/cms/en/contact Blue Shield International Contact Page]. Retrieved 24 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
ICA's mission statement reads: "The International Council on Archives (ICA) is dedicated to the effective management of records and the preservation, care and use of the world's archival heritage through its representation of records and archive professionals across the globe. Archives are an incredible resource. They are the documentary by-product of human activity and as such are an irreplaceable witness to past events, underpinning democracy, the identity of individuals and communities, and human rights. But they are also fragile and vulnerable. The ICA strives to protect and ensure access to archives through advocacy, setting standards, professional development, and enabling dialogue between archivists, policy makers, creators and users of archives. The ICA is a neutral, non-governmental organisation, funded by its membership, which operates through the activities of that diverse membership. For over sixty years ICA has united archival institutions and practitioners across the globe to advocate for good archival management and the physical protection of recorded heritage, to produce reputable standards and best practices, and to encourage dialogue, exchange, and transmission of this knowledge and expertise across national borders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.org/102/about-ica/an-introduction-to-our-organization.html ICA website: An Introduction to our Organization] Retrieved 24 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The ICA is organized in thirteen regional branches with varying levels of activity, including the Caribbean branch (CARBICA), the Eastern and Southern Africa branch (ESARBICA), the South and West Asian branch (SWARBICA), the European branch (EURBICA) and the Pacific Region branch (PARBICA).&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.parbica.org PARBICA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The North American branch (NAANICA) operates "virtually" and by contributions to meetings of the [[Society of American Archivists]] and the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]]. ICA has twelve professional sections, which provide much of the organization's archival content and activity, including the Section for Archival Education (SAE), the Section for Architectural Records (SAR), the Section for Business Archives (SBA), the Section for Archives of Literature and Art (SLA), the Section for Local, Municipal and Territorial Archives (SLMT), the Section on Sports Archives (SPO), the Section for Archives of Parliaments and Political Parties (SPP) and the Section for University and Research Institutions (SUV).

It is based in the [[Le Marais|Marais]] quarter of the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], [[rue des Francs-Bourgeois]], in the premises of the [[Archives nationales (France)|French national archives]].

Member groups include the [[Arxivers sense Fronteres]], among others.

==Activities==
ICA publishes a review ''[[Comma (journal)|Comma]]'', which appears once or twice a year and includes material in United Nations languages as well as German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.org/1649/about-comma-editorial-board/about-comma-editorial-board.html ICA website: COMMA Editorial Board]. Retrieved 24 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Every fourth year, ICA hosts its major International Congress. In recent years, these have been held in [[Vienna]] (2004), [[Kuala Lumpur]] (2008), [[Brisbane]] (2012)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ica2012.ica.org/index.html Website of the ICA International Congress, Brisbane, 2012] Retrieved 15 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Seoul]] (2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica2016.com/eng/index.do Website of the ICA International Congress, Seoul, 2016] Retrieved 15 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The next ICA Congress will be held in [[Abu Dhabi]] in 2020. Until 2011, ICA also hosted the annual meetings of CITRA, the International Conference of the Round Table on Archives, which brought together heads of national archival institutions, presidents of national professional associations and the ICA sections, branches and committees. The last three CITRA meetings were held in [[Malta]] (2009); [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] (2010) and [[Toledo, Spain]] (2011). After the CITRA in Toledo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.citratoledo2011.mcu.es Website of the Toledo CITRA meeting 2011] Retrieved 15 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ICA replaced CITRA meetings with an annual conference. The first three annual conferences were in European venues: [[Brussels]] (2013), [[Girona]] (2014) and [[Reykjavik]] (2015). The venues for future annual conferences will be [[Mexico City]] in 2017, [[Yaoundé]] in 2018, [[Edinburgh]] in 2019, before the four-yearly Congress in [[Abu Dhabi]] in 2020.

===ISAD(G)===
{{See also|ISAD(G)}}
In 1993, the International Council on Archives approved the first draft of [[ISAD(G)]] (General International Standard Archival Description), intended to be a standard for elements that should be included in a finding aid register for archival documents produced by corporations, persons and families.

A revised version, known as ISAD(G)2, was issued in 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5397">'''Jacob Cornelis van Slee''' (1841–1929) was a Dutch Reformed clergyman and scholar. He was the author of a study of the [[Windesheim Congregation]], ''De kloostervereeniging van Windesheim'' (Leiden, 1874), and between 1875 and 1900 contributed articles on theologians to the ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]''.

==Life==
Slee was born at [[Hillegom]] on 23 September 1841, the son of Cornelis van Slee and Anna Barbera Geertruida Romeny. He studied Theology at the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam]] and at [[Leiden University]]. In 1868 he married Elisabeth Kenno and was appointed minister at Herwijnen. Appointments followed at Oostzaan in 1873, at Drumpt in 1877, and at Brielle in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bran038biog01_01/bran038biog01_01_3766.php Slee (Jacob Cornelis van)], in J.G. Frederiks and F. Jos. van den Branden, ''Biographisch woordenboek der Noord- en Zuidnederlandsche letterkunde'' (Amsterdam, 1888–1891), 724.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 he became preacher in Deventer, and in 1892 librarian of the city's [[Athenaeum Illustre]] (a sort of liberal arts college). The library had been founded by the city in 1597, on the basis of a medieval collection, and Slee marked the third centenary by publishing a catalogue of the library's holdings.

Slee retired as a preacher in 1914, and in 1914 he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Groningen]]. In 1917 he organised a major exhibition on Luther in the library at Deventer, to mark the fourth centenary of the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. His wife died in 1920. He himself retired as librarian in 1928, and died on 21 November 1929. He was buried in Diepenveen, where he had lived since retiring as a preacher in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;L.

Sarkar was honored by Britain with a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] and knighted in the [[1929 Birthday Honours]] list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33501/supplements/3667 The London Gazette, 3 June 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; He was invested with his knighthood at Simla by the acting Viceroy, [[George Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen|Lord Goschen]], on 22 August 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33539/pages/6245 |title=Viewing Page 6245 of Issue 33539 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=1929-10-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta&lt;ref name="csssc"&gt;[http://www.cssscal.org/ Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]&lt;/ref&gt; an autonomous research centre has been located at 10, Lake Terrace, Sarkar's house, from 1973 to 2000. This house was handed over to the state government by Sarkar's wife, Kadambini Sarkar, just before she died. The building now houses the newly established Jadunath Sarkar Resource Centre for Historical Research, which has been established under the aegis of the CSSSC. The Jadunath Bhavan Museum and Resource Centre, a museum-cum-archive was set up at Jadunath Bhavan on 1 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150131/jsp/calcutta/story_10930.jsp#.VNLOWTb9nIU Jadunath Bhavan Museum and Resource Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Academically, Jos J. L. Gommans compares Sarkar's work with those of the [[Aligarh Muslim University|Aligarh historians]], noting that while the historians from the Aligarh worked mainly on the [[mansabdar]]i system and [[gunpowder]] technology in the [[Mughal Empire]], Sarkar concentrated on [[military tactics]] and [[siege]]s.&lt;ref name="Gommans2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jos J. L. Gommans|title=Mughal Warfare: Indian Frontiers and Highroads to Empire, 1500-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA3YVOt9QZUC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-23989-9|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaushik Roy notes that the works of Jadunath Sarkar along with those of [[Jagadish Narayan Sarkar]] are now "forgotten due to pressure of [[Marxism]] and [[Postmodernism]]".&lt;ref name="Roy2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaushik Roy|title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpXijlqeRpIC&amp;pg=PR10|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-7824-109-8|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been called the "greatest Indian historian of his time" and one of the greatest in the world, whose erudite works "have established a tradition of honest and scholarly historiography" by E. Sreedharan.&lt;ref name="Historiography 2000, p. 448"&gt;A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000, E.

A [[cultural historian]], Connelly has examined topics ranging from female agency, to ritual space, landscape, life cycles, identity, reception, and complexity. In her ''Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece'', Connelly challenges long held beliefs concerning the "invisibility" of women in ancient Greece and brings together far-flung archaeological evidence for women's leadership roles in the religious life of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Coates-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=5e16305e29883c68&amp;oref=slogin "Keepers of the Faith"] by Steve Coates, ''The New York Times'', July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=20335 "The Women and the Gods"] by Peter Green, ''The New York Review of Books'', Vol. 54, No. 11, June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8368.html ''Portrait of a Priestess'' Profile] at Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portrait of a Priestess'' was named as one of the 100 Notable Books of the Year for 2007 by the [[New York Times Book Review]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/books/review/notable-books-2007.html "100 Notable Books of the Year"] from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Association of American Publishers]] named it the best book in Classics and Ancient History for 2007. In 2009, ''Portrait of a Priestess'' won the Archaeological Institute of America's James R. Wiseman Book Award.

A field archaeologist, Connelly has worked at Corinth, Athens, and Nemea in Greece, at Paphos, Kourion, and Ancient Marion in [[Cyprus]], and on the island of Failaka off the coast of Kuwait. In 1985, she served as consultant for the design and installation of the Hellenistic galleries in the Kuwait National Museum.  Since 1990, Connelly has directed the NYU [[Yeronisos]] Island Excavations and Field School just off western Cyprus. Here, she has pioneered eco-archaeology, undertaking floral and faunal surveys, annual bird counts, and establishing guidelines sensitive to the ways in which archaeological intervention impacts the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://yeronisos.org/Yeronisos_Field_Expedition/Yeronisos_Island_Excavations_and_Field_School,_Cyprus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departures.com/articles/cleopatras-secret Cleopatra's Secret] in "Departures Magazine" July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Yeronisos._Twenty_Years_on_Cleopatra's_Isle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Her fieldwork has focused on cross-cultural exchange in the [[Hellenized]] East during the centuries following the death of [[Alexander the Great]].

==Education and professional life==
Connelly received an A.B. in Classics from [[Princeton University]]. She received her M.A. and PhD in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology from [[Bryn Mawr College]], where she later served as an Assistant Dean of the Undergraduate College, Lecturer in Classical Archaeology, and as a member of the Board of Trustees. Connelly has held visiting fellowships at All Souls College, Magdalen College, New College, and Corpus Christi College, [[Oxford University]], and has been a Visiting Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University. She held the Norbert Schimmel Fellowship and Classical Fellowships at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and was a Visiting Scholar in Anthropology at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago. Connelly was Hetty Goldman Member at the School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, in 2010-11 and Visitor of the Institute in 2015. She was appointed Visiting Professor in the Departement Altertumswissenschaften, University of Basel, Switzerland, in 2012. She returns to All Souls, Oxford, as Visiting Fellow in 2016. Connelly is a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the [[Explorers Club]], and the [[Society of Woman Geographers]]. She is a Trustee of the Association of Members of the Institute of Advanced Study, the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, the Society for the Preservation of the Greek Heritage, and the [[Pharos Arts Foundation]].

Connelly served on the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, [[U.S. Department of State]], from 2003 through 2011.  For over twenty years Professor Connelly has team taught a popular course at NYU titled "Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Heritage Policy" with physical chemist, Professor Norbert Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center.

In collaboration with architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]], Connelly submitted a proposal for the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtcsitememorial.com/ent/entI=683466.html World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition Entry for Joan Connelly]&lt;/ref&gt;

Connelly has been interviewed on the Parthenon by Jeffrey Brown for the [[PBS NewsHour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joanbretonconnelly.com/#!PBS-NewsHour-with-Jeffrey-Brown-Seeing-the-Parthenon-Through-Ancient-Eyes/c1q8z/7F2F6A70-A82F-4951-84F6-B94C33BFB4D0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/parthenon/&lt;/ref&gt; She has spoken on Greek Priestesses for Andrew Marr's ''[[Start the Week]]'' program, [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/starttheweek_20070226.shtml ''Start the Week'' February 26, 2007, Episode Information]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Connelly appeared in [[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]] ([[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]) where she discussed classical antecedents for epic themes in the [[Star Wars]] saga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/minisites/starwarslegacy "Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed" Website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she appeared in ''Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Quest'' (The History Channel, Lucasfilms and Prometheus Entertainment), in which she discussed new technologies in field archaeology, the importance of stratigraphic context, and the global illicit antiquities market. In 2012, her excavations of Yeronisos Island, Cyprus, were featured on ABC's [[Born to Explore with Richard Wiese]]. She has also contributed to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.

In April 2015, renowned physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] told ''[[The New York Times]] Sunday Book Review'' that Joan Breton Connelly was one of the three writers he would invite to a literary dinner party, along with [[Kristen R. Ghodsee]] and [[Mary Doria Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, By the Book: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/19bkr-bythebook_dyson.t.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what book is currently on his nightstand, Dyson answered Connelly's ''Parthenon Enigma''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">'''La troupe du Roi de Danemark''', or ''Roi de Danemark'' for short, was a French-speaking Danish court theatre, active at the Royal Danish court from 1682 until 1721. It was the only permanent theater in Denmark during its tenure. 

The first French theater troupe had performed at the royal Danish court under [[Rosidor|Jean Guilmois de Rosidor]] (father of [[Rosidor fils|Claude Guilmois de Rosidor]]) in 1669-70, but that was but a temporary visit. The ''Roi de Danemark'' was engaged 23 March 1682. It was composed of French artists, who performed French language plays exclusively for the royal Danish court on temporary stages arranged at the various royal palaces. The composition of the troupe varied, but normally consisted of circa twelve people. It was the only permanent theatre company in Denmark during its tenure, when the only other theater activity in Copenhagen consisted of temporary visits from travelling foreign theater company's. 

In 1721, the French court theater was dissolved by the monarch, who preferred German opera. Some of the members of the former court theater, who had lived in Denmark for most of their lives and in some cases even been born there, did not wish to leave Denmark, and therefore founded the first permanent public theater in Copenhagen, [[Lille Grønnegade Theatre]], in January 1722.

'''Lieuwe (Leo) van Aitzema''' (19 November 1600 – 23 February 1669) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[historian]], diplomat, [[bon viveur]], philanderer and spy.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic. Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477-1806, p. 684, 731-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born at [[Dokkum]], in [[Friesland]]. In 1617 he published a volume of [[Latin]] [[poem]]s under the title of ''Poemata Juvenilia'', of which a copy is preserved in the [[British Museum]]. He made a special study of [[politics]] and [[political science]] and was for thirty years resident and minister for the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic towns]] at [[the Hague]], where he died on 23 February 1669.

His most important work was the ''Saken van Staet in Oorlogh in ende omtrent de Vereenigte Nederlanden'' (14 vols. 4to, 1655–1671), embracing the period from 1621 to 1668. It contains a large number of state documents, and is an invaluable authority on one of the most eventful periods of Dutch history.

Four continuations of the history, by the poet and historian [[Lambert van den Bos]], were published successively at Amsterdam in 1685, 1688, 1698 and 1699. The ''Derde Vervolg Zinde het vierde Stuck van het vervolgh op de historie, &amp;c., '', brings the history down to 1697.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1911encyclopedia.org/Lieuwe_van_Aitzema |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514000316/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lieuwe_van_Aitzema |archivedate=2007-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Churches Conservation Trust]], which was initially known as the Redundant Churches Fund, is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] whose purpose is to protect historic churches at risk, those that have been made [[redundant church|redundant]] by the [[Church of England]]. The Trust was established by the Pastoral Measure of 1968.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us.html | title = About us | accessdate = 15 October 2016| publisher = Churches Conservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legally defined object of the Trust is "the preservation, in the interests of the nation and the Church of England, of churches and parts of churches of historic and archaeological interest or architectural quality vested in the Fund&amp;nbsp;... together with their contents so vested".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = | date = | year = 1983| title = Pastoral Measure 1983:Section 44(4)| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]| pages = | page = | format = | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukcm/1983/1/section/44| accessdate =1 April 2011}} (Pastoral Measure 1983 consolidates Pastoral Measure 1968 with later legislation.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The charity cares for over 350&amp;nbsp;churches.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;  The Trust is financed partly by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] and the Church Commissioners, but grants from those bodies were frozen in 2001, since when additional funding has come from other sources, including the general public. In the 12&amp;nbsp;months ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010 the charity's income was £6,161,653, and its spending was £6,035,871.  During that year it had 44&amp;nbsp;employees, and used the services of 2,000&amp;nbsp;volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=258612&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 | title = Churches Conservation Trust| accessdate = 20 December 2010| publisher = [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charity is run by a board of trustees, who delegate the day-to-day management to a chief executive and his senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/board-of-trustees.html | title = Board of Trustees| accessdate = 15 October 2016 | publisher = Churches Conservation Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust's primary aim is to ensure that the buildings in its care are weatherproof and to prevent any deterioration in their condition.  The majority of the churches remain [[consecration|consecrated]], and many are occasionally still used for worship.  Local communities are encouraged to use them for appropriate activities and events, and the buildings provide an educational resource, allowing children and young people to study history and architecture. Nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million people visit the Trust's churches each year.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;  As most of the churches remain consecrated, they are used for occasional services where this is practical, and some are venues for concerts and other purposes.

This list contains the 56&amp;nbsp;churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in Southeast England, consisting of those in the counties of [[Oxfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Greater London]], [[Berkshire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Kent]], [[West Sussex]], and [[East Sussex]]. The churches range in age from the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] [[All Saints Church, West Stourmouth]], to the newest church in the list, [[Holy Trinity Church, Privett]], which was built between 1876 and 1878. All the churches are designated by [[English Heritage]] as [[listed buildings]], most of them in Grades&amp;nbsp;I and II*.

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''middle chronology''' is one [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronology of the Near Eastern Bronze and Early Iron Age]], which fixes the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1792–1750 BCE and the [[Babylonia#The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology|sack of Babylon]] to 1595 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bernal1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bernal|title=Black Athena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0p20bLNVsC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=1 June 1991|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1584-7|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronology is based on a 56/64-year [[astronomical]] calculation determined by evidence from the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and
the [[Enuma anu enlil]] tablet 63. Conventional textbooks tend to use the middle chronology, but early [[dendrochronological]] and [[astronomical]] evidence presented various problems for it.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane McIntosh|title=Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9veK7E2JwkUC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-965-2|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased adoption of the short chronologies by some.&lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0311035.pdf Gurzadyan, V. G., On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology, ICRA, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Italy and Yerevan Physics Institute, Armenia, Akkadica, v. 119–120 (2000), pp. 175–184.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, Akkadica, v. 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent studies have shown that the Middle Chronology is most likely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/07/cornell-led-research-resolves-long-debated-mesopotamia-timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem raised by using short chronologies is that a century or more needs to be added to some period of the second millennium BCE to accommodate it, but no one so far has been able to make a suggestion as to which period to add it to. That has left second millennium BCE dates appearing artificially short and has resulted in distortion and loss of accuracy for older dates, as a sacrifice to provide greater accuracy for earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619055/Problems_of_Chronology_Mesopotamia_Anatolia_and_the_Syro-Levantine_Region], Schwartz, Glenn, 2008.  "Problems of Chronology: Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Syro-Levantine Region." In: Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C., edited by Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, and Jean M. Evans: 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have favoured different chronologies in recent years. [[Peter J. Huber]] has favoured the [[long chronology]], relying on [[astronomical]] data available from [[Enuma anu enlil]] tablets 20 and 21 linking lunar [[eclipse]]s to historical events in the [[Ur III]] period, along with the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], Old Babylonian month lengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caeno.org/_Eponym/pdf/Huber_Ammizaduga_%20Gurzadyan%20rejoinder%202000_NEEDS%20FIX.pdf Huber, Peter J., Astronomy and Ancient Chronology, Akkadica 119–120 (2000), pp. 159–176.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous elements of Huber's theories have been criticized by a consortium of scholars led by [[Hermann Gasche]] and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]], who have suggested an [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|ultra-low chronology]] based on [[archaeological]] evidence and especially on more complete use of [[astronomical]] evidence. Gasche and Gurzadyan argue that only the eight-year cycle from the Venus tablet is entirely reliable and of practical use&lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"/&gt; (see update in&lt;ref name="ultra1" /&gt;). The latest studies largely rely on more evidences.&lt;ref name="ultra1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sassmannshausen, Leonhard. Zur mesopotamischen Chronologie des 2. Jahrtausends, Baghdader Mitteilungen 37, 157–177, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2001 published high-resolution radiocarbon dates from Turkey supporting dates for the 2nd millennium BC that are very close to those proposed by the middle chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=S.W.|last2=Kromer|first2=B.|last3=Kuniholm|first3=P.I.|last4=Newton|first4=M.W.|year=2001|title=Anatolian Tree Rings and a New Chronology for the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages|journal=Science|volume=294|pages=2532–2535|doi=10.1126/science.1066112|issue=5551|pmid=11743159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support for the Middle Chronology (or a "Low-Middle" eight years lower) was provided by a 2016 study combining dendrochronology and radiocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157144#pone-0157144-g008 Sturt W.

'''Mihailo Gavrilović''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: '''Михаило Гавриловић'''), ([[Aleksinac]], May 8, 1868 - [[London]], November 1, 1924) was a prominent [[Serbs|Serbian]] historian and diplomat.

==Early life==
Mihailo Gavrilović was born at [[Aleksinac]] in central [[Serbia]] on May 8, 1868 ([[Julian Calendar|Old Style]]). After graduating at Belgrade and Paris universities, he entered at first upon an academic career. From 1902 to 1911 he was Director of the Serbian State Archives, and during this time won a high reputation as a historian.

==Scholarly career==
Gavrilović researched nineteenth-century Serbian history and wrote extensively on the main political figures of the time (i.e. [[Miloš Obrenović]]), Franco-Serbian relations during the [[Napoleonic era]] and the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804–1813) and Serbo-British relations in the 1840s and 1850s, as well as on international relations concerning the Serbian question. His three-volume biography of Prince [[Miloš Obrenović]] is still the best in Serbian historiography. It will always remain a standard work upon that period, and is specially valuable for its treatment of the diplomatic relations of Serbia with the European Powers. It carries the story of Prince Miloš down to 1835, and a fourth volume was to have dealt with the close of his first reign, his exile and his triumphant return in 1858. But unhappily the material which Gavrilović had amassed during the years of study and which would have enabled him to complete the work without much further effort, was irretrievably lost in a trunk which accompanied him during the painful [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)#1915|retreat of the Serbian Army]] through Albania in the [[First World War]] (1915–1916), now remembered as the epic ”Albanian Golgotha“.

Gavrilović studied history at the ''Velika škola'', the institution that was later to become the [[University of Belgrade]]. He graduated in 1891, and defended his thesis on medieval history at the [[University of Paris]]-[[University of Paris-Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] in 1899. During his years in [[Paris]] (1893–1900) Gavrilović prepared a huge volume of French documents concerning the [[First Serbian Uprising]], under [[Karađorđe]] (1804–1813), that was published in the French language in a single volume in 1904 (''Ispisi iz pariskih arhiva. Građa za istoriju srpskog ustanka''), in [[Belgrade]] by the [[SANU|Serbian Royal Academy]]. After returning to [[Serbia]] from [[Paris]], Gavrilović was appointed Director of the Archives of Serbia (1900–1903) and contributed greatly to its organization as a modern archival institution.

Using Austrian and Russian sources as well, Gavrilović, renowned for his methodical analysis and wider perspective on general historical developments, was considered the leading Serbian expert for diplomatic history. Gavrilović was elected a member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1914.

==Diplomatic career==
Gavrilović was Serbian envoy to [[Cetinje]] (1910–1914), and was reassigned in 1914 as Serbian Envoy to the [[Holy See]]. During his stay in [[Rome]], he searched the archives of the [[Holy See|Vatican]], collecting documents concerning Serbian history. In 1917, while the Serbian government-in-exile was located at [[Corfu]], in [[Greece]] (1916–1918), Gavrilović was appointed Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, and, later on, served as acting Minister of Foreign Affairs (March 10 to November 3, 1918). After the Yugoslav unification in December 1918, Gavrilović was appointed as Envoy of [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to [[London]]. As a diplomat Gavrilović was equally successful as in his scholarly pursuits, developing  an important network of ties with officials in states where he represented the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its successor, The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1919–1924).

'''Oskar Halecki''' (26 May 1891, [[Vienna]] – 17 September 1973, [[White Plains, New York]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian, social and Catholic activist.

==Life and career==
Halecki, whose first name is sometimes spelled Oscar in English-language sources, was born in Vienna to a Polish officer serving in the Austrian army. His father, Oscar Chalecki-Halecki, achieved the rank of Lieutenant Field-marshal. His mother was Leopoldina deDellimanic.

After graduating with a doctorate from the [[Jagiellonian University]] (1909–1913), he served briefly as a research assistant to Bronisław Dembiński in Warsaw, before continuing his education at the [[University of Vienna]] (1914–1915). He secured his first teaching position in 1915 as a docent at his alma mater, the Jagiellonian University. He was disqualified from military service due to poor eyesight. In his early years, Halecki wore [[Pince-nez]], which combined with his mustache gave him an aristocratic appearance. Halecki moved to the [[Warsaw University]] in 1918 where he was appointed to a Chair of East European History.

After the [[First Armistice at Compiegne|Armistice]] was signed, Halecki was appointed Secretary General of a committee of experts attached to the Polish Delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Even though he had been appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy at the Jagiellonian (1920), Halecki spent a decade in international service. In 1921, he was appointed as a member of the [[League of Nations]] Secretariat in Geneva, where he spent three years organizing that body's [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|Committee on Intellectual Co-operation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grandjean |first=Martin |date=2018 |title=Les réseaux de la coopération intellectuelle. La Société des Nations comme actrice des échanges scientifiques et culturels dans l'entre-deux-guerres |trans-title=The Networks of Intellectual Cooperation. The League of Nations as an Actor of the Scientific and Cultural Exchanges in the Inter-War Period |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01853903 |language=fr |location=Lausanne |publisher=Université de Lausanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent a year in Paris as Chief of the University Section in the League's Institute on Intellectual Co-operation, and then spent several years working on its various commissions. After a ten-year absence, Halecki returned to his professorship at the University of Warsaw until 1939, during which time he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Humanities (1930–1931). During 1938, he went to the United States as a visiting scholar of the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]], giving over forty lectures at colleges and universities.

Halecki was attending a conference in Fribourg when Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], which triggered the Second World War. Rather than returning to occupied Poland, he went to Paris, where he organized the [[Polish University Abroad|Polish University in Exile]] and served as its President, taught at the [[Sorbonne]], and edited an émigré periodical called ''La Voix de Varsovie''. When Germany [[Battle of France|invaded France]] in 1940, Halecki escaped to the United States with the help of [[Stephen Mizwa]] and the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]], where he spent two years as a Visiting Professor of History at [[Vassar College]], before becoming Executive Director of the newly formed [[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America|Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America]], which was conceived as an American outpost of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Polska Akademia Umiejętności]] - [[Bronisław Malinowski]] was PIASA's first President, and Halecki was later President from 1952 to 1964.

Halecki became a Professor of Eastern European History at [[Fordham University]] from 1944 to 1961, during which time he was also affiliated with the [[University of Montreal]] from 1944 to 1951, and also was an adjunct professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1955 to 1961, where he contributed to the prestige of Columbia's Institute on East Central Europe. After his "retirement" in 1961, he was a visiting professor at [[John Felice Rome Center|Loyola University in Rome]] (1962-1963), [[University of Fribourg]] (1963), [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1963-1964), and [[Good Counsel College]] (1964-1967).

As a historian, Halecki was an expert on the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which laid the foundation for his thesis that Eastern Europe (distinct from Russia) was no less European than Western Europe, that they were both part of one great European community of people that shared the same spiritual ideals and cultural traditions. His work led to the gradual acceptance of the concept and name of East Central Europe. His magnum opus was a two-volume history of the Jagiellonian Union, published in 1919-1920. Much of his retirement was occupied with working on a biography of [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga of Anjou]], which was published two decades after his death.

Halecki also served on the controversial "Committee of Ten" in [[Scarsdale, New York]], which claimed Communist influence in the public school curriculum during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;A Sort of Utopia, Scarsdale, 1891-1981 by Carol A. O'Connor, Pp. 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many students he mentored were Thaddeus V. Gromada, [[Taras Hunczak]], and [[Eugene Kusielewicz]].

Halecki was married to Helen de Sulima-Szarlowska, who died in 1964.

==Honors and recognition==
Halecki received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Lyon]], the [[University of Montreal]], [[De Paul University]], [[Fordham University]], and [[Saint Peter's University|Saint Peter's College]]. He was Papal Chamberlain and Knight of the Grand Cross, Order of Malta; Commander of the Order of Polonia Restituta; Commander of Saint Gregory; Commander, Hungarian Croix de Merite; and Chevalier, [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'honneur]].  Halecki received the [[Polish American Historical Association]]'s first Haiman Award (1966) for outstanding contributions to Polish American studies. In 1981, the Polish American Historical Association established the Halecki Prize, given to recognize an important book or monograph on the Polish experience in the United States.

[[File:Carmelo Canzonieri.jpg|thumb|Catholic bishop wearing an [[amaranth (color)|amaranth red]]-trimmed black [[cassock]] and pellegrina]]

The '''pellegrina''' is a [[cape]]-like item of clerical dress worn by some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[clergy|ecclesiastics]].

== Description ==
Similar to the [[mozzetta]] but open in front, the pellegrina is a short shoulder cape reaching to the elbow. It is made of black or white material trimmed and lined with [[amaranth (color)|amaranth red]] (for bishops) or [[scarlet (color)|scarlet red]] (for [[cardinalate|cardinals]]). The [[pope]]'s pellegrina is entirely white.  In some countries, priests wear a pellegrina of the same colour as their plain black cassock.

== Use ==
[[File:Papa Benedetto XVI - 21 settembre 2005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wearing a white pellegrina]]
The general rule of the Roman Catholic Church is that the pellegrina may be worn with the [[cassock]] by cardinals and bishops.&lt;ref name=Instruction&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction ''Ut sive sollicite'' on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates, 28 March 1969, 2 and 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the year in which [[Pope Pius IX]] [[Universalis Ecclesiae|restored the Catholic hierarchy]] in England and Wales, he was understood to grant to all priests there the privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white cassock with pellegrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-history.org.uk/nwchs/plumb/glossary.html Catholic History: England &amp; Wales 1550–1850, s.v. "Clerical dress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021024031/http://www.catholic-history.org.uk/nwchs/plumb/glossary.html |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the cassock has been a sign of a Catholic priest in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[File:Pallottines1.jpg|thumb|Polish Palottine Fathers wearing cassocks with pellegrinas]]
In his 1909 book, ''Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church'', John Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=nainfa+%22adopting+the+English+word+simar%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books proposed] the use of the English word "[[simar]]", instead of the word "cassock", for the garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as distinct from the cassock proper. Others too have made the same distinction between the "simar" (with pellegrina) and the "cassock" (without), but many scholars disagree with Nainfa's distinction.&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur444.htm Edward McNamara, "Birettas and Academic Hats at Mass"]&lt;/ref&gt; More particularly, the documents of the [[Holy See]] make no such distinction, using the term "cassock" or "vestis talaris" whether a pellegrina is attached or is not. Thus the 1969 Instruction states that, for cardinals and bishops, "the elbow-length cape, trimmed in the same manner as this ''cassock'', may be worn over it".&lt;ref name=Instruction/&gt; "Cassock", rather than "simar" is the term that is usually applied to the dress of Popes and other Catholic ecclesiastics. The Instruction also gives no support to Nainfa's claim that the cassock with shoulder cape should not be worn in church services, which would be of difficult application, since the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a single garment, with a non-detachable pellegrina.

When Pope Benedict XVI resigned in 2013, he decided that he would continue to wear a white cassock but without pellegrina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quibrescia.it/cms/2013/02/26/dopo-laddio-benedetto-xvi-sara-papa-emerito/?rnd=1575729654 "Dopo l'addio Benedetto XVI sarà 'Papa emerito'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2013/pope-benedict-to-be-pope-emeritus-or-roman-pontiff-emeritus.cfm Cindy Wooden, "Pope Benedict to be 'Pope emeritus' or 'Roman pontiff emeritus'", ''Catholic News Service'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Claude François Daunou''' ({{IPA-fr|donu|lang}}; 18 August 1761{{snd}}20 June 1840) was a French statesman and [[historian]] of the [[French Revolution]] and [[First French Empire|Empire]].

== Early career ==
He was born at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. After a career in the school of the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] there, he joined the order in [[Paris]] in 1777. He was professor in various [[Seminary|seminaries]] in 1780–1787, after which he was [[Ordination|ordained]]. He was already known in literary circles by several essays and poems, when the Revolution opened a wider career. He entered the revolutionary milieu. A supporter of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], he refused an offer of high office in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church that was intended to reverse his position.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Daunou, Pierre Claude François|volume=7|pages=849-850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected to the [[National Convention]] by the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''[[Département in France|département]]'', he associated himself with the [[Girondist]]s, but strongly opposed the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] on [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Daunou took little part in the Girondist clash with [[The Mountain]], but was involved in the events of his party's overthrow in the summer of 1793, and was imprisoned for almost a year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Directory ==
In December 1794 he returned to the Convention, and was the principal author of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] that established the [[French Directory|Directory]] at the end of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. It is probably because of his Girondinism that the [[Council of the Ancients]] was given the right of convoking the [[Council of Five Hundred]] outside Paris, an expedient which made possible [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[coup d'état]]'' (the ''[[18 Brumaire]]'' in 1799).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Daunou was also responsible for the creation of the [[Institut de France]] - he drew up the plan for its organization. His was instrumental in crushing the [[House of Bourbon|Royalist]] insurgency known as the ''[[13 Vendémiaire]]'', and the important place he occupied at the beginning of the period is indicated by the fact that he was elected by twenty-seven ''départements'' as member of the Council of Five Hundred, and became its first president. He had himself set the age qualification of the directors at forty, and thus debarred himself as candidate, as he was only thirty-four. The direction of affairs having passed into the hands of [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and his associates, Daunou turned once more to literature, but in 1798 he was sent to [[Rome]] to organize the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Napoleon and Restoration ==
Daunou again lent his aid to Napoleon in the preparation of the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] (the creation of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]), under which Napoleon held the position of [[First Consul]]. He remained ambivalent towards Napoleon, but, in the latter's controversy with [[Pope]] [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]], Napoleon, (by then [[First French Empire|Emperor]]) was able again to secure from him the learned treatise ''Sur la puissance temporelle du Pape'' (''On the [[Temporal power (Papal)|Temporal Power]] of the Papacy'', 1809).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Nonetheless, he took little part in the new ''régime'', of which he was resentful, and turned more and more to literature. At the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], he was deprived of the post of ''archivist of the Empire'', which he had held from 1807 to 1814. In 1819 he became the chair of history and [[ethics]] at the ''[[Collège de France]]''; in that role, his courses were among the most famous of the period. With the advent of the [[July Monarchy]] in 1830, he regained his old post (now as ''archivist of the Kingdom'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In 1839, Daunou was made a [[Peerage of France|Peer]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:David d'Angers - Daunou.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Pierre Daunou by [[David d'Angers]] (1840).]]
The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' writes:
{{bquote|In politics Daunou was a [[Girondist]] without combativeness; a confirmed [[First French Republic|republican]], who lent himself always to the policy of conciliation, but whose probity remained unchallenged. He belonged essentially to the centre, and lacked both the genius and the temperament which would secure for him a commanding place in a revolutionary era. As an historian his breadth of view is remarkable for his time; for although thoroughly imbued with the classical spirit of the 18th century, he was able to do justice to the middle ages. His ''Discours sur l'état des lettres au XIIIe siècle'', in the sixteenth volume of the ''Histoire littéraire de France'', is a remarkable contribution to that vast collection, especially as coming from an author so profoundly learned in the ancient classics.

Daunou's lectures at the Collège de France, collected and published after his death, fill twenty volumes (''Cours d'études historiques'', 1842–1846). They deal principally with the criticism of sources and the proper method of writing history, and occupy an important place in the evolution of the scientific study of history in France. All his works were written in an elegant style; but apart from his share in the editing of the ''Historiens de la France'', they were mostly in the form of separate articles on literary and historical subjects. In character, Daunou was reserved and somewhat austere, preserving in his habits a strange mixture of [[bourgeois]] and [[monk]]. His indefatigable work as archivist in the time when Napoleon was transferring so many treasures to Paris won him the gratitude of later scholars.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

{{History of Northern Nigeria}}
The '''pre-colonial history of Northern Nigeria''' encompasses the history of [[Northern Nigeria]] before the advent of European explorers and the subsequent pacification of Northern Nigeria by the [[British Empire]]. In [[Prehistory of Northern Nigeria|pre-historical times]], the area known as Northern Nigeria was home to the Kwatarkwashi/[[Nok culture]]. Elements of human civilisation have also been discovered around the [[Niger River]] near [[Kainji Dam]].

==Kabara Period==
Around the 7th century the [[Kabara, Daura|Kabara Nation]] under the control of the Kabara's emerged in Northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="KChronicle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=H. R|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1908|volume=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 9th century an upheaval of unexplained origins saw a transference of power from these matriarchal monarchs and a new set of nations emerged in their place.

==The Fourteen Kingdoms==
In the 9th century a set kingdoms emerged in Northern Nigeria to replace the [[Kabara, Daura|Kabara Nation]], these Kingdoms share a similar ethno-historical dynamic cemented in their belief in a common origin. The lore of the Fourteen Kingdoms unify the diverse heritage of Northern Nigeria into a cohesive system. Seven of these Kingdoms developed from the Kabara legacy of the Hausa people. In the 9th century as vibrant trading centers competing with Kanem-Bornu and Mali slowly developed in the Central Sudan, a set Kingdoms merged dominating the great savannah plains of Hausaland, their primary exports were leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, animal hides, and henna.&lt;ref name="KChronicle" /&gt; The Seven Hausa states included:

* Daura ?–1806
* Kano 998–1807
* Katsina {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1400–1805
* Zazzau (Zaria) {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1200–1808
* Gobir ?–1808
* Rano
* Biram {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1100–1805

The growth and conquest of the Hausa Bakwai resulted in the founding of additional states with rulers tracing their lineage to a concubine of the Hausa founding father, Bayajidda. Thus they are called the 'Banza Bakwai meaning Bastard Seven. The Banza Bakwai adopted many of the customs and institutions of the Hausa Bakwai but were considered unsanctioned or copy-cat kingdoms by non-Hausa people. These states include:

* Zamfara
* Kebbi
* Yauri (also called Yawuri)
* Gwari (also called Gwariland)
* Kwararafa (a Jukun state)
* Nupe (of the Nupe people)

==Sudanic States==
The Sudanic States emerged from the wake of the upheaval that transformed the system of governance in the central Sudan to patriarchal system. With influence of Islamic [[Mali Empire]], the Hausa Kingdoms were replaced beginning with the [[Kingdom of Kano]] by a set of sultanates in the 11th century. The rise of the Sultanates led to series of wars that periodically saw the emergence of organised Empires in Northern Nigeria, by the 17th century, however, these empire had debilitated their economies and have largely stagnated. The parallel rise Fula influence resulted in a wave of ethnic Jihads that saw the rise of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] encompassing much of Northern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon.

==Sokoto Caliphate==
The [[Sokoto Caliphate]] emerged from a series of religious campaigns led by the [[Fula people]]. By 1809 it had encompassed much of Northern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">'''Presidential Inaugural Medals''' have a long history in the United States.  The tradition can be traced back to the first president, [[George Washington]], and continues on today with President [[Donald Trump]].

==History==
Samuel Brooks created the first presidential medal for President George Washington—the medal produce had a crude profile of Washington on one side and is known as the "Manly medal".  When elected for his second term in office, "success tokens" were distributed as mementos following Washington's inauguration, but the medals were not produced for the actual festivities.  Thomas Jefferson received the first unofficial presidential inaugural medal produced by John Reich in 1802.  The silver medal was sold for $4.25 and the tin medal for $1.25. For years, independent medal makers would produce presidential medals to commemorate a specific president's inauguration.  In addition, unofficial presidential buttons, ribbons, and badges were produced.  All of these became increasingly popular once elaborate inaugural festivities were thrown in Washington, D.C because the various items became favored souvenirs for the attendees. Since there was no standard medal, historians have uncovered medals in various sizes and qualities, as well as composed of different metals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;MacNeil, Neil. ''The President's medal, 1789-1977''. New York : Published in association with the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, by C. N. Potter, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidential Medals 019.jpg|thumb|Obverse of a 1905 Roosevelt presidential inaugural medal.]]When the government decided it could no longer afford the inaugural celebrations at the turn of the twentieth century, D.C. residents took it upon themselves to raise all the funding for inaugural festivities.  One way to raise funds was through the sale of official presidential inaugural medals.  Instead of various presidential medals being produced for tourist consumption, an official inaugural medal would be produced by the official Inauguration Committee and sold to the public.  In 1901, William McKinley received the first official presidential inaugural medal—it had his portrait stamped on one side and the Capitol building on the other.  Surrounding the Capitol building are the words, "William McKinley President of the United States * Theodore Roosevelt Vice-President".  Instead of being produced by the United States Mint, the medals were produced by the Joseph K. Davison Company of Philadelphia.  Scholars believe that 3 gold, 55 silver, and approximately 4,000 bronze medals were produced.  The three gold medals were created for the President, Vice President, and President of the Official Inauguration Committee for Medals and Badges.  Silver medals were to be distributed among committee members and bronze medals were available for public sale.  This set a tradition that is still observed today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; 

[[File:Presidential Medals Roosevelt 1905 Eagle.jpg|thumb|Reverse of a 1905 Roosevelt presidential inaugural medal.]]When [[Theodore Roosevelt]] came into office in 1905, he decided that the previous medal produced for McKinley would be insufficient for him.  Roosevelt, an avid art supporter, wanted his medal to go above and beyond a simple portrait.  This led to two different medals being produced for his inauguration—a simpler medal approved by the Committee on Medals and Badges and a medal commissioned by Roosevelt himself.  When choosing someone to design his personal inaugural medal, Roosevelt turned to renowned sculptor, [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].  Saint-Gaudens was at the height of his career and was in negotiations with the U.S. Treasury to make new designs for American coins.  It was during his visit to the White House that President Roosevelt also asked him to design a superior inauguration medal for his election.  Saint-Gaudens agreed to the President's proposal and immediately began to sketch possibilities.  The medal produced from Saint-Gaudens certainly held a superior art aesthetic in comparison to the original medal produced by the Inaugural Committee.  One side of the medal displays a distinguished portrait of Roosevelt and the other side holds a high-relief eagle.  This is the same eagle that is later used for the $10 coins produced by the U.S. Treasury.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Roosevelt's artistic design continues to influence presidential inaugural medals today.  Following Roosevelt's presidency, the Chairmen for the Committee on Medals and Badges purposefully chose artist and other pro-art members in order to produce superior results.  The precedence Roosevelt set continued to be followed and efforts were made to contract an artist, whether it be a sculptor or engraver, to design future medals.  However, time constraints and the limitations set forth by the contracted firm to produce the medals always affects the final results.  Consequently, various degrees of artistic medals have been produced, from the less ornate Woodrow Wilson medals with his portrait on one side and his name and Vice President's Riley Marshall's name on the other side, to the more elaborate John F. Kennedy medal that has his portrait on one side and a high relief Presidential Seal on the other.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Levine, H. Joseph. ''Collectors Guide to Presidential Medals and Memorabilia''. Danbury, Conn. : Johnson &amp; Jensen, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  

When producing a new inaugural medal, the sculptor has the President-elect sit for the creation of a clay sketch.  The sketch is then turned into a mask to which additional facial features can be added.  The mask is then transformed into a plaster model, then an epoxy cast.  The cast is used to create the die cuts that will be used for striking the medals.  After the medals have been created, they are immersed in chemicals that darken the piece to create a two-toned effect.  Lastly, the medals are lacquered to preserve the piece.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Collecting Inauguration Medals==
[[File:Presidential Medals McKinley.jpg|thumb|left|1901 Bronze Presidential Medal for McKinley]]It was not until Richard Dusterberg published ''The Official Inaugural Medals of the Presidents of the United States'' in 1971 that collecting Presidential Medals began to become popular.  The original catalog included pictures of all the medals up to 1969, as well as a price guide.  As a result, the increase in collecting led to an increase in prices.  Collecting presidential medals has grown in popularity due to the appeal of the subject matter, availability of the pieces, and the fact that it is a defined collection.  If a collector chooses to collect the bronze medals, this can be completed fairly easily for a decent price.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;    

The value of the presidential inaugural medals has fluctuated over the years and is highly influenced by auctions and the current U.S. economy.  For example, in 1980 there was the Great Gold and Silver Panic when silver was worth $50 per ounce and gold worth $800 per ounce.  This led to thousands of medals being melted down for their silver and gold weight values.  The medals produced for Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter fell victim to this panic, which has since then created a shortage available for collectors and therefore a higher price tag for those presidents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  

Currently, the Smithsonian Institution and the Special Collections Research Center at The George Washington University hold the most complete collections of presidential inauguration medals.  The Smithsonian collection is composed of medals donated by different individuals over the years.  In December 1977, the National Portrait Gallery premiered the Smithsonian's medal collection with the exhibition, "The President's Medal".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The Special Collections Research Center's collection was donated by Darrell C. Crain in May 1976. Crain's father had designed the presidential medals for President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1917), President [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921), and President [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1925). In addition, Crain served on the Official Inaugural Medal Committee for five presidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/ead/ms2035.xml Darrell C. Crain, Jr., Presidential Inaugural Collection, 1817-1989], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4437">'''Primo Feliciano Velázquez Rodríguez''' (6 June 1860 &amp;ndash; 19 June 1953) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[journalist]], [[Lawyer|attorney]] and [[historian]] who specialized in regional history.  He was a translator of [[Nahuatl]] and Latin and a [[connoisseur]] of local literature.  In 1946-1948, he published the definitive ''Historia de San Luis Potosí'' (''History of [[San Luis Potosi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de San Luis Potosí'' Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística, Mexico City, {{OCLC|1908497}}&lt;/ref&gt; in four volumes.

Velázquez was born in [[Santa Maria del Rio, San Luis Potosi|Santa Maria del Rio]],  [[San Luis Potosi]] to Octaviano Velázquez and María de la Concepción Rodríguez.  He was twelve years old when he was enrolled at the Seminary of San Luis Potosi (Seminario Conciliar Guadalupano Josefino), and he graduated in 1878, took an advanced degree in 1879, and passed his law examination there in October 1880.  Subsequently, he assumed the Latin chair and the Civil Law chair there.

In 1883, he published ''La Voz de San Luis'' (''The Voice of San Luis''), a series of [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] to celebrate the centennial of the birth of  [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. The next year, he joined with Ambrosio Ramirez and Juan N. Ruelas to found the newspaper ''El Estandarte'' (''The Standard'') in San Luis Potosi which proceeded to publish articles critical of the government, as well as literary and historical articles, written mostly by Velázquez.  Velázquez espoused [[Christian democracy|Christian social doctrine]] in his editorials, and encouraged others to submit articles on local history and folklore.   ''El Estandarte'' was very successful going from biweekly to daily in 1890 and continuing to be published until the end of 1911.

Velázquez made his home a gathering point for those interested in the history of San Luis Potosi, and impromptu seminars were regular occurrences.  He was a pioneer in archaeological research in San Luis Potosi, not only excavating himself, but encouraging the work of others.

Velázquez belonged to a number of organizations, local, national, and international, among them were: [[Academia Mexicana de la Historia]], [[Real Academia Española|Real Academia de la Lengua]], and [[Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística]].

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Michle''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in cadastral area [[Michle]] of [[Prague]]. Since 2002, the district belongs to Praha 4. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeareds.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Tana ware''' refers to a type of prehistoric [[pottery]] prominent around the [[Lake Tana]] near northwest [[Ethiopia]], and Kaya settlements of the coastal hinterland of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_sil_751249 collections.si]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The name Tana ware was given because the early discoveries of these types of pottery were along the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]] in present day Kenya. 

==History==
The book ''Societies, Religion, and History: Central East Tanzanians and the World They Created, c. 200 BCE to 1800 CE'' asks: "Did a new ethno-linguistic community introduce Tana ware to the region, or did extant EIA Kwale ware makers innovate a new style through a series of transitions that resulted in Tana ware?" The book also comments that "Taking into consideration the marked typological distinctions in Tana ware motifs, even when shared aesthetic influences may be noted, it is more probable that recently arrived NECB speakers manufactured the Tana ware.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordnik.com/words/Tana wordnik.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 5th and 6th centuries, Tana ware began to replace Kwale ware in the [[Usambara]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1i-IBmCeNhUC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Tana+ware&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qoj21GC-fI&amp;sig=E4QBShVFCx6LX968r3zxA6hnnP4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wjjWTrCmEsqViAfPpNVy&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tana%20ware&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of nuclear fusion''' is an incomplete chronological summary of significant events in the study and use of [[nuclear fusion]].

==1920s==
*'''1920'''
**Based on [[F.W. Aston|F.W. Aston's]] measurements of the masses of low-mass elements and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] discovery that E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Arthur Eddington]] proposes that large amounts of energy released by [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] small nuclei together provides the energy source that powers the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|title=The internal constitution of the stars|journal=The Observatory|date=October 1920|volume=43|pages=341–358|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1920Obs....43..341E|accessdate=20 July 2015|bibcode=1920Obs....43..341E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Henry Norris Russell]] notes that the relationship in the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] suggests a hot core rather than burning throughout the star. Eddington uses this to calculate that the core would have to be about 40&amp;nbsp;million Kelvin. This remains a matter of some debate because it appears to be much higher than what observations suggest, which is about one-third to one-half that value.
*'''1928'''
**[[George Gamow]] introduces the mathematical basis for [[quantum tunnelling]].
*'''1929'''
**[[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans|Houtermans]] provide the first calculations of the rate of nuclear fusion in stars. Based on Gamow's tunnelling, they show fusion can occur at lower energies than previously believed. When used with Eddington's calculations of the required fusion rates in stars, their calculations demonstrate this would occur at the lower temperatures that were being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=R. d E.|last2=Houtermans|first2=F. G.|title=Zur Frage der Aufbaumöglichkeit der Elemente in Sternen|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|date=1929|volume=54|issue=9–10|pages=656–665|doi=10.1007/BF01341595|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01341595|accessdate=20 July 2015|bibcode = 1929ZPhy...54..656A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
*'''1932'''
**[[Ernest Rutherford]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at [[Cambridge University]] begins nuclear experiments with a [[particle accelerator]] built by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]].
**In April, Walton produces the first man-made fission by using [[proton]]s from the accelerator to split [[lithium]] into [[alpha particle]]s.
**Using an upated version of the equipment firing deuterium rather than hydrogen, [[Mark Oliphant]] discovered [[helium-3]] and [[tritium]], and that heavy [[hydrogen]] nuclei could be made to react with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Oliphant|url=http://ethw.org/Mark_Oliphant|website=Mark Oliphant|publisher=ETHW|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first direct demonstration of fusion in the lab.
*'''1939'''
**Peter Thonemann develops a detailed plan for a [[pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] device, but is told to do other work for his thesis.
**[[Hans Bethe]] provides detailed calculations of the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] that powers stars. This work results in a [[Nobel Prize for Physics]].

==1940s==
*'''1941'''
**[[Enrico Fermi]] proposed the idea of using a fission weapon to initiate nuclear fusion (still hypothetical) in a mass of hydrogen to [[Edward Teller]]. Teller became enthusiastic about the idea and worked on it (unsuccessfully) throughout the [[Manhattan Project]].
*'''1944'''
**[[James L. Tuck]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]] attempt to produce fusion reactions using [[shaped charge]]s to fire jets of deuterized metal foil at each other at high velocity. The attempts fail.
*'''1946'''
**[[George Paget Thomson]] and [[Moses Blackman]] patent the concept that would become known as the [[Z-pinch]].
*'''1947'''
**Thomson, Blackman, Thonemann, Cousins, Ware, Jim Tuck, and others meet in [[Harwell]] to discuss the pinch approach and plan development.
**First kiloampere [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by Cousins and Ware at the [[Imperial College]], London, in a doughnut-shaped glass vacuum vessel. Plasmas are unstable and only last fractions of seconds.

==1950s==
*'''1950'''
**The [[tokamak]], a type of [[magnetic confinement fusion]] device, was proposed by soviet scientists [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Igor Tamm]].
*'''1951'''
**[[Edward Teller]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) develop the [[Teller-Ulam design]] for the [[thermonuclear weapon]], allowing for the development of multi-megaton weapons.
**Fusion work in the UK is classified after the [[Klaus Fuchs]] affair.
**A press release from [[Argentina]] claims that their [[Huemul Project]] had produced controlled nuclear fusion. This prompted a wave of responses in other countries, especially the U.S.
***[[Lyman Spitzer]] dismisses the Argentinian claims, but while thinking about it comes up with the [[stellarator]] concept. Funding is arranged under Project Matterhorn and develops into the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]].
***Tuck introduces the British pinch work to LANL. He develops the [[Perhapsatron]] under the codename [[Project Sherwood]]. The project name is a play on his name via Friar Tuck.&lt;ref&gt;...the first money to be allocated [to controlled nuclear research] happened to be for Tuck, and was diverted from Project Lincoln, in the Hood Laboratory. The coincidence of names prompted the well-known cover name "Project Sherwood". James L. Tuck, [http://bayesrules.net/JamesTuckVitaeAndBiography.pdf "Curriculum Vita and Autobiography"], declassified document from Los Alamos National Laboratory (1974), reproduced with permission.

***[[Richard F. Post]] presents his [[magnetic mirror]] concept and also receives initial funding, eventually moving to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL).
***In the UK, repeated requests for more funding that had previously been turned down are suddenly approved. Within a short time, three separate efforts are started, one at Harwell and two at [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (Aldermaston). Early planning for a much larger machine at Harwell begins.
***Using the Huemul release as leverage, Soviet researchers find their funding proposals rapidly approved. Work on linear pinch machines begins that year.
[[Image:IvyMike2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivy Mike]], the first [[thermonuclear weapon]], in 1952]]
*'''1952'''
**[[Ivy Mike]] shot off [[Operation Ivy]], the first detonation of a [[thermonuclear weapon]], yields 10.4 megatons of TNT out of a fusion fuel of liquid deuterium.
**Cousins and Ware build a larger toroidal [[Pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] device in England and demonstrated that the plasma in pinch devices is inherently unstable.
*'''1953'''
**[[Z-pinch|Linear pinch devices]] in the US and USSR attempted to take the reactions to fusion levels without worrying about stability. Both reported detections of [[neutron]]s, which were later explained as non-fusion in nature.
*'''1954'''
**Early planning for the large [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] device at Harwell begins. The name is a take-off on [[research reactor|small experimental fission reactors]] which often had "zero energy" in their name, [[ZEEP]] being an example.
**[[Edward Teller]] gives a now-famous speech on plasma stability in magnetic bottles at the Princeton Gun Club. His work suggests that most magnetic bottles are inherently unstable, outlining what is today known as the [[interchange instability]].
*'''1955'''
**At the first [[Atoms for Peace]] meeting in Geneva, [[Homi Babba]] predicts that fusion will be in commercial use within two decades. This prompts a number of countries to begin fusion research; [[Japan]], [[France]] and [[Sweden]] all start programs this year or the next.
*'''1956'''
**Experimental research of [[tokamak]] systems started at [[Kurchatov Institute]], [[Moscow]] by a group of Soviet scientists led by [[Lev Artsimovich]].
**Construction of ZETA begins at Harwell.
**[[Igor Kurchatov]] gives a talk at Harwell on pinch devices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efda.org/2010/04/lecture-of-i-v-kurchatov-at-harwell/ "Lecture of I.V. Kurchatov at Harwell"], from the address of I.V. Kurchatov: "On the possibility of producing thermonuclear reactions in a gas discharge" at Harwell on 25 April 1956. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150720180242/https://www.euro-fusion.org/2010/04/lecture-of-i-v-kurchatov-at-harwell/ Archived] 20 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing for the first time that the USSR is also working on fusion. He details the problems they are seeing, mirroring those in the US and UK.
**In August, a number of articles on plasma physics appear in various Soviet journals.
**In the wake of the Kurchatov's speech, the US and UK begin to consider releasing their own data. Eventually they settle on a release prior to the 2nd [[Atoms for Peace]] conference in [[Geneva]]. 
*'''1957'''
**In the US, at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|LANL]], [[Scylla I (thermonuclear fusion device)|Scylla I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanl.gov/about/history-innovation/now-then-los-alamos.php In 1957, Los Alamos achieved the first controlled thermonuclear plasma.], Now and Then at Los Alamos.&lt;/ref&gt; achieved the first controlled thermonuclear [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] through the development of a θ-pinch design, a derivative of earlier [[Z pinch|Z-pinch]] [[Perhapsatron|Perhapsatron device]] experiments.
**ZETA is completed in the summer, it will be the largest fusion machine for a decade.
**Initial results in ZETA appear to suggest the machine has successfully reached basic fusion temperatures. UK researchers start pressing for public release, while the US demurs.
**Scientists at the AEI Research laboratory in Harwell reported that the [[Sceptre (fusion reactor)|Sceptre III]] plasma column remained stable for 300 to 400 microseconds, a dramatic improvement on previous efforts. Working backward, the team calculated that the plasma had an electrical resistivity around 100 times that of copper, and was able to carry 200 kA of current for 500 microseconds in total.
*'''1958'''
**In January, the US and UK release large amounts of data, with the ZETA team claiming fusion. Other researchers, notably Artsimovich and Spitzer, are skeptical. In May, the claims of fusion have to be retracted.
**American, British and [[USSR|Soviet]] scientists began to share previously classified controlled fusion research as part of the [[Atoms for Peace]] conference in [[Geneva]] in September. It is the largest international scientific meeting to date. It becomes clear that basic pinch concepts are not successful.
**With [[Scylla I (fusion reactor)|Scylla I]], Tuck's team at Los Alamos followed up their plasma breakthrough from the prior year to demonstrate the first controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]] in any laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/lib-www/la-pubs/00403632.pdf Reviewing next the thermonuclear plasma achievements at Los Alamos, we have achieved:(1) The first controlled thermonuclear reaction.], REVIEW OF CONTROLLED THERMONUCLEAR RESEARCH AT LOS AMMOS 1965, J. L. Tuck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00285870.pdf The first experiment in which thermonuclear fusion was achieved in any laboratory was done in 1958 with the Scylla I machine. ], Winter/Spring 1983 [[Los Alamos Science]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it came too late to be announced at Geneva. This [[Theta-pinch|θ-pinch]] approach will ultimately be abandoned as calculations show it cannot scale up to produce a reactor.

==1960s==
*'''1960'''
**After considering the concept for some time, [[John Nuckolls]] publishes the concept of [[inertial confinement fusion]]. The [[laser]], introduced the same year, appears to be a suitable "driver".
*'''1961'''
**The [[Soviet Union]] test the [[Tsar Bomba]] (50&amp;nbsp;megatons), the most powerful [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever.
*'''1964'''
** Plasma temperatures of approximately 40 million degrees Celsius and a few billion deuteron-deuteron fusion reactions per discharge were achieved at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|LANL]] with the [[Scylla IV]] device&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00285870.pdf In 1964 plasma temperatures of approximately 40 million degrees...were achieved with the Scylla IV], Winter/Spring 1983 LOS ALAMOS SCIENCE.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1965'''
**At an international meeting at the UK's new fusion research centre in Culham, the Soviets release early results showing greatly improved performance in toroidal pinch machines. The announcement is met by scepticism, especially by the UK team who's ZETA was largely identical.
**At the same meeting, odd results from the ZETA machine are published. Studying these effects leads to the [[reversed field pinch]] concept.
**By the end of the meeting, it is clear that most fusion efforts have stalled. All of the major designs, including the [[stellarator]], pinch machines and [[magnetic mirror]]s are all losing plasma at rates that are simply too high to be useful in a reactor setting. Less-known designs like the [[levatron]] and [[Astron (fusion reactor)|astron]] are faring no better.
**The 12-beam "4 pi laser" using ruby as the lasing medium is developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) includes a gas-filled target chamber of about 20 centimeters in diameter.
*'''1967'''
**Demonstration of [[Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor]] appeared to generate neutrons in a nuclear reaction.
**[[Hans Bethe]] wins the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his publication on how fusion powers the stars in work of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Bethe|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1967/bethe-bio.html|website=Hans Bethe - Biographical|publisher=Nobel Prize.org|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1968'''
**Further results from the T-3 [[tokamak]], similar to the toroidal pinch machine mentioned in 1965, claims temperatures to be over an order of magnitude higher than any other device. The Western scientists remain highly sceptical.
*'''1969'''
**The Soviets invite a UK team from ZETA to perform independent measurements on T-3, confirming their results. This leads to a "veritable stampede" of tokamak construction around the world.

==1970s==
*'''1970'''
**The [[Model C stellarator]] is quickly converted to the [[Symmetrical Tokamak]], matching the Soviet results. With an apparent solution to the magnetic bottle problem in-hand, plans begin for a larger machine to test the scaling.
**Kapchinskii and Teplyakov introduce a [[particle accelerator]] for heavy ions that appears suitable as an ICF driver in place of lasers.
*'''1972'''
**The first neodymium-[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] glass (Nd:glass) laser for ICF research, the "[[Long path laser|Long Path laser]]" is completed at LLNL and is capable of delivering ~50 joules to a fusion target. 
*'''1973'''
**Design work on [[Joint European Torus|JET]], the Joint European Torus, begins.
*'''1974'''
**[[John Bryan Taylor|J.B. Taylor]] re-visited ZETA results of 1958 and explained that the quiet-period was in fact very interesting. This led to the development of [[reversed field pinch]], now generalised as "self-organising plasmas", an ongoing line of research.
**KMS Fusion was the only private sector company to pursue controlled thermonuclear fusion research using laser technology. Despite limited resources and numerous business problems KMS successfully demonstrated fusion from the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) process. They achieved compression of a deuterium-tritium pellet from laser-energy in December 1973, and on May 1, 1974 carried out the '''world’s first''' successful laser-induced fusion. Neutron-sensitive nuclear emulsion detectors, developed by Nobel Prize winner Robert Hofstadter, were used to provide evidence of this discovery.
** Beams using mature high-energy accelerator technology are hailed as the elusive "brand-X" laser capable of driving fusion implosions for commercial power. The Livingston Curve, from Stanford SLAC Education Group, is modified to show the energy needed for fusion to occur. Experiments commence on the single beam LLNL [[Cyclops laser]], testing new optical designs for future ICF lasers.
*'''1975'''
**The [[Princeton Large Torus]] (PLT), the follow-on to the Symmetrical Tokamak, begins operation. It soon surpasses the best Soviet machines and sets several temperature records that are above what is needed for a commercial reactor. PLT continues to set records until it is decommissioned.
*'''1976'''
**Workshop, called by the US-ERDA (now DoE) at the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley, CA for an ad-hoc two-week summer study.  Fifty senior scientists from the major US ICF programs and accelerator laboratories participated, with program heads and Nobel laureates also attending. In the closing address, Dr. C. Martin Stickley, then Director of US-ERDA’s Office of Inertial Fusion, announced the conclusion was "no showstoppers" on the road to fusion energy.  
**The two beam [[Argus laser]] is completed at LLNL and experiments involving more advanced laser-target interactions commence.
**Based on the continued success of the PLT, the DOE selects a larger Princeton design for further development. Initially designed simply to test a commercial-sized tokamak, the DOE team gives them the explicit goal of running on a deuterium-tritium fuel as opposed to test fuels like hydrogen or deuterium. The project is given the name [[Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor]] (TFTR).
*'''1977'''
**The 20 beam [[Shiva laser]] at LLNL is completed, capable of delivering 10.2 kilojoules of infrared energy on target. At a price of $25 million and a size approaching that of a football field, the Shiva laser is the first of the "megalasers" at LLNL and brings the field of ICF research fully within the realm of "[[big science]]".
**The [[Joint European Torus|JET]] project is given the go-ahead by the [[European Commission|EC]], choosing an ex-[[Royal Air Force|RAF]] airfield south east of [[Oxford]], UK as its site.
[[Image:IFE laser parameter space.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Progress in power and energy levels attainable by inertial confinement lasers has increased dramatically since the early 1970s.]]
*'''1978'''
**As PLT continues to set new records, Princeton is given additional funding to adapt TFTR with the explicit goal of reaching breakeven.
*'''1979'''
**LANL successfully demonstrates the radio frequency quadrupole accelerator (RFQ). 
**[[Argonne National Laboratory|ANL]] and Hughes Research Laboratories demonstrate required ion source brightness with xenon beam at 1.5MeV.  
**Foster Panel reports to US-DoE's Energy Research and Advisory Board that [[High-energy heavy ion fusion]] (HIF) is the "conservative approach" to fusion power. Listing HIF's advantages in his report, John Foster remarked: "…now that is kind of exciting." After DoE Office of Inertial Fusion completed review of programs, Director Gregory Canavan decides to accelerate the HIF effort.

==1980s==
*'''1982'''
**HIBALL study by German and US institutions,&lt;ref&gt;...Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung; Institut für Plasmaphysik, Garching; Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, University of Wisconsin, Madison; Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik&lt;/ref&gt; Garching uses the high repetition rate of the RF accelerator driver to serve four reactor chambers and first-wall protection using liquid lithium inside the chamber cavity.
**[[Tore Supra]] construction starts at [[Cadarache]], France. Its [[superconductivity|superconducting]] magnets will permit it to generate a strong permanent toroidal magnetic field. [https://web.archive.org/web/20121115112229/http://www-drfc.cea.fr/gb/cea/ts/ts.htm]
**[[high-confinement mode]] (H-mode) discovered in tokamaks.
*'''1983'''
**[[Joint European Torus|JET]], the largest operational magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment is completed on time and on budget. First plasmas achieved.
**The [[NOVETTE laser]] at LLNL comes on line and is used as a test bed for the next generation of ICF lasers, specifically the [[NOVA laser]].
*'''1984'''
**The huge 10 beam [[NOVA laser]] at LLNL is completed and switches on in December. NOVA would ultimately produce a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared laser light during a nanosecond pulse in a 1989 experiment.
*'''1985'''
**National Academy of Sciences reviewed military ICF programs, noting HIF’s major advantages clearly but averring that HIF was "supported primarily by other [than military] programs".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The review of ICF by the National Academy of Sciences marked the trend with the observation: "The energy crisis is dormant for the time being." Energy becomes the sole purpose of heavy ion fusion.  
**The Japanese tokamak, [[JT-60]] completed. First plasmas achieved.
*'''1988'''
**The [[T-15 (reactor)|T-15]], Soviet tokamak with superconducting helium-cooled coils completed. 
**The Conceptual Design Activity for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ([[ITER]]), the successor to [[T-15 (reactor)|T-15]], [[TFTR]], [[Joint European Torus|JET]] and [[JT-60]], begins. Participants include [[EURATOM]], Japan, the [[Soviet Union]] and United States. It ended in 1990.

*'''1989'''
**On March 23, two [[Utah]] electrochemists, [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]], announced that they had achieved [[cold fusion]]: fusion reactions which could occur at room temperatures. However, they made their announcements before any peer review of their work was performed, and no subsequent experiments by other researchers revealed any evidence of fusion.

==1990s==
*'''1990'''
**Decision to construct the [[National Ignition Facility]] "beamlet" laser at LLNL is made.
*'''1991'''
**The [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak|START]] Tokamak fusion experiment begins in [[Culham]].

**A record is reached at [[Tore Supra]]: a plasma duration of two minutes with a current of almost 1 million amperes driven non-inductively by 2.3 MW of [[Lower hybrid oscillation|lower hybrid frequency waves]] (i.e. 280 MJ of injected and extracted energy). This result was possible due to the actively cooled plasma-facing components installed in the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-drfc.cea.fr/gb/cea/ts/ts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115112229/http://www-drfc.cea.fr/gb/cea/ts/ts.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Trudpert Neugart''' (born Villingen, [[Baden]], 23 February 1742; died at St Paul's Benedictine abbey near [[Klagenfurt]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], Austria, 15 December 1825) was a [[Benedictine]] historian. Of middle-class origin, Neugart studied in the classical schools of the Benedictine Abbeys of [[St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest|St George]] and [[St. Blaise's Abbey in the Black Forest|St. Blasien]], entered the order at the latter monastery in l759, and was ordained priest 1765; in 1767 he was appointed professor of Biblical languages at the [[University of Freiburg]]. In 1770, however, he returned to St. Blasien where he [[Profession (religious)|professed]] theology. 

While engaged in this work he published a treatise on [[penance]], ''Doctrina de sacramento poenitentiae recte administrando'' (St Blasien, 1778). His abbot, Gerbert had planned the publication of a Church history of Germany on a large scale (Germania sacra). In 1780 at his request Neugart began an elaborate research into the history of the Diocese of [[Constance]]. On Gerbert's death in 1793, Neugart declined the title of abbot but accepted the provostship of [[Bad Krozingen]], near Freiburg, so as to be able to devote himself entirely to historical studies. He published the original charters and documents for the history of the Diocese of Constance in a separate publication, ''Codex diplomaticus Alemanniae et Burgundiae transjuranae intra fines dioecesis Constantiensis'' (I, St. Blasien, 1791; II, St. Blansien, 1795). With this as a basis he wrote in Krozingen the first instalment of his history of the Diocese of Constance ''Episcopatus Constantiensis Alemannicus sub metropoli Moguntina'' (part I, vol. I, to the year 1100, St. Blasien 1803). 

Soon the abbey of St. Blasien was secularized. Notwithstanding Neugart's efforts for its preservation it was assigned to Baden, and absorbed with all its landed possessions. In 1807 Neugart went to Vienna to negotiate for the settlement of the expelled monks in Austria, and succeeded. The abbot and monks of St. Blasien were granted the [[St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal|Abbey of St. Paul, near Klagenfurt]] in the valley of the Lavant, suppressed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Here Neugart completed the second volume of his diocesan history extending to 1308, but it was not published until 1802. He then turned his attention to the history of Carinthia and of the Abbey of St. Paul, where he and his companions had found refuge. After his death there appeared his ''Historia monasterii Ord. S. Benedicti ad S. Paulum in valle inferioris Carinthiae Lavantina'' (Klagenfurt, 1848,1854). Several historical treatises and compilations are still in manuscript. Another work, ''Libellus majores maternos Rudolphi I regis exhibens'', was edited by Weber (Klagenfurt, 1850).

'''Urmson &amp; Thompson''' was a company that manufactured [[stationary steam engine]]s.  It was based in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]].  The company were general [[millwright]]s, also producing some steam engines during the 19th century and after 1904 produced large steam-driven engines for [[Cotton mill|textile mills]] in Oldham.&lt;ref name=GH15&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''John Urmson and John E Thompson''' started business in 1865 in [[Hathershaw]], [[Oldham]]. While Urmson was a trained engineer who had worked at [[Woolstenhulmes &amp; Rye]], Thompson is thought to have contributed [[Financial capital|capital]]. Thompson died in 1882, and Urmson with his sons John and Andrew continued the business. On the sons' death in 1888 the firm was incorporated, and continued until 1933.&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

The firm operated out of the Hathershaw Foundry. Initially millwrights, in the 1870s they started making stationary steam engines as well. From 1904 they made a series of large mill engines. The largest was a 2000ihp engine for Ace Mill Co. Ltd., Chadderton in 1914. This was erected in 1919.

The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts&lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Hartford Mill was powered by an 1800&amp;nbsp;hp [[twin-tandem]] [[compound engine]] by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907. It was steamed at 160&amp;nbsp;psi at 68&amp;nbsp;rpm. It had a 5&amp;nbsp;ft stroke driving a 24&amp;nbsp;ft flywheel. The transmission method was a rope drive using 40 ropes. The engine was reputed to be the only twin-tandem that Urmson &amp; Thompson built. It had two 30" diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60" LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were [[Corliss engine|Corliss valves]] on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;George Watkins differed in the detail, proposing it was a 1500&amp;nbsp;hp engine with 21" and 44" cylinders on a 5&amp;nbsp;ft stroke, that was steamed at 170psi. The 24&amp;nbsp;ft flywheel drove 34 ropes. George Watkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mills driven by Urmson &amp; Thompson engines==
Urmson &amp; Thompson produced mill engines in the boom years of the 1870s, and millwrighted (i.e. produced the bevelled gear shafts) for mills such as Nile Mill, Chadderton. The period 1904–1914 was productive, when they created engines rating a total of 14,300 ihp for nine Oldham mills:&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;
*Parkfield Mill, Oldham – 1874
*Hollinwood Mill, Failsworth – 1874
*Honeywell Mill, Oldham – 1874
*Copster Mill&lt;!--where?--&gt; – 1904

He met his future wife, Espinosa Como Cuevas Trinidad at the río Yaqui, Sonora. In the fight against Madero in Chihuahua, he was injured at Malpaso.&lt;ref name=Robe/&gt;

After his return to the capital he held several public offices and was chief of staff of Gen. Manuel Gordillo. He was assigned as Military Attache, from October 1912 to February 1913, at the Legation of Mexico in [[Rome]]. He took voluntary discharge from the army and then joined the revolutionary movement of Francisco I, as he did not agree with the regime of Victoriano Huerta.&lt;ref name=Pair/&gt; Alessio Robles was Governor of the [[List of heads of government of the Mexican Federal District|Mexican Federal District]]&lt;ref name="Cumberland1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cumberland|first=Charles C.|title=Mexican Revolution: The Constitutionalist Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8YQd9hsne0C&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=1 January 1972|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75016-6|pages=189–}}&lt;/ref&gt; for one year from 1 January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shelf3d.com/i/List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20the%20Mexican%20Federal%20District|title= List of heads of government of the Mexican Federal District|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher= Shelf3d.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1920, he led a deputation by the Federal District V District and was a senator of Coahuila in 1922. As senator he was an exemplary parliamentarian in the same category as Belisario Dominguez.&lt;ref name=Part/&gt; As a journalist and parliamentarian, he was aggressive. During this time, he was assigned as Minister Plenipotentiary to [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Pair/&gt; After returning from Sweden, he was made the Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture and Development. On August 9, 1921, his brother, General Joseph Alessio Robles, was killed in Mexico City. Gen. Jacinto B. Trevino was accused the perpetrator of the crime; due to insufficient evidence he was released. This caused a permanent rift with his brother Miguel as Vito was accused for not bringing the culprit to justice.&lt;ref name=Pair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robe/&gt;

During his political career between 1927 and 1928, he contested for the post of Governor of [[Coahuila]] but lost the election. He was then sent to the [[United States]] where he worked in [[Austin]], [[Texas]]. Here, he undertook the study of historical documents at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. This assignment enabled him to gather enough material which helped him to launch his literary interests of writing books on history. When he returned to Mexico, he was made the professor of the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (Mexico)|National Preparatory School]] and the Faculty of Arts of the City of Mexico. He was also responsible during this period to found the [[Seminary of Mexican Culture]]; in the role of a founding member he traveled to many provinces on cultural missions.&lt;ref name=Part/&gt; He was elected member of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Historia]], in 1937. From 1947 to 1950, he was Professor of History of the [[Provincias Internas]] of [[New Spain]] in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters.&lt;ref name=Robe/&gt; He died in Mexico City on 11 June 1957 at Ciudad de México, District Federal, México at the age of 78 years.&lt;ref name=Gene/&gt; His daughter Angela inherited his vast library.&lt;ref name=Robe/&gt;

==Writings==
His journalist career started in 1927 in El Universal, the Democratic City newspaper. He published his first book "Bibliography of Coahuila" covering both history and Geography; this collection was edited by Genaro Estrada. As writer of history his other books included many other publications.&lt;ref name=Robe/&gt; His three volume work on the "History of Coahuila y Texas" is a monumental work which gives a comprehensive history of Texas.&lt;ref name="Camp2011"/&gt; The "eponymous" historian Alessio Robles's book collection is an important collection of 14,000 volumes (17th to 19th century) in the museum named "Centro Cultural Vito Alessio Robles" in Saltillo.&lt;ref name="NobleArmstrong2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Noble|author2=Kate Armstrong|author3=Ray Bartlett|author4=Greg Benchwick|title=Lonely Planet Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FCiI62YfUwC&amp;pg=PA392|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-804-9|pages=392–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his other notable books are Saltillo, en la Historia y en la Leyenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/13243946|title= Saltillo, en la Historia y en la Leyenda|author=Vito Alessio Robles|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher= Librarything.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coahuila y Texas, desde la consumación de la independencia hasta el tratado de paz de Guadalupe Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/13243946|title= Vito Alessio Robles|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher= Librarything.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Coahuila y Texas en la época colonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fug02|title= Ugarte, Jose Joaquin|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher= Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Maving Gardner''' (25 May 1914 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] –  28 December 2000)&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17421629.html | title = Coin designer | accessdate = 2010-08-02 | date = 2001-02-15 | publisher = ''[[The Press]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[England|English]] coin designer, engraver, calligrapher and writer who worked regularly for the [[Royal Mint]] over a 30-year period.&lt;ref name=coin/&gt; He is notable for designing coins such as the [[British 20 Pence Coin]] and some of the [[coins of Cyprus]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jordan]], [[Guyana]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref name=coin/&gt;

==Education==
After having studied [[calligraphy]] and letter design at the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute]] in his teens, Gardner enrolled at [[The Royal College of Art]], simultaneously studying (in his second and third years), at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] under George Friend, J. H. Mason, Barry Hart and [[Martin Travers]]. In 1939 his studies were finally rewarded with a diploma and The Travelling Scholarship from the Royal College of Art.

==Professional career==

Gardner was most well known for his designs for the reverses of the 1953 three penny piece, English and Scottish shillings and the decimal 20p reverse of 1982 still in use today. The artist engraved the coins himself.

He also designed the British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] Seal, the HM Greater and Lesser Signets as well as the seals of the [[British Medical Association]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Gardner was soon posted to the Army Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham, where he became involved in the training of 7,000 men of all ranks. Before D-Day he was regularly in the air to advise on camouflaging the build-up of forces. In November 1944 together with a colleague, he set up and ran a new camouflage training school at Scottish Command, Edinburgh.

For the next few years after demobilisation, he spent much of his time as a visiting lecturer in lettering, heraldic design and penmanship at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, The Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, and Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute (the latter until 1973).

During this period Rolls of Honour commissioned by King George VI for the Household Cavalry were inscribed. A considerable variety of commissions in coin design, heraldry and lettering were completed and in 1955 he became a fellow of the RSA, subsequently serving on the jury of its Industrial Design Bursary scheme.

He also reviewed books over a long period for the RSA Journal. He was an examiner for The City and Guilds of London Institute in craft subjects and the definitive Jersey stamp was designed in 1958 and the Tercentenary stained glass window for the [[Royal Society]] in 1960.

In 1963 Gardner was visiting professor and fine art program lecturer at [[Colorado State University]] and in the years immediately following he travelled widely to research art and crafts of the [[United States]], [[Polynesia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Nepal]].

A calligraphic volume for Eton College was completed in 1990.

William Gardner was a Fellow of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators and a Fellow of the Society of [[Numismatics|Numismatic Artists and Designers]].

[[File:Frans Masereel - 25 Images of a Man's Passion - final four plates.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=Four high-contrast black-and-white images in sequence.  In the first, a man, facing left with his right arm aloft, marches with a crowd towards a group of gun-wielding figures.  In the second, uniformed figures are taking the man away amongst a crowd.  In the third, the man is seen from behind at the bottom, with a group seated behind a bench in the distance near the top in an apparent courtroom.  A crucifix hangs prominently above the bench, bathed in light in the darkened room.  In the fourth, the man has his back to a wall, hands bound behind him, with another figure lying apparently dead at his feet.  He faces right, apparently awaiting his execution by gunfire.|Wordless novels flourished in Germany in the 1920s and typically were made using [[woodcut]] or similar techniques in an [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] style. ([[Frans Masereel]], ''[[25 Images of a Man's Passion]]'', 1918)]]

The '''wordless novel''' is a narrative genre that uses sequences of captionless pictures to tell a story.  As artists have often made such books using [[woodcut]] and other [[relief printing]] techniques, the terms '''woodcut novel''' or '''novel in woodcuts''' are also used.  The genre flourished primarily in the 1920s and 1930s and was most popular in Germany.

The wordless novel has its origin in the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] movement of the early 20th century.  The typically [[Socialism|socialist]] work drew inspiration from medieval woodcuts and used the awkward look of that medium to express [[angst]] and frustration at [[social injustice]].  The first such book was the Belgian [[Frans Masereel]]'s ''[[25 Images of a Man's Passion]]'', published in 1918.  The German [[Otto Nückel]] and other artists followed Masereel's example.  [[Lynd Ward]] brought the genre to the United States in 1929 when he produced {{not a typo|''[[Gods' Man]]''}}, which inspired other American wordless novels and a parody in 1930 by cartoonist [[Milt Gross]] with ''[[He Done Her Wrong]]''.  Following an early-1930s peak in production and popularity, the genre waned in the face of competition from [[sound film]]s and anti-socialist [[censorship in Nazi Germany]] and the US.

Following World War&amp;nbsp;II, new examples of wordless novels became increasingly rare, and early works went out of print.  Interest began to revive in the 1960s when the American comics [[fandom]] subculture came to see wordless novels as prototypical book-length comics.  In the 1970s, the example of the wordless novel inspired cartoonists such as [[Will Eisner]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] to create book-length non-genre comics—"[[graphic novel]]s".  Cartoonists such as [[Eric Drooker]] and [[Peter Kuper]] took direct inspiration from wordless novels to create wordless graphic novels.

==Characteristics==

[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white film still.  Three figures stand facing each other on a heavily stylized street set.|[[German Expressionism|Expressionist film]] and graphics inspired early wordless novels. (''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'', 1920)]]

Wordless novels use sequences of expressive images to tell a story.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=112}}  [[Socialism|Socialist]] themes of struggle against [[capitalism]] are common; scholar Perry Willett calls these themes "a unifying element of the genre's aesthetic".{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=114}}  In both formal and moral aspects, they draw from [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] graphics, [[Expressionism (theatre)|theatre]], and [[German Expressionism|film]].{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=126}}  Wordless novelists such as [[Frans Masereel]] appropriated the awkward aesthetic of mediaeval woodcuts to express their anguish and revolutionary political ideas{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=126}} and used simple, traditional iconography.  Text is restricted to title and chapter pages, except where text is a part of the scene, such as in signs.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=181}}

The storytelling tends to be melodramatic,{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=114}} and the stories tend to focus on struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces. The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil—the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the contempt of the artist's moral indignation.{{sfn|Willett|2005|pp=130–131}}

Most wordless novelists were not prolific; few besides Masereel and [[Lynd Ward]] produced more than a single book.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=131}}  The books were designed to be mass-produced for a popular audience, in contrast to similar but shorter portfolios by artists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], and [[Käthe Kollwitz]], which were produced in limited editions for collectors.  These portfolios of typically from eight to ten prints also were meant to be viewed in sequence.  Wordless novels were longer, had more complex narratives, and were printed in sizes and dimensions comparable to those of novels.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=128}}  A large influence was the most popular silent visual medium of the time: [[silent film]]s.  Panning, zooming, slapstick, and other filmic techniques are found in the books; Ward said that in creating a wordless novel, he first had to visualize it in his head as a silent film.{{sfn|Willett|2005|pp=128–129}}

[[File:Prelude to a Million Years, plate 29, by Lynd Ward.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an engraved piece of wood, on which is an image of a man kneeling.|Wordless novelists favoured [[relief printing]] such as in this [[wood engraving]] from [[Lynd Ward|Ward]]'s ''[[Prelude to a Million Years]]'' (1933).]]

Typically, wordless novels used [[relief printing]] techniques such as [[woodcut]]s, [[wood engraving]], [[metalcut]]s, or [[linocut]]s.  One of the oldest printing techniques, relief printing has its origins in 8th-century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century.  It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block; the areas not to be printed (the white areas) are cut away, leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints.{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=15}}  The monochrome prints were usually in black ink, and occasionally in a different colour such as [[sienna]] or orange.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=193}}  Relief printing is an inexpensive but labour-intensive printing technique; it was accessible to socially conscious artists who wanted to tell wordless stories of the working classes.{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=16}}

==History==

In 15th-century{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=175}} mediaeval Europe, woodcut [[block book]]s were printed as religious guides; particularly popular was the {{lang|la|[[Ars moriendi]]}}.  The early 16th century saw block books disappear in favour of books printed with the [[movable type]] of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s presses.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|pp=172–173, 175}}  Woodcut printing persisted into the 16th century under artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], and [[Jost Amman|Amman]],{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=175}} after which engraving techniques superseded woodcuts.  Pioneered by [[Thomas Bewick]], wood engraving enjoyed popularity beginning in the 18th century, until the method gave way by the 19th century to more advanced printing methods such as [[lithography]].{{sfn|Cohen|1977|pp=176–177}}

[[File:Biblia pauperum, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|alt=A monochromatic woodcut print of a page from a mediaeval book depicting a bible scene.|[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] woodcut artists expressed angst using the awkward look of mediaeval woodcuts such as this {{lang|la|[[Biblia pauperum]]}}.]]

[[Post-Impressionism|Post-impressionist]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]] revived woodcut printing in the late-19th century, favouring it for its [[Primitivism|primitivist]] effect.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=177}}  Early in the 20th century, woodcut artists such as Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945) and [[Max Klinger]] (1857–1920) published portfolios of woodcuts, thematically linked by themes of social injustice.{{sfn|Willett|2005|pp=127–128}}  Expressionist graphic artists such as [[Max Beckmann]] (1884–1950), Otto Dix (1891–1969), Kollwitz, and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]] (1884–1976) were inspired by an early-20th-century revival of interest in mediaeval graphic arts—in particular Biblical woodcut prints such as the {{lang|la|[[Biblia pauperum]]}}.  These artists used the awkward look of woodcut images to express feelings of anguish.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=126}}

===In Europe===

The wordless novel grew out of the Expressionist movement.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=111}}  The Belgian Frans Masereel (1889–1972) created the earliest example, ''[[25 Images of a Man's Passion]]'',{{efn|{{lang-fr|25 images de la passion d'un homme}} }} in 1918.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=112}}  It was a commercial success{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=17}} and was followed by ''[[Passionate Journey]]'',{{efn|{{lang-fr|Mon livre d'heures|links=no}}; the book was translated into English as ''My Book of Hours'' (1919),{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=114}} }} which at 167 images was Masereel's longest book.  It was also the most commercially successful,{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=114}} particularly in Germany, where copies of his books sold in the hundreds of thousands throughout the 1920s and had introductions by writers such as [[Max Brod]], [[Hermann Hesse]], and [[Thomas Mann]].  Masereel's books drew strongly on Expressionist theatre and film{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=112}} in their exaggerated but representational artwork with strong contrasts of black and white.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=180}}

Masereel's commercial success led other artists to try their hands at the genre;{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=116}} themes of oppression under capitalism were prominent, a pattern set early by Masereel.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=112}} At age thirteen, Polish-French artist [[Balthus]] drew a wordless story about his cat; it was published in 1921 with an introduction by poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rewald|1y=1984|1pp=12–13|2a1=Walker|2y=2007|2p=11}}  In ''[[Destiny (wordless novel)|Destiny]]'' (1926),{{efn|{{lang-de|Schicksal}}{{sfn|Smart|2011|pp=22–23}} }} [[Otto Nückel]] (1888–1955) produced a work with greater nuance and atmosphere than Masereel's bombastic works;{{sfn|Smart|2011|pp=22–23}} where Masereel told tales of Man's struggle against Society, Nückel told of the life of an individual woman.{{sfn|Bi|2009}}  ''Destiny'' appeared in a US edition in 1930{{sfn|Ward|Beronä|2005|p=v}} and sold well there.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=191}}

[[Clément Moreau]] (1903–1988) first tried his hand at the genre with the six-plate ''Youth Without Means''{{efn|{{lang-de|Erwerbslose Jugend|links=no}} }} in 1928.{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=23}}  [[István Szegedi-Szüts]] (1892–1959), a Hungarian immigrant to England, made a wordless book in brush and ink called ''My War'' (1931).

In 1926, the American Lynd Ward (1905–1985) moved to Leipzig to study graphic arts; while there, he discovered the works of Masereel and Otto Nückel.{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=20–21}}  He produced six such works of his own;{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=126}} he preferred to call them "pictorial narratives".{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=19–21}} The first, {{not a typo|''[[Gods' Man]]''}} (1929), was his most popular.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=126}}  Ward used wood engraving rather than woodcutting{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=19–21}} and varied image sizes from page to page.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=191}}  {{not a typo|''Gods' Man''}} sold 20,000 copies, and other American artists followed up on this success with their own wordless novels in the 1930s.{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=19–21}}

[[File:He Done Her Wrong - Gross does Ward.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black-and-white drawing of woman opening a window.|In ''[[He Done Her Wrong]]'' (1930), [[Milt Gross]] parodied [[Lynd Ward]]'s {{not a typo|''[[Gods' Man]]''}} (1929).]]

Cartoonist [[Milt Gross]]'s ''[[He Done Her Wrong]]'' (1930) was a parody of the genre; the book uses varying panel designs akin to those of comics: the action sometimes takes place outside the panel borders{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=21–22, 24}} and "dialogue balloons" show in images what the characters are saying.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=158}}  Cartoonist and illustrator [[William Gropper]]'s ''Alay-oop'' (1930) tells of three entertainers' disappointed dreams.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=136}}  In ''Abraham Lincoln: Biography in Woodcuts'' (1933) Charles Turzak documented [[Abraham Lincoln|the American president]].{{sfn|Ward|Beronä|2005|p=vi}}  Animator [[Myron Waldman]] (1908–2006) wrote a wordless tale of a plump young woman looking for a glamorous husband.  The book, ''Eve'' (1943), also uses "picture balloons" as ''He Done Her Wrong'' does.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=170}}

Inspired by mediaeval religious block books and working in an [[Art Deco]] style, American illustrator James Reid (1907–1989) produced one wordless novel, ''The Life of Christ'' (1930);{{sfn|Walker|2007|pp=25, 27}} due to the book's religious content, the [[Soviet Union]] barred its importation under its [[Religion in the Soviet Union|policies on religion]].{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=17}}

In 1938, Italian-American [[Giacomo Patri]] (1898–1978) produced his only wordless novel, the linocut ''White Collar''.  It chronicles the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash and was intended to motivate [[white-collar worker]]s to unionize.{{sfn|Walker|2007|pp=25, 27}}  It also deals with controversial topics such as abortion, accessibility of health care for the poor, and loss of Christian faith.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=177}}  From 1948 to 1951, Canadian [[Laurence Hyde (artist)|Laurence Hyde]] (1914–1987) produced his single wordless novel, the woodcut ''[[Southern Cross (wordless novel)|Southern Cross]]'', in response to the American [[Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll|atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll]].{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=31}}  The work tells of an American evacuation of an island for nuclear tests, where one family is left behind.{{sfn|Cohen|1977|p=195}}  Polish-American [[Si Lewen]]'s (1918–&amp;nbsp;) first book, ''The Parade: A Story in 55 Drawings'' (1957), won praise from [[Albert Einstein]] for its anti-war message.{{sfnm|1a1=Beronä|1y=1999|1pp=2–3|2a1=Walker|2y=2007|2p=10}}  Canadian George Kuthan's ''Aphrodite's Cup'' (1964) is an erotic book drawn in an ancient Greek style.{{sfn|Beronä|1999|pp=2–3}}  In the early 21st century, Canadian [[George Walker (printmaker)|George Walker]] made wordless woodcut novels, beginning with ''Book of Hours'' (2010), about the lives of those in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] complex just before the [[September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Smart|2011|p=55}}

===Decline===

The popularity of wordless novels peaked around 1929 to 1931, when "[[Sound film|talkies]]" were introduced and began to supersede silent films.{{sfn|Willett|2005|pp=129–130}}  In the 1930s the Nazis in Germany suppressed and detained many printmakers and banned Masereel's works{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=17}} as "[[degenerate art]]".{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=21}}  Following World War&amp;nbsp;II, US censors suppressed books with socialist views, including the works of Lynd Ward, on whom the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept files over his socialist sympathies; this censorship has made early editions of wordless novels scarce collectors' items in the US.{{sfn|Walker|2007|p=17}}

By the 1940s, most artists had given up on the genre.  The most devoted practitioners, Masereel and Ward, moved on to other work for which they became better known; Masereel's obituary did not even mention his wordless novels.{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=131}}  Many wordless novels remained out of print until the rise of the graphic novel revived interest amongst readers and publishers in the early 21st century.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=225}}

There have been sporadic examples of textless comics throughout the medium's history.

Cartoonist [[Will Eisner]] (1917–2005) first came upon the work of Lynd Ward in 1938.  Eisner was an early pioneer in the [[American comic book]] industry and saw in Ward's work a greater potential for comics.  Eisner's ambitions were rebuffed by his peers, who saw comics as no more than low-status entertainment.  Eisner withdrew from the commercial comics industry in the early 1950s to do government and educational work.  He returned in the 1970s when the atmosphere had changed and his readers and peers seemed more receptive to his ambitions.  In 1978, he began a career of creating book-length comics, the first of which was ''[[A Contract with God]]''; the book was marketed as a "graphic novel", a term that became standard towards the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kaplan|2010|p=153}}  Eisner called Ward "perhaps the most provocative graphic storyteller"{{sfn|Chute|2012|p=410}} of the 20th century.  He wrote that Ward's ''[[Vertigo (wordless novel)|Vertigo]]'' (1937) required considerable investment from readers in order to fill in the story between images.{{sfn|Chute|2012|p=410}}

Interest in the wordless novel revived with the rise of the graphic novel.{{sfn|Beronä|2001|p=20}}  Comics fans discussed the works of Masereel and others in fanzines, and the discussions turned to talk of the [[Great American Novel]] being made in comics.  These discussions inspired cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]] (b.&amp;nbsp;1948),{{sfn|Kaplan|2010|p=171}} who in 1973 made a four-page strip, "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", in an Expressionist style inspired by Ward's work.  Spiegelman later incorporated the strip into his graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Witek|2004|p=100}}

While graphic novels generally use captions and dialogue,{{sfn|Willett|2005|p=131}} cartoonists such as [[Eric Drooker]], [[Peter Kuper]], {{illm|Thomas Ott|fr}}, [[Brian Ralph]], [[Masashi Tanaka]], [[Lewis Trondheim]], and Billy Simms have made wordless graphic novels.{{sfn|Beronä|2001|p=20}}  As Gross did in ''He Done Her Wrong'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Hendrik Dorgathen|de}}'s wordless ''oeuvre'' uses textless [[Speech balloon|word balloons]] containing symbols, icons, and other images.{{sfn|Beronä|2001|pp=27–28}}  The influence of the wordless novel is prominent in Drooker's ''Flood'' (1992) and Kuper's ''The System'' (1997), both metaphorical stories that focus on social themes.{{sfn|Beronä|2008|p=225}}  Since 2011, the [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] and the [[Pennsylvania Center for the Book]] have awarded the annual Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel, a cash prize established by Ward's daughters to highlight their father's influence on the development of the graphic novel.{{sfn|Reid|2014}}

'''Yvonne Dold-Samplonius''' (20 May 1937 – 16 June 2014) was a Dutch [[mathematician]] and [[History of mathematics|historian]] who specialized in the history of Islamic mathematics during the Middle age. She was particularly interested in the mathematical methods used by Islamic architects and builders of the Middle Ages for measurements of volumes and measurements of religious buildings or in the design of [[muqarnas]].

'''Łukasz Konarzewski''', born September 22, 1955 in [[Istebna]], is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[history of art|historian of art]], [[conservator-restorer|art restorer]], a civil servant of both central and local governmental [[Public administration|administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial biographical notes in, among others: “Cieszyn no longer historic”, ''Architektura-Murator'', no 3 (150) March 2007, p. 22 {{ISSN|1232-6372}} - the main periodical devoted to architecture in Poland and abroad; “Impact of public administration on the space quality on the example of conservation effort in the 1990s in Cieszyn”, ''Ochrona Zabytków'', no 2 (269) LXIX, December 2016, p. 51 {{ISSN|0029-8247}}– a leading Polish scientific periodical dealing with matters concerning conservation of monuments&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

He comes from the Konarzewski family of artists, residing in Istebna, who have been professionally active in Silesia since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzewska M., Ludwik Konarzewski (senior) [in:] ''A dictionary  of Polish and foreign artists in Poland (before 1966) '', edited by Jolanta Maurin-Białostocka and Janusz Derwojed et al., vol. 4.- Wrocław, 1986, p.79 {{ISBN|83-04-01983-3}},&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Ludwik Konarzewski-junior]] and Joanna Konarzewska. He studied in the Department of History of Art at [[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw|Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University of Warsaw]] (Warsaw Theological Academy at that time). In 1984 he defended his final M.A. thesis, under the supervision of the [[Janusz Pasierb|rev. prof. Janusz Pasierb]] and the assistant-professor Andrzej Olszewski, which dealt with Polish art of the first half of the 20th century.

In his public activity he deals with resources, culture management,  popularizing culture, conservation, and also the shaping of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others: ''Conservation Guidelines in the form of project concepts concerning The Market Square and The Town Hall Square in Niepołomice near Kraków'' – 1994-1995 (accessible in the archives of the Municipal Council in Niepołomice); ''Conservation Guidelines concerning the Clothmakers’ House in Bielsko-Biala'' – 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1991-1999 he was a Municipal Restorer in [[Cieszyn]]. Thanks to his creation and application of a conservation method, which was precursory at that time and which enabled the linking of activities of various fields, such as conservation, sociology and social studies as well as planning, it was possible to  recover and retain the historic and original character of Cieszyn, which also visibly influenced the quality of the public space. Thanks to this the town became an example to follow in the region, as well as beyond it, when it comes to new solutions in art conservation and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;“Impact of public administration on the space quality on the example of conservation effort in the 1990s in Cieszyn”, ''Ochrona Zabytków'', no 2 (269) LXIX, December 2016, p. 51 {{ISSN|0029-8247}}; Archival conservation documentation, in the hands of The Office for Spatial Planning at the Department of Strategy and Town Development in The Municipal Council in Cieszyn&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of scientific research, he is one of the discoverers of part of the mediaeval fortifications on Castle Hill in Cieszyn, including, especially, the cylindrical tower, the so-called Tower of Ultimate Defence from the 13th century. The discovery contributes significantly to the development of research into the history of architecture in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kuś, “Provisional report on archaeological research on the medieval cylindrical tower discovered on Castle Hill in Cieszyn”, ''Pamiętnik cieszyński'' vol. 11, Cieszyn 1996, pages 7-13 {{ISSN|0137-558X}} – a Polish scientific periodical concerning research in the field of history; see also: W. Kuś,” Archaeological research on the medieval cylindrical tower discovered on Castle Hill in Cieszyn”, [in:] Tomczak E. (editor), “Archaeological research in Upper Silesia and borderland in 1994”, Katowice 1997, pages 164-170 and “The outcome of the archaeological research on the medieval cylindrical tower  conducted on Castle Hill in Cieszyn in 1999”, Cieszyn 1999, (typescript in the archives of the Municipal Restorer in Cieszyn)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also conducts research on the [[methodology]] of preservation and protection of monuments&lt;ref&gt;See, among others: “Impact of public administration on the space…” op. cit.; “Cieszyn no longer historic” op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the influence of activities carried out by the civil service on the shaping of the [[cultural landscape|cultural environment and landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;See - ''Cultural landscape of Poland just before entering The European Union : the methods of its preservation and shaping, on the basis of activity of the civil service in Cieszyn. '' [in:] Social and economic determinants of the development of culture (Materials from the II all-Poland Congress of Culture "Culture-Economy-Media, Social and economic determinants of the development of culture") – Narodowe Centrum Kultury (National Centre of Culture, Cracow – Warsaw, 2003) {{ISBN|9788391805237}}, 8391805239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 90’s of the 20th century he has been working on identification, description, management, promotion&lt;ref&gt;''Vademecum of contemporary creators of culture and artistic groups in Cieszyn County'' – in external links&lt;/ref&gt; and protection of culture and the [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;''The County programme for protection of monuments in Cieszyn county'' – in external links&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cieszyn Silesia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bip.powiat.cieszyn.pl/contents/content/128/706 Public Information Bulletin of Cieszyn District Office]&lt;/ref&gt; which is situated on the border  between [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. He is the author of a few hundred studies and publications in the fields of  art and culture of the 19th and the 20th centuries in the [[Upper Silesia]]. They concern particularly the protection of the cultural heritage, methodology and guidelines, history and resources of culture and art, as well as artistic biographies and bibliography of the history of art in Cieszyn Silesia.
 
He was the initiator and the academic editor of the first monograph on Cieszyn Silesia with respect to the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;'' “Culture and art of Cieszyn Silesia throughout centuries” '' in the series of '' “The History of Cieszyn Silesia from the dawn of time to contemporary times” '' – a series edited by Idzi Panic {{ISBN|978-83-944146-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also the author of ''“The County programme for the protection of monuments…”'' for Cieszyn county (which was one of the first programs of this kind in Poland)  and ''Vademecum of contemporary creators of culture and artistic groups'' in Cieszyn county. He was one of the originators of the idea to create the rev. Leopold Jan Szersznik Award, which is the highest distinction and promotion for people and institutions that create, propagate and protect the cultural heritage on the Polish side of Cieszyn Silesia, as well as [[Zaolzie]] (its western part that lies in the Czech Republic). Since 2015 he has been the chairman of the committee that grants  the award.
