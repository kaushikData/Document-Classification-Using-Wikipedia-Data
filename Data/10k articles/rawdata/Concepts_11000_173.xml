{{Elections in California}}

'''Proposition 58''' is a [[California ballot proposition]] that passed on the November 8, 2016 ballot. Proposition 58 repealed bilingual education restrictions enacted by [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] in 1998.

Proposition 58 passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ulloa |first=Jazmine |title=California will bring back bilingual education as Proposition 58 cruises to victory |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-58-bilingual-1478220414-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It preserves the requirement that public schools ensure students obtain an English language proficiency, require school districts to solicit parent/community input in developing language acquisition programs, require instruction to ensure English acquisition as rapidly and effectively as possible, and authorize school districts to establish dual–language immersion programs for both native and non–native English speakers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 58. California General Election November 8, 2016. Official Voter Information Guide.|url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/58/|website=California Secretary of State|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passage of Proposition 227 in 1998, students were required to be taught in an English-only environment, where the student was taught English by a teacher who only speaks English. Proposition 227 also required limited English proficient students who were in separate classes to be put into regular classes, ended bilingual programs, and required students to be taught in an English-only environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_(1998)|title=California Proposition 227, the "English in Public Schools" Initiative (1998)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Proposition 58, the public school systems will have the right to choose the way they see as appropriate for their students to learn English more swiftly. Students will now have the option to be taught in an English-only environment, or a bilingual environment, where a person of the student's native language teaches them English. This also allows English speaking students to learn in another language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A California Department of Education spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers under Proposition 58. The number of bilingual credentials had fallen after Proposition 227's passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renee |first=Alexa |title=Prop 58: Higher demand for bilingual teachers not helping teacher shortage |work=ABC 10 |location=Sacramento |date=November 9, 2016 |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/california/prop-58-higher-demand-for-bilingual-teachers-not-helping-teacher-shortage/350584412 |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Alexander George McAdie''' (August 4, 1863 &amp;ndash; November 1, 1943) was an [[United States|American]] [[meteorologist]].

While in college he joined the ''Army Signal Service'', the predecessor of the [[U.S. Weather Bureau]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1885.

From 1903 until 1913 he ran the U.S. Weather Bureau in [[San Francisco]]. He was also the vice president of the [[Sierra Club]], starting in 1904, and continuing until 1913. In 1913 he became Professor of meteorology at Harvard, and remained there until 1931. During the same period he also served as the director of the ''[[Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory|Blue Hill Observatory]]''.

Among his accomplishments was the invention of a device to prevent frost from harming fruit. He was a pioneer in the use of kites to study conditions at high altitudes. In 1885 at Blue Hill, [[Boston]], he modernized the experiments of [[Benjamin Franklin]] by attaching a voltmeter to a kite and measuring the voltage difference between the ground and several hundred feet up. He also made studies of the atmospheric effects of smoke, the connection between the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and electricity in the atmosphere, and the dangers posed by lightning.  He is the author of a [[cloud atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Alexander McAdie
|title=A cloud atlas
|publisher=Rand, McNally &amp; company
|year=1923
|pages=57
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also known for testifying about the potential effects of electrocution (based on his experience with lightning) in 1899 at the first trial to decide if the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment.  His testimony was used against the use of the electric chair for the death penalty.

In addition to his work with the weather bureau, McAdie [http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/1906/06nsfmart.htm#16 wrote a detailed account] of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v153/n3886/abs/153488b0.html compiled a catalog] of earthquakes on the Pacific coast.

He was married to Mary Randolph Brown McAdie.

==Awards and honors==
* [[Mount McAdie]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range was named after him.
* The crater [[McAdie (crater)|McAdie]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.
* The Fleet Weather Center building in Norfolk, VA is named after him.

[[Piracicaba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Brazil.]]

'''Alternative fuels''', known as non-conventional and  advanced [[fuel]]s, are any materials or [[Chemical substance|substances]] that can be used as [[fuel]]s, other than conventional fuels like; ''[[fossil fuel]]s'' ([[petroleum]] (oil), [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]), as well as nuclear materials such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], as well as artificial [[radioisotope]] fuels that are made in [[nuclear reactors]].

Some well-known alternative [[fuel]]s include [[biodiesel]], [[bioalcohol]] ([[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[n-Butanol|butanol]]), [[refuse-derived fuel]], chemically stored [[electricity]] (batteries and [[fuel cell]]s), [[hydrogen]], non-fossil [[methane]], non-fossil [[natural gas]], [[Vegetable oil fuel|vegetable oil]], [[propane]] and other [[biomass]] sources.

==Background==
The main purpose of fuel is to store energy, which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use.

Almost all fuels are chemical fuels. The user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work, such as powering an engine. It may also be used to generate electricity, which is then used for heating, lighting, or other purpose.

==Biofuel==
{{Main|Biofuel}}

[[File:Biofuel pumps DCA 07 2010 9834.JPG|thumb|Alternative fuel dispensers at a regular gasoline station in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. [[B20 (biodiesel)|B20]] [[biodiesel]] at the left and [[E85]] [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] at the right.]]
Biofuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels.
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage.

===Biomass===
{{Main|Biomass}}
Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead [[biotic material|biological material]] which can be used as fuel or for industrial production.
It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass.[2] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel.

===Algae-based fuels===
{{Main|Algae fuel}}

Algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/ |title= Is Algae Based Biofuel a Great Green Investment Opportunity |publisher=Green World Investor |date= 2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100617064204/http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/| archivedate= 17 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMIX/2010oct00223.html |title= Navy demonstrates alternative fuel in riverine vessel |publisher=Marine Log |date= 2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/technology/blog/science-scope/can-algae-based-plastics-reduce-our-plastic-footprint/1605/ |title= Can algae-based plastics reduce our plastic footprint? |publisher=Smart Planet |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiesel===

[[Biodiesel]] is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life{{Clarify|date=October 2013}} from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=21|date=2008|publisher=ABDO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol fuels==
{{Main|Alcohol fuel|Butanol fuel|Ethanol fuel|Methanol fuel}}

Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy.  These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels. Butanol has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks, instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Ammonia ==
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.agmrc.org/renewable_energy/renewable_energy/ammonia-as-a-transportation-fuel/ | title = Ammonia as a transportation fuel | author = Don Hofstrand | publisher = AgMRC Renewable Energy Newsletter | date = May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nh3fuelassociation.org/about/ | title = NH3 Fuel Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits of ammonia include no need for oil, zero emissions, low cost, and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Carbon-neutral and negative fuels ==

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered{{By whom|date=October 2013}} the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative.

Hydrogen is an emissionless fuel. The byproduct of hydrogen burning is water, although some mono-nitrogen oxides [[NOx]] are produced when hydrogen is burned with air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf |title=Module 3: Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines |author=College of the Desert |publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) |date=December 2001 |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905043908/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/politicalconsiderations/a/altfuelcost.htm |first=Christine |last=Gable|first2=Scott |last2=Gable |title=Fuel or Fool?|publisher= about.com |accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid nitrogen==
[[Liquid nitrogen vehicle|Liquid nitrogen]] is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Compressed air==
The [[Pneumatic motor|air engine]] is an emission-free piston engine using [[compressed air]] as fuel. Unlike hydrogen, compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel, making it an economically attractive alternative fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Propane autogas==
{{Main|Autogas}}
[[Propane]] is a cleaner burning, high performance fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family.

Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall. Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/Search_and_Explore/Technologies_and_Fuel_Types/Propane.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/propane.html&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an "intercooler" effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214141910/http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |archivedate=2014-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion.

Propane lacks additives, detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil.

Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market.

Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly {{convert|5|bar|psi|abbr=on}} of pressure. Fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment. Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to [[compressed natural gas]] which is usually kept at over {{convert|3000|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.

In a vehicle format, propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles.

==Natural gas vehicles==
[[Compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG) are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid [[automobile]] fuels.

=== Compressed natural gas fuel types ===
Compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non-renewable CNG.&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W. Axhausen, Gian Carle, and Alexander Wokaun. 2007 10–22"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frick |first=Martin |first2=Kay W. |last2=Axhausen |first3=Gian |last3=Carle |first4=Alexander |last4=Wokaun |title=Optimization of the distribution of compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations: Swiss case studies|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |date=2007 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=10–22|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920906000691 |doi=10.1016/j.trd.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional CNG is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today.  New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources,  appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |title=Study of Opportunities for natural gas in the transportation sector |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |author=Marbek |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411134857/http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane‐based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel.  Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills,  sewage,  and animal/agri‐waste.  Based on the process type,  biogas can be divided into the following:  biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, [[landfill gas]] collected from landfills,  treated to remove trace contaminants, and synthetic natural gas (SNG).&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W.

=== Environmental analysis ===
Because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted, cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goyal |first=P |title=Present scenario of air quality in Delhi: a case study of CNG implementation |journal=Atmospheric Environment |date=2003 |url=http://eprint.iitd.ac.in:8080/bitstream/2074/1487/1/goyalpre2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2003.09.005 |volume=37 |pages=5423–5431 |bibcode=2003AtmEn..37.5423G }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tailpipe {{CO2}} can be reduced by 15–25% compared to gasoline, diesel.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236105003303 |title=An experimental investigation of CNG as an alternative fuel for a retrofitted gasoline vehicle |journal=Fuel |first=M.U. |last=Aslam |first2=H.H. |last2=Masjuki |first3=M.A. |last3=Kalam |first4=H. |last4=Abdesselam |first5=T.M.I. |last5=Mahlia |first6=M.A. |last6=Amalina  |volume=85 |issue=5–6 |date=March–April 2006 |pages=717–724 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2005.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty, light duty and refuse truck segments.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

'''Similarities to hydrogen '''
Natural gas, like hydrogen, is another fuel that burns cleanly; cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines. Also, none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted.

==Nuclear power and radiothermal generators==
{{Main|Nuclear power|radiothermal generator}}

=== Nuclear reactors ===
Nuclear power is any [[nuclear technology]] designed to extract usable energy from [[atomic nuclei]] via controlled [[nuclear reactions]]. The only controlled method now practical uses [[nuclear fission]] in a [[fissile]] fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent [[radioactive decay]]). Use of the nuclear reaction [[nuclear fusion]] for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research.

Nuclear power is usually used by using a [[nuclear reactor]] to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.

In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for [[nuclear propulsion|propulsion]] in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]], are built to minimize moving parts, and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from [[nuclear fission]] has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in [[RORSAT]] military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the [[SNAP-10A]] mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988.

===Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors===

[[Thorium-based nuclear power]] reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at [[NASA]] Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, “After studying [[climate change]] for over four decades, it’s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace [[fossil fuels]]. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/about/endorsements/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorium]] is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than [[uranium]], and its ore, [[monazite]], is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Atomic Energy Agency|title=Thorium fuel cycle — Potential benefits and challenges|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhasz|first1=Albert J.|last2=Rarick|first2=Richard A.|last3=Rangarajan|first3=Rajmohan|title=High Efficiency Nuclear Power Plants Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Technology|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090038711.pdf|website=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces [[radioactive waste]] for [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] like [[technetium-99]] (half-life over 200,000 years),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/thorium2009factsheet.pdf Thorium fuel No panacea for nuclear power]&lt;/ref&gt; and has a longer fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"/&gt;

For a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors, see [[thorium fuel cycle#List of thorium fueled reactors]].

=== Radiothermal generators ===
In addition, [[radioisotope]]s have been used as alternative fuels, on both land and in space. Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. [[Radiothermal generator]]s (RTGs) which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has (in turn) been produced on Earth as a concentrated power source (fuel) using energy from an Earth-based [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space4peace.org/ianus/npsm2.htm |title=Nuclear Powered Space Missions - Past and Future |first=Regina |last=Hagen |publisher=Space4peace.org |date=1998-08-11 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grief]] is “a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed”. A common emotion amongst [[human]]s, grief is also apparent in [[animal]]s, known as '''animal grief'''. In the late 19th century, research started to show grief in [[chimpanzee]]s and the connection between animal and human grief. However, until recently, grief has never been the focus of [[research]]. [[Marc Bekoff]], a scientist, has spent his time researching emotions in animals, including grief. Combined with other research, the following animals have been seen to grieve: [[Gray wolf|wolves]], chimpanzees, [[magpie]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[otter]]s, [[Goose|geese]], [[sea lion]]s, and many more.

Grief can be caused by many things and one of the things to understand is animal pain and emotions.

== What is Animal Pain? ==
Bernard E. Rollin says that the ability to experience '''pain''' is something we have to feel to be considered moral (Rollin, 2010). It can result from something such as a wound or abuse causing physical pain. Animals can also experience pain mentally, such as experiencing grief as well as sadness due to anxiety. Animal pain can be understood once we understand the nature of a certain animal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=41486940|title=Animal Pain: What It is and Why It Matters|journal=The Journal of Ethics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=425–437|last1=Rollin|first1=Bernard E|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when somebody is caring for a dog as a pet the individual understands their actions, their traits and emotions. While taking care of an animal we are then able to understand that specific animal and their way of grieving or their happiness per se.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The difference in pain from humans and animals is how one is willing to bear pain for a better lifestyle. Rollin mentions an example of extending life. This example states that the owner may think pain will be a small price to pay for the life of their pet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since an animal cannot express their pain or how much something may hurt these emotions or decisions are hard to conclude. Pain felt can sometimes be unbearable to the point where humans have the decision or thought to choose death over the continuation of that pain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Animal Emotions ==
A question that is asked is if animals have any emotions? Marc Bekoff defines emotion as something that helps behavioral control and management (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; It is known that humans have emotions and that it is something fundamental and important in our lives, however it is hard to say if that is true for animals or just some. There are different ways you can tell the emotion of animal: how they’re acting or how they’re looking at someone or something.

=== Primary Emotions and Secondary Emotions ===
There are different “categories” of emotions known as primary and secondary emotions. Bekoff explains that primary emotions are similar to reflex or something along the lines of fear or fight-or-flight response. Therefore, it is something that animals react to such as loud noises, unknown objects, or odors (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; Having primary emotions is crucial because reactions to these are important for an animal's survival. The part of the brain that is responsible for primary emotions is the limbic system (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt;

Secondary emotions are part of an experience. These emotions are taking part in the central cortex of the brain because of the requirement of different and higher brain centers. With secondary emotions it allows one (in this case the animals that do feel grief) to create the connection between feelings and actions.

==Early Research on Animal Grief==
In 1879, Arthur E. Brown studied how a male chimpanzee reacted after the death of his female counterpart. He saw the male chimpanzee display grief and "a cry which the keeper of the animals assures [Brown] he had never heard before").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Arthur E. |title=Grief in the Chimpanzee |journal=The American Naturalist |date=1879 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=173–175 |jstor=2448772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to the next day, the chimpanzee sulked and barely moved. Brown deciphered that the male chimpanzee was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after the female chimpanzee died. However, Brown concluded that any permanent grief is only found in man, as the chimpanzee seemed fine after a couple of days.

[[William Emerson Ritter|William E. Ritter]] (1925) connects animal and human [[emotion]] to provide evidence of [[Human evolution|human descent]] from the animal kingdom. He mentions the [[James–Lange theory|James-Lange theory]], where "all emotional stages as of joy, grief, fear, anger, jealousy, love, are associated with more or less characteristic bodily manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=William E. |title=The Emotions in Man and Animals |journal=The Scientific Monthly |date=1925 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–138 |jstor=7499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter proposes new evidence to the theory, mentioning that no item on the above list is exclusive to humans, and most are common to the animal world. He argues that because the connection between human emotion and [[Emotion in animals|animal emotion]] is so strong, humans have descended from the animal kingdom.

==Marc Bekoff's Recent Research on Animal Grief==
Marc Bekoff is a professor of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado-Boulder]]. He has spent his life studying animals and their emotions, finding that animals grieve quite frequently. Such examples of grieving animals are:
*Bekoff found that '''sea lion''' mothers squeal eerily when they watch their babies be eaten by [[killer whale]]s.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/10/861/233998|title=Animal Emotions: Exploring Passionate Natures {{!}} BioScience {{!}} Oxford Academic|website=academic.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Even after their calves have died, '''dolphin''' mothers have been seen to save them and grieve when they confirm the death.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
*'''Elephants''' have been "observed to stand guard over a stillborn baby for days with their head and ears hanging down". Orphan elephants, who have watched their mothers be killed, have been shown to wake up screaming.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
* A '''wolf''' "sniffed [her dead companion], then sat back and gave the most soulful and heart-wrenching howl I've ever heard!"; After a pack member died, the wolves let their tails and heads hang low while walking slowly.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Emotional_Lives_of_Animals.html?id=TIW2D7eR_Y8C|title=The Emotional Lives of Animals: A Leading Scientist Explores Animal Joy, Sorrow, and Empathy--and why They Matter|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2010|publisher=New World Library|isbn=9781577313489|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chimpanzee''' orphans can die while in the state of grieving.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010/&gt; [[Jane Goodall]] (1990) followed [[Flint (chimpanzee)|Flint]], a chimpanzee, for a few days after the death of Flint's friend Flo. She noted that Flint "walked along one of the branches, then stopped and stood motionless, staring down at an empty nest". Flint had been lethargic, even refusing food. Per Goodall, Flint was "hollow-eyed, gaunt and utterly depressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Through_A_Window.html?id=Gc59YpamCvgC|title=Through a Window: 30 years observing the Gombe chimpanzees|last=Goodall|first=Jane|date=2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=9780297865360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Magpies''' have been seen to mourn over their dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458609000541|title=Animal emotions, wild justice and why they matter: Grieving magpies, a pissy baboon, and empathic elephants - ScienceDirect|website=sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*After a fellow goose died, [[Konrad Lorenz]] noted that other '''geese''' had their "eyes sink deep into their sockets, and the individual ha[d] an overall drooping experience, literally letting the head hang".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Minding_Animals.html?id=Or4TDAAAQBAJ|title=Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions, and Heart|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195150773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; The previous example shows that animals can express their grief and it is possible for an individual to identify that. Bekoff mentions an experience of a bird that lost its partner. It showed many signs of depression before it ended up passing away in a vegetative state similar to the one his partner ended up dying in (Bekoff, 2010). Many animals can show grief when they have lost a loved one of their own.

== How Long Do Animals Feel Grief? ==
One of the questions that can be asked aside from does animals grief is how long do they grieve for or if these animals show signs of mourning. Anthropologist Barbra J King mentions how animals might sleep less or change their ways in their daily life styles. These animals might also end up staying close to their companion's corpse for a long time as well (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/nature/animal-grief/|title=The Depths of Animal Grief — NOVA Next {{!}} PBS|date=2015-07-08|work=NOVA Next|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something we know is that emotions in a human can change one day they can be sad and the other happy. Actions are taken days after one of our loved ones die such as time of school, work or any social interaction (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is actually the same for animals. An example that can be shown is in chimpanzees.

A case is shown with one names Amos. The day before he died he spent the day in his nest and did not move until a female chimpanzee Daisy went up to him (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Amos died, one of the chimpanzees who was more sociable than the rest as well as a “higher rank” than the rest did not want to be with the group for weeks. As shown here it also depends on who passed away on how long an animal can grieve. Though through the time spent mourning many signs can appear of an animals grief and agony of the loss of their companion.

Another example mentioned is the dog Hachiko from Tokyo. In this case the dog was no grieving due to the death of an animal, but of the loss of its owner. It is known that this dog went to the station where his owner would come home to every day for around ten years.

==Other Research on Animal Grief==
Though Bekoff is the face of recent research on animal grief, other scientists are starting to look more into it. Some studies have looked at depression in animals, with Paul Willner finding that there are eighteen [[animal models of depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00427414|title=The validity of animal models of depression|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF00427414|pmid=6429692|year=1984|last1=Willner|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Fashing &amp; Nga Nguyen (2012) found that a group of chimpanzees groomed and caressed a grieving, older chimpanzee. They also found that "the dying female [elephant] was approached by the matriarch of another group who repeatedly attempted to bring her to her feet using her tusks". Even otters grieve, where members of a group caught fish for months and brought them to the matriarch who had failing vision and poor mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.fullerton.edu/_resources/pdf/nga/FashingandNguyen2011.pdf|title=Behavior toward the dying, diseased, or disabled among animals and its relevance to paleopathology|website=anthro.fullerton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of Research==
Though grief in animals may seem questionable, evidence shows it is abundant. From chimpanzees to otters to sea lions, animals grieve just like humans do. Researchers like Bekoff, Fashing, Nguyen, and others, are studying every day to help better understand how and why animals grieve. With increased knowledge, humans can have better relationships with animals. For example, zoo caretakers can study chimpanzee grief habits and better notice when a chimpanzee mother is mourning. The caretakers can then help the mother cope and live a healthy and successful life. Research shows grief in animals, and understanding that can help humans form closer, healthier connections with them.

The '''Association for Behavior Analysis International''' ('''ABAI''') is a nonprofit organization dedicated to contributing to the well being of society by developing, enhancing, and supporting the growth of the science of [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]] through research, education, and practice. ABAI has over 7,000 members. It is committed to promoting the experimental, theoretical, and applied analysis of behavior.

==History==

The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(1978) ''The Behavior Analyst, 1''(1)&lt;/ref&gt; MABA was organized to establish a separate identity for the behavior analysis group of the larger psychological community and to provide a forum for the discussion of issues and the dissemination of information pertinent to the interests of its membership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events.&lt;ref name= "Trends In Presentations"&gt;Kangas, B.D. &amp; Vaidya, M. (2007). Trends in presentations at the annual conference of the association for behavior analysis. Behavioral Analysis, 30, 2, 117-131&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the members included [[Sidney Bijou]], James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) ''The Behavior Analyst, 2''(2)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added "International" to its name.&lt;ref name= "The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science"&gt;Craighead, W.E. &amp; Nemeroff, C.B. (2004). Association for Behavior Analysis. In The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science. (3rd ed., pp. 87-88) Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Today ABAI has more than 7,000 active members worldwide.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership"&gt;http://www.abainternational.org/membership.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One can obtain an ABAI membership if they want to further education, practice, and research goals in [[behavior analysis]].

==Membership==

ABAI offers different membership levels. A full membership is available for those who have a master's degree in experiential or applied behavior analysis or have contributed to the field of behavior analysis. An affiliate membership is feasible for those with undergraduate degrees, have an interest in behavior analysis, and do not meet the criteria for a full membership. A student membership is offered to anyone who is a full-time undergraduate or graduate student, resident, or intern.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership" /&gt;

==Impact==

ABAI is the leading advocate in the United States for advances in behavior analysis and behavioral psychology in applied settings. The association provides support to the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that grants funding for continuing research. ABAI is a member of the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences (FABBS)—a group of scientific organizations that are interested in advancing science in areas of the brain, mind, and behavior.

ABAI organizes an annual convention dedicated to the advancements in the science of behavior analysis. More than 5,100 behavior analysts come to participate in workshops, poster sessions, “round-table” discussions, symposia, and listen to speakers. In 2017, ABAI will be hosting their 43rd Annual Convention in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Convention" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/annual-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Past host cities for the convention have included Chicago, San Antonio, Seattle, and other. Every two years, ABAI hosts an international conference; the last one took place in 2017 in Paris, France.&lt;ref name= "ABAI International Conference" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/international-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ABAI international conference has also been held in Japan, Spain, China, Australia, as well as many other places. The association also holds an annual autism conference; the 11th Annual Autism Conference will take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in January 2017.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Conference" &gt;http://www.abainternational.org/events/autism-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ABAI has hosted many single-track conferences on topics of special interest to behavior analysts, such as theory and philosophy, climate change, behavioral economics, and education.&lt;ref name= "Past ABAI conferences" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/archives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5530">An '''attribute-value system''' is a basic [[knowledge representation]] framework comprising a table with columns designating "attributes" (also known as "properties", "predicates," "features," "dimensions," "characteristics", "[[Field (computer science)|fields]]", "headers" or "independent variables" depending on the context) and "[[Row (database)|rows]]" designating "objects" (also known as "entities," "instances," "exemplars," "elements", "[[Record (computer science)|records]]" or "dependent variables"). Each table cell therefore designates the value (also known as "state") of a particular attribute of a particular object.

== Example of attribute-value system==
Below is a sample attribute-value system. It represents 10 objects (rows) and five features (columns). In this example, the table contains only integer values. In general, an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data, numeric or otherwise. An attribute-value system is distinguished from a simple "feature list" representation in that each feature in an attribute-value system may possess a range of values (e.g., feature &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; below, which has domain of {0,1,2}), rather than simply being ''present'' or ''absent'' {{Harv|Barsalou|Hale|1993}}.

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern_world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life | lives]]".  Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-014-9553-0|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

==Cultural factors==
There are four major reasons why cherophobes avoid happiness: "believing that being happy will provoke bad things to happen; that happiness will make you a worse person; that expressing happiness is bad for you and others; and that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |publisher=[[The British Psychological Society]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."&lt;ref name="livescience44233"&gt;{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".&lt;ref name="livescience44233"/&gt; Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=13 of Psychology’s Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

[[Image:Ramakrishna.jpg|thumb|right|Sri [[Ramakrishna]] Paramahamsa]]'''Avidyamaya''' and '''Vidyamaya''' are concepts created by the [[Hindu]] sage [[Ramakrishna]] based on his mystical realizations. Literally, ''vidyamaya'' means "wisdom-illusion", and ''avidyamaya'' means "un-wisdom-illusion".

Ramakrishna implied that all things, good and bad, were ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (illusion). According to him, both love and hate, materialism and spirituality, egotism and generosity exist only due to our limited perception of [[Reality]]. However, he divided them into illusions that further bind us (''avidyamaya'') and illusions that take us further onto the dispelling of maya (''vidyamaya'').

According to his Hindu school of thought, as one cannot trust one's eyes before a trained magician, also the human five senses draw and drag us further into illusions and false conclusions. However, the embracing and realization of some concepts that are not [[sense|sensual]] (i.e., of the senses), such as love, generosity, spirituality, all of them ''vidyamaya'', take us further away from sticking to what we see, touch, smell, hear, taste.

Quote: "Vidyamaya may be likened to the last few steps before the roof. Next is the roof, the realization of God." &lt;ref&gt;Swami Nikhilananda (1985), ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'' (Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2745">'''''"Aśuddhatā"''''', a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] term most often used by [[Hindus]] in [[India]], means ritual impurity or uncleanness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=99&amp;table=brown&amp;display=simple A Telugu-English dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus believe in a duality of purity and impurity.  They think that people are both pure and impure and they understand that a person cannot be entirely one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Lachman, Margie.  ''Handbook of Midlife Development: Wiley Series On Adulthood and Aging''.  New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2001. pg 44&lt;/ref&gt;  While impurity has a negative connotation, “impurities are thought to be part of everyday life and all humans alternate between relative purity (''[[suddhatā]]'') and relative impurity (''aśuddhatā'').&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, Jaan and Kevin J. Connolly. ''Handbook of Developmental Psychology''.  London: Sage, 2003. pg 433&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore best that these impurities be avoided as much as possible.

''[[Chõyāchũyi]]'' is a form of ''aśuddhatā''. It can be defined as “mutual touching”, which is essentially any form of contact between two people whether it be intentional or unintentional.  In addition to being defined as contact between two people, ''chõyāchũyi'' also occurs when “two people touch an object at the same time…or when two people sit on the same bench or mat at the same time”.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Sarah. ''White Saris and Sweet Mangoes: Aging, Gender, and Body in North India''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. pg 32&lt;/ref&gt; While seemingly unavoidable, Hindus have found a way around becoming impure through “mutual touching”—they simply avoid contact. If a person needs something that another person has in their possession, instead of handing the object directly to the person in need, they “place an object on the ground for the other to pick up” or they drop it into the other’s hand.&lt;ref&gt;(Lamb, 32)&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Eto'' is another form of aśuddhatā. It is described as “a term that refers specifically to food items that have become very highly permeated with the substance of those who have cooked, handled, and eaten them”.&lt;ref name="Lamb, 33"&gt;(Lamb, 33)&lt;/ref&gt; It is acceptable for close family members to eat the other’s ''eto'' food, however, there are some ''eto'' relationships that are one-sided. For example, a servant can eat an employer’s ''eto'' food, but the employer cannot eat the servant’s ''eto'' food.&lt;ref name="Lamb, 33"/&gt;  This is because an employer is of higher status than a servant and does not want to be polluted by the servant's lower status.

'''''Barometer''''' is a 2013 [[sculpture]] by Devin Laurence Field, to be installed at the newly constructed [[Hillsboro Ballpark]] in Oregon, United States. The [[stainless steel]] sculpture, commissioned by the City of Hillsboro, stands {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} tall at the stadium's entry plaza. Installation of the work began on June 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Theen|first=Andrew|title=Hillsboro Hops news: 'Barometer' public art piece starting to take shape, team signage goes up|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2013/06/hillsboro_hops_news_public_art.html#incart_river|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Barometer'', commissioned by the City of Hillsboro for the newly constructed [[Hillsboro Ballpark]], was designed by Northwest sculpture Devin Laurence Field. Field's design was chosen from twenty qualified candidates by an artist, design team, the [[Hillsboro Arts &amp; Culture Council]], and the Parks and Recreation Department. The [[stainless steel]] sculpture stands {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} tall at the stadium's entry plaza. According to Fields, "the piece takes the overall triangular form of the baseball diamond held aloft by columns and illuminated with color changing, sound activated LED lights. The laser-cut skin of the diamond form is adorned with intricate patterns of baseball bats and balls [and other sports equipment]. Around the sculpture are various 'instruments' people can play, a giant horn, a rattle roller, drum sets and chimes that together form a symphony of sounds. When no one is at the park there is no colored light, when there is noise it lights up — the louder the noise, the brighter the light. The art is a veritable Barometer of excitement for the ballpark."&lt;ref name=Redden&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://portlandtribune.com/ht/117-hillsboro-tribune-news/129203-new-hillsboro-baseball-stadium-adds-artistic-barometer|title= New Hillsboro baseball stadium adds artistic 'Barometer'|first=Jim|last=Redden|accessdate=May 15, 2013|date=February 28, 2013|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman-using-chocolate-fountain.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Chocolate fountain]] being used at a social function.]]
A '''chocolataire''' is a type of social gathering&lt;ref&gt;Maud C. Cooke, ''Social Life: Or, The Manners and Customs of Polite Society, Containing the Rules of Etiquette for All Occasions'', p.296, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; which ranges from large events (such as fund raising and [[RSVP (invitations)|invitation only]]) to smaller functions (similar in structure to informal [[tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]]), in which all food and drink are composed of or contain some form of [[chocolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Foulston, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hI4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Chocolataire+party&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party&amp;pgis=1 The Virago Book of the Joy of Shopping]'', p.84, 2007. ({{ISBN|184408275X}}, 9781844082759)&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered obsolete by some,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Martin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju1XvqoMookC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium]'', p.453, 1990. ({{ISBN|067172228X}}, 9780671722289)&lt;/ref&gt; this entertainment was at its peak popularity around the turn of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Sorrel Marks, Lynne Marks, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2T4miKwsIIcC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Chocolataire Revivals and Roller Rinks: Religion, Leisure, and Identity in Late-nineteenth-century Small-town Ontario]'', p.99, 1996 ({{ISBN|0802078001}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7800-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; (the process for making [[milk chocolate]] having been [[History of chocolate#origins|brought to market]] in 1875), and was seen as a novel alternative to the other forms of social gathering at the time.

==Food and drink==
The menu at a chocolataire may include any variety of chocolate-based dishes: [[cake]]s, [[wafer]]s, [[bonbon]]s, [[candy]], and [[pastry]] being a few examples thereof. These dishes can also be seasonal. For instance, featuring [[hot chocolate]] as the drink of choice in the colder months, and chocolate [[lemonade]] in the warmer ones; with chocolate [[fondue]] and chocolate [[ice cream]] being the seasonal food choices for winter and summer, respectively.

==Ceremony==
[[File:La famille du Duc de Penthièvre dit la tasse de chocolat.jpg|thumb|Chocolate at a social function, 1768 painting]]
As the chocolataire grew in popularity, the ceremony itself became more chocolate-themed—the [[menu]] cards, [[event program|programs]], decorations, and even the costumes of the waiters were of chocolate color; chocolate [[teacup|cups]] and [[saucer]]s were sometimes sold with the chocolate that was served in them,&lt;ref&gt;The Penn publishing company, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oHHh6RAmq-MC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party#PPA30,M1 Eureka Entertainments: Containing a Wide Variety of New and Novel Entertainments Suitable to All Kinds of Public and Private Occasions]'', 1894&lt;/ref&gt; or given as a [[souvenir]] for those who purchased chocolate.
The chocolataire saw use in every social gathering imaginable—one was even thrown as part of a [[fundraising|fund raising]] function for a [[kindergarten]] in Indiana&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jlgVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party The Kindergarten-primary Magazine], 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;—and it was not uncommon, after all guests have been served, to hold an [[auction]] of remaining candy, loaves of cake, and boxes of chocolate left over from preparation of the dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian M. Heath, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HSMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party#PPA28,M1 Eighty Pleasant Evenings]'', p.28, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
The modern analog to the traditional chocolataire is found in some [[bridesmaid]] and [[bachelorette]] parties (where traditional chocolate foods and candies like [[Chocolate truffle|truffles]] and cake are joined by newer recipes like chocolate [[beer]] and [[martini (cocktail)|martini]]s&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Peltz, [http://www.aisledash.com/2007/12/06/calling-all-chocoholics-have-yourself-a-chocolataire/ Calling all chocoholics! Have yourself a chocolataire.] article at aisledash.com&lt;/ref&gt;), and restaurants like "Death by Chocolate" in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]] featuring all-chocolate menus.

[[File:Aggregate Data Structure Diagram.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of a Data Structure Diagram]]

'''Data structure diagram''' ('''DSD''') is a [[diagram]] of the [[Conceptual schema|conceptual data model]] which documents the [[entity|entities]] and their [[Relational model|relationships]], as well as the [[Integrity constraints|constraint]]s that connect to them.

The basic graphic notation elements of DSDs are [[box]]es which represent entities.The arrow symbol represents relationships. Data structure diagrams are most useful for documenting complex data entities.

==Overview==
[[File:Data Structure Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Data Structure Diagram]]
Data Structure Diagram is a [[diagram]] type that is used to depict the structure of [[data]] elements in the [[data dictionary]]. The data structure diagram is a graphical alternative to the composition specifications within such data dictionary entries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FHWA/010394.pdf Data Integration Glossary], U.S. Department of Transportation, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The data structure diagrams is a predecessor of the [[entity-relationship model]] (E-R model). In DSDs, [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]s are specified inside the entity boxes rather than outside of them, while relationships are drawn as boxes composed of attributes which specify the constraints that bind entities together. DSDs differ from the E-R model in that the E-R model focuses on the relationships between different entities, whereas DSDs focus on the relationships of the elements within an entity.

There are several styles for representing data structure diagrams, with the notable difference in the manner of defining [[Cardinality (data modeling)|cardinality]]. The choices are between arrow heads, inverted arrow heads ([[Entity-relationship model|crow's feet]]), or numerical representation of the cardinality.

==Bachman diagram==
[[File:Bachman diagram.jpg|thumb|360px|Illustration of set type using a Bachman diagram]]
A Bachman diagram is a certain type of data structure diagram,&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.irs.gov/irm/part2/irm_02-005-013.html IRS Resources]. Part 2. Information Technology, Chapter 5. Systems Development, Section 13. Database Design Techniques and Deliverables. Retrieved 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to design the [[data]] with a network or relational "logical" model, separating the [[data model]] from the way the data is stored in the system. The model is named after database pioneer [[Charles Bachman]], and mostly used in computer [[software design]].

In a relational model, a relation is the cohesion of attributes that are fully and not {{Clarify span|transitive functional dependent|date=April 2013}} of every key in that relation. The coupling between the relations is based on accordant attributes. For every relation, a rectangle has to be drawn and every coupling is illustrated by a line that connects the relations. On the edge of each line, arrows indicate the cardinality. We have 1-to-n, 1-to-1 and n-to-n. The latter has to be avoided and must be replaced by two (or more) 1-to-n couplings.

Additionally it includes the concepts of a [[Subclass (computer science)|subclass]] and [[Superclass (computer science)|superclass]] ([[Is-a]]), along with the concepts of [[Inheritance (computer science)#Specialization|specialization]] and [[generalization]]. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of a [[union (computer science)|union]] type or category, which is used to represent a collection of objects that is the union of objects of different [[entity]] types. EER model also includes EER diagrams that are conceptual models that accurately represent the requirements of complex databases.

===Subclass and superclass===
Entity type Y is a subtype (subclass) of an entity type X if and only if every Y is necessarily an X. A subclass entity inherits all [[attribute (computing)|attribute]]s and [[Entity–relationship model#Relationships, roles and cardinalities|relationship]]s of its superclass entity. This property is called the attribute and relationship inheritance. A subclass entity may have its own specific attributes and relationships (together with all the attributes and relationships it inherits from the superclass). A common superclass example is a Vehicle superclass along with the subclasses of Car and Truck. There are a number of common attributes between a car and a truck, which would be part of the superclass, while the attributes specific to a car or a truck (such as max payload, truck type...) would make up two subclasses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7171">In [[computing]], '''external memory algorithms''' or '''out-of-core algorithms''' are [[algorithms]] that are designed to process data that is too large to fit into a computer's [[main memory]] at one time. Such algorithms must be optimized to efficiently fetch and access data stored in slow bulk memory ([[auxiliary memory]]) such as [[hard drives]] or [[tape drives]], or when memory is on a [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vitter, J.

== Model ==
[[File:External memory.svg|thumb|The cache on the left holds &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{M}{B}&lt;/math&gt; blocks of size &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; each, for a total of {{mvar|M}} objects. The external memory on the right is unbounded.]]
External memory algorithms are analyzed in an idealized [[model of computation]] called the external memory model (or '''I/O model''', or '''disk access model'''). The external memory model is an [[abstract machine]] similar to the [[RAM model|RAM machine model]], but with a [[Cache (computing)|cache]] in addition to [[main memory]]. The model captures the fact that read and write operations are much faster in a [[cache (computing)|cache]] than in [[main memory]], and that [[Reading (computer)|reads]] long contiguous blocks is faster than reading randomly using a [[disk read-and-write head]]. The [[running time]] of an [[algorithm]] in the external memory model is defined by the number of reads and writes to memory required.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=I/O Model of Computation|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages= 1333–1334|url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_752|year= 2009|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was introduced by Alok Aggarwal and [[Jeffrey Vitter]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal88"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Alok|last2=Vitter|first2=Jeffrey|author2-link=Jeffrey Vitter|title=The input/output complexity of sorting and related problems|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1116–1127|date=1988|doi=10.1145/48529.48535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external memory model is related to the [[Cache-oblivious algorithm#Idealized cache model|cache-oblivious model]], but algorithms in the external memory model may know both the [[Block (data storage)|block size]] and the [[Cache (computing)|cache]] size. For this reason, the model is sometimes referred to as the '''cache-aware model'''.&lt;ref name="Demaine02"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Demaine|first1=Erik|author1-link=Erik Demaine|year=2002|title=Cache-Oblivious Algorithms and Data Structures|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/paper.pdf|conference=Lecture Notes from the EEF Summer School on Massive Data Sets|location=Aarhus|publisher=BRICS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model consists of a [[processor (computing)|processor]] with an internal memory or [[cache (computing)|cache]] of size {{mvar|M}}, connected to an [[infinity|unbounded]] external memory. Both the internal and external memory are divided into [[Block (data storage)|blocks]] of size {{mvar|B}}. One input/output or memory transfer operation consists of moving a block of {{mvar|B}} contiguous elements from external to internal memory, and the [[running time]] of an algorithm is determined by the number of these input/output operations.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal88"/&gt;

== Algorithms ==
Algorithms in the external memory model take advantage of the fact that retrieving one object from external memory retrieves an entire block of size &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. This property is sometimes referred to as locality. 

Searching for an element among &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; objects is possible in the external memory model is possible using a [[B-tree]] with branching factor &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Using a B-tree, searching, insertion, and deletion can be achieved in &lt;math&gt;O(\log _B N)&lt;/math&gt; time (in [[Big O notation]]). [[Information theory|Information theoretically]], this is the minimum [[running time]] possible for these operations, so using a B-tree is [[asymptotically optimal]].&lt;ref name="Aggarwal88"/&gt;

[[External sorting]] is sorting in an external memory setting. External sorting can be done via distribution sort, which is similar to [[quicksort]], or via a &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{M}{B}&lt;/math&gt;[[K-way merge algorithm|-way merge sort]]. Both variants achieve the [[asymptotically optimal]] runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(\tfrac{N}{B} \log _{\tfrac{M}{B}} \tfrac{N}{B})&lt;/math&gt; to sort {{mvar|N}} objects. This bound also applies to the [[Fast Fourier Transform]] in the external memory model.&lt;ref name="Vitter"/&gt;

The permutation problem is to rearrange &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements into a specific [[permutation]]. This can either be done either by sorting, which requires the above sorting runtime, or inserting each element in order and ignoring the benefit of locality. Thus, permutation can be done in &lt;math&gt;O(\min (N, \tfrac{N}{B} \log _{\tfrac{M}{B}} \tfrac{N}{B}))&lt;/math&gt; time.

== Applications ==
The external memory model captures the [[memory hierarchy]], which is not modeled in other common models used in analyzing [[data structures]], such as the [[random access machine]], and is useful for proving [[lower bound]]s for data structures. The model is also useful for analyzing algorithms that work on datasets too big to fit in internal memory.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal88"/&gt;

A typical example is [[geographic information system]]s, especially [[digital elevation model]]s, where the full data set easily exceeds several [[gigabytes]] or even [[terabytes]] of data.

This methodology extends beyond [[Central processing unit|general purpose CPUs]] and also includes [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] computing as well as classical [[digital signal processing]]. In [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU), powerful graphics cards (GPUs) with little memory (compared with the more familiar system memory, which is most often referred to simply as [[RAM]]) are utilized with relatively slow CPU to GPU memory transfer (when compared with computation bandwidth).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8743">The '''Feldman–Mahalanobis model''' is a [[Neo-Marxian economics|Neo-Marxian]] model of [[development economics|economic development]], created independently by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] economist [[Grigory Feldman]] in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=G. A. |origyear=1928 |year=1964 |chapter=On the Theory of Growth Rates of National Income |editor-first=N. |editor-last=Spulber |title=Foundations of Soviet Strategy for Economic Growth |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPkrAAAAMAAJ }} (Translated version)&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian [[statistician]] [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahalanobis |first=P. |year=1953 |title=Some observations  on the Process of Growth of National Income |location=Sankhya |pages=307–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahalanobis became essentially the key economist of [[India]]'s [[Five-year plans of India|Second Five Year Plan]], becoming subject to much of India's most dramatic economic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bronfenbrenner |first=M. |authorlink=Martin Bronfenbrenner |title=A Simplified Mahalanobis Development Model |journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=45–51 |year=1960 |jstor=1151921 |doi=10.1086/449867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the model is a shift in the pattern of industrial [[investment]] towards building up a [[domestic policy|domestic]] [[consumption goods]] sector. Thus the [[strategy]] suggests in order to reach a high standard in consumption, investment in building a [[Capacity utilization|capacity]] in the [[Production (economics)|production]] of capital goods is firstly needed. A high enough capacity in the capital goods sector in the long-run expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods. The distinction between the two different types of goods was a clearer formulation of [[Karl Marx|Marx’s]] ideas in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', and also helped people to better understand the extent of the trade off between the levels of immediate and future consumption. These ideas were however first introduced in 1928 by Feldman, an economist working for the [[GOSPLAN]] planning commission; presenting theoretical arguments of a two-department scheme of growth. There is no evidence that Mahalanobis knew of Feldman’s approach, being kept behind the borders of the USSR.

==Implementation of the model==
The model was created as an analytical framework for India’s Second Five Year Plan in 1955 by appointment of Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], as India felt there was a need to introduce a formal plan model after the First Five Year Plan (1951–1956). The First Five Year Plan stressed investment for capital accumulation in the spirit of the one-sector [[Harrod–Domar model]]. It argued that production required capital and that capital can be accumulated through investment; the faster one accumulates, the higher the growth rate will be. The most fundamental criticisms came from Mahalanobis, who himself was working with a variant of it in 1951 and 1952. The criticisms were mostly around the model’s inability to cope with the real constraints of the economy; it’s ignoring of the fundamental choice problems of planning over time; and the lack of connection between the model and the actual selection of projects for governmental expenditure. Subsequently Mahalanobis introduced his celebrated two-sector model, which he later expanded into a four-sector version.

==Assumptions==
The assumptions under which the Mahalanobis model holds true are as follow:

*We assume a [[autarky|closed economy]].
*The [[economy]] consists of two sectors: consumption goods sector C and capital goods sector K.
*Capital goods are ''non-shiftable''.
*Full capacity production.
*Investment is determined by supply of capital goods.
*No changes in prices.
*Capital is the only scarce factor.
*Production of capital goods is independent of the production of consumer goods.

==Basics of the model==
The full capacity output equation is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Subrata |last=Ghatak |year=2003 |title=Introduction to Development Economics |location=London |publisher=Routledge |edition=4th |page=349 |isbn=0-415-09722-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
Y_{t} = Y_{0} \left \lbrace 1 + \alpha_{0} \frac{\lambda_{k}\beta_{k} + \lambda_{c}\beta_{c}}{\lambda_{k}\beta_{k}} \left \lbrack (1 + \lambda_{k}\beta_{k})^t - 1 \right \rbrack \right \rbrace
&lt;/math&gt;

In the model the growth rate is given by both the share of investment in the capital goods sector, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and the share of investment in the consumer goods sector, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{c}&lt;/math&gt;. If we choose to increase the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k}&lt;/math&gt; to be larger than &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, this will initially result in a slower growth in the short-run, but in the long run will exceed the former growth rate choice with a higher growth rate and an ultimately higher level of consumption. In other words, if this method is used, only in the long run will investment into the capital goods produce consumer goods, resulting in no short run gains.

==Criticisms==
One of the most common criticisms of the model is that Mahalanobis pays hardly any attention to the savings constraint, which he assumes comes from the [[industrial sector]]. Developing countries however do not have this tendency, as the first stages of saving usually come from the [[agriculture|agricultural sector]]. He also does not mention [[taxation]], an important potential source of capital.
A more serious criticism is the limitation of the assumptions under which this model holds, an example being the limitation of [[foreign trade]]. This cannot be justifiable to [[developing countries]] today. Also another criticism is that a country to use this model would have to be large enough to contain all the raw resources needed to be sustainable, so therefore this would not apply to smaller countries.

==Empirical case==
Essentially the model was put into practice in 1956 as the theoretical pathway of India's Second Five Year Plan. However, after two years the first problems started to emerge. Problems such as unexpected and unavoidable costs contributed to increased [[money supply]] and growing [[inflation]]. The biggest problem was the fall in the [[foreign exchange reserve]] due to liberalised [[import]] [[policy]] and international tension, leading to modifications in the Second Plan in 1958. It was finally abandoned and replaced by the Third Five Year Plan in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen |first=Pronab |title=Growth Theories and Development Strategies: Lessons from Indian Experience |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=26 |issue=30 |year=1991 |pages=PE62–PE72 |jstor=41498498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada''' ('''FINTRAC''') gathers, analyzes, assesses, and discloses [[financial intelligence]].  Originally created in July 2000 to counter suspected [[money laundering]], FINTRAC's mandate was expanded in December 2001 to provide the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) with information on [[terrorist financing]] that threaten the security of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fintrac.gc.ca/fintrac-canafe/1_e.asp|title=FINTRAC - Who We Are|accessdate=2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINTRAC was established under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, which was amended in December, 2001 to become the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA). FINTRAC's mandate was further amended in 2006 under Bill C-25&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/39-1/C-25/?page=4|title=Bill C-25 (Historical) {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enhance the client identification, record-keeping and reporting measures, established a registration regime for money services businesses and foreign exchange dealers, and created new offences for not registering.

The Director of FINTRAC reports to the Minister of Finance.

FINTRAC receives information from regulated entities on:

* Suspicious transactions

In 2009, FINTRAC estimated that  the amount of money laundered on an annual basis is somewhere between $5 and  $15 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-005-x/2011001/article/11454-eng.htm#a1|title=Money laundering in Canada, 2009|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Suspicious transactions are financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a money laundering offence. Since June 12, 2002, suspicious transactions also include financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a terrorist activity financing offence. Suspicious transactions must be reported by financial entities (banks and financial dealers),  money services businesses, life insurance companies and agents, certain government agencies that take deposits (such as Canada Post), accountants or accounting firms,  real estate agents and brokers, and casinos.

FINTRAC publishes Annual results, Quarterly updates, performance reports, and notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/about-apropos/corp-publications-eng.asp|title=Corporate reports|last=Canada|first=Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of|website=www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''finite lattice representation problem''', or '''finite congruence lattice problem''', asks whether every finite [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] is [[isomorphic]] to the [[congruence lattice]] of some finite [[Universal algebra|algebra]].

== Background ==
A [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] is called [[Algebraic lattice|algebraic]] if it is [[Complete lattice|complete]] and [[Compact element|compactly generated]].  In 1963, Grätzer and Schmidt proved that every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the [[congruence lattice]] of some [[universal algebra|algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Grätzer and E. T. Schmidt, ''Characterizations of congruence lattices of abstract algebras'', Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged) '''24''' (1963), 34–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus there is essentially no restriction on the shape of a congruence lattice of an algebra. The finite lattice representation problem asks whether the same is true for finite lattices and finite algebras. That is, does every finite lattice occur as the congruence lattice of a ''finite'' algebra?

In 1980, Pálfy and Pudlák proved that this problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether every finite lattice occurs as an interval in the [[subgroup lattice]] of a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;Pálfy and Pudlák. ''Congruence lattices of finite algebras and intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups.'' Algebra Universalis 11(1), 22–27 (1980). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02483080 DOI]&lt;/ref&gt;  For an overview of the group theoretic approach to the problem, see Pálfy (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Péter Pál Pálfy. ''Intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups.'' In Groups ’93 Galway/St. Andrews, Vol. 2, volume 212 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., pages 482–494. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pálfy (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Péter Pál Pálfy. ''Groups and lattices.'' In Groups St. Andrews 2001 in Oxford. Vol. II, volume 305 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., pages 428–454, Cambridge, 2003. Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem should not be confused with the [[congruence lattice problem]].

== Significance ==
This is among the oldest unsolved problems in [[universal algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Berman. [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17739547/diss/berman-phd-thesis.pdf ''Congruence lattices of finite universal algebras.''] PhD thesis, University of Washington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarni Jónsson. ''Topics in universal algebra.'' Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 250. Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph McKenzie. ''Finite forbidden lattices.''

(1983). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BFb0063438 DOI]&lt;/ref&gt; Until it is answered, the theory of finite algebras is incomplete since, given a finite algebra, it is unknown whether there are, ''a priori'', any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice.

[[File:Student Action for Aborigines bus ouside the Hotel Bogabilla in February 1965.jpg|thumb|300px|Student Action for Aborigines' bus in February 1965]]
The '''Freedom Ride''' of 1965  was a significant event in the history of [[civil rights]] for [[Indigenous Australians]].

{{Segregation}}

Inspired by the [[Freedom Riders]] of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], students from the [[University of Sydney]] formed a group called the Student Action for Aborigines, led by [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]] (the first [[Indigenous Australian]] to graduate [[tertiary education]]) among others, and travelled into [[New South Wales]] country towns on what some of them considered a fact-finding mission. What they encountered was ''de facto'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]]; the students protested, picketed, and faced violence, raising the issue of Indigenous rights. They commonly stood protesting for hours at segregated areas such as pools, parks and pubs which raised a mixed reception in the country towns. Australia overwhelmingly passed a [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] removing discriminatory sections from the [[Australian Constitution]] and enabling the federal government to take direct action in Aboriginal affairs.

At the time of the Freedom Ride in 1965, some Aboriginal People of Australia were counted separately in the [[Australian census|census]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/B207140FE5757989CA257AF40014D933/$File/13010_1960%20section%209.pdf Year Book Australia, 1960], Australian Bureau of Statistics, pages 327–328.&lt;/ref&gt; and their rights as citizens were regularly ignored. In 1964 a University of Sydney protest against [[racial segregation in the United States]] had brought comments from members of the public urging students to look to their own backyard if they wanted to draw attention to racial discrimination.

==Participants==
The original Freedom Riders were: [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]], Gary Williams, Aidan Foy, Alan Outhred, Alex Mills, [[Ann Curthoys]], Barry Corr, Beth Hansen, Bob Gallagher, Brian Aarons, Chris Page, Colin Bradford, Darce Cassidy, David Pepper, Derek Molloy, [[Hall Greenland]], Helen Gray, [[Jim Spigelman]], John Butterworth, John Gowdie, John Powles, Judith Rich, Louise Higham, Machteld Hali, Norm Mackay, Paddy Dawson, Pat Healy, Ray Leppik, Rick Collins, Robyn Iredale, Sue Johnston, Sue Reeves, Warwick Richards and Wendy Golding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Curthoys, Ann |title=Freedom ride : a freedom rider remembers |publisher=Allen and Unwin |year=2002 |isbn=1-86448-922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communities visited==
[[File:Ann Curthoys and Louise Higham interview residents at Moree Aborigial Station 17 Feb 1965.jpg|thumb|Ann Curthoys and Louise Higham interview residents at Moree Aboriginal Station during the Freedom Ride]]
[[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] was the site of a violent conflict during the Freedom Ride. After a protest at [[Walgett, New South Wales|Walgett]], an unidentified driver rammed the bus forcing it off the road.  Because cadet reporter Bruce Maxwell had come along, the incident made headlines in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', attracting the attention of international media.&lt;ref&gt;Curthoys, Ann [http://arts.anu.edu.au/history/curthoys/endnotes.htm Endnotes to the book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606175020/http://arts.anu.edu.au/history/curthoys/endnotes.htm |date=2011-06-06 }} March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Bruce. "Following the Freedom Riders", ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 16 June 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reports compared the treatment of Aboriginal Australians to the [[racism]] and segregation in the [[Deep South]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Freedom-Ride-inspires-a-new-generation/2005/02/04/1107476802617.html |title=Freedom Ride inspires a new generation |accessdate=2008-02-18 |author=Lewis, Daniel |date=2005-02-05|work=Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two towns they went to were [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]] and [[Gulargambone, New South Wales|Gulargambone]]. Protests were not conducted there. Instead the locals were asked questions which affirmed perceptions of how bad [[discrimination]] against Indigenous Australians was in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/messageclub/duknow/stories/s888118.htm |title=Didj "u" Know - Stories: Freedom Ride |accessdate=2008-02-18 |author=Dawkins, Kezia |date=2004-02-01 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other towns that were visited include [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], [[Bowraville, New South Wales|Bowraville]] [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]] and [[Kempsey, New South Wales|Kempsey]].

==2005 re-enactment==
In 2005 another ride travelled through New South Wales. The aim was to determine how much had changed in 40 years and foster debate on reconciliation.&lt;ref name="ang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/daanews/3/Freedomride.html |title=A new generation take the freedom ride 2005 |publisher=Aboriginal Affairs New South Wales |accessdate=5 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402190617/http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/daanews/3/Freedomride.html |archivedate=2 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 2005 event focussed on reconciliation, experiences of discrimination were reported and the poor housing conditions for some Aboriginal People were noted. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [[Andrew Refshauge]] was presented with the findings of the 2005 ride which visited more than 13 communities.&lt;ref name="ang"/&gt;

==2015 50th anniversary==
To mark the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Ride, two coaches re-ran the route with several of the original participants and a group of present-day University of Sydney students. This was featured in an episode of the SBS programme ''[[Living Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3YJN3WED4|title=Living Black S2015 Ep2 – Freedom Rides|publisher=SBS|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological factors==
A person's "...sense of personal insignificance comes from two primary experiences: (a) the developmental experience with its increasing awareness of separation and loss, transience, and the sense of lost felt perfectibility; and (b) the increasing cognitive awareness of the immutable laws of biology and the limitations of the self and others in which idealization gives way to painful reality." To deal with feelings of insignificance, "...each individual seeks [[narcissistic]] reparation through the elaboration of a personal narrative or myth, a story, which gives one's life a feeling of personal significance, meaning, and purpose." These "...myths provide the individual with a personal sense of identity, and they confirm and affirm memberships in a group or community, and provide guidelines and an idealized set of behaviors..., [and] endorse an explanation for the mysterious universe."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw JA. Narcissism as a motivational structure: the problem of personal significance. ''Psychiatry''. 2000 Fall;63(3):219-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern society, people living in crowded, anonymous major cities may face feelings of insignificance. [[George Simmel]]'s work has addressed the issue of how the "dissociation typical of modern city life, the freeing of the person from traditional social ties as from each other" can lead to a "loss or diminution of individuality." Moreover, when a person feels like "...just another face in the crowd, an object of indifference to strangers", it can "lead to feelings of insignificance..."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the book ''The Fear of Insignificance'', psychologist [[Carlo Strenger]] "...diagnoses the wide-spread fear of the global educated class of leading insignificant lives."&lt;ref&gt;Amazon Book Description. Available at: www.amazon.com/Fear-Insignificance-Searching-Meaning-Twenty-First/dp/0230113753. Accessed on Dec. 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Strenger warns "...that the global celebrity culture is adding fuel to the 'fear of insignificance' by undermining one’s self-image and sense of self-worth." He noted that "...over recent years people around the world have been suffering from an increasing fear of their own 'insignificance'." He argues that the "impact of the global [[infotainment]] network on the individual is to blame," because it has led to the creation of "a new species...homo globalis – global man." In this new system, people "...are defined by our intimate connection to the global infotainment network, which has turned ranking and rating people on scales of wealth and [[celebrity]] into an obsession." 

Strenger states that "...as humans we naturally measure ourselves to those around us, but now that we live in a “global village” we are comparing ourselves with the most “significant” [celebrity] people in the world, and finding ourselves wanting." He notes that "...in the past being a lawyer or doctor was a very reputable profession, but in this day and age, even high achievers constantly fear that they are insignificant when they compare themselves to [celebrity] success stories in the media. Strenger claims that this "...creates highly unstable self-esteem and an unstable society."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

[[Alain de Botton]] describes some of the same issues in his book ''[[Status Anxiety]]''. Botton's book examines people's anxiety about whether they are judged a success or a failure. De Botton claims that chronic anxiety about status is an inevitable [[unintended consequence|side effect]] of any [[democracy|democratic]], ostensibly [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[society]].

[[Edith Wharton]] stated that “It is less mortifying to believe one's self unpopular than insignificant, and vanity prefers to assume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness.” &lt;ref&gt; http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/insignificance&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote that “If you once realize that to-morrow, if not to-day, you will die and nothing will be left of you, everything becomes insignificant!”&lt;ref&gt; http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/insignificance&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

[[Blaise Pascal]] emphasized "the apparent insignificance of human existence, the "...dread of an unknown future", and the "...experience of being dominated by political and natural forces that far exceed our limited powers"; these elements "strike a chord of recognition with some of the existentialist writings that emerged in Europe following the Second World War."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Desmond, "Blaise Pascal", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pascal/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] states that in modern capitalist societies, people develop a "...feeling of personal insignificance and powerlessness" due to "...economic recessions, global wars and terrorism." Fromm argues that in capitalist societies, the "...individual became subordinated to capitalist production and worked for profit's sake, for the development of new investment capital and for conspicuous spending." In making people "...work for extrapersonal ends," capitalism made people into a "servant to the very machine he built" and caused feelings of insignificance to arise.

==In religion==

[[Martin Luther]] believed that the solution to the feelings of insignificance felt by the common person "...was to accept individual insignificance, to submit, to give up individual will and strength and hope to become acceptable to God."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm and "The Fear of Freedom.

In her column in Scientific American, [[Jennifer Ouellette]] referred to the vastness of the cosmos:&lt;ref&gt;In Praise of Insignificance

&lt;blockquote&gt;If one embraces an atheist worldview, it necessarily requires embracing, even celebrating, one's insignificance. It's a tall order, I know, when one is accustomed to being the center of attention. The universe existed in all its vastness before I was born, and it will exist and continue to evolve after I am gone. But knowing that doesn't make me feel bleak or hopeless. I find it strangely comforting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In literary philosophy==
The concept of "insignificance" is also important to the literary philosophy of [[cosmicism]]. One of the prominent themes in cosmicism is the utter insignificance of humanity. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] believed that "the human race will disappear. Other races will appear and disappear in turn. The sky will become icy and void, pierced by the feeble light of half-dead stars. Which will also disappear. Everything will disappear."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michel Houellebecq, ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]'' (1999), referenced in Andrew Riemer's [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/27/1056683892274.html "A nihilist's hope against hope"], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Wilson]] criticizes “the sense of defeat, or disaster, or futility, that seems to underlie so much...20th century literature", and its tendency "...to portray human existence as insignificant and futile." Wilson "...calls this affliction the "fallacy of insignificance", and as he explains in ''The Stature of Man'' this fallacy is unconsciously embedded in the psychology of the modern individual." Wilson argues that the "other-directed individual...is the typical person found in our modern society today and is a victim of the "fallacy of insignificance"." He claims that the "...other directed individual has been conditioned by society to lack self-confidence in their ability to achieve anything of real worth, and thus they conform to society to escape their feelings of unimportance and uselessness."&lt;ref&gt;The Stature of Man - Colin Wilson.

In a controlled social experiment if a control is aware of their status as members of the control group and is able to compare their performance with that of the treatment group, members of the control group may actively work harder to overcome the "disadvantage" of being in the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Campbell|first2=Donald Thomas|title=Quasi-experimentation: Design &amp; Analysis Issues for Field Settings|date=1979|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=9780395307908|page=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if in an educational trial where the school classes who are in the treatment receive an extra support teacher, students who are in the control group may be induced to work harder to overcome that disadvantage.

'''K G Kannabiran''' was a [[human rights]] activist and a lawyer of the [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]] in the Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] (AP). He was cofounder and National President of [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] (PUCL).

== Early life ==

He was born on 9 November 1929, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, to Kandala Gopalaswamy Iyengar, a doctor, and Pankajammal. His early education was in Hyderabad and Nellore. He obtained a BA Hons degree in economics (equivalent to Masters) and a degree in law from Madras University.  He enrolled in the Madras Bar Council and started his practice in 1953 with the help of his advocate cousin Srinivasa Raghavan (Rajappa). He married Vasanth Kannabiran in 1959. His daughter, Chitra Kannabiran, a molecular biologist was born in 1960; second daughter [[Kalpana Kannabiran]], a sociologist was born in 1961; and his son Arvind Kannabiran, a cinematographer, was born in 1966.  He moved to Hyderabad and set up practice there soon after his marriage.

== Career ==

=== Lawyer ===

He practiced law in Madras (now [[Chennai]]) with moderate success and shifted to Hyderabad in 1960 soon after his marriage in 1959.

=== Human rights activist ===

Kannabiran started his career as an advocate in AP High court in the early 1960s. He defended human rights and political dissents cases, including [[Shankar Guha Niyogi]], conspiracy cases and political prisoner cases. He was a founding member of PUCL and APCLC and other human rights organizations. Kannabiran took up cases of human rights violations, political dissidents and encounter cases, including four major conspiracy cases, [[Parvathipuram, Andhra Pradesh|Parvathipuram]] ([[Srikakulam district]]), Tarimela Nagi Reddy, [[Secunderabad]] and [[Ramnagar, Hyderabad|Ramnagar]] in 1975. Pleading his case in the lower court, he ultimately succeeded in getting the murderers convicted and punished by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defending dissent and democracy|url= http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/defending-dissent-and-democracy/article1090248.ec|accessdate=15 January 2011 |newspaper= [[The Hindu]]|date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of PUCL and APCLC ==
The [[PUCL]] was an attempt to establish an organisation free from political ideologies, through which people connected with different political parties could be brought onto a common platform for the defence of civil liberties and human rights. Kannabiran was one of the National Executive members of the PUCL. Kannabiran remained President of PUCL from 1995 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUCL Formed|url=http://www.pucl.org/from-archives/may81/puclformed.htm|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
He published the book ''The Wages of Impunity&amp;nbsp;— Power, Justice and Human Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advocacy of human rights|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2004/06/08/stories/2004060800201400.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
He died at age 81 after a brief illness in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil rights activist Kannabiran passes away|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/civil-rights-activist-kannabiran-passes-away/article1018960.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10926">The '''Koide formula''' is an unexplained [[Empirical relationship|empirical equation]] discovered by [[Yoshio Koide]]&lt;!--Koide Yoshio 小出 義雄--&gt; in 1981. In its original form, it relates the masses of the three charged [[leptons]]; later authors have extended the relation to neutrinos, quarks, and other families of particles.

==Formula==
The Koide formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{m_e + m_{\mu} + m_{\tau}}{(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_{\mu}}+\sqrt{m_{\tau}})^2} \approx 0.6666617 \approx \frac{2}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

where the masses of the [[electron]], [[muon]], and [[tau (particle)|tau]] are measured respectively as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|0.510998946|(3)|ul=MeV/c2}}, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|105.6583745|(24)|u=MeV/c2}}, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|1776.86|(12)|u=MeV/c2}}, and the digits in parentheses are the [[measurement uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the last figures.&lt;ref name="AmslerDoser2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amsler|first1=C. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=Particle Data Group |title=Review of Particle Physics|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=667 |issue=1–5 |year=2008 |pages=1–6 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.018 |bibcode=2008PhLB..667....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|0.666661|(7)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Since the uncertainties in ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are much smaller than that in ''m''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;, the uncertainty in ''Q'' was calculated as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\Delta Q = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial m_\tau}\Delta m_\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is clear that {{nowrap|{{frac|1|3}} &lt; Q &lt; 1}}. The superior bound follows if we assume that the square roots cannot be negative. By [[Cauchy-Schwarz]], the value &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3Q}&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the squared cosine of the angle between the vector &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{m_e},\sqrt{m_{\mu}},\sqrt{m_{\tau}})&lt;/math&gt; and the vector
&lt;math&gt;(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[dot product]]).

The mystery is in the physical value. Not only is this result odd in that three apparently random numbers should give a simple fraction, but also that ''Q'' is exactly halfway between the two extremes of {{frac|1|3}} (should the three masses be equal) and 1 (should one mass dominate). 

While the original formula appeared in the context of [[preon]] models, other ways have been found to produce it (both by Sumino and by Koide, see references below). As a whole, however, understanding remains incomplete.

There are similar empirical formulae which relate other masses. 
Quark masses depend on the energy scale used to measure them, which makes an analysis more complicated.

Taking the heaviest three quarks, [[charm quark|charm]] (1290 MeV), [[bottom quark|bottom]] (4180 MeV) and [[top quark|top]] (172440 MeV), gives the value:&lt;ref name=Cao/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{heavy} = \frac{m_C + m_{B} + m_{T}}{(\sqrt{m_C}+\sqrt{m_B}+\sqrt{m_T})^2} \approx  0.668 \approx \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The possibility that ''Q'' equals exactly 2/3 lies within the experimental uncertainties of the masses ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}). This was noticed by Rodejohann and Zhang in the first version of their 2011 paper&lt;ref&gt;

However, the masses of the lightest quarks, [[up quark|up]] (2.3 MeV), [[down quark|down]] (4.8 MeV), and [[strange quark|strange]] (95 MeV) yield:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{light} = \frac{m_{U} + m_{D} + m_{S}}{(\sqrt{m_{U}}+\sqrt{m_{D}}+\sqrt{m_{S}})^2} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;

a value also cited by Cao.&lt;ref name=Cao/&gt;

==Running of particle masses==
In [[quantum field theory]], quantities like [[coupling constant]] and [[mass]] "run" with the energy scale. That is, their value depends on the energy scale at which the observation occurs, in a way described by a [[Exact renormalization group equation|renormalization group equation]] (RGE). One usually expects relationships between such quantities to be simple at high energies (where some [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] is [[symmetry breaking|unbroken]]) but not at low energies, where the RG flow will have produced complicated deviations from the high energy relation. The Koide relation is exact (within experimental error) for the [[pole mass]]es, which are low-energy quantities defined at different energy scales. For this reason, many physicists regard the relation as [[Numerology#.22Numerology.22 in science|"numerology"]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the Japanese physicist [[Yukinari Sumino]] has constructed an [[effective field theory]] in which a new [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] causes the pole masses to exactly satisfy the relation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Lily-White Movement''' was an anti-[[African-American Civil Rights|civil-rights]] movement within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement was a response to the political and socioeconomic gains made by African-Americans following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which eliminated slavery.

During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], following the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], black leaders in Texas and around the country gained increasing influence in the Republican Party by organizing blacks as an important voting bloc via [[Union League]]s and the biracial [[Black-and-tan faction]] of the Republicans. Conservative whites attempted to eliminate this influence and recover white voters who had defected to the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The effort was largely successful in eliminating African-American influence in the Republican Party leading to black voters predominantly migrating to the Democratic Party for much of the 20th century.

The term ''lily-white movement'' was coined by [[Texas Republican Party|Texas Republican]] leader [[Norris Wright Cuney]], who used the term in an 1888 Republican convention to describe efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of Texas party leadership and incite riots to divide the party.&lt;ref name="Myrdal 1996, pg. 478"&gt;Myrdal (1996), pg. 478&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to be used nationally to describe this ongoing movement as it further developed in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NEGROES LOSE FIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA; Pritchard's "Lilly Whites" Recognized by the President.

Localized movements began immediately after the war but by the beginning of the 20th century the effort had become national.

According to author and professor Michael K. Fauntroy, "the 'Lily-White Movement' is one of the darkest, and under-examined ''{{sic}}'', eras of American Republicanism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republicans and the Black Vote |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |author=Michael K.

==Background==
{{Main|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1865–1896)}}

Immediately following the war all of the Southern states enacted "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]," laws intended specifically to curtail the rights of the newly freed slaves. Many Northern states enacted their own "Black Codes" restricting or barring black immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=African American History | accessdate=10 October 2009 | publisher=MSN Encarta | url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761595158_3/African_American_History.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwsezS0j|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], however, nullified most of these laws and the federal Freedman's Bureau was able to regulate many of the affairs of Southern blacks, who were granted the right to vote in 1867. Groups such as the [[Union League]] and the [[Radical Republicans]] sought total equality and complete integration of blacks into American society. The Republican Party itself held significant power in the South during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] because of the federal government's role.&lt;ref name="Brady 2008, pg. 154"&gt;Brady (2008), pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], Union Leagues were formed across the South after 1867 as all-black working auxiliaries of the Republican Party. They were secret organizations that mobilized [[freedmen]] to register to vote and to vote Republican. They discussed political issues, promoted civic projects, and mobilized workers opposed to certain employers. Most branches were segregated but there were a few that were racially integrated. The leaders of the all-black units were mostly urban blacks from the North, who had never been slaves. Historian [[Eric Foner]] reports:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds.|title=Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB-Y2Ejlp9oC&amp;pg=PA221|year=1991|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the end of 1867 it seemed that virtually every black voter in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.|Eric Foner | Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century}}

During the 19th century numerous African Americans were elected to the [[United States Congress]], all members of the Republican Party. In the South the party was a voting coalition of Freedmen (freed slaves), [[Carpetbaggers]] (recent arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (Southern whites, especially men who had been Unionists in the War). In Texas, blacks comprised 90% of the party members during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLITICS | id=wmafr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first black [[United States Senate|senator]] was [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]] of [[Mississippi]]. The first black [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] was [[John Willis Menard]] of Louisiana. Over the course of the century, an additional black senator (from Mississippi) would be elected and more than 20 black representatives would be elected from Louisiana, [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]].

Blacks held other powerful political positions in government. [[P. B. S. Pinchback]] was elected lieutenant governor of Louisiana and even served briefly as governor. Pierre Caliste Landry became mayor of [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]]. [[Edward Duplex]] became mayor of [[Wheatland, California]].

In the South the Republican party gradually came to be known as "the party of the Negro."&lt;ref name="Macmillan's: Future"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Future of the Negro | work=Macmillan's magazine | page=449 | author=Masson, David; Masson, George; Morley, John; Morris, Mowbray Walter | year=1900 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1ZkOe4ZpOIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, for example, blacks made 90% of the party during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLITICS | id=AA/wmafr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic party increasingly came to be seen by many in the white community as the party of respectability.&lt;ref name="Macmillan's: Future"/&gt; The first [[Ku Klux Klan]] targeted violence against black Republican leaders and seriously undercut the Union League.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hahn, ''A nation under our feet: Black political struggles in the rural South, from slavery to the great migration'' (2003). pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s through early 1890s, Democrats in Southern states used various methods to suppress the vote of blacks, largely intimidation, violence and fraud.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Republicans responded by challenging the election results and overturning them in order to count the votes of blacks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was much more successful when Republicans held an uncontested majority of the US House than otherwise.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Republican factionalism==
[[Image:Norris_Wright_Cuney.jpg | thumb|Norris Wright Cuney, the first African-American chairman of the Texas Republican Party]]
From the beginning of Reconstruction, conservative Southern white factions fought against the [[black-and-tan faction]], coalitions of blacks and liberal whites, for control of the Republican Party. White Republican leaders became increasingly concerned about the exodus of white voters in other parts of the country, some out of concerns for the strength of the party and some for purely racist reasons, thus giving impetus to what would be called the ''lily-white movement''.

Blacks increasingly demanded more and more offices at the expense of the Scalawags.  The more numerous black-and-tan element typically won the factional battles; many Scalawags joined the opposing lily-whites or switched to the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins, ''The Scalawag in Alabama Politics, 1865-1881'' (University of Alabama Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Wetta, ''The Louisiana Scalawags: Politics, Race, and Terrorism during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The black-and-tans predominated in counties with large black populations, as the whites in these counties were usually Democrats, whereas the lily-whites were found mostly in the counties where fewer blacks lived.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Following the death of Texas Republican leader [[Edmund J. Davis]] in 1883, black civil rights leader [[Norris Wright Cuney]] rose to the Republican chairmanship in Texas, becoming the national committeeman in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY TEXAS | id=npl01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While blacks were a minority overall in Texas, Cuney's rise to this position caused a backlash among white conservative Republicans in other areas, leading to the lily-white's becoming a more organized, nationwide effort. Cuney himself coined the term ''lily-white movement'' to describe rapidly intensifying organized efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of party leadership and incite riots to divide the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Myrdal, Gunnar |author2=Bok, Sissela | title=An American dilemma: the Negro problem and modern democracy | year=1944 | page=478 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuAEokAx2G4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors contend that the effort was coordinated with Democrats as part of a larger movement toward [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks in the South by increasing restrictions in voter registration rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Republicans and the Black Vote | author=Fauntroy, Michael K. | year=2007 | publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers | page=43 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyuHAAAAMAAJ | quote="... lily whites worked with Democrats to disenfranchise African Americans."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black disfranchisement in Southern states==
By 1890 the Democratic Party had gained control of all state legislatures in the South (with a few brief exceptions as in North Carolina). By the beginning of the 20th century black political influence was in freefall. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states accomplished disenfranchisement of blacks and, in some states, many poor whites.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three decades of the 20th century blacks were excluded from the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Negroes’ Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929 | publisher=Black Americans in Congress (House of Representatives) | accessdate=9 October 2009 | url=http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s most blacks had abandoned or were prevented from seeking office in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="Brady 2008, pg. 154"/&gt; The last five African Americans that served in Congress, all college-educated, were the product of Reconstruction era educational and economic opportunities which were significantly eroded in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brady (2008), pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The last black Congressman of this earlier era departed the Congress in 1901. Blacks still had some influence in the Republican party but their influence continued to decline rapidly.

==Downfall of black Republicans==
By the beginning of the 20th century, black political influence was in freefall, both because the Republican lily-white movement and the efforts by the Democratic Southern governments. During the first three decades of the 20th century, no blacks served in the U.S. Congress due to their disenfranchisement across the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Negroes’ Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929 | publisher=Black Americans in Congress (House of Representatives) | accessdate=9 October 2009 | url=http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the lily-white movement had largely succeeded in establishing almost total white supremacy in the party. Black leaders were barred in 1922 from the [[Virginia]] Republican Congressional Convention. The state had imposed racial segregation of public places and disenfranchised most blacks by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Virginia Party Politics | accessdate=9 October 2009 | publisher=Virginia Center for Digital History (University of Virginia) | url=http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/politics/party.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | title=NEGROES AGAIN BARRED FROM G.O.P. CONVENTION | work=Daily Progress | date=July 23, 1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a national level, the Republican Party made some attempts to respond to black interests.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis L. Gould, ''The Republicans: A History of the Grand Old Party'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. De Santis, ''Republicans face the southern question: The new departure years, 1877-1897'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The party proposed federal legislation to prohibit [[lynching]], which was always defeated by the Southern bloc. In 1920 Republicans made opposition to [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] part of their platform at the Republican National Convention. Lynchings, primarily of black men in the South, had increased in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. [[Leonidas C. Dyer]], a white Republican Representative from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], worked with the NAACP to introduce an anti-lynching bill into the House, where he gained strong passage in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, "The South and the Politics of Antilynching Legislation, 1920-1940." ''Journal of Southern History'' 51.2 (1985): 201-220. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2208825 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[black-and-tan faction|Black and Tan]] partisans who continued to hold appointed office was [[Walter L. Cohen]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], the customs inspector and later comptroller of customs. He gained appointments from four Republican presidents and continued in office through the [[Calvin Coolidge]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site20.php|author=[[Louisiana Historical Association]]|title=A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography|publisher=lahistory.org|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[NAACP]] national convention in 1926, the delegates expressed their disappointment with the party:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Americans in Congress, 1870-2007 | author=Wasniewski, Matthew ; Office of History and Preservation House | publisher=Government Printing Office | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cNiPp-D260C | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Our political salvation and our social survival lie in our absolute independence of party allegiance in politics and the casting of our vote for our friends and against our enemies whoever they may be and whatever party labels they carry.|NAACP | 1926 Convention}}

An interesting historical irony is that, though strengthening the Republican Party in the South was a major motivation of the movement, the party faded to near irrelevance in the South during the early 20th century despite the movement's success.

Lily-white/black-and-tan factionalism flared up in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisio, Donald J. | title=Hoover, Blacks, and Lily-Whites: A Study of Southern Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAWcOqUNRckC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2012|publisher=U North Carolina Press |page=37ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Herbert Hoover tried to appeal to southern whites; and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marty Cohen|title=The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEw9ROwagN0C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2009|page=118|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Black-and-tan factions lost heavily in 1964 and practically vanished. Due to Democratic support of the civil rights movement and Congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the shift of African Americans toward Democratic candidates accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert David Johnson|title=All the Way with LBJ: The 1964 Presidential Election|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc4_3JKYvo0C&amp;pg=PA84|year=2009|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11735">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;, a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, and the constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]]; the letters MV refer to the [[Many-valued logic|''many-valued'' logic]] of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative [[BCK algebra]]s.

==Definitions==
An '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, \lnot, 0\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; consisting of
* a [[empty set|non-empty]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; and
* a constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; denoting a fixed [[element (mathematics)|element]] of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:
* &lt;math&gt; (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus 0 = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus y = y \oplus x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot \lnot x = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus \lnot 0 = \lnot 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot ( \lnot x \oplus y)\oplus y = \lnot ( \lnot y \oplus x) \oplus x.&lt;/math&gt;

By virtue of the first three axioms, &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative [[monoid]]. Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of [[BL (logic)|BL]]-algebras and contains all [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

An MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]] &lt;math&gt;\langle L, \wedge, \vee, \otimes, \rightarrow, 0, 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the additional identity &lt;math&gt;x \vee y = (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of MV-algebras==
A simple numerical example is &lt;math&gt;A=[0,1],&lt;/math&gt; with operations &lt;math&gt;x \oplus y = \min(x+y,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot x=1-x.&lt;/math&gt; In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the ''standard MV-algebra'', as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

The ''trivial'' MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way, &lt;math&gt;0\oplus0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot0=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''two-element'' MV-algebra is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\},&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; coinciding with Boolean disjunction and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x = x&lt;/math&gt; to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomatization of Boolean algebras.

If instead the axiom added is &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \oplus x = x \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;, then the axioms define the MV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Axiomatizations of Ln need Grigolia's axioms|date=February 2013}}. Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\dots,1\},&lt;/math&gt; which is closed under the operations &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another important example is ''Chang's MV-algebra'', consisting just of infinitesimals (with the [[order type]] &amp;omega;) and their co-infinitesimals.

Chang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary [[Linearly ordered group|totally ordered abelian group]] ''G'' by fixing a positive element ''u'' and defining the segment [0, ''u''] as { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' }, which becomes an MV-algebra with ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = min(''u'', ''x''+''y'') and ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x''. Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.

D. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian [[lattice-ordered group]]s. If ''G'' is such a group with strong (order) unit ''u'', then the "unit interval" { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' } can be equipped with ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x'', ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = ''u''∧&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (x+y), ''x'' ⊗ ''y'' = 0∨&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+''y''−''u''). This construction establishes a [[categorical equivalence]] between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.

==Relation to Łukasiewicz logic==
[[C. C. Chang]] devised MV-algebras to study [[many-valued logic]]s, introduced by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]], as described below.

Given an MV-algebra ''A'', an ''A''-[[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the algebra of [[propositional formula]]s (in the language consisting of &lt;math&gt;\oplus,\lnot,&lt;/math&gt; and 0) into ''A''. Formulas mapped to 1 (or &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;0) for all ''A''-valuations are called ''A''-[[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Chang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]], defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.

The way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]] in a manner analogous to the way that [[Boolean algebras]] characterize classical [[two-element Boolean algebra|bivalent logic]] (see [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]).

In 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the [[Wajsberg algebra]] as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, "Wajsberg Algebras", ''Stochastica'', VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras ===
{{expand section|the extra axioms|date=August 2014}}
In the 1940s [[Grigore Moisil]] introduced his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]s (LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras) in the hope of giving [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] for the (finitely) ''n''-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz ''n''-valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]]. For the axiomatically more complicated (finitely) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by [[Revaz Grigolia]] and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras; the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are MV-algebras which satisfy some additional axioms, just like the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics have additional axioms added to the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued logic.

In 1982 [[Roberto Cignoli]] published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cignoli, Proper n-Valued Łukasiewicz Algebras as S-Algebras of Łukasiewicz ''n''-Valued Propositional Calculi, Studia Logica, 41, 1982, 3-16, {{doi|10.1007/BF00373490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras that are also MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are precisely Cignoli’s proper n-valued Łukasiewicz algebras.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to functional analysis==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
MV-algebras were related by [[Daniele Mundici]] to [[approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra]]s by establishing a bijective correspondence between all isomorphism classes of AF C*-algebras with lattice-ordered dimension group and all isomorphism classes of countable MV algebras. Some instances of this correspondence include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Countable MV algebra !! AF C*-algebra
|-
| {0, 1} || ℂ
|-
| {0, 1/''n'', ..., 1 } || M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ), i.e. ''n''×''n'' complex matrices
|-
| finite || finite-dimensional
|-
| boolean || commutative
|}

There are multiple frameworks implementing fuzzy logic (type II), and most of them implement what has been called a '''multi-adjoint logic'''. This is no more than the implementation of a MV-algebra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">In economics, the '''marginal rate of substitution''' ('''MRS''') is the rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of [[utility]].  At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical.

==As the slope of indifference curve==
Under the standard assumption of [[neoclassical economics]] that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an [[indifference curve]] (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the [[implicit derivative]]. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is [[Measure (mathematics)|quantified]], the marginal rate of substitution of good or service Y for good or service X (MRS&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;) is also equivalent to the [[marginal utility]] of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=-m_\mathrm{indif}=-(dy/dx) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=MU_x/MU_y \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an [[indifference curve]]), the [[marginal utility]] of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up.

For example, if the MRS&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X.

As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Simple mathematical analysis==
{{See|Implicit differentiation}}

Assume the consumer [[utility function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;U(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''U'' is consumer utility, ''x'' and ''y'' are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via [[partial differentiation]], as follows.

Also, note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x=\partial U/\partial x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_y=\partial U/\partial y &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ MU_x &lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal utility]] with respect to good ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\ MU_y &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility with respect to good ''y''.

By taking the [[total differential]] of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results:
:&lt;math&gt;\ dU=(\partial U/\partial x)dx + (\partial U/\partial y)dy &lt;/math&gt;, or substituting from above,

:&lt;math&gt;\ dU= MU_xdx + MU_ydy &lt;/math&gt;, or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x\frac{dx}{dx}+ MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.
Through any point on the indifference curve, ''dU/dx'' = 0,    because ''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', where ''c'' is a constant. It follows from the above equation that:
::&lt;math&gt; 0 = MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, or rearranging
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y}&lt;/math&gt;

The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest.  That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities:
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}= MU_x/MU_y.\, &lt;/math&gt;.

----

When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the [[budget line]], therefore, with ''m'' representing slope:

:&lt;math&gt;\ m_\mathrm{indif}=m_\mathrm{budget} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ -(MRS_{xy})=-(P_x/P_y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/MU_y=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/P_x=MU_y/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer's budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility).

'''Mindfulness-based stress reduction''' ('''MBSR''') is a program that incorporates [[mindfulness]] to assist people with pain and a range of conditions and life issues that were initially difficult to treat in a hospital setting. Developed at the [[University of Massachusetts]] [[UMass Memorial Health Care|Medical Center]] in the 1970s by Professor [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness [[meditation]], body awareness, and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] to help people become more mindful.&lt;ref name="Time2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pickert K |title=The art of being mindful.

== History ==
In 1979 Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Clinic at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts Medical Center]], and nearly twenty years later the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both these institutions supported the successful growth and implementation of MBSR into hospitals worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, MBSR is practiced as a complementary medicine, commonly in the field of oncology;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the same year, 2015, close to 80% of medical schools are reported&lt;ref name="Buchholz"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laura Buchholz|date=Oct 2015|title=Exploring the Promise of Mindfulness as Medicine|journal=JAMA|volume=314|issue=13|pages=1327–1329|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.7023|pmid=26441167}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer some element of mindfulness training and research and education centers dedicated to mindfulness have proliferated.

==Overview==
MBSR has been described as "a group program that focuses upon the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness".&lt;ref name="MBSR 2003 meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2003.tb04008.x|title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction and health benefits: A meta-analysis|year=2010|last1=Grossman|first1=P|last2=Niemann|first2=L|last3=Schmidt|first3=S|last4=Walach|first4=H|journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|volume=8|issue=4|pages=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MBSR program is an eight-week workshop taught by certified trainers that entails weekly group meetings (two-hour classes) and a one-day retreat (six-hour mindfulness practice) between sessions six and seven, homework (45 minutes daily), and instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning and simple yoga postures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Body scanning is the first prolonged formal mindfulness technique taught during the first four weeks of the workshop, and entails quietly lying on one's back and focusing one's attention on various regions of the body, starting with the toes and moving up slowly to the top of the head.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, etal |title=Meditation practices for health: state of the research |journal=Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep) |volume=|issue=155 |pages=1–263|date=June 2007 |pmid=17764203 |pmc=4780968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MBSR is based on the following tenets: non-judging, non-striving, acceptance, letting go, beginner’s mind, patience, trust, and non-centering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frewen PA, Evans EM, Maraj N, Dozois DJ, Partridge K |title=Letting go: Mindfulness and negative automatic thinking |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=32 |pages=758–774 |date=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10608-007-9142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kabat-Zinn, the basis of MBSR is mindfulness, which he defined as "moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness."&lt;ref name=vid&gt;{{YouTube|id=rSU8ftmmhmw|title=Mindfulness Stress Reduction And Healing}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the program, participants are asked to focus on informal practice as well by incorporating mindfulness into their daily routines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Focusing on the present is thought to heighten sensitivity to the environment and one’s own reactions to it, consequently enhancing self-management and coping. It also provides an outlet from ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, breaking the cycle of these maladaptive cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|last2=Villatte|first2=Matthieu|last3=Levin|first3=Michael|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Mikaela|date=2011-01-01|title=Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=141–168|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|pmid=21219193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific evidence of the debilitating effects of stress on human body and its evolutionary origins were pinpointed by the ground-breaking work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert|date=1982|title=The endocrine stress-response and social status in the wild baboon|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X82900277|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=16|pages=279–292|via=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/0018-506X(82)90027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert Sapolsky]], and explored for lay readers in the book "'''''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'''''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert|publisher=Holt paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=978-0805073690|location=USA|pages=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sapolsky's work consequently promotes mindfulness-based techniques for a better lifestyle and healthy stress management.

== Extent of practice ==
According to a 2014 article in ''Time'' magazine, mindfulness meditation is becoming popular among people who would not normally consider meditation.&lt;ref name="Time2014"/&gt;  The curriculum started by Kabat-Zinn at University of Massachusetts Medical Center has produced nearly 1,000 
certified MBSR instructors who are in nearly every state in the US and more than 30 countries.  Corporations such as [[General Mills]] have made it available to their employees or set aside rooms for meditation. Democratic Congressman [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] published a book in 2012 titled ''A Mindful Nation'' and he has helped organize regular group meditation periods on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Warren |last=Rojas |title=A Meditation on the Quiet Time Caucus |publisher=Roll Call |date=January 8, 2014 |url=http://hoh.rollcall.com/a-meditation-on-the-quiet-time-caucus/ |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of practice ==
Mindfulness-based stress reduction classes and programs are offered by various facilities including hospitals, retreat centers, and various yoga facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcaminohospital.org/stay-healthy/class/mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-program-free-introductory-session|title=Mindfulness based stress reduction at El Camino Hospital, Mountain View, CA (accessed on Nov, 2017).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the programs focus on teaching,
* mind and body awareness to reduce the physiological effects of stress, pain or illness
* non-judgemental awareness in daily life
* promote serenity and clarity in each moment
* to experience more joyful life and access inner resources for healing and stress management
* [[progressive muscle relaxation]] 
* [[Mindfulness|mindfulness meditation]]

== Evaluation of effectiveness ==
Mindfulness-based approaches have been tested for a range of health problems including anxiety disorder, mood disorder, substance abuse disorder, eating disorders, chronic pain, ADHD, insomnia, coping with medical conditions, with many populations including children, adolescents, parents, teachers, therapists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; As a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt; Nearly 100 [[randomized controlled trial]]s had been published by early 2014.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2014&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Hurley |title=Breathing In vs. Spacing Out |date=January 14, 2014 |publisher=New York Times Magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/breathing-in-vs-spacing-out.html |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests mindfulness training improves focus, attention, and ability to work under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1361002 | pmid=16272874 | volume=16 | title=Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | date=November 2005 | author=Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, ''et al.'' | journal=NeuroReport | pages=1893–7 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008914,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/CABN.7.2.109 | volume=7 | title=Mindfulness training modifies subsystems of attention | journal=Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | pages=109–119 | year=2007 | author=Krompinger J., Baime M. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 statement from the [[American Heart Association]] on alternative approaches to lowering [[blood pressure]] concluded that MBSR was not recommended in clinical practice to lower blood pressure.&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brook |first=Robert D |author2=Lawrence J.

Preliminary evidence suggests efficacy of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of [[substance use disorders]]; however, further study is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zgierska A, Rabago D, Chawla N, Kushner K, Koehler R, Marlatt A |title=Mindfulness meditation for substance use disorders: a systematic review |journal=Subst Abus |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=266–94 |year=2009 |pmid=19904664 |pmc=2800788 |doi=10.1080/08897070903250019 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBSR might be beneficial for people with [[fibromyalgia]]: there is no evidence of long-term benefit but low-quality evidence of a small short-term benefit.&lt;ref name=fibr&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lauche R, Cramer H, Dobos G, Langhorst J, Schmidt S |title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of mindfulness-based stress reduction for the fibromyalgia syndrome |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=500–10 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24290038 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2013.10.010 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a meta-analysis was conducted by Hoffman and colleagues exploring the efficacy of MBSR and similarly structured programs for adults with symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The meta-analysis showed that between pre and post testing there was significant medium within in-group effect sizes observed on anxiety and depression and also small to medium between-group effect sizes when comparing wait-list, treatment as usual, and active treatment (MBSR), further supporting the literature that states mindfulness-based therapies can be beneficial in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; A broader meta-analysis conducted in 2004 by Grossman and colleagues found similar effect sizes when testing the physical and mental health outcomes following MBSR treatment.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9492">'''Naïve physics''' or '''folk physics''' is the untrained human [[perception]] of basic physical [[phenomena]]. In the field of [[artificial intelligence]] the study of naïve [[physics]] is a part of the effort to formalize the [[common knowledge]] of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Hayes|first=Pat|title= The naive physics manifesto|journal=Expert systems in the micro-electronic age|editor=Michie, Donald|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-85224-381-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism.

Naïve physics can also be defined as an intuitive understanding all humans have about objects in the physical world.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goswami |first=U. |year=2008 |title=Cognitive Development: the learning brain |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Psychology Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists are delving deeper into these phenomena with promising results.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Psychological studies indicate that certain notions of the physical world are innate in all of us.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Examples==
Some examples of naïve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature:

* What goes up must come down
* A dropped object falls straight down
* A solid object cannot pass through another solid object
* A [[vacuum]] sucks things towards it
* An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense
* Two events are either simultaneous or they are not

Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by [[Aristotle]] and the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastics]] in [[Western civilization]]. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and others. The idea of [[absolute simultaneity]] survived until 1905, when the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] and its supporting experiments discredited it.

==Psychological research==
The increasing sophistication of technology make possible more research on knowledge acquisition.  Researchers measure physiological responses (like [[heart rate]] or [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]) to quantify reaction to a particular stimulus.  Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can.

Research in naïve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get [[bored]] looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; That boredom is called [[habituation]]. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus.

Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, he or she will attend to it until it makes sense. Until recently,{{When|date=August 2013}} psychologists believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that defy what is physically possible. Such studies conclude that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world.

Smith and Cassati (1994) have reviewed the early history of naïve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist [[Paolo Bozzi]].&lt;ref name="smith&amp;casati"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/naivephysics.html |last1=Smith |first1=B. | author1link = Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|last2=Casati |first2=R. |year=1994 |title=Naive Physics: An Essay in Ontology |journal=[[Philosophical Psychology]] |volume=7 |number=2 |pages=225–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of experiments===
The basic experimental procedure of a study on naïve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant's expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant's attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

====Solidity====
An experiment that tests an infant's knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0˚ to 180˚ in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in probable event trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | authorlink = Renee Baillargeon | year = 1994 | title = How Do Infants Learn About the Physical World? | url = | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 133–140 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occlusion====
An occlusion event tests the knowledge that an object exists even if it is not immediately visible. [[Jean Piaget]] originally called this concept [[object permanence]]. When Piaget formed [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|his developmental theory]] in the 1950s, he claimed that object permanence is learned, not innate. The children's game [[Peekaboo|peek-a-boo]] is a classic example of this phenomenon, and one which obscures the true grasp infants have on permanence. To disprove this notion, an experimenter designs an impossible occlusion event. The infant is shown a block and a transparent screen. The infant habituates, then a solid panel is placed in front of the objects to block them from view. When the panel is removed, the block is gone, but the screen remains. The infant is confused because the block has disappeared indicating that he/she understands that objects maintain location in space and do not simply disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Infants' Physical World | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 89–94 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Containment====
A containment event tests the infant's recognition that an object that is bigger than a container cannot fit completely into that container. [[Elizabeth Spelke]], one of the psychologists who founded the naïve physics movement, identified the continuity principle, which conveys an understanding that objects exist continuously in time and space.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; Both occlusion and containment experiments hinge on the continuity principle. In the experiment, the infant is shown a tall cylinder and a tall cylindrical container. The experimenter demonstrates that the tall cylinder fits into the tall container, and the infant is bored by the expected physical outcome. The experimenter then places the tall cylinder completely into a much shorter cylindrical container, and the impossible event confuses the infant. Extended attention demonstrates the infant's understanding that containers cannot hold objects that exceed them in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | last2 = Hespos | first2 = S.J. | year = 2001 | title = Infant's Knowledge About Occlusion and Containment Events: A Surprising Discrepancy | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 141–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baillargeon's research===
The published findings of [[Renee Baillargeon]] brought innate knowledge to the forefront in psychological research. Her research method centered on the visual preference technique. Baillargeon and her followers studied how infants show preference to one stimulus over another. Experimenters judge preference by the length of time an infant will stare at a stimulus before habituating. Researchers believe that preference indicates the infant's ability to discriminate between the two events.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

{{Marxism}}
'''''Petite bourgeoisie''''' ({{IPA-fr|pətit buʁʒwazi}}, literally '''small bourgeoisie'''), also '''''petty bourgeoisie''''', is a French term (sometimes derogatory) referring to a social class comprising semi-autonomous peasantry and small-scale merchants whose politico-economic ideological stance in times of socioeconomic stability is determined by reflecting that of a haute ("high") [[bourgeoisie]], with which the petite bourgeoisie seeks to identify itself and whose bourgeois morality it strives to imitate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Habermas]] [1968] ''Technology and Science as Ideology'' quotation: {{quotation|Their socialization seems to have been achieved in subcultures freed from immediate economic compulsion, in which the traditions of bourgeois morality and their petit-bourgeois derivatives have lost their function.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is politico-economic and references [[historical materialism]]. It originally denoted a sub-stratum of the [[Middle class|middle]] [[Social class|classes]] in the 18th and early-19th centuries. In the mid-19th century, the German economist [[Karl Marx]] and other [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorists used the term "petite bourgeoisie" to identify the socio-economic stratum of the bourgeoisie that comprised small-scale capitalists such as shop-keepers and workers who manage the production, distribution and/or exchange of commodities and/or services owned by their bourgeois employers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm#petite-bourgeoisie "Encyclopaedia of Marxism – Glossary"]. Retrieved 6 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm ''The Communist Manifesto'' – Chapter 1]. Retrieved 6 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]]]]
The petite bourgeoisie is economically distinct from the [[proletariat]] and the [[lumpenproletariat]] social-class strata who rely entirely on the sale of their labor-power for survival; and also are distinct from the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] class [[Bourgeoisie|haute bourgeoisie]] ("high bourgeoisie") who own the [[means of production]] and thus can buy the labor-power of the proletariat and lumpenproletariat to work the means of production. Though the petite bourgeoisie can buy the labor of others, they typically work alongside their employees, unlike the haute bourgeoisie.

== Role in fascism ==
Historically, Karl Marx predicted that the petite bourgeoisie were to lose in the course of economic development. In the event, [[R. J. B. Bosworth]] suggested that they were to become the political mainstay of [[fascism]], which political reaction was their terroristic response to the inevitable loss of power (economic, political and social) to the haute bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. B. Bosworth, ''Mussolini's Italy'', p. 134 {{ISBN|1-59420-078-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Reich]] also highlighted the principal support of the rise of fascism in Germany given by the petite bourgeoisie and middle class in ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]''. He claimed that the middle classes were a hotbed for political reaction due to their reliance on the patriarchal family (according to Reich, small businesses are often self-exploiting enterprises of families headed by the father, whose morality binds the family together in their somewhat precarious economic position) and the sexual repression that underlies it.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/MassPsychologyOfFascism-WilhelmReich/mass-psychology-reich_djvu.txt ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'']. Retrieved 13 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary treatment of the petite bourgeoisie ==
{{disputed section|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]]]
[[File:Henrik_Ibsen_by_Gustav_Borgen_NFB-19775.jpg|thumb|[[Henrik Ibsen]]]]
[[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote that "the petty bourgeois is spiritless[.] [...] Devoid of imagination, as the petty bourgeois always is, he lives within a certain orbit of trivial experiences as to how things come about, what is possible, what usually happens, no matter whether he is a [[bartender|tapster]] or a prime minister. This is the way the petty bourgeois has lost himself and God".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sickness Unto Death'', Penguin Books, 1989, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the petite bourgeoisie exemplifies a spiritual emptiness that is rooted in an overemphasis on the worldly, rather than the inwardness of the [[self]]. However, Kierkegaard's indictment relies less on a class analysis of the petite bourgeoisie than on the perception of a worldview which was common in his middle-class milieu.

In fact, though there have been many depictions of the petite bourgeoisie in literature as well as in cartoons, based on an image of their overly conventional practicality, the realities of the petite bourgeoisie throughout the 19th century were more complex.&lt;ref&gt;''The Petite Bourgeoisie in Europe, 1780–1914: Enterprise, Family and Independence'', Geoffrey Crossic and Heinz Gerhardt-Haupt, Routledge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; All the same, writers have been concerned with petite bourgeois morality and behavior and have portrayed them as undesirable characters. [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' was a play written in direct response to the reception of another one of his plays for making "indecent" references to syphilis and in general his work was considered scandalous in its disregard for the morality of the period. Later, [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s concern with [[Nazism]] and his Marxist politics ([[Petite bourgeoisie#Role in fascism|see above]]) got him interested in exploring the petite bourgeois mind and this interest led him to represent the petite bourgeoisie repeatedly throughout his work (one was even titled ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|The Seven Deadly Sins of the Petite Bourgeoisie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"'The Little House in Louisiana': The Role of the Petite Bourgeoisie in Brecht's Concept of Nazism", ''Brecht Unbound'', Associated University Presses.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity, and Meaningful Work and Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=James C.|title=[[Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity, and Meaningful Work and Play]]|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton &amp; Oxford|isbn=978-0-691-15529-6|pages=110–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James C. Scott]] dedicates an entire chapter to describing some features of the petite bourgeoisie. First, he points out the contempt of this class by Marxists due to the ambiguity of their political position. He further points out that this position of contempt or distaste encompasses both the socialist bloc and large capitalist democracies due to the difficulty of monitoring, taxing and policing of this class which results from complexity, variety and mobility of activities taken on by this class. He points out the petite bourgeoisie has existed for most of civilized history and that even those who are not part of the class have to some degree desired to become small property owners due to the conferred autonomy and social standing. He continues that the desire to keep, restore land has been the leitmotif of most radically egalitarian mass movements. He argues that the petite bourgeoisie have an indispensable economic role in terms of invention and innovation, citing as an example software [[startup company|startups]] that develop ideas which are then usually bought by larger firms. He also points out that small shopkeepers provide several "unpaid" social services such as: {{quotation|[...] informal social work, public safety, the aesthetic pleasures of an animated and interesting streetscape, a large variety of social experiences and personalized services, acquaintance networks, informal neighborhood news and gossip, a building block of social solidarity and public action, and (in the case of the smallholding peasantry) good steward-ship of the land}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51618">'''Political violence''' is [[violence]] perpetrated by people or [[government]]s to achieve political goals. It can describe violence used by a [[State (polity)|state]] against other states ([[war]]) or against non-state actors (e.g. [[police brutality]], [[counter-insurgency]], [[genocide]]). It can also describe politically-motivated violence by non-state actors against a state (e.g. [[rebellion]], [[rioting]]) or against other non-state actors. Non-action on the part of a government can also be characterized as a form of political violence, such as refusing to alleviate [[famine]] or otherwise denying resources to politically identifiable groups within their territory. 

Due to the imbalances of power between state and non-state actors, political violence often takes the form of [[asynchronous warfare]] where neither side is able to directly assault the other, instead relying on tactics such as [[terrorism]] and [[guerrilla warfare]], and often include attacks on [[civilian]] or otherwise [[non-combatant]] targets that are perceived as a proxy for the opposing faction.

Many groups and individuals believe that their political systems will never respond to their demands and thus believe that violence is not only justified but also necessary in order to achieve their political objectives. Similarly, many governments around the world believe they need to use violence in order to intimidate their populace into acquiescence. At other times, governments use force in order to defend their country from outside invasion or other threats of force and to coerce other governments or conquer territory.&lt;ref name="Nelson Education"&gt;[http://polisci.nelson.com/violence.html Definition of "political violence"], Nelson Education; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Political violence varies widely in form, severity, and practice. In political science, a common organizing framework is to consider types of violence by the relevant actors: violence between non-state actors, one-sided violence perpetrated by a state actor against civilians, and violence between states.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Violence between non-state actors ===
Fighting between non-state actors without state security forces playing a direct role in the conflict.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"&gt;[http://www.hsrgroup.org/docs/Publications/HSR2013/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf Human Security Report Project 2013 Report]; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

==== Ethnic conflict ====
{{Main article|Ethnic conflict}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
An '''ethnic conflict''' is fought between [[ethnic group]]s. While at times a specific ethnic group may have the backing (whether formal or informal) of the state (or conversely, a specific ethnic group may be targeted by the state), ethnic conflict can also take place between two groups without the direct intervention of the state, or despite the state's attempts to mediate between groups.

=== One-sided violence by non-state actors ===
==== Terrorism ====
{{Main article|Terrorism}}
'''Terrorism''' can be directed by non-state actors against political targets other than the state (e.g. [[Yishai Schlissel|Stabbing attacks at gay pride parades in Jerusalem]], [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]]). Because terrorism is a tactic often used by the weaker side of a conflict, it may also fall under violence between a state and non-state actor.

While there lacks a concrete [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of terrorism]], the [[United States Department of Defense]] however defines terrorism as, "the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorism-research.com|title=Terrorism Research - What is Terrorism?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419112023/http://www.terrorism-research.com|archivedate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is and is not considered terrorism is itself a controversial political question, as states have often used the label of terrorism to exclusively demonize the actions of their enemies while obscuring "legal" violence administered by the state (e.g. [[The Troubles]], [[CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion]], [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Political Terrorism: A New Guide To Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, And Literature'' by Albert J. Jongman&lt;!-- publisher, year, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One-sided violence by the state ===
{{further|Mass murder#By states}}
The use of force by an organized armed group, be it a government or non-state group, which results in the deaths of civilians. According to the [[Human Security Report Project]], a campaign of one-sided violence is recorded whenever violence against civilians committed by one group results in at least 25 reported deaths in a calendar year.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Genocide ====
{{Main article|Genocide}}One form of political violence is genocide. '''Genocide''' is commonly defined as "the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]], [[Religious denomination|religious]], or [[nationality|national]] group",&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{cite book |author=Funk, T.

[[The Holocaust]] is the most cited [[Genocides in history|historical example of genocide]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==== Torture ====
{{Main article|Torture}}
Torture is the act of inflicting severe pain (whether physical or psychological) as a means of punishment, revenge, forcing information or confession, or simply as an act of cruelty. Torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries in the 21st century. It is considered a [[human rights violation]] and is declared unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] have officially agreed not to torture prisoners in armed conflicts. National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by military police personnel of the [[United States Army]]. Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] monitor abuses of human rights and reports widespread violations of human torture in by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 Report 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601024732/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 |date=2005-06-01 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Capital punishment ====
{{Main article|Capital punishment}}
Capital punishment is the sentence of death upon a person by the state as a punishment for an offense. This does not include [[extrajudicial killing]], which is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. The [[use of capital punishment by country]] varies, but according to Amnesty International 58 countries still actively use the death penalty, and in 2010, 23 countries carried out executions and 67 imposed death sentences. Methods of execution in 2010 included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death Penalty in 2010|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2010|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]] which called for worldwide abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Penalty in International Law|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/international-law|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police brutality ====
{{Main article|Police brutality}}
Police brutality is another form of political violence. It is most commonly described in juxtaposition with the term excessive force. Police brutality can be defined as "a civil rights violation that occurs when a police officer acts with excessive force by using an amount of force with regards to a civilian that is more than necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/police-brutality/|title=Police Brutality Law &amp; Legal Definitions |publisher=uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police brutality and the use of excessive force are present throughout the world and in the United States alone, 4,861 incidences of police misconduct were reported during 2010 (see also [[Police brutality (United States)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.injusticeeverywhere.com/?p=4053|title=2010 NPMSRP Police Misconduct Statistical Report -Draft- - PoliceMisconduct.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, there were 6,826 victims involved and 247 fatalities.

==== Famine ====
{{Main article|Famine}}
&lt;!-- Is Bengal famine that occurred during WWII in India an example of famine as violence by state? Various researchers, including Amrtya Sen has shown how British government had diverted resources to war.  --&gt;Famine can be initiated or prolonged in order to deny resources, compel obedience, or to depopulate a region with a recalcitrant or untrusted populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/starvation-is-being-used-as-a-weapon-of-war-in-syria|title=Famine Is Being Used as a Weapon of War in Syria|work=VICE|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/10/zimbabwe.famine|title=Famine becomes Mugabe weapon|author=Peter Beaumont|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2002-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/01/03/war-and-famine-in-ireland-1580-1700/#.VZb94Pmqqko|title=War and Famine in Ireland, 1580-1700|work=The Irish Story|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence between a state and non-state actor ===
At least one of the warring parties involved is the government of a state.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Rioting ====
{{Main article|Riot}} 
A '''riot''' can be described as a violent disturbance by a group of individuals formed to protest perceived wrongs and/or injustice. These can range from poverty and inequality to unemployment and government oppression. They can manifest themselves in a number of ways but most commonly in the form of property damage. [[Riot]]s are characterized by their lack of predictability and the anonymity of their participants. Both make it difficult for authorities to identify those participating.&lt;ref&gt;Wada, George, and James C. Davies. "Riots and Rioters". The Western Political Quarterly 10.4 (1957): 864–874. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots have been analyzed in a number of ways but most recently in the context of the frustration-aggression model theory, expressing that the aggression seen in most riots is a direct result of a groups frustration with a particular aspect of their lives.Widespread and prolonged rioting can lead to and/or produce rebellion or revolution. There are also a number of different types of riots including but not limited to police riots, [[race riots|race riot]], [[prison riots]], and [[sports riots|sport riot]].

==== Revolution ====

==== Civil War ====
{{Main article|Civil war}}
Also known as an intrastate war, a civil war is a war fought within the same state or country between organized groups. Less commonly, it can also be fought between two countries that have been created from one previously unified state. Often these conflicts involve one group wishing to take control of a region or expressing dissatisfaction with the government. There is typically a desire to overthrow the existing power or at least change some of their policies. In many cases, an outside power may intervene on behalf of one side if they share their ideology or condemn the methods/motives of their opponents.

==== Counter-insurgency ====
{{Main article|Counter-insurgency}}
'''Counter-insurgency''', another form of political violence, describes a spectrum of actions taken by the recognized government of a state to contain or quell an [[insurgency]] taken up against it.&lt;ref&gt;An ''insurgency'' is a [[rebellion]] against a constituted authority (for example an authority recognized as such by the [[United Nations]]) when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as [[belligerent]]s ([[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 "insurgent B. n. One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent.")&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different doctrines, theories, and tactics espoused regarding counter-insurgency that aim to protect the authority of the government and to reduce or eliminate the supplanting authority of the insurgents. Because it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a [[non-combatant]], and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often rested on a confused, relativistic, or otherwise [[situational]] distinction between insurgents and non-combatants. Counter-insurgency operations are common during [[war]], [[Military occupation|occupation]] and armed [[rebellion]]s.

=== War between states ===
{{Main article|War}}
'''War''' is a state of organized, armed, and often prolonged conflict carried on between [[State (polity)|states]], [[nation]]s, or other parties&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; typified by extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality.&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century: the death toll of [[World War II]], estimated at more than 60 million, surpasses all other war death tolls by a factor of two. It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Obermeyer Z, Murray CJ, Gakidou E |title=Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1482–6 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18566045 |pmc=2440905 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a137 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Scholarship and data suggests that violence has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/14/genocide-is-going-out-of-fashion/|title=Genocide is Going Out of Fashion|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=126956|title=Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide|last=Goldstein|first=Joshua|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-0452298590|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, scholars have started to question this long-held belief.

=== Long-run trends ===
Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2005, violent conflict around the world dropped by 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, A., 2007, 'Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline', Coping with Crisis Working Paper Series, International Peace Academy, New York&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]], [[Steven Pinker]] argues that this decline has not occurred over the past 60 years, but has been going on for over the past millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datasets on political violence have shown similar trends.

For example, the Center for Systemic Peace finds that in the post-World War II era armed conflict was at its peak when the Soviet Union collapsed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html|title=Conflict Trends|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the levels of armed conflict declined. Recently, armed conflict has begun to increase as political violence in the Middle East and Africa begins to increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] (UCDP), another project that collects armed conflict data, has found similar trends as well. UCDP defines armed conflict as conflict that involves the government of a state which "results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/|title=UCDP Definitions|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their overview of armed conflict, UCDP has found that the number of armed conflicts in the world has decreased since the end of the Cold War, yet, there has been some recent upward trends.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Armed conflicts, 1946–2014|url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/52/4/536.abstract|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343315595927|pmid=|access-date=|volume=52|issue=4|pages=536–550|last1=Pettersson|first1=Therése|last2=Wallensteen|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past ten years, the UCDP has found an upward trend in the number of internationalized armed conflicts, "a conflict between a government of a state and internal opposition groups with intervention from other states."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Critique ====
Recently, the conventional wisdom that violent conflict has declined is being challenged. Scholars argue that the current data, focus on the number of battle deaths per country per year, are misleading.

Tanisha Fazal argues that wars have become less fatal because of medical advancements that help keep more people alive during wars. Therefore, the battle death threshold used by the UCDP and other organizations to determine cases of armed conflict is misleading. A conflict "that produced 1,000 battle deaths in 1820 will likely produce many fewer overall casualties (where casualties, properly understood, include the dead and wounded) than a conflict with 1,000 battle deaths today."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/04/the-reports-of-wars-demise-have-been-exaggerated/|title=The reports of war's demise have been exaggerated|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current data makes it seem like, war is becoming less frequent, when it is not.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=Summer 2014|title=Dead Wrong? Battle Deaths, Military Medicine, and Exaggerated Reports of War's Demise|url=|journal=International Security|doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00166|pmid=|volume=39|pages=95–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear F. Braumoeller argues that looking at data on per-capita death is a "misleading and irrelevant statistic" because it does not tell us how wars actually happen.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=2317269|title=Is War Disappearing?|last=Braumoeller|first=Bear|date=August 27, 2013|website=|publisher=APSA Chicago 2013 Meeting|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in battle-related deaths can mean that population growth is outpacing war deaths or that "fewer people are exposed to risk of death from war".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Instead, we should examine the willingness of a state to go to war. Braumoeller creates a new metric for conflicted called the "use of force", which is the number of militarized dispute that reaches at least a level 4 on the 5-point [[Correlates of War]] Militarized Interstate Dispute scale. He finds that use of force has held steady from the 1800s through the [[World War I|First World War]], but after World War I the use of force has steadily increased. Braumoeller creates another metric called "uses of force per relevant dyad", which is the use of force between neighboring states or states with one major power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using this metric he finds that there is no downward trend in the rates of conflict initiation since the post-World War II period. Additionally, he finds that the rates of conflict have remain steady over the past two hundred years and the slight increases and decreases in use of force are random.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Current trends ===

==== Armed conflicts ====
In 2014, UCDP estimates that 126,059 people were killed in organized violence, which is the highest fatality count in the post-Cold War period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] had the most violent conflict followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there were 40 armed conflicts active in 27 locations in the world. This is the largest number of conflicts reported since 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Regionally, Asia had the largest amount of violent conflict at 14, followed by Africa at 12, Europe at six, Middle East at six, and the Americas at two.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During that year, four new conflicts began, all of them in [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|Ukraine]]. Three conflicts were restarted by new actors in &amp;nbsp;Egypt, Lebanon, and Libya. Additionally, six conflicts were restarted by previously registered actors in "[[Armenian–Azerbaijani border conflict|Azerbaijan (Nagorno-Karabakh),]] India ([[Garo Hills|Garoland]]), [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|India–Pakistan]], [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel (Palestine),]] [[Northern Mali conflict|Mali (Azawad)]], and [[2015 Kokang offensive|Myanmar (Kokang)]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, seven conflicts in 2013 were no longer active in 2014. The conflicts were in [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)|Central African Republic]], Ethiopia (Oromiya), Malaysia (Sabah), [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Karen)]], [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Shan)]], Mozambique, and [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Turkey (Kurdistan)]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of the 40 conflicts, 11 have been classified at the level of war, which means that there were at least 1,000 deaths in one calendar year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The conflict between India and Pakistan was the only interstate conflict, conflict between two or more states. Out of the remaining 39 conflicts, 13 were internationalized, a conflict between a government and internal opposition group where other states intervene. The percentage of internationalized conflict is 33% (13/39), which is the largest proportion of external actors in intrastate conflicts since the post-World War II era.

==== Terrorism ====
Just like armed conflict, there was an increase in fatalities associated with terrorism. In 2014, the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]] reported 13,463 terrorist attacks in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/150618_Patterns_in_Global_Terrorism_in_2014.pdf|title=BROAD PATTERNS IN GLOBAL TERRORISM IN 2014|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony|date=June 19, 2015|website=Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks resulted in at least 32,700 deaths and 34,700 injuries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, more than 9,400 people were kidnapped or taken hostage. Compared to 2013, the number of terrorist attacks increased by 35% and the total fatalities increased by 81%.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2014, the five countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks were Iraq, [[Terrorism in Pakistan|Pakistan]], Afghanistan, [[Terrorism in India|India]], and Nigeria. In 2013, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and the [[Terrorism in the Philippines|Philippines]] were the countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, the perpetrators responsible for the most terrorist attacks were [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Taliban|the Taliban]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], [[Boko Haram]], and Maoists. Fifty-five percent of the targets were either private citizens, private property, or police. 66% of attacks in Nigeria and 41% of attacks in Iraq targeted private citizens and property.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Global Terrorism Database]] estimates that &amp;nbsp;that between 2004 and 2013, about 50% of all terrorist attacks, and 60% of fatalities due to terrorist attacks, took place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Theories==

Theories of political violence can be organized by their [[level of analysis]]:  
* [[Level of analysis|Macro theories]] explain how political, economic, and social processes cause political violence  
* [[Level of analysis|Micro theories]] discuss political violence processes that involve individuals and households, like who participates in violence and what motivates people to participate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balcells|first=Laia|date=December 2014|title=Bridging Micro and Macro Approaches on Civil Wars and Political Violence: Issues, Challenges, and the Way Forward|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/8/1343.abstract|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|doi=10.1177/0022002714547905|pmid=|access-date=|volume=58|issue=8|pages=1343–1359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macro===

====Social conflict theory ====
[[Social conflict theory]] is a [[Marxist]]-based [[social theory]] which states that social systems reflect the vested interests of those who own and control resources. The people in power use the political and economic institutions to exploit groups with less power. This causes the rest of society to become alienated or psychologically separated from the people in power. Revolutions occur to break down the social and economic separation between the people in power and the exploited people and "to achieve equity and social unity".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collective Political Violence: An Introduction to the Theories and Cases of Violent Conflicts|last=Conteh-Morgan|first=Earl|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415947435|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War's inefficiency puzzle ====
[[War's inefficiency puzzle]] explains why states go to war even though war is costly. In [[James Fearon]]’s ''Rationalist Explanations for War'', he asserts war is costly and that creates an incentive to bargain with the other side. However, states do not bargain and instead go to war because of private information on the capability to fight and the incentives to misrepresent this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|date=Summer 1995|title=Rationalist Explanations for War|jstor=2706903|journal=International Organization|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid=|volume=49|issue=3|pages=379–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Functionalism ====
[[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]] sees society as "an organism whose entire system has to be in good working order for systemic equilibrium to be maintained."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, when there is an unexpected shock to the system, society becomes disorientated allowing for collective violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mass society ====
[[Mass society]] argues that violent social movements come from people who are isolated socially and from political institutions. People who are alienated are easily convinced to join radical or extremist movements.

==== Resource mobilization ====
[[Resource mobilization]] is a theory on social movement that emphasizes the capacity of competing groups to organize and use adequate resources to achieve their goals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resources can be time, money, organizational skills, and certain social or political opportunities. Political violence occurs when individuals are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.

==== Primordialism ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Primordialism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. "Interethnic differences based on racial, language, religious, regional characteristics, and other visible markers produce interethnic conflicts because members of that same group emotionally identify with their in-group, but feel no such identify with those outside their ethnic group."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

==== Instrumentalist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Instrumentalism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnicity is not inherent in human nature. Conflict occurs when leaders manipulate ethnicity for the sake of political power or economic gain.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashutoshvarshney.net/wp-content/files_mf/varshneyethnicityandethnicconflict.pdf|title=Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflict|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constructivist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Constructivist]] is an explanations of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnic and national identities are socially constructed and are formed through social, economic and political processes, like colonization and conquest. Ethnic conflict is a product of the factors shaping ethnic identity and not from ethnicity itself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Youth bulge ====
A [[Population pyramid|youth bulge]] occurs when there is disproportionate percentage of a state population being between the ages of 15 and 24 years old. It occurs when infant mortality rates decrease and fertility rate increase. This youth bulge increases the working-age population; however, it does not translate to more jobs being available, which leads to severe unemployment. This will cause the young adult male population to "prolong dependency on parents, diminish self-esteem and fuel frustrations".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/effects-youth-bulge-civil-conflicts/p13093|title=The Effects of 'Youth Bulge' on Civil Conflicts|last=Beehner|first=Lionel|date=April 27, 2007|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads the youth to "seek social and economic advancement by alternative, extralegal means", which means that the [[opportunity cost]]s to join armed movements are low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Micro===

====Rational choice theory====
[[Rational choice theory]] is a decision-making approach in which the decisions makers compare the expected utility of competing options and select the option that produces the most favorable outcome. Political violence occurs when the benefits in participating in political violence outweighs the costs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Relative deprivation ====
In ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr]] uses [[Relative deprivation|relative deprivation theory]] to explain why men commit acts of violence. As Gurr explains, relative deprivation "is defined as actors' perception of discrepancy between their value expectations and their value capabilities."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Men Rebel|last=Gurr|first=Ted|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1594519147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, relative deprivation is the gap between the wants and needs we{{Who|date=August 2016}} feel we deserve versus what we are capable of "getting and keeping."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The collective discontent, the gap between the expected and achieved welfare, leads people to resort to violence.

==== Collective action theory ====
[[Collective action theory]] explains why people participate in rebellions.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Edward N.|last2=Opp|first2=Karl-Dieter|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and Rebellious Collective Action|jstor=1958269|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=80|issue=2|pages=471–488|doi=10.2307/1958269}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person decides to participate or not participate in a rebellion based on the benefits and costs. Generally, people decide to be [[Free rider problem|free riders]] and not to participate in the rebellion. These people will still receive the benefits of the rebellion since the benefits are a [[public good]]. However, if people are expected to receive [[private good]]s, like material rewards or power, then that person is expected to rebel.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Greed versus grievance ====
[[Greed versus grievance]] provides two lines of explanations as to why individuals will fight. Individuals are said to be motivated by greed when they decide to join a conflict in an effort to better their situation and find that benefits of joining a rebellion or any kind of collective violence is greater than not joining.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Hoeffler|first2=Anke|date=2004-10-01|title=Greed and grievance in civil war|url=http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/563|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|language=en|volume=56|issue=4|pages=563–595|doi=10.1093/oep/gpf064|issn=0030-7653|citeseerx=10.1.1.17.7530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are said to be motivated by grievance when they fight over "high inequality, a lack of political rights or ethnic and religious divisions in society."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In "Greed and Grievance in Civil War", Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler argue that greed is a better predictor of participating in violence than grievance.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

In the aftermath of political violence, there are many changes that occur within the state, society, and the individual.

=== Macro ===
Social science literature that examines how political violence affects the region, state, nation, and society.

==== State-building ====

Charles Tilly argues that "war making", eliminating rivals outside a territory, "state making", eliminating rivals within a territory, "protection", protecting subjects within a territory, and "extraction", extracting resources to "[carry] out the first three activities", are what defines a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Making and State Making as Organized Crime|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521313131|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four actives depend on the state's ability to use and monopolize violence. In other words, politically and non-politically motivated violence is necessary in state-building and building [[fiscal capacity]].

=== Micro===

There are a growing number of social science studies that examine how political violence affects individuals and households. It is important to keep in mind that what happens at the individual and household level can affect what happens at the macro level. For example, political violence effects an individual's income, health, and education attainment, but these individual consequences combined can effect a state or nation's economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2010-03-01|title=Civil War|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=48|issue=1|pages=3–57|doi=10.1257/jel.48.1.3|issn=0022-0515}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the macro and micro consequences of political violence do not occur in a vacuum.

====Political impacts====

There are empirical studies that link violence with increases in political participation. One [[natural experiment]] examines the effect of being abducted by [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[Lord's Resistance Army|LRA]] on political participation. An abducted male Ugandan youth, or in other words a former child soldier, had a greater probability of voting for [[Ugandan multi-party referendum, 2005|Uganda's 2005 referendum]] and being a community mobilizer/leader than a male Ugandan youth who wasn't abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|date=2009-05-01|title=From Violence to Voting: War and Political Participation in Uganda|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003055409090212|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=103|issue=2|pages=231–247|doi=10.1017/S0003055409090212|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this effect is not just contained to Uganda. Another natural experiment on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or made refugees, were more likely to register to vote, attend community meetings, and participate in local political and community groups than households that did not experience violence.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=John|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2009-12-01|title=War and local collective action in Sierra Leone|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272709000942|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=93|issue=11–12|pages=1144–1157|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic impacts====

A study on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or displaced, did not have long-term impacts on owning assets, child nutrition, consumption expenditures and earnings.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"/&gt;

== Datasets ==

===Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) ===
{{Main article|Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project}}

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) is a project that collates data on political violence and protest in developing states, from 1997 to the present. As of early 2016, ACLED has recorded over 100,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection focused on Africa and ten countries in South and Southeast Asia. The data can be used for medium- and long-term analysis and mapping of political violence across developing countries through use of historical data from 1997, as well as informing humanitarian and development work in crisis and conflict-affected contexts through real time data updates and reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/|title=ACLED - ACLED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACLED defines "political violence" as "the use of force by a group with a political purpose or motivation." The database uses this definition to catalog a number of what it refers to as political events across Africa and South East Asia. Political events are described as "a single altercation where often force is used by one or more groups for a political end. The data project catalogs nine different types of events.&lt;ref name="acleddata.com"&gt;http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ACLED_Codebook_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Security Report Project===

The [[Human Security Report Project]] or '''HSRP''' catalogs global and regional trends in organized violence, their causes and consequences. Research findings and analyses are published in the Human Security Report, Human Security Brief series, and the miniAtlas of Human Security based in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/about-hsrp/about-us.aspx|title=Human Security Report Project: About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data from the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], the report tracks 5 types of violence 
* '''State-based armed conflict''' are cataloged as international conflicts and civil wars—in which at least
one of the warring parties is the government of a state.
'''Interstate Conflicts''' are conflicts between two states. 
'''Intrastate Conflicts''' happen within a state such as a civil war. 
* '''Non-state armed conflicts''' are conflicts which consist of fighting between two armed groups,
neither of which is the government of a state
* '''One-sided violence''' is thought of as targeted attacks against unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

'''Pseudophilosophy''' is a term, often considered derogatory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, applied to criticize philosophical ideas or systems which are claimed not to meet an expected set of standards. The etymology of the term is based on appending the prefix [[pseudo-]] ("false") to the word [[philosophy]] ("love of wisdom"); another term to describe false philosophy is "cod philosophy".

==Targets==
{{Cleanup-list|section|date=August 2016}}
The term has been used against many different targets, including:
* To criticise [[dogmatism]] in general, “which is dissolved when philosophy incorporates the scientific method”;{{sfn|Kearney|Rainwater|1996|p=60}}
* To criticise any philosophy in general which does not meet the criteria of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] or [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]];{{sfn|Taylor|Kelly|2013|p=116-117}} 
* To criticise specific philosophical schools, traditions and systems:
** [[Platonism]] as "dogmatic [[metaphysics]]"{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}{{refn|group=note|Kant called Plato's ideas "dogmatic metaphysics" and "mysticism".{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}}}

* To criticise some forms of idealism:
** [[German idealism]],{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}} especially [[Hegel]];{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}{{refn|group=note|Bunge mentions Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, "and their Britisn followers".{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}
** [[Continental philosophy]];{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}}{{sfn|Kritzman|Reilly|2007|p=368}}{{refn|group=note|Soccio mentions Heidegger;{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} Kritzman mentions [[Albert Camus]].{{sfn|Kritzman|Reilly|2007|p=368}}}}
** [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]]{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}

* To criticise several ([[Pseudoscience|pseudo]])sciences:
** [[Social Darwinism]];{{sfn|Adler|Pouwels|2010|p=545}}

* To criticise some [[Religion|theistic worldviews]]:
** [[Catholicism]];{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}{{refn|group=note|Heidegger "lambastes Catholicism as a "dogmatic and casuistic pseudo-philosophy, which poses as a particular system of religion," a system that "totally excludes an original and genuine religious experience of value."{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}}}
** [[Mysticism]];{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}
** Modern [[spirituality]] and [[esotericism]]{{refn|group=note|Irwin and Gracia: "Philosophy needs to replace pseudo-philosophy (crystals, astrology, tarot cards)".{{sfn|Irwin|Gracia|2007|p=48}}}}

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

Pieper notes that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[Transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', describes ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth." Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

According to Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy  is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]] (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959), an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to Bunge,
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy - an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

However his opinion is not widely held of Hegelianism or German Idealism.

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Jonathan Chait  used  the term in the title "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy" of an article in ''New Republic'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt;

'''Pāguññatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "proficiency", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāya-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of mental body (or proficiency of cetisakas)
* ''Citta-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of consciousness (or proficiency of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2374-2377}}
:The twofold proficiency has the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness. It is manifested as absence of disability. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to lack of faith, etc., which cause unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 48, 49) this pair of cetasikas consists in fitness, competence and efficiency. ''Pāguññatā'' is fitness, competence or efficiency in the performance of kusala.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that proficiency of cetasikas and of citta suppress mental illness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as diffidence, which cause mental illness.
:When the citta is akusala citta, there is diffidence, lack of confidence in kusala and then there is mental sickness. Mental proficiency assists the kusala citta and then citta and cetasikas are healthy and skilful so that they can perform their functions in the most efficient way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">'''''Religio licita''''' ("permitted religion,"&lt;ref&gt;''Licita'' is the [[past participle]] of ''licet'', "is permitted, is lawful."&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as "approved religion"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in the ''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'' of [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the special status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]]. It was not an official term in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1996), p. 211, begins his analysis of the ''religio licita'' theory "by immediately scotching the idea that Rome had some process for licensing foreign religions. There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''." See also Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 35; Solomon Grayzel, "The Jews and Roman Law," ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 59 (1968), pp. 93-117; [[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary ''(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1997), p. 542; John J. O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

[[file:Nuphar_lutea_170803.jpg|thumb|250px|The natural water lily leaf]]
'''{{lang|de|Seeblatt|italic=no}}''' (German for 'lake leaf', plural ''{{lang|de|Seeblätter}}''; {{lang-da|søblad}}; {{lang-fy|pompeblêd}}) is the term for the stylized leaf of a [[Nuphar lutea|water lily]], used as a charge in heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mistholme.com/dictionary/seeblatt/ Mistholme: Seeblatt], retrieved on 18 Feb. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This charge is used in the heraldry of Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, but not so much in France and Britain. Seeblätter feature prominently on the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] as well as on [[Danish coins]].

In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], the term ''pompeblêd'' is used. The name is used to indicate the seven red lily leaf-shaped blades on the [[Flag of Friesland (province)|Frisian flag]]. The seven red ''pompeblêden'' (leaves of the [[Nuphar lutea|yellow water lily]] and the [[Nymphaea alba|European white waterlily]]) refer to the medieval Frisian 'sea districts': more ore less autonomous regions along the Southern North Sea coast from the city of Alkmaar to the [[Weser]] River. There never have been exactly seven of these administrative units, the number of seven bears the suggestion of 'a lot'. Late mediaeval sources identify seven Frisian districts, though with different names. The most important regions were [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]], [[Westergo]], [[Oostergo]], [[Hunsingo]], [[Fivelingo]], [[Reiderland]], [[Emsingo]], [[Brokmerland]], [[Harlingerland]] and [[Rüstringen]] ([[Jeverland]] and [[Butjadingen]]).

The '''Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984''' (or '''SCPA''') is an act of the [[US Congress]] that makes the [[IC layout|layouts]] of [[integrated circuit]]s legally protected upon registration, and hence illegal to copy without permission.

==Background==
Prior to 1984, it was not necessarily illegal to produce a competing chip with an identical layout. As the legislative history for the SCPA explained, patent and copyright protection for chip layouts, chip ''topographies'', was largely unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;The Senate Report on the bill (S.Rep. No. 425, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984)) stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the semiconductor industry, innovation is indispensable; research breakthroughs are essential to the life and health of the industry. But research and innovation in the design of semiconductor chips are threatened by the inadequacies of existing legal protection against piracy and unauthorized copying. This problem, which is so critical to this essential sector of the American economy, is addressed by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.... [The bill] would prohibit "chip piracy"--the unauthorized copying and distribution of semiconductor chip products copied from the original creators of such works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Quoted in [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/977/1555/304802/ Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.], 977 F.2d 1555, ¶ 17 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also ''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 21-22 (copyright and patent law ineffective).&lt;/ref&gt; This led to considerable complaint by U.S. chip manufacturers—notably, Intel, which, along with the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), took the lead in seeking remedial legislation—against what they termed "chip piracy." During the hearings that led to enactment of the SCPA, chip industry representatives asserted that a pirate could for $10,000 copy a chip design that had cost its original manufacturer upwards of $100,000 to design.

==Enactment of US and other national legislation==
In 1984 the United States enacted the '''Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984''' (the ''SCPA'') to protect the topography of semiconductor chips. The SCPA is found in  title 17, U.S. Code, sections 901-914 ([http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap9.html  17 U.S.C. §§ 901-914]).

Japan&lt;ref&gt;Japan was the first country to enact its own version of the SCPA, the Japanese "Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit" of 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and European Community (EC) countries soon followed suit&lt;ref&gt;In 1986 the EC promulgated a directive requiring its members to adopt national legislation for the protection of semiconductor topographies. Council Directive 1987/54/EEC of 16 Dec. 1986 on the ''Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products'', art. 1(1)(b), 1987 O.J. (L 24) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and enacted their own, similar laws protecting the topography of semiconductor chips.&lt;ref&gt;The UK enacted the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, c. 48, § 213, after it initially took the position that its copyright law fully protected chip topographies. See [[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]

Criticisms of inadequacy of the UK copyright approach as perceived by the US chip industry are summarized in [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04089472 Further chip rights developments], Micro Law, IEEE Micro, Aug. 1985, pp. 91-92.

Australia passed the Circuit Layouts Act of 1989 as a ''sui generis'' form of chip protection. Korea passed the ''Act Concerning the Layout-Design of Semiconductor Integrated Circuits''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip topographies are also protected by TRIPS, an international treaty.&lt;ref&gt;On Jan. 1, 1995, the ''Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights'' (TRIPs) (Annex 1C to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement), went into force. Part II, section 6 of TRIPs protects semiconductor chip products and was the basis for Presidential Proclamation No. 6780, March 23, 1995, under SCPA § 902(a)(2), extending protection to all present and future WTO members.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the SCPA operates==
===''Sui generis'' law===
Although the U.S. SCPA is codified in title 17 (copyrights), the SCPA is not a [[copyright]] or [[patent]] law. Rather, it is a ''[[sui generis]]'' law resembling a [[utility model]] law or ''[[Gebrauchsmuster]]''. It has some aspects of copyright law, some aspects of patent law, and in some ways, it is completely different from either.  From ''Brooktree'', ¶ 23: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 was an innovative solution to this new problem of technology-based industry. While some copyright principles underlie the law, as do some attributes of patent law, the Act was uniquely adapted to semiconductor mask works, in order to achieve appropriate protection for original designs while meeting the competitive needs of the industry and serving the public interest.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In general, the chip topography laws of other nations are also ''sui generis'' laws. Nevertheless, copyright and patent [[case law]] illuminate many aspects of the SCPA and its interpretation.

===Acquisition of protection by registration===
Chip protection is acquired under the SCPA by filing with the US Copyright Office an application for "mask work" registration under the SCPA, together with a filing fee. The application must be accompanied by identifying material, such as pictorial representations of the IC layers so that in the event of infringement litigation, it can be determined what the registration covers. Protection continues for ten years from the date of registration.

===Mask works===
The SCPA repeatedly refers to "mask works." The term is a relic of the original form of the bill that became the SCPA and was passed in the Senate as an amendment to the Copyright Act. The term mask work is parallel to and consistent with the terminology of the 1976 Copyright Act, which introduced the concept of "literary works," "pictorial works," "audiovisual works," and the like and protected physical embodiments of such works, such as books, paintings, video game cassettes, and the like against unauthorized copying and distribution. The terminology became unnecessary when the House of Representatives insisted on the substitution of a ''sui generis'' bill, but the SCPA as enacted still continued its use.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Thomas Hoeren, Francesca Guadagno, and Sacha Wunsch-Vincent, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291791824_Breakthrough_technologies_-_Semiconductor_innovation_and_intellectual_property ''Breakthrough Technologies – Semiconductors, Innovation and Intellectual Property''], {{smallcaps|WIPO Econ. Rsch. Working Paper No. 27}} (Nov. 2015), p. 28 (discussing introduction of term "mask work"). Hoeren discusses, ''id''. n.143, the insistence of Copyright Office General Counsel Dorothy Schrader that the copyright version of the SCPA must have a "work" to be protected, in accordance with the concept of the 1976 Copyright Act. The proponents of chip protection responded, Hoeren recounts: "She wants a 'work'? OK, she can have a 'mask work' if that will satisfy her." So that 'work' went into the next draft of the Senate bill. The mask work concept had nothing to do with ''sui generis''. It was an attempt to assimilate the chip protection sought to the copyright pattern of literary works, pictorial works, musical works,
etc. But once in the Senate bill it stayed in and was carried over to the subsequent House bill."&lt;/ref&gt; The term "mask work" is not limited to actual masks used in chip manufacture but is defined broadly in the SCPA to include the topographic creation embodied in the masks and chips. Moreover, the SCPA protects any physical embodiment of a mask work.&lt;ref&gt;The SCPA, [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))], defines a '''mask work''' as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
The owner of mask work rights may pursue an alleged infringer ("chip pirate") by bringing an action for mask work infringement in federal district court. The remedies available correspond generally to those of copyright law and patent law.

===Functionality unprotected===
The SCPA does not protect functional aspects of chip designs, which is reserved to [[Patent|patent law]]. Although EPROM and other memory chips topographies are protectable under the SCPA, such protection does not extend to the information stored in chips, such as computer programs. Such information is protected, if at all, only by [[Copyright|copyright law]].

===Reverse engineering allowed===
The SCPA permits competitive emulation of a chip by means of [[reverse engineering]]. The ordinary test for illegal copying (mask work infringement) is the "[[substantial similarity]]" test of copyright law,&lt;ref&gt;''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt; but when the defense of reverse engineering is involved and supported by probative evidence (usually, the so-called paper trail of design and development work), the similarity must be greater.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 48-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the accused chip topography must be substantially identical (truly copied by rote, so-called slavish copying) rather than just substantially similar for the defendant to be liable for infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See Explanatory Memorandum, Mathias-Leahy Amendments to S. 1201, 130 Cong. Rec. S12, 91617 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1984). See also [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/977/977.F2d.1555.91-1259.91-1258.html Brooktree Corp. v.

Rev. 385, 406 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Most world chip topography protection laws provide for a reverse engineering privilege.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be a '''shrinking space''' if every [[open cover]] admits a shrinking. A ''shrinking'' of an open cover is another open cover indexed by the same indexing set, with the property that the closure of each open set in the shrinking lies inside the corresponding original open set.&lt;ref name="egt"&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of General Topology|first1=K. P.|last1=Hart|first2=Jun-iti|last2=Nagata|first3=J. E.|last3=Vaughan|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2003|isbn=9780080530864|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWyoCRkLFAkC&amp;pg=PA199}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following facts are known about shrinking spaces:

* Every shrinking space is [[normal space|normal]].&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* Every shrinking space is [[countably paracompact]].&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* In a [[normal space]], every locally finite, and in fact, every point finite open cover admits a shrinking.&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* Thus, every normal [[metacompact space]] is a shrinking space. In particular, every [[paracompact space]] is a shrinking space.&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;

These facts are particularly important because shrinking of open covers is a common technique in the theory of [[differential manifold]]s and while constructing functions using a [[partition of unity]].

[[File:Skew-T.gif|300px|thumb|right|Black-and-white skew-T log-P diagram]]
[[File:Skew-T-color-blank.svg|300px|thumb|right|Color skew-T log-P diagram, with the temperature grid lines in red slanted to the right. Click for more details.]]

A '''skew-T log-P diagram''' is one of four [[thermodynamic diagrams]] commonly used in [[weather]] analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the [[emagram]] that allows straight, horizontal [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and provides for a large angle between [[Contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherms]] and dry [[adiabat]]s, similar to that in the [[tephigram]]. It was thus more suitable for some of the newer analysis techniques being invented by the [[United States Air Force]].

Such a diagram has pressure plotted on the vertical axis, with a [[logarithmic scale]] (thus the "log-P" part of the name), and the temperature plotted [[skew coordinates|skewed]], with isothermal lines at 45° to the plot (thus the "skew-T" part of the name). Plotting a hypothetical set of measurements with constant temperature for all altitudes would result in a line angled 45° to the right. In practice, since temperature usually drops with altitude, the graphs are usually mostly vertical (see examples linked to below).

The major use for skew-T log-P diagrams is the plotting of [[Atmospheric sounding|radiosonde soundings]], which give a vertical profile of the [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] temperature throughout the [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]]. The [[isopleth]]s on the diagram can then be used to simplify many tedious calculations involved, which were previously performed by hand or not at all. Many skew-T log-P diagrams also include a vertical representation of the wind speed and direction using wind barbs. Important atmospheric characteristics such as [[Dew point|saturation]], [[atmospheric instability]], and [[wind shear]] are critical in severe weather forecasting, by which skew-T log-P diagrams allow quick visual analysis. The diagrams are widely used by [[gliding|glider pilots]] to forecast the strength of [[thermal]]s and the height of the base of the associated cumulus clouds.

== Early life and education ==

Steve Adler was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2016/02/14/austin/ Hadassah Magazine: "Austin" By Helen Lippman] February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and first lived in [[Washington, DC]] and grew up in [[Kensington, Maryland]].  His father was a [[World War II]] veteran with the [[U.S. Navy]] who later became a film editor with [[CBS News]].  His mother was a homemaker.&lt;ref name="theaustinbulldog.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Adler Launches Mayoral Campaign|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=294:steve-adler-launches-mayoral-campaign&amp;catid=3:main-articles|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he graduated from [[Princeton University]] with a B.A from the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=1977|page=18|edition=Volume 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA62 |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He then attended the [[University of Texas School of Law|University of Texas at Austin School of Law]] and received his [[juris doctorate]] in 1982.  After graduating from University of Texas, Adler remained in Austin to practice law.&lt;ref name="theaustinbulldog.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Adler: 'New Way Forward'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Adler: 'New Way Forward'|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2014-05-30/steve-adler/|website=Austin Chronicle|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal career ==

In the mid 1980s, Steve Adler co-founded the Barron, Graham &amp; Adler LLP law firm, later Barron &amp; Adler, LLP. He represented primarily landowners who were dealing with eminent domain and condemnation cases where the government or a private company seek to acquire their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr./Ms. Mayor|url=http://www.atxman.com/mr-ms-mayor|website=Austin Man Magazine|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to this practice, Adler spent most of the 1980s, his early legal career, doing civil rights employment discrimination cases.  This work included representing women as well as Hispanic, African American and other minority workers in federal court, before the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission]] and on matters filed with the [[Human Rights Commission of Austin (Texas)|Austin Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Time Candidate to Announce Run for Mayor|url=http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/first-time-candidate-to-announce-run-for-mayor/|website=Impact News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He represented clients seeking equal treatment and opportunity in the workplace, redress from sexual harassment and denial of [[equal pay for equal work]].

Adler has argued before state appellate courts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], and the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and was named a Texas Super Lawyer from 2007-2013 and one of the Best Lawyers in America in 2007-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Super Lawyers|url=http://www.superlawyers.com/texas/lawyer/Stephen-I-Adler/7a77cdda-d332-4411-bf4c-7c7ef366de60.html|website=Super Lawyers|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
== Community leadership ==

Adler has been involved in a number of community organizations in the [[Greater Austin]] region. In 2010, he joined the board of GENaustin (formerly Girls Empowerment Network), an organization that provides education and mentoring to middle school girls in local school districts to help them make good choices.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Incorporation for the Ophelia Education Foundation|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=317&amp;limit=5&amp;limitstart=0&amp;order=name&amp;dir=DESC&amp;Itemid=22|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009-2012, Adler served as the board chair of the Anti-Defamation League Austin Region where he contributed to the creation of the Austin Hate Crimes Task Force and expanding the [http://www.adl.org/npfh/ No Place for Hate] anti-bullying program from just a few schools to over 300 schools throughout Central Texas.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Adler: 'New Way Forward'"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Defamation League National Leadership Conference|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?305723-1/antidefamation-league-national-leadership-conference|website=C-SPAN|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Defamation League Austin|url=http://austin.adl.org/|website=Anti-Defamation League Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Steve Adler has served on the [[Ballet Austin]] board since the late 1990s and he has supported the organizations work to provide community access to arts, and the creation of new works, including collaborations with organizations in other major cities in the [[United States]] and abroad.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014/15 Board of Directors|url=http://www.balletaustin.org/about/board.php|website=Ballet Austin|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler was on the founding board of directors for the Texas Tribune in 2009.  He was later appointed board chair, a role he resigned from in January 2014 in order to launch his run for Austin mayor.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form 990 Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=317&amp;limit=5&amp;limitstart=0&amp;order=name&amp;dir=DESC&amp;Itemid=22|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early political career ==

In 1996, Steve Adler assisted [[El Paso]] Democrat Eliot Shapleigh in his run for [[Texas State Senate]].  He then served as Senator Shapleigh's [[chief of staff]] and later [[general counsel]] from 1997-2005.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Staff: 76th Legislature|url=http://www.hro.house.state.tx.us/pdf/focus/staff76.pdf|website=Texas House of Representatives|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Staff: 77th Legislature|url=http://www.hro.house.state.tx.us/pdf/focus/staff77.pdf|website=Texas House of Representatives|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Adler's time working in the Texas Senate, he primarily focused on fairness in school funding formulas, teachers' salary issues, state budget policy, environmental protection, and equity and access issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayoral Candidate Questions|url=http://austinenvironmentaldems.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steve-Adler-Mayor.pdf|website=Austin Environmental Democrats|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Adler: 'New Way Forward'|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2014-05-30/steve-adler/|website=The Austin Chronicle|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Time Candidate to Announce Run for Mayor|url=http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/first-time-candidate-to-announce-run-for-mayor/|website=Impact News|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
== Mayoral campaign ==

Steve Adler began his campaign in January 2014 for Austin Mayor and ran on a platform of reforming governance at the Austin City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Martinez calls out Steve Adler on tax exemption proposal|url=http://www.kvue.com/media/cinematic/video/14628810/mike-martinez-calls-out-steve-adler-on-tax-exemption-proposal/|website=KVUE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property tax exemption proposal worth considering|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/property-tax-exemption-proposal-worth-considering/ngzzz/|website=Austin American Statesman|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Austin mayoral debate, Mike Martinez and Steve Adler trade jabs|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/at-austin-mayoral-debate-mike-martinez-and-steve-a/ng5DQ/|website=Austin American Statesman|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His primary issues included governance, traffic congestion, education, affordability, environment and water, and neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayor candidates say city of Austin should help fund pre-K programs|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/mayor-candidates-say-city-of-austin-should-help-fu/nhFgk/|website=Austin American Statesman|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler entered into a run-off with City Council Member [[Mike Martinez]] in November after both candidates failed to get a majority of votes.

Adler is the first mayor to serve as part of the "10-1" City Council system that was approved via referendum by voters during the 2012 election and implemented after the 2014 election.&lt;ref name=KXAN2015&gt;{{cite news |title=Austin's new mayor and city council take office |date=January 6, 2015 |work=KXAN| url=http://kxan.com/2015/01/06/austins-new-mayor-and-city-council-take-office/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Austin City Council was composed of six at-large Council members and a mayor. The new system is composed of ten Council members representing geographic districts and the mayor. 
[[File:Steve Adler Richard Overton.jpg|alt=Steve Adler and Richard Overton |thumb|Mayor Steve Adler made a statement regarding the Veteran's Day Parade.

"I will not be marching in the Congress Avenue parade because that parade will include groups carrying the Confederate flag. Veterans Day should only be about honoring United States Military Veterans. Symbols of racism, Civil War secession, and white supremacy should not be forgotten or erased, but they need to be remembered and studied in museums and classrooms not cheered and applauded in parades."

The push to move to the geographic districts was prompted by Austin's dramatic population growth as well as a recognition that the former system often resulted in an underrepresentation of Austin's minority communities, particularly its rapidly growing Latino population.&lt;ref name=AustinChronicle2013&gt;{{cite news |title=The road to 10-1 |first=Elizabeth |last=Pagano |date=February 1, 2013 |work=Austin Chronicle| url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-02-01/the-road-to-10-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the city's political establishment had abided by an unwritten "gentleman's agreement" that reserved one Council seat for a Latino and one for an African American.&lt;ref name=KUT2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Hispanic Leaders call for change to Gentleman's Agreement, just not yet |first=Daniel |last=Guerra |date=April 23, 2012 |work=KUT| url=http://kut.org/post/hispanic-leaders-call-change-gentlemens-agreement-just-not-yet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2015, Adler denounced an anonymous group's attempt to inflame discussion of gentrification in historically black neighborhoods of East Austin by placing stickers on the doors of East Side businesses that proclaimed them off-limits to non-whites.&lt;ref name=AASMarch2015&gt;{{cite news |title=Austin Mayor Steve Adler: 'White people' stickers appalling, offensive|first=Ciara |last=O'Rourke |date=March 18, 2015 |work=Austin American-Statesman |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/crime-law/exclusively-for-white-people-stickers-found-on-sug/nkY7f/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city," said Adler. "Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin mayor outraged by 'white people only' stickers posted on businesses|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/19/us/austin-white-people-sticker/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=March 19, 2015|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler has been a proponent of the Office of Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoradler.com/great-cities-do-big-things-state-of-our-city-feb-16-2016-austin-texas/&lt;/ref&gt; Following a six-month search, Brion Oaks was selected September 2016 as the City's first Chief Equity Officer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/brion-oaks-named-citys-first-chief-equity-officer/nsZSq/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, when the [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] in Austin announced that it would hold a women-only screening of the movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', one man wrote Mayor Adler an angry email about allowing the event to take place, in which he urged the boycott of Austin and called women "the second rate gender". Adler's response, in which he warned the writer that his email account had been "hacked by ... an unusually hostile individual", and listed women's accomplishments, drew national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/mayor-on-men-boycotting-all-female-wonder-woman-screening-w485342|title=Mayor Responds to Boycott of All-Female 'Wonder Woman' Screening|last=Chen|first=Joyce|date=June 1, 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/01/wonder-woman-all-female-screenings-mayor-steve-adler/|title=Wonder Woman: Mayor defends all-female screening|last=Romano|first=Nick|date=June 1, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/06/02/austin-mayor-wonder-woman-women-only-screening-drafthouse/|title=Austin mayor claps back at "Wonder Woman" women-only screening hater|last=Serena|first=Katie|date=June 2, 2017|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Adler and the federal [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] declared that significant progress had been made to house homeless veterans.&lt;ref&gt;http://kxan.com/2016/08/19/austin-plan-to-house-all-homeless-veterans-accomplished/&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite progress in the area of veterans, work remains to be done to further reduce homelessness and associated drug use.  During the summer of 2016, several people were hospitalized during an outbreak of K2 overdoses around the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless.&lt;ref&gt;http://keyetv.com/news/local/officials-concerned-about-k2-outbreak-in-austin&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler won reelection in 2018, garnering 59% of the vote in a 7-way race.

[[File:Bore Stroke Ratio Animation.gif|thumb|Bore/Stroke Animation]]
In a [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston engine]], the '''stroke ratio''', defined by either '''bore/stroke ratio''' or '''stroke/bore ratio''', is a term to describe the ratio between [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] diameter and [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  This can be used for either an [[internal combustion engine]], where the fuel is burned within the cylinders of the engine, or [[external combustion engine]], such as a [[steam engine]], where the combustion of the fuel takes place ''outside'' the working cylinders of the engine.

A fairly comprehensive yet understandable study of stroke/bore effects was published in ''Horseless Age'', 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingram|first1=Edward|title=As to the Matter of Stroke|journal=Horseless Age|date=April 1916|volume=37|issue=6 &amp; 7|pages=275, 325|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 November 2015|ref=WA-37-Stroke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions==
In a [[piston engine]], there are two different ways of describing the ''stroke ratio'' of its [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]], namely: ''bore/stroke'' ratio, and ''stroke/bore'' ratio.

===Bore/stroke ratio===
'''Bore/stroke''' is the more commonly used term, with usage in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].

The diameter of the [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] is divided by the length of the [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] to give the ratio.

==Square, oversquare and undersquare engines==
The following terms describe the naming conventions for the configurations of the various bore/stroke ratio:

===Square engine===
A '''square engine''' has equal bore ''and'' stroke dimensions, giving a bore/stroke value of exactly 1:1.

====Square engine examples====

1967 – FIAT 125, 124Sport engine 125A000-90&amp;nbsp;hp, 125B000-100&amp;nbsp;hp, 125BC000-110&amp;nbsp;hp, 1608 ccm, DOHC, {{convert|80.0 x 80.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1970 – Ford [[Ford 335 engine#400|400M]] had a {{convert|4.00 x 4.00|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} bore and stroke.

1973 – [[Kawasaki Z1]] and KZ(Z)900 had a {{convert|66.0 x 66.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kawasaki 900 Super Four|url=http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/4-18e.html|work=240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.|accessdate=6 November 2013|quote=Journalists and riders called it the king of motorcycles, and it gained a reputation as a super sport model all over the world. The Super Four boasted high performance and quality. This best-selling motorcycle won many prizes around the world within only six months of its release.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1973 – British Leyland's Australian division created a 4.4-litre version of the [[Rover V8 engine#4.4|Rover V8]] engine, with bore and stroke both measuring 88.9&amp;nbsp;mm.  This engine was exclusively used in the [[Leyland P76]].

1982 - [[Honda Nighthawk 250]] and [[Honda CMX250C]] Rebel have a {{convert|53.0 x 53.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke, making it a square engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Honda Rebel Specifications|url=http://www.hondanews.com/channels/powersports-motorcycles-custom-rebel/releases/2013-honda-rebel-specifications|work=Honda Media Newsroom|publisher=American Honda Motor Co|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1983 – [[Mazda]] [[Mazda F engine|FE 2.0L]] inline four-cylinder engine with a perfectly squared {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|1|abbr=on}} bore and stroke. This engine also features the ideal 1.75:1 rod/stroke ratio.

1987 – The Opel/Vauxhaul 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[C20NE|GM Family II engines]] are square at {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke; example as C20XE C20NE C20LET X20A X20XEV X20XER Z20LET Z20LEH Z20LER A20NHT A20NFT.

1989 – [[Nissan Motors|Nissan's]] [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE and SR20De|SR20DE]] is a square engine, with an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1990–2010 [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] [[Saab Automobile|B234/B235]] is a square engine, with a {{convert|90.0 x 90.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1991 – [[Ford Modular engine#4.6 L|Ford's 4.6]] V8 OHC engine has a {{convert|3.552 x 3.543|in|mm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} bore and stroke. It has been the backbone of Ford V8-powered cars and trucks in different power levels and head designs for two decades.

1995 – The [[BMW]] [[BMW M52|M52]] engine with a displacement of 2793 cubic centimeters is an example of a perfect square engine with an {{convert|84.0 x 84.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1996 – Jaguar's [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#4.0 L|AJ-V8]] engine in 4.0-litre form has an 86.0&amp;nbsp;mm bore and stroke.

2000 – [[Mercedes-Benz]] 4.0-litre ({{convert|3.996|L|cc cid|disp=out|comma=5}}) [[Mercedes-Benz OM628/OM629|OM628]] V8 diesel engine is an example of a square engine – with an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

The [[Volkswagen Group]]'s 2005 [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W16|W16 engine]] as used in the [[Bugatti Veyron]] also using a {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

The [[Peugeot]] [[Peugeot|XU10]] engine line – with a displacement of 1998 cubic centimeters – is an example of a perfect square engine with an {{convert|86.0x86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

[[Toyota Motors|Toyota's]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ|2JZ]] and [[Toyota U engine#4U|4U]] are square engines, with {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

Honda's J30A engine has an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

===Oversquare or short-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''oversquare''' or '''short-stroke''' if its cylinders have a greater bore diameter than its stroke length, giving a bore/stroke ratio greater than 1:1.

An oversquare engine allows for more and larger valves in the head of the cylinder, higher possible rpm by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, oversquare engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.

The reduced stroke length allows for a shorter cylinder and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making oversquare engines less tall  but wider than undersquare engines of similar [[engine displacement]].

====Oversquare engine examples====
Oversquare engines (a.k.a. "short stroke engines") are very common, as they allow higher [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] (and thus more power), without excessive piston speed.

Examples include both Chevrolet and Ford small-block V8s. The [[BMW N45]] gasoline engine has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.167.

[[Flat engine|Horizontally opposed, also known as "Boxer" or "flat", engines]] typically feature oversquare designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width.  This is particularly so in [[Subaru]]’s front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by the width of the engine. Although oversquare engines have a reputation for being high-strung, {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} low-torque machines, the [[Subaru EJ engine|Subaru EJ181 engine]] develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm.

Nissan's [[Nissan SR engine#SR16VE|SR16VE]] engine found in [[Nissan Pulsar]] VZ-R and VZ-R N1 is an oversquare engine with {{convert|86|mm|in|2}} bore and {{convert|68.7|mm|in|2}} stroke, giving it an impressive {{convert|175|-|200|hp|kW|-1}} but relatively small torque of {{convert|119|-|134|lbft|Nm kgm}}

Extreme oversquare engines are found in [[Formula One]] racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed,{{efn|There is no actual restriction on bore:stroke ratio, but cylinder bores are limited to {{convert|98|mm|in|2|disp=or}} and capacity to {{convert|2400|cm3|cuin}}.}} enabling engine speeds of 18,000 rpm while remaining reliable for multiple races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011F1 Technical Regulations|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/2B2B158DE64879C7C12578C0004B1DF6/$FILE/2011_F1__TECHNICAL_REGULATIONS_30-06-2011.pdf|publisher=FIA|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ducati 1199|Ducati Panigale]] [[motorcycle engine]] is massively oversquare with a bore/stroke ratio of 1.84:1. It was given the name "SuperQuadro" by [[Ducati]], roughly translated as "super-square" from Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1199panigale.ducati.com/en/#|title=Ducati 1199 Panigale - Ducati|author=|date=|website=www.1199panigale.ducati.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[side-valve]] Belgian [[D-Motor LF26]] [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]] has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.4:1.&lt;ref&gt;http://d-motor1.vpweb.be/Price---product-specifications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Mercedes-Benz M116 engines had a {{convert|92|mm|in|2}} bore and a {{convert|65.6|mm|in|2}} stroke for a 3.5 litre V8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/mercedes_350SL_technical_specifications.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|undersquare}}Undersquare or long-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''undersquare''' or '''long-stroke''' if its cylinders have a smaller bore (width, diameter) than its stroke (length of piston travel)  - giving a ratio value of less than 1:1.

At a given engine speed, a longer stroke increases engine friction and increases stress on the crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number.

Undersquare engines exhibit peak torque at lower rpm than an oversquare engine due to their longer crank throw and high piston speed.

Undersquare engines have become more common lately, as manufacturers push for more and more efficient engines and higher fuel economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/powertrain2018/engine/|title=2.0-liter Dynamic Force Engine, a New 2.0-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline Engine |publisher=Toyota |location=Japan |date=26 February 2018 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Undersquare engines have a higher volume/surface area ratio, leading to reduced heat loss and higher BSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/why-0-5-liter-cylinders-will-soon-dominate-automotive-engine-design |title=Why 0.5-Liter Cylinders Will Soon Dominate Automotive-Engine Design |first=Don |last=Sherman |work=Car and Driver |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undersquare engine examples====
Many inline engines, particularly those mounted transversely in front-wheel-drive cars, utilize an undersquare design. The smaller bore allows for a shorter engine that increases room available for the front wheels to steer. Examples of this include many [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines|Volkswagen]], [[list of Nissan engines|Nissan]], [[list of Honda engines|Honda]], and [[list of Mazda engines|Mazda]] engines. The [[Toyota KR engine#1KR-FE|1KR-FE]]-engine used in the [[Toyota Aygo]], [[Citroën C1]] and [[Peugeot 107]] amongst others is an example of a modern long-stroke engine widely used in [[FF layout]] cars. This engine has a 71&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 84&amp;nbsp;mm stroke giving it a bore/stroke ratio of 0.845:1. Some rear-wheel-drive cars that borrow engines from front-wheel-drive cars (such as the [[Mazda MX-5]]) use an undersquare design.
.

BMW's acclaimed [[BMW M54#S54B32|S54B32]] engine was undersquare ({{convert|91|mm|2}} vs {{convert|87|mm|2}} bore), offering a world record torque-per-litre figure ({{cvt|114|Nm/L|lbft/USgal|disp=comma}}) for normally-aspirated production engines at the time; this record stood until Ferrari unveiled the [[458 Italia]].

Many [[United Kingdom|British]] automobile companies used undersquare designs until the 1950s, largely because of a motor tax system that [[RAC horsepower|taxed cars by their cylinder bore]].  This includes the [[BMC A-Series engine]], and many [[Nissan]] derivatives. The [[Trojan (automobile)|Trojan Car]] used an undersquare, [[split-single|split piston]], [[two stroke]], two cylinder in line engine; this was partly for this tax advantage and partly because its proportions allowed flexing V-shaped connecting rods for the two pistons of each U-shaped cylinder, which was cheaper and simpler than two connecting rods joined with an additional bearing.

The  225&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.7&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]) [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine]] is undersquare, with a {{convert|86|mm|2}} bore and a {{convert|105|mm|2}} stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.819:1).

The Ford [[Ford Modular engine#5.4.C2.A0L|5.4L Modular Engine]] features a cylinder bore of 90.1&amp;nbsp;mm (3.552&amp;nbsp;in) and a stroke of 105.8&amp;nbsp;mm (4.165&amp;nbsp;in), which makes a bore/stroke ratio of 0.852:1. Since the stroke is significantly longer than the bore, the SOHC 16V (2-valve per cylinder) version of this engine is able to generate a peak torque of 350&amp;nbsp;lb·ft as low as 2501&amp;nbsp;rpm.

The Willys Jeep  [[Willys Go Devil engine|L134]] and [[Willys Hurricane engine|F134]] engines were undersquare, with a 79.4&amp;nbsp;mm (3.125&amp;nbsp;in) bore and 111.1&amp;nbsp;mm (4.375&amp;nbsp;in) stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.714:1).

The [[Dodge Power Wagon]] used a [[straight-six engine|straight-six]] [[Chrysler Flathead engine]] of 230&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.8&amp;nbsp;l) with a bore of {{convert|83|mm|2}} and a stroke of {{convert|117|mm|2}}, yielding a substantially undersquare bore/stroke ratio of 0.709:1.

The 4-litre [[Ford Barra engine#Straight-six engine|Barra Inline 6]] engine from the Australian [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], uses a 92.21&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 99.31&amp;nbsp;mm stroke, which equates to a 0.929:1 bore-stroke ratio.

The 292 Chevrolet I6 is also undersquare, with a bore of 3.875 in and a stroke of 4.125 in (bore/stroke ratio = 0.939:1).

Mitsubishi's 4G63T engine found primarily in many generations of [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] is an undersquare engine at 85&amp;nbsp;mm bore x 88&amp;nbsp;mm stroke.

Virtually all piston engines used in military aircraft were long-stroke engines. The PW R-2800, Wright R-3350, [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major]], Rolls-Royce Merlin (1650), Allison V-1710, and Hispano-Suiza 12Y-Z are only a few of more than a hundred examples.

All diesel-powered ships have massively undersquare marine engines.  A [[Wärtsilä]]  [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96-C|two-stroke marine diesel engine]] has a cylinder bore of 960&amp;nbsp;mm (37.8&amp;nbsp;in) and stroke of 2500&amp;nbsp;mm (98.4&amp;nbsp;in), (bore/stroke ratio = 0.384:1).

While most modern [[motorcycle engine]]s are square or oversquare, some are undersquare.  The [[Kawasaki Z1300]]'s [[straight-six engine]] was made undersquare to minimise engine width, more recently, a new [[straight-twin engine]] for the [[Honda NC700 series]] used an undersquare design to achieve better combustion efficiency in order to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global 700cc Engine for Next-Generation : Technical details|url=http://world.honda.com/Global-700cc-engine/Tech-details/page05.html|work=Honda Worldwide|publisher=Honda Motor Co|accessdate=25 March 2014|page=5|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Jerry|title=Reality Check From Honda, in Touch With Economics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/automobiles/autoreviews/reality-check-from-honda-in-touch-with-economics.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tele-information services''' are based on an alliance of digital [[telecommunication]] and [[computer technology]] that play an important role in inter-[[human communication]]s. It is a classification of [[information flow]]s broken down so that the presentation and information content are not confused with the character of the information flow. Tele-information services consist of four definable information traffic patterns being ''allocution'', ''conversation'', ''consultation'' and ''registration''. These [[Tele-information services#Information traffic patterns|information traffic patterns]] can be combined to form more complex multi-pattern services and networks made up of any number of information traffic patterns.&lt;ref name="bordwijk"&gt;Bordewijk, Jan L. and Van Kaam, Ben (2002) [1986] "Towards a New Classification of Tele-Information Services," in Denis McQuail (ed.) ''McQuail's Reader in Mass Communication Theory,'' Sage, London, pp. 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information traffic patterns==

* Allocution — the issue of information by an information service centre under programmatic control of the centre itself. Typically has a general/soldier, master/slave relationship. Examples include [[broadcasting]] organisations such as [[radio]] and [[television]].
* Conversation — the issue of information by information services consumer(s) under programmatic control of the consumer(s) themselves. Examples include information flow between consumers or with the help of an interpreter.
* Consultation — the issue of information by an information service provider under programmatic control of an information service consumer. Examples include phoning a doctor, lawyer, reading books, magazines and newspapers as well as cable television and the Internet.
* Registration — the issue of information by an information service consumer under the programmatic control of an information service centre. Examples include a fire alarm, news agencies and some [[MMORPG|MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)]] such as [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref name="bordwijk" /&gt;

'''Temporal encroachment''' is an action that affects the perception of time or that affects the ability to take action in the [[future]]. [[Time|Temporal]] means ''related to the measurement or passing of time'' and encroachment is ''an intrusion, usually unwelcome, into the space of another''.

The space that temporal encroachment refers to is temporal space, the temporal "space" or "territory" upon which others attach significance.

There are various kinds of temporal encroachment:

==Scheduling==
This is when one group or person delays another person. A good example is a vice president making a lower-ranked employee wait in his outer office while he conducts business. Another good example is a valued worker who always shows up late to work but this is allowed due to his abilities. This kind of encroachment is very common in the workplace. Various [[cultures]] look at this differently—the [[Japan]]ese are very punctual, while most [[Latin]] and [[Baltic region|Baltic]] cultures would be more relaxed with time, instead looking at social parameters.

==Future 'space'==
This refers to actions taken that influence events 'down the line', narrowing possible choices and alternatives.  It is worth noting that the most common use of this phrase is found in [[ecology]], where there is a large amount of concern about the effects of human encroachment upon animals and other wildlife.  Encroachment can be a good or bad factor in the lives of the animals, but most commonly, it is bad.

It has been used by some [[Jewish]] thinkers&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q7122u6t67863756/fulltext.pdf SpringerLink - Resource Secured&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to changes in [[Zionism]] that have 'ripple effects' on Jews worldwide, and the effect this has had on global terrorism.

It has also been used in the [[legal]] system, where some legal thinkers believe early correction of poverty and other socioeconomic ills can 'narrow' the likelihood of future [[criminality]].

==Past 'space'==
It can also reflect a sense that modern events and interpretations of [[history]] alter and change our perceptions of history. For example, the involvement of the Papacy in the formation of the structure of medieval Europe was viewed differently at the time than it is today.{{citation needed|date=December 2008|reason= stale link: http://www.historicist.com/papacy/b1c5.html }}

Some also view it as the encroachment of the young on the old, see ''Encroachment of old age'' below.

==Examples==
Some examples of temporal encroachment in other contexts.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/encroacv.php#temp Varieties of Encroachment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from flooding:''' Construction of settlements in flood plains, ignoring the tendency of rivers to flood occasionally, results in situations in which river water encroaches on properties in ways that can prove extremely costly. Here encroachment on flood plains by buildings engenders encroachment by flooding.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from rising sea levels:''' This is a more dramatic and permanent example of encroachment from flooding whose major effects are predicted to become evident over the coming decades. It is caused by failure to respond effectively to the challenge of global warming and rising carbon emissions. Here encroachment on air quality engenders encroachment by rising sea levels. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment by disease resistant bacteria:''' The widespread development and use of pharmaceutical drugs to control disease has created a situation in which bacteria are mutating and treatment-resistant bacteria are becoming a major challenge to hospitals. Here encroachment by progressive pharmaceutical response to disease engenders encroachment by bacterial resistance to those treatments. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from population pressure:''' This widely documented phenomenon is associated with the ever-increasing use of non-renewable resources. Here encroachment by increasing population (and reproductive rights) engenders encroachment by the demands on resources which there is a reasonable probability cannot be fulfilled and will therefore engender a violent and unreasonable response.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment of old age:''' The process of ageing, and terminal illness, may be experienced as encroaching shadows on human dignity. Equally, while near the peak of their careers, people may note the encroachment of youth and change. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other uses==
In medical terminology, a temporal encroachment has to do with bones in the skull pressing tightly against the brain after an injury to the head.

In computer science, a [[temporal key]] that is improperly validatated is considered a temporal encroachment.

'''Use value''' (German: ''Gebrauchswert'') or '''value in use''' is a concept in classical political economy and Marxian economics. It refers to the tangible features of a commodity (a tradeable object) which can satisfy some human requirement, want or need, or which serves a useful purpose. In [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] critique of [[political economy]], any product has a labor-value and a use-value, and if it is traded as a [[commodity]] in markets, it additionally has an [[exchange value]], most often expressed as a money-[[price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/u/s.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: Us |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a ''general utility'', implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.  
== Origin of the concept ==
The concepts of value, use value, utility, exchange value and price have a very long history in economic and philosophical thought. From [[Aristotle]] to [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] their meanings have evolved.  Smith recognized that commodities may have an exchange-value but may satisfy no use-value, such as diamonds, while a commodity with a very high use-value may have a very low exchange-value, such as water.  Marx comments for example that "in English writers of the 17th century we frequently find ''worth'' in the sense of value in use, and ''value'' in the sense of exchange-value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | editor-first=Karl | editor-last=Marx | title= Capital  | volume = I, Chapter 1, Note 4. |  work = referring to John Locke, "Some Considerations on the consequences of the lowering of interest, 1691," in Works Edit. London, 1777. Vol. II, p. 28.| url= http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/marx/cap1/chap01 |access-date = 18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the expansion of market economy, however, the focus of economists has increasingly been on prices and price-relations, the social process of exchange as such being assumed to occur as a naturally given fact.  

In ''The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844'', Marx emphasizes that the use-value of a labour-product is practical and objectively determined;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Capital I, Chapter 1, two paragraphs starting "The utility of a thing makes it a use value." http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/marx/cap1/chap01 accessed 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, it inheres in the intrinsic characteristics of a product that enable it to satisfy a [[human need]] or want. The use-value of a product therefore exists as a material reality vis-a-vis [[social needs]] regardless of the individual need of any particular person. The use-value of a commodity is specifically a [[social]] use-value, meaning that it has a generally accepted use-value for others in society, and not just for the producer.

== Marx's definition ==
{{Marxian economics |concepts}}

Marx first defines use-value precisely in ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859) where he explains that:

{{quote|"To begin with, a commodity, in the language of the English economists, is 'any thing necessary, useful or pleasant in life,' an object of human wants, a means of existence in the widest sense of the term. Use-value as an aspect of the commodity coincides with the physical palpable existence of the commodity. Wheat, for example, is a distinct use-value differing from the use-values of cotton, glass, paper, etc. A use-value has value only in use, and is realized only in the process of consumption. One and the same use-value can be used in various ways. But the extent of its possible application is limited by its existence as an object with distinct properties. It is, moreover, determined not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Different use-values have different measures appropriate to their physical characteristics; for example, a bushel of wheat, a quire of paper, a yard of linen. Whatever its social form may be, wealth always consists of use-values, which in the first instance are not affected by this form. From the taste of wheat it is not possible to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French peasant or an English capitalist. Although use-values serve social needs and therefore exist within the social framework, they do not express the social relations of production. For instance, let us take as a use-value a commodity such as a diamond. We cannot tell by looking at it that the diamond is a commodity. Where it serves as an aesthetic or mechanical use-value, on the neck of a courtesan or in the hand of a glass-cutter, it is a diamond and not a commodity. To be a use-value is evidently a necessary prerequisite of the commodity, but it is immaterial to the use-value whether it is a commodity. Use-value as such, since it is independent of the determinate economic form, lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy. It belongs in this sphere only when it is itself a determinate form. Use-value is the immediate physical entity in which a definite economic relationship—exchange-value—is expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ch01.htm#2 |title=Economic Manuscripts: Critique of Political Economy. The Commodity |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept is also introduced at the beginning of ''[[Das Kapital]],'' where Marx writes, but in the extract below he holds it up as a critique of Hegel's liberal "Philosophy of Right".  He remained a sharp critic of what was to the Marxian view a destructive philosophy:

{{Quotation|"The utility of a thing makes it a use value. But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities. When treating of use value, we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The use values of commodities furnish the material for a special study, that of the commercial knowledge of commodities.  Use values become a reality only by use or consumption: they also constitute the substance of all wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth. In the form of society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material depositories of exchange value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm | title = Elements of the Philosophy of Right | first = Georg W.F. | last = Hegel | year = 1820 | location = Berlin, Prussia }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was a direct reference by Marx to Hegel's ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/property.htm §63]. Marx adds that:

{{Quotation|"A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &amp;c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use values. (And not only for others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use value, by means of an exchange.) Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Karl | last = Marx | title = Capital: A Critique of Political Economy| volume= Vol. I | page = 30| orig-year = 1867 | date = 1887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx acknowledges that a nominal price or value can be imputed to goods or assets which are not reproducible goods and not produced by human labour, as correctly noted later by Engels that a product is not necessarily a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, The Process of Capitalist Production | editor-first = Karl | editor-last = Marx | editor-first2 = Friedrich | editor-last2 = Engels| publisher = fourth German edition by [[Ernest Untermann]], The Modern Library series | orig-year = 1859| year = 1920| edition = 4th }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However Marx generally holds that only human labour expended can create value compared with Nature, through instrumentation known as modus operandi, or the method of working.{{efn| it is only latterly that the phrase ''modus operandi'' (Lat.) has morphed into the MO of a criminal in the language of the law.}}

==Transformation into a commodity==
"As exchange-values, all commodities are merely definite quantities of congealed labour-time", wrote Karl Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy. Vol. 1. Trans. Ben Fowkes. New York: Penguin, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy of the true purpose of value came to be one of the biggest sources of conflict between capital and labour.  The transformation of a use-value into a social use-value and into a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] (the process of [[commodification]]) is not automatic or spontaneous, but has technical, social and political preconditions. For example, it must be possible to trade it, and to transfer ownership or access rights to it from one person or organization to another in a secure way. There must also be a real market demand for it. And all that may depend greatly on the nature of the use-value itself, as well as the ability to package, store, preserve and transport it. In the case of [[information]] or [[communication]] as use-values, transforming them into commodities may be a complex and problem-fraught process.

Thus, the objective characteristics of use-values are very important for understanding (1) the development and expansion of market trade, and (2) necessary technical relationships between different economic activities (e.g. [[supply chain]]s). To produce a car, for example, you objectively require steel, and this steel is required, regardless of what its price might be. Necessary relationships therefore exist between different use-values, because they are technically, materially and practically related. Some authors therefore write about an "industrial complex" or "technological complex", indicating thereby how different technological products are linked in a system. A good example would be all the different products involved in the production and use of motor cars.

The category of use-value is also important in distinguishing different [[economic sectors]] according to their specific type of output. Following [[Quesnay]]'s analysis of economic [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]], Marx distinguished between the economic sector producing means of production and the sectors producing consumer goods and luxuries.&lt;ref&gt;Capital II, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[national accounts]] more subtle distinctions are made, for example between primary, secondary and tertiary production, semi-durable and durable goods, and so on.

==Role in political economy==
{{Section OR|date=September 2010}}
In his textbook ''The Theory of Capitalist Development'' (1942), American Marxist [[Paul Sweezy]] claimed that:

{{Quotation|"Use-value is an expression of a certain relation between the consumer and the object consumed. Political economy, on the other hand, is a social science of the relations between people. It follows that 'use-value as such' lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy."}}

Curiously, Sweezy disregarded that in consuming (both [[intermediate consumption|intermediate]] and final consumption), producers and consumers might ''also'' be socially related.

Likewise, in his influential ''Principles of Political Economy'', the Japanese Marxist [[Kozo Uno]] sums up the theory of a "purely capitalist society" in the three doctrines of circulation, production and distribution. Apparently it did not occur to him that even in the purest capitalist society, (final) consumption would have to occur as a necessary aspect of economic reproduction, and that capitalist relations extended to, and included, the way in which consumption was organised in capitalist society—increasingly substituting private consumption for collective consumption.

Marx himself explicitly rejected Sweezy's and Uno's interpretation (see the quotation from 1859 cited previously, in which use-value is distinguished from the general concept of utility). In a draft included in the [[Grundrisse]] manuscripts, which inspired the starting point of ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' and ''Das Kapital'', Marx explicitly states that:

{{Quotation|"The commodity itself appears as unity of two aspects. It is use value, i.e. object of the satisfaction of any system whatever of human needs. This is its material side, which the most disparate epochs of production may have in common, and whose examination therefore lies beyond political economy. Use value falls within the realm of political economy ''as soon as it becomes modified by the modern relations of production, or as it, in turn, intervenes to modify them''. What it is customary to say about it in general terms, for the sake of good form, is confined to commonplaces which had a historic value in the first beginnings of the science, when the social forms of bourgeois production had still laboriously to be peeled out of the material, and, at great effort, to be established as independent objects of study. In fact, however, the use value of the commodity is a given presupposition—the material basis in which a specific economic relation presents itself. It is only this specific relation which stamps the use value as a commodity. — Karl Marx, Fragment on Value, in: ''Grundrisse'', Notebook 7 (1858), emphasis added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch17.htm#p867 |title=Economic Manuscripts: Grundrisse | pages = 851 – 861 | publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

In an important essay [[Roman Rosdolsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/05/rosdolsky-on-marxs-use-value.html |title=maximum red: Rosdolsky on Marx's 'use-value' |publisher=Maximumred.blogspot.com |date=2005-05-27 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the important role of use value in Marx's economics. The fact is that Marx himself, in the introduction to his ''Grundrisse'' manuscript, had defined the economic sphere as the ''totality'' of production, circulation, distribution ''and consumption''. He did not however live to finish ''Das Kapital'', and did not theorise how commercial relations would reshape the sphere of personal consumption in accordance with the requirements of [[capital accumulation]].

Minor issues remained from the redundant neoclassical theories, such as the question of the proper empirical definition of capital and labour in the laws [[factor substitution]].  Other empirical issues include the so-called [[Solow Residual]] in which the heterogenous nature of labour is thoroughly explored for its qualitative elements beyond differentiation.  and the concept of total factor productivity, prompting some to consider such things as technology, human capital, stock of knowledge to name a few tested.  It was only later that scholars such as [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Ben Fine]], [[Manuel Castells]] and [[Michel Aglietta]] tried to fill this gap in Marx's unfinished work.  In modern times the theory has been extended to conclude that conversion of energy-driven work does not rely on labour-intensive inputs; thus use can be unsupervised work that develops a notion of human capital.

''Equation:  A = P + hL''
(A, the Concept of Substitutive Work  = P, the loss of Primary Productive Energy (which is P/Ep, the coefficient of efficiency) + h, the units of energy (which is the energy consumed by workers during work done) * L,  Labour time per hour)

==Utility==
Marx's concept of use-value seems akin to, but in reality differs from the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] concept of utility.

*Marx usually assumes in his analysis that products sold in the [[Market (economics)|market]] have a use-value to the buyer, without attempting to quantify that use-value other than in product units of price, and commodity value. (this caused some of his readers to think wrongly that use-value played no role in his theory).  "The utility makes it a use value," &lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Das Kapital, vol.1, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neoclassicism|neoclassicals]], on the other hand, typically see prices as the quantitative expression of the general utility of products for buyers and sellers, instead of expressing their [[exchange-value]].  For "Price is the money-name of the labour realised in a commodity".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', Vol.1, p.70 &lt;/ref&gt;
*In neoclassical economics this utility is ultimately subjectively determined by the buyer of a good, and not objectively by the intrinsic characteristics of the good. Thus, neoclassical economists often talk about the [[marginal utility]] of a product, i.e., how its utility fluctuates according to consumption patterns.  This kind of utility is a "general utility" which exists independently from particular uses that can be made of a product, the assumption being that if somebody wants, demands, desires or needs a good, then it has this general utility.  Marx rejected the concepy of marginal utility precisely because it accentuated profit on capital returns over the usefulness or utility of labour.  Thus the wider application of general utility lay in variable rates of productivity, since higher labour inputs could raise or lower the price of commodity.  This was the true concept of Use as a Value system: the higher the rate of 'productiveness' the more labour 'crystallised' in the article.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Capital, vol.1, pp.29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marx rejects any economic doctrine of [[consumer sovereignty]], stating among other things in his first chapter to ''Das Kapital'' that "In bourgeois societies the economic ''fictio juris'' prevails, that every one, as a buyer, possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities".

In summary, different concepts of use value lead to different interpretations and explanations of [[trade]], [[commerce]] and [[capitalism]]. Marx's main argument is that if we focus only on the general utility of a commodity, we abstract from and ignore precisely the specific social [[relations of production]] which created it.

=="Indifference" of capitalists==
Some academics such as Professor [[Robert Albritton]], a Canadian political scientist, have claimed that according to Marx, capitalists are basically "indifferent" to the use-value of the goods and services in which they trade, since what matters to capitalists is just the money they make; whatever the buyer does with the goods and services produced is, so it seems, of no real concern.

But this is arguably a misunderstanding of business activity and the [[bourgeoisie]] as a class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/epofe/c5sec3.asp |title=Epistemological Problems, Subjective Theory of Value, Use Value |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx thought that capitalists can never be totally "indifferent" to use-values, because inputs of sufficient quality (labour, materials, equipment) must be bought and managed to produce outputs that:

*will sell at an adequate profit,
*are legally permitted by the [[State (polity)|state]] to be sold,
*do not destroy the reputation of the supplier (with its obvious effect on sales).

For this purpose, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] in production must moreover be used in an economical way, and care must be taken not to waste resources to the extent that this would mean additional costs for an enterprise, or reduce productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxist.com/in-defence-of-ltv.htm | title = In Defence of Marx's Labour Theory of Value | accessdate = 2018-03-22 | first = Rob | last = Sewell | date = 13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theory of Use Values relates directly to human labour and the power of machines to destroy value, "Living labour must seize on these things, awaken them from the dead, change them from merely possible into real and effective use values.”&lt;ref&gt; Karl Marx, Das Kapital, vol.1, pp.45, 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is just that from the point of view of the financier or investor, the main concern is not what exactly is being produced as such or how useful that is for society, but whether the investment can make a profit for him. If the products of the enterprise being invested in sell and make a profit, then that is regarded as sufficient indication of usefulness. Even so, the investor is obviously interested in "the state of the market" for the enterprise's products—if certain products are being used less or used more, this affects sales and profits. So to evaluate "the state of the market", the investor needs knowledge about the place of a product in the [[value chain]] and how it is being used.

Often, Marx assumed in ''Das Kapital'' for argument's sake that supply and demand will balance, and that products do sell. Even so, Marx carefully defines the production process both as a [[Abstract labour and concrete labour|labour]] process creating use-values, and a [[valorisation]] process creating new value. He asserts only that "capital in general" as an abstract social power, or as a property claim to [[surplus value]], is indifferent to particular use-values—what matters in this financial relation is only whether more value can be appropriated through the exchanges that occur. Most share-holders are not interested in whether a company actually satisfies customers, they want an adequate profit on their investment (but a countertrend is so-called "[[socially responsible investing]]").

In modern times, business leaders are often very concerned with [[total quality management]] in production, which has become the object of scientific studies, as well as a new source of industrial conflict, since attempts are made to integrate ''everything'' a worker is and does (both his creative potential and how he relates to others) in the battle for improved quality. In that case, it could be argued not just [[labor power|labour power]] but the whole person is a use-value (see further [[Richard Sennett]]'s books such as ''[[The Culture of the New Capitalism]]'', Yale (2006). Some regard this practice as a kind of "[[wage-slavery]]".

From beginning to end, and from production to consumption, use-value and exchange-value form a [[dialectical unity]]. If this is not fully clear from Marx's writings, that is perhaps mainly because he never theorised the sphere of final [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] in any detail, nor the way in which [[commerce]] reshapes the way that final consumption takes place.

In [[theoretical physics]], the composition of two non-[[collinear]] [[Lorentz boost]]s results in a [[Lorentz transformation]] that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation. This rotation is called '''Thomas rotation''', '''Thomas–Wigner rotation''' or '''Wigner rotation'''. The rotation was discovered by [[Llewellyn Thomas]] in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derived by Wigner in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigner|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sequence of non-collinear boosts returns an object to its initial  velocity, then the sequence of Wigner rotations can combine to produce a net rotation called the [[Thomas precession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|Semon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still ongoing discussions about the correct form of equations for the Thomas rotation in different reference systems with contradicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebilas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Goldstein|Goldstein]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two non-collinear Lorentz transformations have been declared every bit as paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of common sense, such as the [[twin paradox]].''
Einstein's principle of velocity reciprocity (EPVR) reads&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''We postulate that the relation between the coordinates of the two systems is linear. Then the inverse transformation is also linear and the complete non-preference of the one or the other system demands that the transformation shall be identical with the original one, except for a change of {{mvar|v}} to {{math|−v}}''
With less careful interpretation, the EPVR is seemingly violated in some models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mocanu|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, of course, no true paradox present.

===Two general boosts===

When studying the Thomas rotation at the fundamental level, one typically uses a setup with three coordinate frames, {{math|Σ, Σ&amp;prime; Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. Frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}.

The axes are, by construction, oriented as follows. Viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ}} are parallel (the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ}}.) Also viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the spatial axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are parallel (and the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an application of EVPR: If {{math|'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}, then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime; {{=}} −'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. The velocity {{nowrap|{{math|3}}-vector}} {{math|'''u'''}} makes the ''same'' angles with respect to coordinate axes in both the primed and unprimed systems. This does ''not'' represent a snapshot taken in any of the two frames of the combined system at any particular time, as should be clear from the detailed description below.

This is possible, since a boost in, say, the positive {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}, preserves orthogonality of the coordinate axes. A general boost {{math|''B''('''w''')}} can be expressed as {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;('''w''')''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}}, where {{math|''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}} is a rotation taking the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} into the direction of {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a boost in the new {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|pp=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cushing|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each rotation retains the property that the spatial coordinate axes are orthogonal. The boost will stretch the (intermediate) {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} by a factor {{mvar|γ}}, while leaving the {{nowrap|intermediate {{math|''x''}}-axis}} and {{nowrap|{{math|''y''}}-axis}} in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that coordinate axes are non-parallel in this construction after ''two'' consecutive non-collinear boosts is a precise expression of the phenomenon of Thomas precession.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This preservation of orthogonality of ''coordinate axes'' should not be confused with preservation of angles between spacelike vectors taken at one and the same time in one system, which, of course, does not hold. The coordinate axes transform under the ''passive'' transformation presented, while the vectors transform under the corresponding ''active'' transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} as seen in {{math|Σ}} is denoted {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}}, where ⊕ refers to the [[velocity addition formula|relativistic addition of velocity]] (and not ordinary [[vector addition]]), given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v}{c^2}} \left[\left(1 + 
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}}{1+\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v \right)\mathbf u +
\frac{1}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf v \right],&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|VA 2}}}}

and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{|\mathbf{u}|^2}{c^2} } }&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]] of the velocity {{math|'''u'''}} (the vertical bars {{math|{{abs|'''u'''}}}} indicate the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude of the vector]]). The velocity {{math|'''u'''}} can be thought of the velocity of a frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}, and {{math|'''v'''}} is the velocity of an object, say a particle or ''another frame'' {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. In the present context, all velocities are best thought of as relative velocities of frames unless otherwise specified. The result {{math|'''w''' {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}} is then the relative velocity of frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}.

Although velocity addition is [[nonlinear]], non-[[associative property|associative]], and non-[[commutative property|commutative]], the result of the operation correctly obtains a velocity with a magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}. If ordinary vector addition was used, it would be possible to obtain a velocity with a magnitude larger than {{math|''c''}}. The [[Lorentz factor]] {{math|''γ''}} of both composite velocities are equal,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \gamma_{\mathbf {u} \oplus \mathbf{v}} = \gamma_{\mathbf {v} \oplus \mathbf{u}} = \gamma_\mathbf{u} \gamma_\mathbf{v}\left(1+ \frac{\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} }{c^2}\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s are equal under interchange of velocity vectors

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v| = |\mathbf v \oplus \mathbf u| = \frac{c}{\gamma}\sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the two possible composite velocities have equal magnitude, but different directions, one must be a rotated copy of the other. More detail and other properties of no direct concern here can be found in the main article.

===Reversed configuration===

Consider the reversed configuration, namely, frame {{math|Σ}} moves with velocity {{math|−'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, in turn, moves with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. In short, {{math|'''u''' → − '''u'''}} and {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} by EPVR. Then the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is {{math|(−'''v''') ⊕ (−'''u''') ≡ −'''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. By EPVR again, the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}} is then {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. {{EquationRef|(A)}}

One finds {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. While they are equal in magnitude, there is an angle between them. For a single boost between two inertial frames, there is only one unambiguous relative velocity (or its negative). For two boosts, the peculiar result of ''two'' inequivalent relative velocities instead of one seems to contradict the symmetry of relative motion between any two frames. Which is the correct velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}? Since this inequality may be somewhat unexpected and potentially breaking EPVR, this question is warranted.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is sometimes called the "Mocanu paradox". Mocanu himself didn't name it a paradox, but rather a "difficulty" within the framework of relativistic electrodynamics in a 1986 paper. He was also quick to acknowledge that the problem is explained by Thomas precession {{harvtxt|Mocanu|1992}}, but the name lingers on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation in terms of Lorentz transformations==

[[File:Lorentz boosts and Thomas rotation 1.svg|310px|thumb|A frame Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; is boosted with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to another frame Σ&amp;prime;, which is boosted with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to another frame Σ.]]

===Two boosts equals a boost and rotation===

The answer to the question lies in the Thomas rotation, and that one must be careful in specifying which coordinate system is involved at each step. When viewed from {{math|Σ}}, the coordinate axes of {{math|Σ}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are ''not'' parallel. While this can be hard to imagine since both pairs {{math|(Σ, Σ&amp;prime;)}} and {{math|(Σ&amp;prime;, Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;)}} have parallel coordinate axes, it is easy to explain mathematically.

Velocity addition does not provide a complete description of the relation between the frames. One must formulate the complete description in terms of [[Lorentz transformation]]s corresponding to the velocities. A Lorentz boost with any velocity {{math|'''v'''}} (magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}) is given symbolically by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates and transformation matrix are compactly expressed in [[block matrix]] form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \begin{bmatrix} c t' \\ \mathbf{r}' \end{bmatrix} \quad B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma_\mathbf{v} &amp; - \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} \\ -\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v} &amp; \mathbf{I} + \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1} \dfrac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2} \\ \end{bmatrix} \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c t \\ \mathbf{r} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and in turn, {{math|'''r''', '''r'''&amp;prime;, '''v'''}} are [[column vector]]s (the [[matrix transpose]] of these are row vectors), and {{math|''γ''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Lorentz factor]] of velocity {{math|'''v'''}}. The boost matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]. The inverse transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf {v} )^{-1}=B(-\mathbf {v} )\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=B(-\mathbf {v} )X' &lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that to each admissible velocity {{math|'''v'''}} there corresponds a ''pure'' Lorentz boost,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \leftrightarrow B(\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Velocity addition {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} corresponds to the composition of boosts {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} in that order. The {{math|''B''('''u''')}} acts on {{math|''X''}} first, then {{math|''B''('''v''')}} acts on {{math|''B''('''u''')''X''}}. Notice succeeding operators act on the ''left'' in any composition of operators, so {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} should be interpreted as a boost with velocities {{math|'''u'''}} then {{math|'''v'''}}, not {{math|'''v'''}} then {{math|'''u'''}}. Performing the Lorentz transformations by block matrix multiplication,

:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(\mathbf{u}) X \quad \Rightarrow \quad X'' = \Lambda X &lt;/math&gt;

the composite transformation matrix is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = B(\mathbf{v}) B(\mathbf{u}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\
-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and in turn

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma_\mathbf{v}\gamma_\mathbf{u}\left(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =\frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{u}\oplus\mathbf{v} \,, \quad \mathbf{b} = \frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{v}\oplus\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}=\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}\frac{\mathbf{vu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}+\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1}\frac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right)\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1}\frac{\mathbf{uu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''γ''}} is the composite Lorentz factor, and {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are 3×1 [[column vector]]s proportional to the composite velocities. The 3×3 matrix {{math|'''M'''}} will turn out to have geometric significance.

The inverse transformations are

:&lt;math&gt; X = B(-\mathbf{u}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(-\mathbf{v}) X'' \quad \Rightarrow \quad X = \Lambda^{-1} X'' &lt;/math&gt;

and the composition amounts to a negation ''and'' exchange of velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = B(-\mathbf{u}) B(-\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\\
\mathbf{a} &amp; \mathbf{M}^\mathrm{T}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the relative velocities are exchanged, looking at the blocks of {{math|Λ}}, one observes the composite transformation to be the [[matrix transpose]] of {{math|Λ}}. This is not the same as the original matrix, so the composite Lorentz transformation matrix is not symmetric, and thus not a single boost. This in turn translates to the incompleteness of velocity composition from the result of two boosts, symbolically;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v) \ne B(\mathbf v)B(\mathbf u) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

To make the description complete, it is necessary to introduce a rotation, before or after the boost. This rotation is the '''Thomas rotation'''. A rotation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = R(\boldsymbol{\theta})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the 4×4 rotation matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})={\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;\mathbf {R} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})\end{bmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|'''R'''}} is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In the literature, the 3d rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} may be denoted by other letters, others use a name and the relative velocity vectors involved, e.g., {{math|tom['''u''', '''v''']}} for "Thomas rotation" or {{math|gyr['''u''', '''v''']}} for "gyration" (see [[gyrovector space]]). Correspondingly the 4d rotation matrix {{math|''R''}} (non-bold italic) in this article may be denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tom} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{tom}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathrm{Gyr} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{gyr}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used, and {{math|'''θ''' {{=}} ''θ'''''e'''}} is the "axis-angle vector", the angle {{math|''θ''}} multiplied by a unit vector {{math|'''e'''}} parallel to the axis. Also, the ''right-handed'' convention for the spatial coordinates is used (see [[orientation (vector space)]]), so that rotations are positive in the anticlockwise sense according to the [[right-hand rule]], and negative in the clockwise sense. With these conventions; the rotation matrix rotates any 3d vector about the axis {{math|'''e'''}} through angle {{math|''θ''}} anticlockwise (an [[active transformation]]), which has the equivalent effect of rotating the coordinate frame clockwise about the same axis through the same angle (a passive transformation).

The rotation matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], its transpose equals its inverse, and negating either the angle or axis in the rotation matrix corresponds to a rotation in the opposite sense, so the inverse transformation is readily obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{-1}=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{\mathrm {T} }= R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad X=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})X'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

A boost followed or preceded by a rotation is also Lorentz transformation, since these operations leave the spacetime interval invariant. The same Lorentz transformation has two decompositions for appropriately chosen rapidity and axis-angle vectors;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{u})=R(\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\theta})=B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

and if these are two decompositions are equal, the two boosts are related by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{u})=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

so the boosts are related by a [[matrix similarity]] transformation.

It turns out the equality between two boosts and a rotation followed or preceded by a single boost is correct: the rotation of frames matches the angular separation of the composite velocities, and explains how one composite velocity applies to one frame, while the other applies to the rotated frame. The rotation also breaks the symmetry in the overall Lorentz transformation making it nonsymmetric. For this specific rotation, let the angle be {{math|''ε''}} and the axis be defined by the unit vector {{math|'''e'''}}, so the axis-angle vector is {{math|'''ε''' {{=}} ''ε'''''e'''}}.

Altogether, two different orderings of two boosts means there are two inequivalent transformations. Each of these can be split into a boost then rotation, or a rotation then boost, doubling the number of inequivalent transformations to four. The inverse transformations are equally important; they provide information about what the other observer perceives. In all, there are eight transformations to consider, just for the problem of two Lorentz boosts. In summary, with subsequent operations acting on the left, they are

Matching up the boosts followed by rotations, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (first diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (second diagram). If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (third diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (fourth diagram).

The cases of rotations then boosts are similar (no diagrams are shown). Matching up the rotations followed by boosts, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}. If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}.

===Finding the axis and angle of the Thomas rotation===

The above formulae constitute the relativistic velocity addition and the Thomas rotation explicitly in the general Lorentz transformations. Throughout, in every composition of boosts and decomposition into a boost and rotation, the important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}+\frac1{\gamma+1}\mathbf{ba}^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;

holds, allowing the rotation matrix to be defined completely in terms of the relative velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. The angle of a rotation matrix in the axis–angle representation can be found from the [[Rotation matrix#Determining the angle|trace of the rotation matrix]], the general result for ''any'' axis is {{math|tr('''R''') {{=}} 1 + 2 cos''ε''}}. Taking the trace of the equation gives&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macfarlane|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=4, 11, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2013|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\epsilon = \frac{(1+\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+\gamma_\mathbf{v})^2}{(1+\gamma)(1+\gamma_\mathbf{u})(1+\gamma_\mathbf{v})} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The angle {{math|''ε''}} between {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is ''not'' the same as the angle {{math|''α''}} between {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}.

In both frames Σ and Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;, for every composition and decomposition, another important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{Ra} &lt;/math&gt;

holds. The vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are indeed related by a rotation, in fact by the same rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} which rotates the coordinate frames. Starting from {{math|'''a'''}}, the matrix {{math|'''R'''}} rotates this into {{math|'''b'''}} anticlockwise, it follows their [[cross product]] (in the right-hand convention)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}= \frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}(\gamma^2 -1)(\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{v}+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)}{c^2(\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1)(\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)(\gamma+1)} \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

defines the axis correctly, therefore the axis is also parallel to {{math|'''u'''×'''v'''}}. The magnitude of this pseudovector is neither interesting nor important, only the direction is, so it can be normalized into the [[unit vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = \frac{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}|}&lt;/math&gt;

which still completely defines the direction of the axis without loss of information.

The rotation is simply a "static" rotation and there is no relative [[rotational motion]] between the frames, there is relative translational motion in the boost. However, if the frames accelerate, then the rotated frame rotates with an angular velocity. This effect is known as the [[Thomas precession]], and arises purely from the kinematics of successive Lorentz boosts.

== Finding the Thomas rotation ==
{{quote|text=The decomposition process described (below) can be carried through on the product of two pure Lorentz transformations to obtain explicitly the rotation of the coordinate axes resulting from the two successive "boosts". In general, the algebra involved is quite forbidding, more than enough, usually, to discourage any actual demonstration of the rotation matrix|source={{harvtxt|Goldstein|1980|p=286}}}}

In principle, it is pretty easy. Since every Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and a rotation, the consecutive application of two pure boosts is a pure boost, either followed by or preceded by a pure rotation. Thus suppose

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = B(\mathbf w)R.&lt;/math&gt;

The task is to glean from this equation the boost velocity {{math|'''w'''}} and the rotation {{math|''R''}} from the matrix entries of {{math|Λ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of events are related by

:&lt;math&gt;x'^\mu = {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this relation yields

:&lt;math&gt;{(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu{\Lambda^\mu}_\rho x^\rho = {(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu x'^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_\mu}^\nu x'^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Set {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''ct''&amp;prime;, 0, 0, 0).}} Then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will record the spacetime position of the origin of the primed system,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_0}^\nu x'^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^0 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^1 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^2 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^3 ct'\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = (B(\mathbf w)R)^{-1} = R^{-1}B(-\mathbf{w}),&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying this matrix with a pure rotation will not affect the zeroth columns and rows, and

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma\beta_x ct' \\ \gamma\beta_y ct' \\ \gamma\beta_z ct'\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma w_x t' \\ \gamma w_y t' \\ \gamma w_z t'\end{pmatrix}
= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} ct' \\  w_x t' \\ w_y t' \\ w_z t'\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

which could have been anticipated from the formula for a simple boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, and for the relative velocity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ct}\mathbf x = \frac{\mathbf w}{c} = \boldsymbol \beta = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x_1} {ct} \\ \frac{x_2} {ct} \\ \frac{x_3} {ct}\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \beta_x \\ \beta_y \\ \beta_z \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^1/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^2/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^3/{\Lambda_0}^0 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus given with {{math|Λ}}, one obtains {{math|'''β'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} by little more than inspection of {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Of course, {{math|'''w'''}} can also be found using velocity addition per above.) From {{math|'''w'''}}, construct {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}}. The solution for {{math|''R''}} is then

:&lt;math&gt;R = B(-\mathbf w)\Lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = RB(\mathbf w),&lt;/math&gt;

one finds by the same means

:&lt;math&gt;R = \Lambda B(-\mathbf w).&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a formal solution in terms of velocity parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} involves first ''formally'' multiplying {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}, formally inverting, then reading off {{math|'''β'''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form the result, ''formally'' building {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}} from the result, and, finally, formally multiplying {{math|''B''(−'''w''')''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}. It should be clear that this is a daunting task, and it is difficult to interpret/identify the result as a rotation, though it is clear a priori that it is. It is these difficulties that the Goldstein quote at the top refers to. The problem has been thoroughly studied under simplifying assumptions over the years.

==Group theoretical origin==

{{main|Lorentz group|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

Another way to explain the origin of the rotation is by looking at the generators of the [[Lorentz group]].

=== Boosts from velocities ===

The passage from a velocity to a boost is obtained as follows. An arbitrary boost is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-\boldsymbol \zeta \cdot \mathbf K},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''ζ'''}} is a triple of real numbers serving as coordinates on the boost subspace of the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3, 1)}} spanned by the matrices

:&lt;math&gt;(K_1, K_2, K_3) = \left( 
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right]
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The vector

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \zeta = \frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \tanh^{-1}\beta&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''boost parameter'' or ''boost vector'', its norm is the [[rapidity]]. Here {{mvar|β}} is the ''velocity parameter'', the magnitude of the vector {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''u'''/''c''}}. While for {{mvar|ζ}} one has {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}} the {{mvar|β}} is confined by {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}, and hence {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}}. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-(\tanh^{-1}\beta) \frac{ \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \cdot \mathbf K}
 = e^{-{\tanh^{-1}\beta \over c\beta} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf K} \equiv B(\mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

The set of velocities satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}} is an open ball in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is called the space of '''admissible velocities''' in the literature. It is endowed with a [[Velocity-addition formula#Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]] described in the linked article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutators===

The [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Explicit formulas|generators of boosts, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], in different directions do not commute. This has the effect that two consecutive boosts is not a pure boost in general, but a rotation preceding a boost.

Consider a succession of boosts in the x direction, then the y direction, expanding each boost to first order&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryder|1996|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = (I-\zeta_y K_y+\cdots)(I-\zeta_x K_x+\cdots)= I-\zeta_x K_x -\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x} = I+\zeta_x K_x +\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x +\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[group commutator]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x}e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = I &amp; + \zeta_x\zeta_y[K_y,K_x]-(\zeta_xK_x)^2-(\zeta_yK_y)^2 \\
&amp; +\zeta_x^2\zeta_y[K_x,K_y]K_x+\zeta_x\zeta_y^2K_y[K_y,K_x]\\
&amp; +(\zeta_x\zeta_y)^2K_yK_xK_yK_x +\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,J_y ] =  J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [K_x ,K_y ] = - J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,K_y ] = K_z &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is a [[binary operation]] known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

Returning to the group commutator, the commutation relations of the boost generators imply for a boost along the x then y directions, there will be a rotation about the z axis. In terms of the rapidities, the rotation angle {{mvar|θ}} is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\tanh \frac{\zeta_x}{2}\tanh \frac{\zeta_y}{2}  .&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime diagrams for non-collinear boosts==

The familiar notion of vector addition for velocities in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be done in a triangular formation, or since vector addition is commutative, the vectors in both orderings geometrically form a parallelogram (see "[[parallelogram law]]"). This does not hold for relativistic velocity addition; instead a [[hyperbolic triangle]] arises whose edges are related to the rapidities of the boosts. Changing the order of the boost velocities, one does not find the resultant boost velocities to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varićak|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions may be in violation of [[international human rights law]].

The Working Group was established by resolution in 1991 by the former [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]]. It is one of the thematic special procedures overseen by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and is therefore a subsidiary body of the UN.

==Mandate and composition==

The Working Group is mandated to receive and verify information from a variety of sources, in order to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily, or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.311]&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 9 states: ‘No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile’. In considering claims of arbitrary detention, the Working Group is not only guided by State national law, but other international legal instruments may also be relevant if accepted by the States concerned. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 9(1) states; “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be Deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.”

The Working Group's role is to investigate individual cases of arbitrary detention, as well as situations where the conditions in a country prompt concern over widespread occurrences of arbitrary detention. It has an intentionally broad mandate, to allow flexibility, and allow anyone to seek its assistance. The Working Group may send urgent appeals to governments to ascertain the whereabouts and condition of those allegedly detained, issues opinions on the compliance with international law and may also conduct fact-finding visits to countries. The Working Group also issue deliberations on issues, to assist States in avoiding behaviour that may enable arbitrary detention. Ensuring a communicative dialogue with Governments and intergovernmental and [[non-governmental organisations]] allows the Working Group to achieve success. The Working Group must work in coordination with other Human Rights Council mechanisms and is mandated to carry out its task with discretion, objectivity and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group mandate reflects the Commission’s concerns regarding worldwide instances of detention without legal basis. The Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Working Group with the following mandate:

# To investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily in individual cases 
# To complete field missions in order to receive information from Government and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and receive information from the individuals concerned, their families or their representatives; 
# To present annual reports to the Human Rights Council

The mandate lasts for a period of three years, and was most recently extended for a further three-year period by Human Rights Council resolution 33/30 of 30 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/228/05/PDF/G1622805.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 33/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===

The Working Group is composed of five independent experts. They are appointed in equitable geographical distribution from the following regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Other Countries, and South America and Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Three sessions are held per year, each lasting between five and eight days.

==Process==

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is tasked with acting on information of alleged cases of arbitrary detention. To fulfil this mandate, the Working Group may decide individual complaints of arbitrary detention, formulate deliberations to provide guidance on the interpretation of international standards related to detention circumstances and provide reports for the Human Rights Council. It may undertake country visits to achieve this.

The Working Group does not require the exhaustion of local remedies. However, its purpose is not to replace national courts.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This broadens its jurisdiction, as it allows the Group to bypass governments that may be stalling procedure.

Detention in itself does not necessarily violate human rights. Therefore, the Working Group must distinguish between lawful exercise of police power, and detention so lacking in lawful basis or otherwise unreasonable, that it must be considered arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual complaints and urgent appeals==

===Individual complaints===

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is unique in that its mandate expressly provides for the consideration of individual complaints. Individuals anywhere in the world are therefore able to petition the Working Group for consideration. The Group acts on information submitted to it by individuals directly, their families, or through representatives of [[Non-governmental organisations]].

The Working Group then sends communications to the Governments concerned, to clarify or bring attention to the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government is invited to respond to the allegations within 60 days, with its view on the issue. The Working Group then sends the reply to the source of the allegations, requesting more information. This process allows the Group to remain neutral in the information-gathering process.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group has identified detention or imprisonment as arbitrary if it falls into one of the following categories;
# Imposed without any legal basis
# Imposed because of the exercise of human rights 
# Imposed in violation of the principle of fair trial
# Prolonged administrative custody imposed on asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees
# Based on illegal discriminatory grounds

Examples of this can include continued detention after the completion of a sentence, denial of the exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, violations of the right to a fair trial, asylum and immigration claims, or detention based on ethnicity; religion; sexual orientation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.317]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving information under this adversary procedure, the Working Group then adopts one of the following approaches;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx], The UN.&lt;/ref&gt;

* If the individual concerned has been released, the Group may still decide to formulate an opinion on whether or not the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary
* The Group may find that the deprivation of liberty is not arbitrary, and will state an opinion as such
* The Group may seek further information from the individual or the Government
* If further information is unable to be sought, the Group may file the case subject to further confirmation
* The Group may decide that the arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been established, state an opinion to that effect, and make recommendations to the Government. These are then communicated to the Government. The opinion requests that the state takes the necessary steps to remedy the situation in order to bring it into conformity. The fulfilment of this request is often achieved by the release of the individual.

Upon evaluating contradicting evidence, such as between an individual claiming arbitrary deprivation of liberty and a government, the Working Group use a standard of 'convincing evidence', as opposed to evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The informal nature of the Working Group can strengthen the position of the individual represented, by easing the objective burden of proof on them.

===Urgent appeals===

If the Working Group receives information that raises concern about the immediate wellbeing of an individual, then it may, at its discretion, pursue an urgent action. The source must provide sufficiently reliable information that the continuation of deprivation poses significant threat to the psychological or physical wellbeing to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged situation may be time-sensitive in relation to loss of life or deportation. Rapid communication is sought with diplomats, such as the Foreign Minister (or equivalent). The Working Group request immediate action to ensure the detained person's right to life, as well as physical and mental integrity are respected.&lt;ref&gt;Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, available at http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This a purely humanitarian undertaking, and does not prejudice the Working Group's final opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty is indeed arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory procedures==

===Country visits===

In order to fulfil its mandate, the Working Group may conduct country visits. These provide an opportunity for the Group to understand the specific situation prevailing in countries. The Group undertake one to three country visits per year, upon invitation from the Government concerned.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in May 2017 the Working Group visited Argentina. In 2016 the Group visited the United States of America and Azerbaijan. The Group tend to visit between one and four countries per year.

On a country visit, members of the Working Group engage in a variety of tasks. These can include meeting with representatives of the executive, legislators, and other state officials. The Group also has the right to visit places of detention and have private discussions with detainees.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." They also enable the Working Group to evaluate internal legislation for its compatibility with international standards. Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Country visits enable the Working Group to gain a greater understanding of the social, political and historical environment in each country, enabling them to create context-appropriate recommendations.

===Deliberations===

More generally, the Working Group seeks to encourage broader international understanding of arbitrary detention, and promote universal standards.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a more general advisory role, with the formulation of deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Group formulates deliberations on general issues to assist States in safeguarding against the practice of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. For example, the Group have developed deliberations on issues relating to house arrest, psychiatric detention, deprivation of liberty subsequent to a conviction and resulting from the use of the internet, on rehabilitation through labour and situations regarding immigrants and asylum seekers. The Group have also provided legal analysis regarding the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] and clarified the definition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law and the urgent appeals procedure.

===Annual reports===

The Working Group must submit Annual Reports to the Human Rights Council, summarising the previous year's activities. The report will express observations made while investigating cases and on field missions in differing countries. The report details the Working Group's reasoning behind legal insufficiencies, policies and judicial policies that are the cause of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and recommend best practice to safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Annual.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The Group functions as a [[quasi-judicial body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The Group has no direct enforcement power of its own. Instead, it relies on communication among states, policy-makers and advocates to encourage governments to implement its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its reliance on the cooperation of states, it can be argued that this weakens the authority of the Group.

The opinions of the Working Group however are legally binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights laws, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This is applicable to states that have ratified the Covenant.

The opinions of the Working Group are considered authoritative by some prominent international judicial institutions including the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17013&amp;LangID=E United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of the Working Group arguably play a role in its success, as it allows it to provide a politically viable alternative to treaty-based human rights enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; The flexible mandate enables it to avoid direct political confrontation with governments, ultimately achieving more politically acceptable and lasting solutions to individual cases of arbitrary detention.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; While the opinions of the Working Group are not binding on states, they can facilitate information sharing among non-governmental organisations and governments. This can in turn lead to an increase in government accountability.

A further criticism of the Group is that it has taken no steps toward creating a robust follow up procedure, to apply pressure on states arbitrarily detaining individuals. Establishing a systematic follow up procedure could ensure an even greater accountability on governments, acting as a name and shame process to pressure them into action. A follow up procedure may also be beneficial for providing feedback for future policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; It could also aid non-governmental organisations in petitioning governments with unresolved cases. Having a record of resolved cases could help the Group to keep track of the status of detainees and any correlation between the action of the Working Group. Information and statistics drawn from this can be publicised, and help to increase outreach.

==Development of Draft Principles==

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Council]] requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to develop draft basic principles. These were to provide guidelines on remedies and procedures for anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The intention behind these were to assist states in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55f7d5844.pdf Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]&lt;/ref&gt; States, treaty bodies, human rights institutions and non-governmental organisations were invited to submit details on the treatment of the right to bring such proceedings before a court, in their respective legal frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The text was adopted in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/DraftBasicPrinciples/March2015/WGAD.CRP.1.2015.pdf United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable case==

===Julian Assange===
On 5 February 2016, the group released a report stating that Assange had been subject to [[arbitrary detention]] by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison in Britain and Sweden, on conditional bail, and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the report, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/world/britain-sweden-should-accept-ruling-on-julian-assange-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-2618960.html "Britain, Sweden should accept ruling on Julian Assange: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights"]. ''Firstpost'' (India). 6 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17012&amp;LangID=E The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention Deems the deprivation of liberty of Mr. Julian Assange as arbitrary]. The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR). 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and Swedish governments rejected the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/02/05/assange-warrant-still-active--uk-police.html |work=Sky News Australia |title=UK, Sweden reject UN ruling on Assange |date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, [[Philip Hammond]], said the claim was "ridiculous" and that the group was "made up of lay people", and called Assange a "[[fugitive from justice]]" who "can come out any time he chooses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecuador-sweden-assange-hammond-idUKKCN0VE120 Hammond calls U.N.

''The Guardian'' (London). 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein]] has claimed that the finding is based on international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain, Sweden should accept Assange ruling: UN rights chief|url=http://www.newsjs.com/url.php?p=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/world/66368|access-date=13 February 2016|publisher=Haveeru.com|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13th February 2018, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, while considering whether the arrest warrant issued against Assange should be upheld, rejected the findings of the Working Group, stating in part that "The group appears to have based its conclusions on some misunderstandings of what occurred after Mr Assange’s arrest." Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) Emma Arbuthnot did not find that Mr Assange’s stay in the Embassy was "inappropriate, unjust, unpredictable, unreasonable, unnecessary or disproportionate." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43049474 "Julian Assange: Warrant for his arrest upheld by court"].

'''World Conference on Women, 1975''' was held between 19 June and 2 July 1975 in Mexico City, Mexico. It was the first international conference held by the United Nations to focus solely on women's issues and marked a turning point in policy directives. After this meeting, women were viewed as part of the process to develop and implement policy, rather than recipients of assistance. The conference was one of the events established for [[International Women's Year]] and led to the creation of both the United Nations Decade for Women and follow-up conferences to evaluate the progress that had been made in eliminating discrimination against women and their equality. Two documents were adopted from the conference proceedings, the [[World Plan of Action]] which had specific targets for nations to implement for women's improvement and the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]], which discussed how nations foreign policy actions impacted women. It also led to the establishment of the [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] to track improvements and continuing issues and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] to provide funding for developmental programs. The conference marked the first time that the parallel Tribune meeting was successful in submitting input to the official meeting and became a catalyst for women's groups to form throughout the world.

==History==
The World Conference on Women occurred in the 1970s amid the [[Cold War]] when geopolitical conflict was controlled based on the interests of the United States or the USSR in various regions throughout the world, polarizing the world into two camps and their respective fields of influence.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|p=93}} At a time when the United States had just withdrawn from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]],{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} forty-eight separate conflicts would rock Asia in such places as [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh]], [[Cambodian coup of 1970|Cambodia]], [[New Order (Indonesia)|Indonesia]], [[Laotian Civil War|Laos]], [[Communist insurgency in Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Pakistan]], [[1977 anti-Tamil pogrom|Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=94–95}} African wars during the end of [[decolonization]] in the 1970s turned toward long-lasting [[civil wars]] in [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]], [[Ogaden War|Ethiopia-Somali]], [[Mozambique]] and other African nations, with the superpowers manipulating the conflicts in the background with troops and arms.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=92–96}} [[Decolonization]] of the Caribbean saw twelve states gain their independence between 1962 and 1983, but simultaneously remain marginalized by pressures from world powers which continued to manipulate local concerns.{{sfn|Bégot|Buleon|Shurmer-Smith|2012}}{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|p=175}} Two significant Middle East conflicts occurred in [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]] with the US backing its Arab allies and Israel, while the USSR backed [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] regimes.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=92–93}} In [[Central America|Central]] and South America various [[coups d'état]]s in [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|Argentina]], [[History of Bolivia (1964–82)#The Banzer regime|Bolivia]], [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Chile]], [[History of Ecuador (1960–1990)#Velasco (1967 - 72)|Ecuador]], [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] and dictatorships led to instability and decimation of indigenous populations.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|p=93}}

Responses to the conflict often had additional repercussions, such as the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Oil embargo]], a response to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which caused the price of oil to rise on the world market from three dollars per barrel to twelve dollars per barrel.{{sfn|Frum|2008|p=318}} The embargo was followed by the [[1979 energy crisis]], sparked by concerns over lowered production caused by the [[Iranian Revolution]] and how continued instability might impact oil availability. That in turn led to a build up of reserves, during which time the price of oil doubled and forced the world to look at alternative sources of oil.{{sfn|Graefe|2013}}{{sfn|Macalister|2011}} Adding to the conflicts of the time were racial inequalities, ranging from [[Apartheid]] and [[Zionism]] to [[Paternalism]].{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=524}}

Work had long been ongoing by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women. By 1965, it was believed that enough support had been garnered to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates began drafting a declaration. On 7 November 1967, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), was passed by the General Assembly.{{sfn| Fraser|1999|pp=891–892}} In 1972, the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding. That same year, CSW proposed that DEDAW become a legally binding [[Treaty|Convention]]. To that end, the United Nations proclaimed 1975 as [[International Women's Year]] and the CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage. [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events.{{sfn| Fraser|1999|pp=893–894}} Added significance of the date was that the conference would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}}

===Official conference===
When the United Nations designated 1975 as [[International Women's Year]], no conference was planned as part of the celebrations because delegates on opposing sides of the [[Cold War]] could not agree to authorize one.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} Initially proposed by the Romanian delegate of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|UN Commission on the Status of Women]], communist women joined to [[filibuster]] the project,{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} instead proposing a women's congress in [[East Berlin]], which had nothing to do with the United Nations.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As a counter, the US proposed a gender neutral conference to be held in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to promote equality for men and women, because the presence of men would legitimize the conference.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974}} When Mexico City agreed to host the conference, [[Princess Ashraf]] of Iran began collecting funds,{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} and each side mobilized to shape the agenda. The US position advocated for political rights and elimination of discrimination through legal remedies. The Soviet camp advocated for women to be empowered so that they could use their natural abilities as nurturers to stem violence and inequality which created poverty and injustice.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=4}}

Though {{ill|Pedro Ojeda Paullada|es}}, the Mexican Attorney General, was appointed head of the conference, the majority, 113 of the 133 delegation leaders were women.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=443}}{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=42}} The conference was a governmental meeting, not a meeting of women, and as such the high percentage of women marked the first time that 73% of the delegates for a UN conference were women, even if the 27% participation by men was higher than the number of women typical at such conferences.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=42}} The nature of the conference also dictated that all delegates, as representatives of their governments would follow the ideological agendas of their governments, rather than act upon any private convictions.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} Among the prominent delegates, which many feminists felt were chosen for ideological reasons or ties to prominent male politicians, were [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], Prime Minister of [[Sri Lanka]];{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=124}} [[Anna Louise Beer]], chair of the [[Norwegian National Women's Council]]; [[Vilma Espín|Vilma Espín de Castro]], sister-in-law to the Cuban president; [[Francoise Giroud]], [[Ministry of Women's Affairs (France)|French Minister of Women's Affairs]];{{sfn|''The Ames Daily Tribune''|1975|p=6}} [[Imelda Marcos]], [[First Lady of the Philippines]]; [[Ashraf Pahlavi]], twin sister of Iran's shah;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=526}} [[Leah Rabin]], [[First Lady of Israel]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=448}} [[Elizabeth Anne Reid]] of Australia;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=527}} [[Silvana Maria Rota]], [[Argentina|Argentine]] congresswoman;{{sfn|''The Ames Daily Tribune''|1975|p=6}} [[Jehan Sadat]], [[First Lady of Egypt]];{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=265}} Soviet [[Cosmonaut]] [[Valentina Tereshkova]], the first woman in space; [[Vida Tomšič]], [[Yugoslavia]]n representative of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]];{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=534}} [[Khunying Suparb Visessurakarn]], vice president of [[Thailand]]'s National Council on Social Welfare;{{sfn|Klemesrud|1975|p=7}} but not [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]], as the US administration feared linking the threat of [[anti-capitalist]] sentiment with women's issues.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}

After opening remarks by [[Kurt Waldheim]], President [[Luis Echeverría]] of Mexico spoke, stating that women, in their role as mothers, were allies of the oppressed and that "no woman was more discriminated against or exploited than the woman without bread, school or medicines for her children". Setting the stage, Echeverría's comments mirrored the position that the nurturing nature of women could help to solve the worlds' crises, if marginalization were eliminated.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=123–124}} It was agreed that the themes of equality, development and peace were the primary focus of action, as they were international in nature and required simultaneous action by global components.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=131}} In general discussion it was recognized that to achieve equality and attain the fundamental human rights and freedoms expressed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the inferior status of women had to be addressed to bring about parity in civic, economic, legal, social and political spheres.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=132}} Recognizing that legal changes alone could not ensure equality, the general discussion agreed that developmental programs made available to both urban and rural women must include women in all decision-making levels, from planning to implementation and analysis, and must provide adequate training. The discussion also recognized the need to monitor advances in women's progress as well a societal change in attitudes toward women via national institutions.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=135–137}} In efforts toward peace, the discussion recognized women's contributions to developing friendly international relationships and pressing for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. Increased participation by women in international and regional problem-solving summits, was discussed as a way to maintain peace and security.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=139}} 
 
The first committee, under the chair [[Jeanne Martin Cissé]] of [[Guinea]], with vice-chairs, [[Gladys Freire de Addiego]] of [[Uruguay]], {{ill|Jaroslav Havelka|cs}} of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Nilima Ibrahim]] of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Rapporteur]] John Bruce Campbell of Australia{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=140}} discussed the World Plan of Action. The plan, which had previously been drafted by a diverse range of UN committees, established a broad range of targets, considering that national developments were in varying stages, to be accomplished over the next decade (1975–1985).{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=141}}{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=7}} In addition to adopting the overall plan as revised by subcommittees, the first committee evaluating six draft resolutions, which dealt with research and training, international cooperation, women's status, the role of the UN in implementation of the Plan, women's health, and participation of women in future meetings of the UN. All were accepted with either no or minimal modification. The ''Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace'', was also reviewed by the committee and the draft accepted with minimal or no modification.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=151–152}} Some radical feminists, uninterested in reviewing a plan already prepared by UN committees tried to take over a US embassy meeting and yet another group walked out of the conference when Leah Rabin spoke.{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=7}}

The second committee, under the chair Shapour Rassekh of Iran, with vice-chairs, [[Edmonde Dever]] of [[Belgium]], [[Annie Jiagge]] of [[Ghana]] and [[Anna Papp]] of [[Hungary]] and Rapporteur {{ill|Phyllis MacPherson-Russell|de}} of [[Jamaica]]{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=153}} evaluated current trends and obstacles in the roles of men and women to achieving parity in rights, opportunities, and responsibilities; and how women could be integrated into developmental programs.  They discussed passage of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) as a critical step in the process. Recognizing the wide gap between the ''[[de jure]]'' and ''de facto'' status of women, the committee noted that to achieve equality changes would need to be made in a broad spectrum of areas including: education, employment opportunity, family, integration into existent systems, and the law.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=155–160}} Fifty-eight draft resolutions had been submitted for the committee to review, which covered these areas and they divided them into working groups to reduce duplications.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=163}} Winnowing down the drafts to twenty-one items which were accepted with modifications, the major areas concerned communications media, education and training, employment, exploitation of women and girls, family health, family planning, family security (including the elderly and disabled), financial assistance, integration to development, political and social participation, and systems to gather, collate and evaluate data on women's status.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=163–165}} The committee evaluated seven other drafts having to do with expanding the role of women in peace initiatives and nation rebuilding, and adopted each of them with little or no modification.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=166}}

===Tribune===
The International Women's Year Tribune was a parallel conference scheduled by women to be held simultaneously with the official conference. The format allowed for non-governmental organizations (NGO) to meet and discuss the issues tabled at the official conference, but gave them no authority to take any action.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=444}} There were around 6,000 delegates who attended the Tribune,{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} organized by [[Mildred Persinger]] the UN's [[YWCA]] observer,{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} including such women as [[Domitila Chúngara|Domitila Barrios de Chungara]], head of the Siglo XX Miners' Union Housewives Committee of [[Bolivia]];{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=261}} [[Nancy Cárdenas]], Mexican lesbian activist;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} [[Jacqui Ceballos]], former president of the New York chapter of [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=450}} [[Thelma Daily]] of the [[Coalition of Labor Union Women]] (CLUW); [[Carole DeSaram]], president of the New York NOW{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of NOW;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} [[Ronnie Feit]] of the [[National Women's Political Caucus]]; [[Dorothy Haene]] of the [[United Auto Workers]]; [[Dorothy Height]] of the [[National Council of Negro Women]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} [[Pat Keppler]] of the [[Harvard Divinity School]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=451}} [[Esperanza Brito de Martí|Esperanza Martí]], director of ''[[Fem (magazine)|Fem]]'' magazine and a Mexican feminist;{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=460}} [[Jan Peterson]] of CLUW;{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} and [[Margo St. James]], founder of [[COYOTE]].{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=267}} The founders of [[Women's World Banking]] met as part of the tribunal, including  [[Michael Walsh (banker)|Michaela Walsh]], a program associate at the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], who met [[Ela Bhatt|Ela R. Bhatt]], founder of [[Self-Employed Women's Association of India]], and [[Esther Afua Ocloo|Esther Ocloo]], a Ghanian businesswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=We Are Poor but So Many: The Story of Self-Employed Women in India|last=Bhatt|first=Ela R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Tribune was held on the opposite side of Mexico City, creating a physical as well as philosophical separation of the two groups.{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=525}} The difference in format stemmed from position that the delegates participated in discussions on official policy; whereas, the NGO tribunal women dealt with means and methods of program implementation to improve women's educational opportunities, equality, economic position and collaboration.{{sfn|Pauley|1975|p=12}} The Tribune hosted thirty-six planned meetings and nearly two hundred spontaneously organized additional sessions covering a wide variety of topics from [[Economic development|development]], [[Female education|education]], [[Population health|health]], human rights, [[peace]] and [[Women in the workforce|work]] to [[birth control]], [[Violence against women|gender violence]], lesbianism, prostitution, racism and [[sexism]].{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=525}} The dynamics of this conference were different from the official UN session because the participants were not governmental representatives, and delegates were free to discuss items openly avoided by the officials.{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=17}} But the free discussion also made apparent the divide separating the women. [[Western world|Westernized]] women focused on [[individual freedom]], Socialist women focused on the state's obligation to enforce the [[Collectivism|collective rights]] of all members of a society,{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|pp=526, 535}} and those from countries not aligned to either of these views pointed to the need for development, economic empowerment, food security{{sfn|''The Piqua Daily Call''|1975|p=3}} and correction of the structural problems in systems.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=268}}

Women from developing nations pointed out issues such as how aid from industrialized nations was often harmful, as it displaced women practicing subsistence agriculture with technology. Without adequate training to utilize technology, women who had been the prevalent food producers no longer had means to support their families. If they were utilized by new industry, women tended to be exploited as a cheap labor source, as laws for equal pay were non-existent in many developing economies.{{sfn|''The News Herald''|1975|p=4}} In light of these survival issues, the demands of others asking for [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]] seemed frivolous and indicative of self-indulgence.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=263}} Socialist women felt that equality could only come with a transformation of [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] relationships, which recognized the contributions of all members of society and denounced exploitation and discrimination on any basis.{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=535}} Amid the wide range of views, there were performances aimed at capturing media attention, with some attendees wearing [[Folk costume|national costumes]] and others wearing business attire, as well as rhetoric pitting ideologies against each other to gain a spotlight.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=265}}{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} At one point, frustrated that they could not be part of the official dialogue, a group of radical feminists planned to stage a march through the streets of Mexico City. Instead, a group of fifteen delegates was chosen who presented amendments to Helvi Sipilä requesting that they be given to the official committees. It was the first time that a Tribune had ever been successful in presenting their input to the officials. The amendments the Tribune proposed included establishment of a UN office to monitor success of the Plan, issue annual progress reports, and investigate human rights abuse against women. They also asked for the UN to improve their internal hiring policies so that more women were not only hired, but promoted to management and executive positions.{{sfn|Brady|1975|p=26}}

==Outcomes==
The conference adopted the official [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]], which was an indictment of the foreign policies that pushed [[military intervention|military]] or corporatist [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] to coerce developing nations from determining their own path. The Declaration passed with a vote of eighty-nine in favor, three against, and eighteen nations abstaining.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} The Plan established minimum targets to be attained within the next five years to secure for women the equal access of the mechanisms to attaining equality and eliminating discrimination; to full participation in development and their integration in extant systems; and to their contributions toward world peace and non-aggression. To reach these goals, the conference made education, employment, family planning, health and nutrition, and housing key focal points. The Tribune played a uniting role, by bringing together people of diverse cultures and backgrounds to formulate the means to overcome differences in objective and create pathways for NGOs to participate in the policy-making process. The conference not only encouraged member countries to develop policies which would lead to the improvement of women's lives, but led to the establishment of the United Nations Decade for Women as a means to focus those policies, as well as establishing a series of conferences to follow-up. The first of these would be the [[World Conference on Women, 1980|Second World Conference on Women]] to be held in [[Copenhagen]]. To assist in advancing women's development with research, operations support and training, the UN created the [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM).{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}}{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}

For the first time, institutional collection within the UN evaluated the extent of problems and conditions of women in varying nations, specifically separating data by sex to bring to light the level of inequality and discrimination towards women.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}} It was also one of the first international meetings of organized lesbians from multiple countries and cultures.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=5}} Attitudes within the member nations and the UN itself began to change as a result of the focus on women brought about by the conference.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=45}} Another benefit of the conference was that it connected women to other women in their struggles. Though in many ways the conference was not as effective in poor and undeveloped countries, because enforcement of the principals established and communication with women was harder in the developing world,{{sfn|Martin|2015}} there was a surge in women's activists coming together across the globe, as well as governmental understanding of the needs of their constituent women.{{sfn|Maier|Lebon|2010|pp=21, 143}}{{sfn|Fraser|2013}}

The '''XCOR Lynx''' was a proposed [[suborbital]] [[HTHL|horizontal-takeoff, horizontal-landing]] (HTHL),
[[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket-powered]] [[spaceplane]] that was under development by the California-based company [[XCOR Aerospace]] to compete in the emerging suborbital spaceflight market. The Lynx was intended to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload above 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The concept was under development since 2003, when a two-person suborbital spaceplane was announced under the name Xerus.

In January 2016, XCOR changed plans for the first flight of the Lynx spaceplane. It was initially planned for the second quarter of 2016 from the [[Midland International Air and Space Port|Midland spaceport]] in Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt.com/business/development/article_59287c2e-5682-11e5-b319-e7ad9e129220.html?mode=jqm|title=MSDC president: Lynx will launch from Midland this fiscal year|work=MRT.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in early 2016 it was pushed to an "undisclosed and tentative" date at the [[Mojave spaceport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt.com/news/top_stories/article_0783b3da-bced-11e5-97bc-6f2e78081a3e.html|title=XCOR officials refrain from disclosing date for Lynx test flights|publisher=Midland Reporter-Telegram|date=17 January 2016|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a21103/the-xcor-lynx-spaceplane-might-be-down-for-the-count//|title=The XCOR Lynx Spaceplane Might Be Down for the Count|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; XCOR announced development of the Lynx had been halted with layoffs of approximately one-third of the staff; the company intends to concentrate on development of their liquid hydrogen rocket under contract with [[United Launch Alliance]], instead.&lt;ref name=sn20160531/&gt;

Following the bankruptcy of XCOR Aerospace in 2017, the assets of the company were sold to the nonprofit organization Build A Plane, which will focus on education rather than suborbital flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-04-30|title=Bankrupt Spaceflight Company's Space Plane Assets to Help Young Minds Soar|url=https://www.space.com/40352-xcor-aerospace-lynx-space-plan-stem-education.html|newspaper=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Xerus===
In 2003, XCOR proposed the '''Xerus''' (pronunciation: zEr'us) [[suborbital spaceplane]] concept. It was to be capable of transporting one pilot and one passenger as well as some [[Suborbital spaceflight#Scientific experiments|science experiments]] and it would even be capable of carrying an [[upper stage]] which would launch near [[apogee]] and therefore would potentially be able to carry [[satellite]]s into [[Low Earth Orbit|low-Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name=sdc20030519&gt;[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/xcor_xerus_030520.html Space.com: ''XCOR Zeroes in on Xerus''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208081624/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/xcor_xerus_030520.html |date=December 8, 2009 }}, ''[[space.com]]'', 2003-05-19, accessed 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2007, XCOR continued to refer to their future two-person spaceplane concept as ''Xerus''.&lt;ref name=sdc20070423&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Leonard|title=XCOR Pursues Dream a Step at a Time|url=http://www.space.com/3589-xcor-pursues-dream-step-time.html|accessdate=2013-10-21|newspaper=Space.com|date=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- a search of the Space.com site reveals about a half-dozen mentions of Xerus over those years. --&gt;

The Lynx was initially announced on March 2008, with plans for an operational vehicle within two years.&lt;ref name=xcpr20080326&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcor.com/press-releases/2008/08-03-26_Lynx_suborbital_vehicle.html |title=XCOR AEROSPACE SUBORBITAL VEHICLE TO FLY WITHIN TWO YEARS |publisher=XCOR |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509143030/http://www.xcor.com/press-releases/2008/08-03-26_Lynx_suborbital_vehicle.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 a ticket price of $95,000 per seat was announced, with flights intended to commence in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16185-rocket-company-offers-95000-trips-to-space|title=Rocket company offers $95,000 trips to space|date=2 December 2008|publisher=New Space/Reuters|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The build of the Lynx Mark I [[Flight test|flight article]] did not commence until mid 2013 and, {{asof|2014|10|lc=y}} XCOR claimed that the first flight would take place in 2015.&lt;ref name = sdc20130916&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/22820-lynx-private-spaceship-jeff-greason.html |title=Lynx Space Plane Taking Off: Q&amp;A with XCOR Aerospace CEO Jeff Greason |last1=Schilling |first1=Govert |last2= |first2= |date=September 16, 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name = AviationWeek&gt;Norris, Guy (8 October 2014) [http://aviationweek.com/awin-only/xcor-lynx-moves-final-assembly XCOR Lynx Moves Into Final Assembly] Aviation Week, Retrieved 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 ticket prices increased by 50% to $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/07/17/xcor-hike-ticket-prices-50-percent/|title=XCOR to Hike Ticket Prices 50 Percent|date=July 2015|publisher=Parabolic Arc|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, three co-founders left their existing positions with the company to start Agile Aero. Dan DeLong (Chief Engineer) and Aleta Jackson left the company entirely, while Jeff Greason, the former CEO, remained on the Board of Directors until he resigned in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcor.com/news/new-board-of-directors-and-advisory-board-members/|title=New Board of Directors and Advisory Board Members|work=xcor.com|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405003107/http://www.xcor.com/news/new-board-of-directors-and-advisory-board-members/|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greason cited problems with the Lynx vehicle body, although the engine had been a success. As of mid 2016, development was suspended in favor of a ULA contracted hydrolox engine, the [[XCOR 8H21|8H21]].&lt;ref name=sn20160531/&gt;

As of December, 2015, [[Kayak.com]] was reportedly selling tickets for flights on the XCOR Lynx starting in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2015/12/14/travel-booking-site-starts-booking-space-vacations/ |title=Kayak starts booking space flights |date=14 Dec 2015 |accessdate=16 Dec 2015 |work=foxnews.com |author=Foxnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the company halted development of the Lynx spaceplane and pivoted company focus toward development its [[LOX]]/[[LH2]] engine technology, particularly on a funded project for [[United Launch Alliance]]. The company [[laid off]] more than 20 people of the 50–60 persons onboard prior to May.&lt;ref name=sn20160531&gt;

The development program of the XCOR Lynx 5K18 [[LOX]]/[[RP-1|kerosene]] engine reached a major milestone in March 2011.  Integrated test firings of the engine/nozzle combination demonstrated the ability of the aluminum nozzle to withstand the high temperatures of rocket-engine exhaust.&lt;ref name=satnewsnozzle&gt;

In an effort to prevent potential rework resulting from implementing designs not yet mature the Lynx fabrication was paused, so our engineering team has gone back to the design board."&lt;ref&gt;XCOR (November 2016), [http://www.xcor.com/media/65308/aerospace-report-nov-2016-no-ula-lr-v4.pdf Aerospace Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225081438/http://www.xcor.com/media/65308/aerospace-report-nov-2016-no-ula-lr-v4.pdf |date=2016-12-25 }}, retrieved 25 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test program==
Tests of the XR-5K18 main engine began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nasawatch.com/archives/2008/12/xcor-fires-lynx-engine.html | title =  Successful First Test Fire of Engine for Lynx Suborbital Launch Vehicle | publisher = NASA Watch | author=Keith Cowing|date=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, it was reported that engine tests were largely complete&lt;ref name=tsr20110228&gt;
{{cite news |last=Foust|first=Jeff |title=Suborbital back out of the shadows |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1790/1 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |newspaper=The Space Review |date=2011-02-28 |quote=''the 5K18 engine, four of which will power the Lynx ... the last few technical milestones for the engine are largely complete. ... non-toxic reaction control system (RCS) thrusters, a project that Greason said was more challenging in some respects than the larger main engine, but critical to the company’s vision of rapid turnaround times that would not be possible if conventional hydrazine RCS systems are used.

In October 2014, XCOR claimed that flight tests of the Mark I prototype would start in 2015.&lt;ref name=sdc20130916 /&gt;&lt;ref name = AviationWeek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Age of Space Flights is about to begin|url= http://www.flyfighterjet.com/xcor-lynx-space-flight/|publisher= flyfighterjet.com|date= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by January 2016, technical hurdles led the company to state that they had not assigned a new projected date for test flights.&lt;ref name =MRT&gt;{{cite web | title = XCOR officials refrain from disclosing date for Lynx test flights | publisher = Midland Reporter-Telegram  | date = January 17, 2016 | url = http://www.mrt.com/news/top_stories/article_0783b3da-bced-11e5-97bc-6f2e78081a3e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of operations==

===NASA sRLV program===
In March 2011, XCOR submitted the Lynx as a reusable launch vehicle for carrying research payloads in response to [[NASA]]'s suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) solicitation, which is a part of NASA's Flight Opportunities Program.&lt;ref name=nasa20110310&gt;
{{cite web |title=sRLV platforms compared |url=https://c3.ndc.nasa.gov/flightopportunities/platforms/compare/ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2011-03-10 |date=2011-03-07 |quote=Lynx: Type: HTHL/Piloted}}&lt;/ref&gt; No contract for providing this was ever announced.

===Commercial operations===

According to XCOR, the Lynx was intended to fly four or more times a day, and would have also had the capacity to deliver payloads into space. The Lynx Mark I prototype was expected to perform its first test flight in 2015,&lt;ref name = AviationWeek/&gt;&lt;ref name = Woollaston&gt;Woollaston, Victoria (14 March 2014) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2581024/Budget-XCOR-space-trip-set-launch-2016-let-pilot-ship-57-000.html 'Budget' XCOR space trip set to launch in 2016 will let you pilot the ship for £57,000] Daily Mail, Retrieved 26 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = moon20130109&gt;Belfiore, Michael, (9 January 2013) [http://moonandback.com/2013/01/09/lynx-rocket-plane-readying-for-summer-flight/ Lynx Rocket Plane Readying for Summer Flight] Moon and Back, Retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a flight of the Mark II production model twelve to eighteen months afterwards.&lt;ref name = AviationWeek/&gt;

XCOR had planned to have the Lynx's initial flights at the [[Mojave Spaceport|Mojave Air and Spaceport]] in [[Mojave, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/news/080326-xcor-lynx-spaceplane.html | title = XCOR Unveils New Suborbital Rocketship | publisher = SPACE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any licensed spaceport with a 2,400 meter (7900&amp;nbsp;ft) runway. Media reports in 2014 anticipated that by the end of 2015&lt;ref name = Nilsson&gt;Nilsson, Eric and Zhangyu, Deng (25 October 2014) "The Final Frontier" Daily Telegraph supplement "China Watch" Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2016&lt;ref name = Woollaston/&gt; the Lynx was expected to begin flying suborbital [[space tourism]] flights and scientific research missions from a new [[spaceport]] on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref&gt;(2012) [http://www.spacexc.com/en/bookings/ SXC - Buying your tickets into space!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306043002/http://www.spacexc.com/en/bookings/ |date=March 6, 2013 }} SXC web page, Retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writers | title = Space Expedition Corporation Announces Wet Lease of XCOR Lynx Suborbital | work = Space Media Network Promotions | publisher = Space-Travel.com   | date = October 6, 2010 | url = http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Space_Experience_Curacao_Announces_Wet_Lease_of_XCOR_Lynx_Suborbital_999.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Experience Curacao | work = Home | publisher = Space Experience Curacao  | date = 2009–2010 | url = http://spaceexperiencecuracao.com/ | accessdate = 2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company stated in January 2016 that they had not assigned a new projected date for test flights and a date for the launch of commercial operations could not be anticipated.&lt;ref name="MRT"/&gt;

Because it lacked any propulsion system other than its rocket engines, the Lynx would have to be towed to the end of the runway.  Once positioned on the runway, the pilot would have ignited the four rocket engines, take-off and begin a steep climb. The engines will be shut off at approximately 138,000 feet (42&amp;nbsp;km) and [[mach number|Mach]] 2. The [[spaceplane]] would then continue to climb, unpowered until it reached an [[apogee]] of approximately 200,000 feet (61&amp;nbsp;km).  The spacecraft would have experienced a little over four minutes of weightlessness, before re-entering the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. The occupants of the Lynx were intended to have experienced up to four times normal gravity during re-entry. After re-entry, the Lynx would have glided down and performed an unpowered landing. The total flight time was projected to last about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=engine/&gt; The Lynx was expected to be able to perform 40 flights before maintenance was required.

{{asof|2011|03}}, Orbital Outfitters was reportedly designing [[pressure suit]]s for XCOR use.&lt;ref name=suborbital&gt;{{cite web | title=Commercial Spacesuit Companies Compete for Market Share | url = http://www.parabolicarc.com/2011/03/21/commercial-spacesuit-companies-compete-market-share/| publisher= Parabolic Arc| date=March 21, 2011| accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2013|11|3}}.

As of 2012, the successor to the Mark II might have been a two-stage, fully reusable orbital vehicle that took off and landed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-next-frontier-an-interview-with-lee-valentine|title=The Next Frontier: An Interview with Lee Valentine|date=30 November 2012|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
