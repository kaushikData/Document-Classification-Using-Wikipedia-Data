      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">'''Abram Moiseyevich Deborin''' ('''Joffe''') ({{lang-ru|Абра́м Моисе́евич Дебо́рин Ио́ффе}}; {{OldStyleDate|June 16|1881|June 4}}, [[Upyna]], [[Kovno Governorate]] – March 8, 1963) was a Soviet [[Marxist]] [[philosopher]] and [[academician]] of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] (1929).

Entering the revolutionary movement by the end of the 1890s, Deborin joined the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] in 1903. By 1907, however, he switched to the [[Menshevik]] faction and became known as one of [[Georgi Plekhanov]]'s disciples, both in politics and philosophy. In 1908, Deborin graduated from the philosophy department at Bern University ([[Lyubov Axelrod|L. I. Akselrod]] had received her doctorate there in 1900). He soon began publishing major books and articles on philosophy from a Marxist perspective.

==After the Russian Revolution==
Soon after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Deborin left the Mensheviks and began lecturing at the [[Sverdlov University]], the [[Institute of Red Professors]] and the Institute of Philosophy. He soon assumed editorial duties at the journal, ''[[Under the Banner of Marxism]]'', which he headed from 1926-1931.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deborin, Abram Moiseevich |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Deborin%2c+Abram+Moiseevich |publisher=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979) |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborin joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1928. Following the 1917 October Revolution, [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|Soviet philosophy]] found itself divided itself between two factions:  the "dialecticians," headed up by Deborin, and "mechanists," whose leading figure was the philosopher [[Lyubov Akselrod]] (the then prominent Bolshevik leader [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]] was seen as an ally of the "mechanists," although he did not entirely agree with them).

==Under Stalin==
In 1931, [[Joseph Stalin]] decided the issue of the debate between dialecticians and mechanists by publishing a decree which identified [[dialectical materialism]] as pertaining solely to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. He then codified it in ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm Dialectical and Historical Materialism]'' (1938) by enumerating the "laws of dialectics", which are the grounds of particular disciplines and in particular of the science of history, and which guarantees their conformity to the "[[proletarian]] conception of the world". Thus, ''diamat'' was imposed on most Communist parties affiliated to the [[Third International]]. Diamat became the official [[philosophy]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and remained as such until its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]].  When Stalin decided in favor of dialectical materialism, Deborin made a show of support for Stalin's position.  For some years afterwards, Deborin kept a low profile, and most of his writings were suppressed. However, he lived long enough to see all of his works republished in the Soviet Union during the "thaw" under [[Nikita Khrushchev]].

'''Albert Schweitzer''', [[Order of Merit|OM]] (14 January 1875{{snd}}4 September 1965) was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] theologian, organist, writer, humanitarian, philosopher, and physician. A [[Lutheran]], Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of [[historical Jesus|Jesus as depicted by the historical-critical method]] current at this time, as well as the traditional [[Christology|Christian view]]. His contributions to the interpretation of [[Pauline Christianity]] concern the role of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s [[mysticism]] of "being in Christ" as primary and the doctrine of [[Justification by faith|Justification by Faith]] as secondary.

He received the 1952 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his philosophy of "[[Reverence for Life]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/press.html | contribution = Award Ceremony Speech | title = The Nobel Peace Prize 1952 | first = Albert | last = Schweitzer | publisher = The Nobel prize | date = 10 December 1953 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the eighth Frenchman to be awarded that prize. His philosophy was expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]] in [[Lambaréné]], in the part of [[French Equatorial Africa]] which is now Gabon. As a music scholar and organist, he studied the music of German composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and influenced the [[Organ reform movement|Organ Reform Movement]] (''Orgelbewegung'').

==Nationality==
Schweitzer was born in the province of [[Alsace]], which had been a French province since 1639 and became Prussian after France lost it to Prussia in 1871. It became French again in 1919, after Germany's defeat during the First World War. Schweitzer considered himself French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent |first2=Woodland |last2=Kahler |date=1974 |title=Olga: The memoirs of Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent |location=New York, NY |publisher=Walker}} qtd. in [https://ivu.org/history/europe20a/schweitzer.html ''ivu.org'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=See talk page, section Nationality 2017}} and wrote mostly in German. His mother-tongue was [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]], a Germanic dialect, although he was fluent in both French and German too.

==Education==
[[File:KaysersbergAS.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Albert Schweitzer's birthplace, Kaysersberg]]
Schweitzer was born in Kaysersberg, Haute Alsace, the son of Louis Schweitzer and Adèle Schillinger.{{sfn|Oermann|2016|p=43}}{{sfn|Free|1988|p=74}} He spent his childhood in the Alsatian village of [[Gunsbach]], where his father, the local [[Lutheran|Lutheran-Evangelical]] pastor of the [[EPCAAL]], taught him how to play music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | archivedate = 2006-04-26 | url = http://schweitzer.org/dutch/asstamm.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060426004850/http://schweitzer.org/dutch/asstamm.htm | title = Stammbaum – Genealogic tree Arbre généalogique de la famille Schweitze | publisher = Schweitzer}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tiny village became home to the [[Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer]] (AIAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.schweitzer.org/ | title = Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer | accessdate = 1 August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval parish church of Gunsbach was shared by the Protestant and Catholic congregations, which held their prayers in different areas at different times on Sundays. This compromise arose after the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Schweitzer, the pastor's son, grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance, and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=3–9}}

Schweitzer's first language was the Alsatian dialect of [[German language]]. At the [[Mulhouse]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] he received his "[[Abitur]]" (the certificate at the end of secondary education) in 1893. He studied [[Organ (music)|organ]] in Mulhouse from 1885 to 1893 with Eugène Munch, organist at the Protestant cathedral, who inspired Schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of German composer [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Eugene Munch'' (J. Brinkmann, Mulhouse 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he played for the French [[organist]] [[Charles-Marie Widor]] (at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]]), for whom [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship thus began.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=23–24}}

From 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the [[University of Strasbourg|Kaiser Wilhelm University]] in [[Strasbourg]]. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch, the brother of his former teacher, organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J.S. Bach's music.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=24}} Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg (under [[Otto Lohse]]) and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to see Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', which deeply impressed him. In 1898 he went back to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on ''The Religious Philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll]]. He also studied piano at that time with [[Marie Jaëll]].&lt;ref&gt;George N. Marshall, David Poling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UC5sXn1CwT4C&amp;pg=PA24 ''Schweitzer''], JHU Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8018-6455-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Schweitzer spent the summer semester at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and eventually obtained his theology degree in [[University of Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9nDF2hsN1oC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Albert+Schweitzer+university+of+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi73LjM5-LZAhXC1IMKHZtRBt0Q6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Albert%20Schweitzer%20university%20of%20berlin&amp;f=false|title=Albert Schweitzer's Ethical Vision A Sourcebook|last=Cicovacki|first=Predrag|date=2009-02-02|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199703326|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLRADgok_a0C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=Albert+Schweitzer+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje1tCh6OLZAhVRIqwKHS6RCwYQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Albert%20Schweitzer%20berlin&amp;f=false|title=Albert Schweitzer-helene Bresslau: the Years Prior to Lambarene|last=Schweitzer|first=Albert|last2=Bresslau|first2=Helene|last3=Stewart|first3=Nancy|date=2003|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815629948|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOm0iqkRsYEC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Albert+Schweitzer+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje1tCh6OLZAhVRIqwKHS6RCwYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Albert%20Schweitzer%20berlin&amp;f=false|title=Albert Schweitzer: A Biography|last=Brabazon|first=James|date=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815606758|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/schweitzer-bio.html|title=Albert Schweitzer - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his PhD thesis at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1899.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=24–25}}

In 1905, Schweitzer began his study of medicine at the University of Strasbourg, culminating in the degree of M.D. in 1913.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Music==
Schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist, dedicated also to the rescue, restoration and study of historic [[pipe organ]]s. With theological insight, he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] religious music. In 1899 he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bach's [[Chorale Preludes]] as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based. They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas, conceived visually. Widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old [[Lutheran]] hymns.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=20}}

The exposition of these ideas, encouraged by Widor and Munch, became Schweitzer's last task, and appeared in the masterly study ''J. S. Bach: Le Musicien-Poète'', written in French and published in 1905. There was great demand for a German edition, but, instead of translating it, he decided to rewrite it.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, ''My Life and Thought'', pp 80–81; cf. {{harvnb|Seaver|1951|pp=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was two volumes (''J. S.

[[File:Eglise St Thomas - Orgue de Choeur.JPG|thumb|left|175jpg|The Choir Organ at [[St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg]], designed in 1905 on principles defined by Albert Schweitzer]]
His pamphlet "The Art of Organ Building and Organ Playing in Germany and France" (1906,&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in {{harvnb|Joy|1953|pp=127–129, 129–165}}: cf. also {{harvnb|Seaver|1951|pp=29–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; republished with an appendix on the state of the organ-building industry in 1927) effectively launched the 20th-century ''[[Orgelbewegung]]'', which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than Schweitzer had intended. In 1909 he addressed the ''Third Congress of the International Society of Music'' at [[Vienna]] on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries, he produced a very considered report.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joy|1953|pp=165–166}}: Text of 1909 Questionnaire and Report, pp. 235–269.&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the ''International Regulations for Organ Building''. He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic [[reed pipe]]s, and with the classical Alsace [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] organ resources and baroque [[flue pipe]]s, all in registers regulated (by [[Organ stop|stops]]) to access distinct voices in [[fugue]] or [[counterpoint]] capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing the same music together.

Schweitzer also studied piano under [[Isidor Philipp]], head of the piano department at the [[Paris Conservatory]].

In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the [[Paris Bach Society]], a choir dedicated to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at [[Barcelona]], Spain, and often travelled there for that purpose.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=20}} He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Works for organ|Bach's organ works]], with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were to be worked on in Africa, but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=44}}

On departure for Lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a [[pedal piano]], a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Given by the Paris Bach Society, {{harvnb|Seaver|1951|p=63}}; but {{harvnb|Joy|1953|p=177}}, says it was given by the Paris Missionary Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Built especially for the tropics, it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to Lambaréné, packed in a zinc-lined case. At first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art, and fell out of practice: but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Widor, [[César Franck]], and [[Max Reger]] systematically.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=63–64}} It became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons. Schweitzer's pedal piano was still in use at Lambaréné in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joy|1953}} plate facing p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a visitor, Dr. Gaine Cannon, of Balsam Grove, N.C., the old, dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by Dr. Schweitzer in 1962, and stories told that "his fingers were still lively" on the old instrument at 88 years of age.

Sir [[Donald Tovey]] dedicated his conjectural completion of Bach's ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' to Schweitzer.

Schweitzer's recordings of organ-music, and his innovative recording technique, are described [[#Sound recordings|below]].

One of his notable pupils was conductor and composer [[Hans Münch (conductor)|Hans Münch]].

==Theology==
[[File:Strasbourg Tram.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Saint-Nicolas, Strasbourg]]
In 1899 Schweitzer became a deacon at the [[Saint Nicholas Church, Strasbourg|church of Saint Nicholas]] in Strasbourg. In 1900, with the completion of his licentiate in theology, he was ordained as curate, and that year he witnessed the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of [[Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)|Saint Thomas]], from which he had just graduated, and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent.{{Efn | He officiated at the wedding of [[Theodor Heuss]] (later the first President of West Germany) in 1908.{{sfn|Oermann|2016|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Brabazon|2000|p=422}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1956|p=63}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1957|p=63f}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | work=The Bulletin | location=Bonn, West Germany |publisher=Press and Information Office | issn=0032-7794 |volume=9-10 | year=1962 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o03jAAAAMAAJ&amp;&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=schweitzer+wedding | access-date=2 July 2017 | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1906 he published ''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'' ("History of Life-of-Jesus research"). This book, which established his reputation, was first published in English in 1910 as ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913, containing theologically significant revisions and expansions: but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001. In 1931 he published ''Mystik des Apostels Paulus'' ("The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle"); a second edition was published in 1953.

===''The Quest of the Historical Jesus (1906)''===
{{Main|The Quest of the Historical Jesus}}

In ''The Quest'', Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the "historical Jesus" back to the late 18th century. He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors, and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century's findings. He maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus' own convictions, which reflected late Jewish [[eschatology]]. Schweitzer writes:

{{Quote|The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah, who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God, who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed. He is a figure designed by rationalism, endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb. This image has not been destroyed from outside; it has fallen to pieces...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schweitzer | first = Albert | author-link =Albert Schweitzer|title=The Quest of the Historical Jesus|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uzRXxvPsylkC&amp;pg=PA478|year=2001 |publisher= Fortress Press |page= 478| isbn = 9781451403541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept that Christianity started as a Jewish apocalyptic movement is evidenced by the teachings of the historical Jesus concerning the end of days. Not only did he preach he would rise from the grave, but that he would also ascend to heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world, saying that no one, including himself, knew the exact time of his return, but it would be before the end of his generation. Schweitzer verified the many New Testament references clearly explaining that 1st-century Christians believed in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World's ending within the lifetime of Jesus's original followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Pcisys | url = http://home.pcisys.net/~jnf/schauth/rq2.html | title = Review of "The Mystery of the Kingdom of God"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that in the gospel of Mark, Jesus speaks of a "tribulation", with his "coming in the clouds with great power and glory" (St Mark), and states when it will happen: "This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled" (St Matthew, 24:34) (or, "have taken place" (Luke 21:32))

In ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', Schweitzer observes the Bible contradicting the possibility of important events that never took place and never can take place as they are described; Jesus specifically states that we are to "not seal up the words of the prophecy" and promises that some of his listeners as well as the high priest at his trial would be alive to see him return to the Earth. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near" (Revelation 1:3). Saint Paul spoke of the "last times": "Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none" (1 Corinthians 7:29); "God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son" (Hebrews 1:2); "There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom" (Matthew 16:28) (or, "until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power" (Mark 9:1); or, "till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:27).)

Schweitzer continues writing in ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' that it is totally unreasonable to think that "coming quickly", "near", and "soon" could mean hundreds, much less thousands, of years in the future. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." (Revelation 1:3) "And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). "All these things shall come upon this generation" (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.

In ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', Schweitzer notes the passage "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." (Revelation 1:3) Similarly in St Peter: "Christ .. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you" (1 Peter 1:20), and "But the end of all things is at hand" (1 Peter 4:7). "Surely I come quickly" (Revelation 22:20). Schweitzer felt that St. Paul clearly believed in the immediacy of the [[Second Coming of Jesus]], in stark contrast to modern organized Christianity.

[[File:The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle Book-Cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of Albert Schweitzer's ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'']]

===''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (1931)''===
In ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'', Schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of [[mysticism]]: primitive and developed.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 1}} Primitive mysticism "has not yet risen to a conception of the universal, and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super-earthly, temporal and eternal." Additionally, he argues that this view of a "union with the divinity, brought about by efficacious ceremonies, is found even in quite primitive religions."{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 1}}

On the other hand, a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the Greek mystery-cults that were popular in first-century A.D. society. These included the cults of [[Attis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Mithras]]. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the "conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself." Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found "among the [[Brahman]]s and in the [[Buddha]], in [[Platonism]], in [[Stoicism]], in [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Hegel]]."{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 2}}

Next, Schweitzer poses the question: "Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul?" He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of [[Adoption (theology)|sonship]] to God as "mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ."{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 3}} He summarizes Pauline mysticism as "being in Christ" rather than "being in God."

Paul’s imminent [[eschatology]] (from his background in [[Jewish eschatology]]) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible, which is in the near future.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}} Therefore, Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of "being-in-God." Rather, Paul uses the phrase "being-in-Christ" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of "being-in-Christ" is not a "static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again." The "realistic" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}}

One of Schweitzer's major arguments in ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase "being in Christ", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading [[justification by faith]] as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by [[Martin Luther]], Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by "being in Christ." [[Jaroslav Pelikan]], in his Forward to ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle,'' points out that:

{{Quote|the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around: 'The doctrine of the redemption, which is mentally appropriated through faith, is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine, which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = xvi}}}}

====Paul's "Realism" versus Hellenistic "Symbolism"====
Schweitzer contrasts Paul’s "realistic" dying and rising with Christ to the "symbolism" of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenism]]. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the "realistic" dying and rising with Christ rather than the "symbolic" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through [[deification]].{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 16}} After baptism, the Christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]]). On the other hand, the Hellenist "lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 17}}

Another major difference between Paul's "realism" and Hellenistic "symbolism" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that "Paul’s thought follows [[Predestination|predestinarian]] lines."{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 103}} He explains, "only the man who is [[Election (Christianity)|elected]] thereto can enter into relation with God."{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 9}} Although every human being is invited to become a Christian, only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through [[baptism]] can share in the "realistic" dying and rising with Christ.

==Medicine==
At the age of 30, in 1905, Schweitzer answered the call of The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris, which was looking for a [[medical doctor]]. However, the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be "incorrect".&lt;!-- Wouldn't the fact that Schweitzer wasn't a physician be an equally likely reason? --&gt;{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=40}} He could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.

Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus''. He defended [[Mental health of Jesus|Jesus′ mental health]] in it. In June 1912, he married [[Helene Bresslau Schweitzer|Helene Bresslau]], municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian [[Harry Bresslau]].&lt;ref name = "Marxsen"&gt;Marxsen, Patti M. ''Helene Schweitzer: A Life of Her Own.'' First Edition. Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at [[Lambaréné]] on the [[Ogooué]] river, in what is now Gabon, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising, he was ready to equip a small hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1913, he and his wife set off to establish a hospital ([[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]]) near an existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) upstream from the mouth of the Ogooué at [[Port Gentil]] ([[Cape Lopez]]) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.
[[File:Bassin versant de l'Ogooué-fr.svg|thumb|right|200px|The catchment area of the Ogooé occupies most of Gabon. [[Lambaréné]] is marked.]]
In the first nine months, he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries, he was often treating severe [[sandflea]] and crawcraw sores, ''[[framboesia]]'' (yaws), tropical [[Ulcer (dermatology)|eating sores]], heart disease, tropical [[dysentery]], tropical [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[leprosy]], fevers, strangulated [[hernias]], [[necrosis]], abdominal tumours and chronic [[constipation]] and [[nicotine poisoning]], while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, [[fetishism]] and fear of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Ethnic groups in Gabon|Mbahouin]].

Schweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking [[Galoa]] ([[Mpongwe]]) who first came as a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monfried|first1=Walter|title=Admirers Call Dr. Schweitzer "Greatest Man in the World"|date=February 10, 1947|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|pages=1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapters 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, German citizens in a French colony when the countries were at war, were put under supervision by the French military at Lambaréné, where Schweitzer continued his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm Albert Schweitzer 1875–1965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214021148/http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm |date=14 December 2007 }}. schweitzer.org (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical [[anaemia]], they were taken to [[Bordeaux]] and interned first in [[Garaison]] and then from March 1918 in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]. In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, ''The Decay and Restoration of Civilization'' and ''Civilization and Ethics''. The two remaining volumes, on ''The World-View of Reverence for Life '' and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.

In 1924 he returned without his wife, but with an Oxford undergraduate, [[Noel Gillespie]], as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had [[salvarsan]] for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann,&lt;ref&gt;Nessmann worked with the [[French Resistance]] during the Second World War, was captured and executed by the [[Gestapo]] in [[Limoges]] in 1944. cf Guy Penaud, ''Dictionnaire Biographique de Périgord'', p. 713. {{ISBN|978-2-86577-214-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included [[Suramin|Germanin]] and [[tryparsamide]]. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera [[vibrion]] (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.

He was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937, he returned again to Lambaréné and continued working there throughout [[World War II]].

==Schweitzer's views==
===Colonialism===
Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus' call to become "fishers of men" but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European [[colonialism|colonizers]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schweitzer | first = Albert | author-link = Albert Schweitzer | title = On the Edge of the Primeval Forest | place = New York | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1931b | page = 115 | OCLC = 2097590}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they [the coloured peoples] have suffered at the hands of Europeans?... If a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races, it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible.}}

Schweitzer was one of colonialism's harshest critics. In a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905, before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in Africa, he said:{{sfn|Schweitzer|2005|p=76–80}}

{{quote|Our culture divides people into two classes: civilized men, a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying; and others, who have only the human form, who may perish or go to the dogs for all the 'civilized men' care.''

Oh, this 'noble' culture of ours! It speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot, only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves. This culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is, how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there, and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights...

I will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice. People robbed native inhabitants of their land, made slaves of them, let loose the scum of mankind upon them. Think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us, how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic 'gifts', and everything else we have done... We decimate them, and then, by the stroke of a pen, we take their land so they have nothing left at all...

If all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God, or the American God, or the British God, and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be 'Christian'—then the name of Jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery. And the Christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people. The name of Jesus has become a curse, and our Christianity—yours and mine—has become a falsehood and a disgrace, if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated. For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.

And now, when you speak about missions, let this be your message: We must make atonement for all the terrible crimes we read of in the newspapers. We must make atonement for the still worse ones, which we do not read about in the papers, crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night...}}

===Paternalism===
Schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being [[Paternalism|paternalistic]], [[Colonialism|colonialist]], and [[Racism|racist]] in his attitude towards Africans, and in some ways his views did differ from that of many [[Liberalism|liberals]] and other critics of colonialism.{{sfn|Brabazon|2000|p=253-256}} For instance, he thought that Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. [[Edgar Berman]] quotes Schweitzer as having said in 1960, "No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Berman | first = Edgar | title = In Africa With Schweitzer | place = Far Hills, [[New Jersey|NJ]] | publisher = New Horizon Press | year = 1986 | page = 139 | ISBN = 0-88282-025-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks, while also sometimes characterizing them as children.&lt;ref name="forest" /&gt; He summarized his views on European-African relations by saying "With regard to the [[negro]]es, then, I have coined the formula: 'I am your brother, it is true, but your elder brother.'"&lt;ref name="forest"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schweitzer |first=Albert |title=On the Edge of the Primeval Forest |orig-year=1922 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/ontheedgeofthepr007259mbp#page/n163/mode/2up |chapter=Social Problems in the Forest |p=130 |year=1924 |translator=Ch. Th. Campion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinua Achebe]] has criticized him for this characterization, though Achebe acknowledges that Schweitzer's use of the word "brother" at all was, for a European of the early 20th century, an unusual expression of human solidarity between Europeans and Africans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chinua Achebe.

American journalist [[John Gunther]] visited Lambaréné in the 1950s and reported Schweitzer's patronizing attitude towards Africans. He also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Inside Africa | publisher=Harper | location = New York | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, his contemporary [[Albert Ruskin Cook|Sir Albert Cook]] in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Amagezi Agokuzalisa | publisher=Sheldon Press | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three decades in Africa, Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Hospital conditions==
The journalist [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]] visited Lambaréné in 1953 (when Schweitzer was 78) and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James | last = Cameron | title = Point of Departure | year = 1966 |origyear=1978 | publisher=Law Book Co of Australasia | pages = 154–74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WM89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time: according to a BBC dramatisation, he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story, and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé.&lt;ref&gt;On Monday 7 April 2008 ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009przg "The Walrus and the Terrier"]&amp;nbsp;– programme outline) [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast an ''[[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|Afternoon Play]]'' "The Walrus and the Terrier" by Christopher Ralling concerning Cameron's visit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor conditions of the hospital in Lambaréné were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist [[Chinua Achebe]] in his essay on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'': "In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Reverence for life==
{{Main|Reverence for Life}}
[[File:Albert Schweitzer 1955.jpg|thumb|Schweitzer in 1955]]
The keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of ''[[Reverence for Life]]'' ("''Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben''"). He thought that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its [[Ethics|ethical]] foundation.

In the Preface to ''Civilization and Ethics'' (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from [[René Descartes|Descartes]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming optimism of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], expressed in the [[Pessimism|pessimist]] philosophies from [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] onward. Scientific [[materialism]] (advanced by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.

Schweitzer wrote, "True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization and Ethics'', Chapter 21, p. 253: reprinted as A. Schweitzer, ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', ([[Prometheus Books]], Buffalo 1987), Chapter 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.

Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian [[Brahmin]]ic philosophy.

For Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization and Ethics'', Preface and Chapter II, 'The Problem of the Optimistic World-View'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development of reverence for life, was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular the [[Jainism|Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]], or non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ara Paul Barsam (2002) "Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life" in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2977-1}} pp.&amp;nbsp;207–08&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Schweitzer noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought&amp;nbsp;– and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far&amp;nbsp;– reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.}}

==Later life==
[[File:Albert-Schweitzer-Haus.jpg|thumb|right|The Schweitzer house and Museum at Königsfeld in the Black Forest]]
After the birth of their daughter ([[Rhena Schweitzer Miller]]), Albert's wife, Helene Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné due to her health. In 1923 the family moved to [[Königsfeld im Schwarzwald]], Baden-Württemberg, where he was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertschweitzer-haus.de Schweitzer museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Schweitzer-Archiv und Museum Gunsbach.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Albert Schweitzer's house at Gunsbach, now a museum and archive]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0423-317, Weimar, Albert-Schweitzer-Gedenkstätte.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Albert Schweitzer Memorial and Museum in [[Weimar]] (1984)]]
From 1939–48 he stayed in Lambaréné, unable to go back to Europe because of the war. Three years after the end of World War II, in 1948, he returned for the first time to Europe and kept traveling back and forth (and once to the US) as long as he was able. During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach, Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house, which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work. His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie ''Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer'', starring [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Albert Schweitzer and [[Jeanne Moreau]] as his nurse Marie. Schweitzer inspired actor [[Hugh O'Brian]] when O'Brian visited in Africa. O'Brian returned to the United States and founded the [[Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation]] (HOBY).
[[File:Albert Schweitzer.jpg|thumb|Albert Schweitzer Monument in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], Australia]]
Schweitzer was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] of 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1952 | website=The Nobel Foundation | date=21 May 2014 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/ | access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting the prize with the speech, "The Problem of Peace".{{sfn|Schweitzer|1954}} From 1952 until his death he worked against [[nuclear tests]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s with [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in ''Peace or Atomic War''. In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of [[Peace Action|The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]]. On 23 April 1957, Schweitzer made his "Declaration of Conscience" speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons. His speech ended, "The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennesseeplayers.org/declaration.html Declaration of Conscience speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064238/http://tennesseeplayers.org/declaration.html |date=16 October 2007 }}&amp;nbsp;– at Tennessee Players&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks prior to his death, an American film crew was allowed to visit Schweitzer and Drs. Muntz and Friedman, both [[Holocaust]] survivors, to record his work and daily life at the hospital. The film ''The Legacy of Albert Schweitzer'', narrated by Henry Fonda, was produced by Warner Brothers and aired once. It resides in their vault today in deteriorating condition. Although several attempts have been made to restore and re-air the film, all access has been denied.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1955 he was made an honorary member of the [[Order of Merit]] (OM) by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1747.asp |title=List of Members of the Order of Merit, past and present |publisher=British Monarchy |accessdate=2 December 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a [[Knight|chevalier]] of the [[Order of St Lazarus|Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem]].

Schweitzer died on 4 September 1965 at his beloved hospital in Lambaréné, now in independent Gabon. His grave, on the banks of the [[Ogooué River]], is marked by a cross he made himself.

His cousin Anne-Marie Schweitzer Sartre was the mother of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Her father, Charles Schweitzer, was the older brother of Albert Schweitzer's father, Louis Théophile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en&amp;m=NG&amp;n=Louis+Th%C3%A9ophile+Schweitzer&amp;t=PN |title=Louis Théophile Schweitzer |publisher=Roglo.eu |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schweitzer was a vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/schweitzer.html |title=History of Vegetarianism&amp;nbsp;– Dr Albert Schweitzer (1875–1965) |publisher=Ivu.org |date=4 September 1965 |accessdate=1 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521101835/http://ivu.org/history/europe20a/schweitzer.html| archivedate= 21 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/cva/th-schweitzer-albert.htm |title=Dr. Albert Schweitzer&amp;nbsp;– Take Heart&amp;nbsp;– Christian Vegetarian Association |publisher=All-creatures.org |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}}However, in an account written by Dr. Edgar Berman, it is suggested that Schweitzer consumed fried liver at a Sunday dinner in Lambaréné.&lt;ref&gt;In Africa With Schweitzer, (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1986), page 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albert Schweitzer Fellowship]] was founded in 1940 by Schweitzer to unite US supporters in filling the gap in support for his Hospital when his European supply lines were cut off by war, and continues to support the Lambaréné Hospital today. Schweitzer, however, considered his ethic of Reverence for Life, not his Hospital, his most important legacy, saying that his Lambaréné Hospital was just "my own improvisation on the theme of Reverence for Life. Everyone can have their own Lambaréné." Today ASF helps large numbers of young Americans in health-related professional fields find or create "their own Lambaréné" in the US or internationally. ASF selects and supports nearly 250 new US and Africa Schweitzer Fellows each year from over 100 of the leading US schools of medicine, nursing, public health, and every other field with some relation to health (including music, law, and divinity). The peer-supporting lifelong network of "Schweitzer Fellows for Life" numbered over 2,000 members in 2008, and is growing by nearly 1,000 every four years. Nearly 150 of these Schweitzer Fellows have served at the Hospital in Lambaréné, for three-month periods during their last year of medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Schweitzerfellowship.org |title=The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship |publisher=Schweitzerfellowship.org |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716093859/http://www.schweitzerfellowship.org/| archivedate= 16 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Albert Schweitzer Prize==
The prize was first awarded on 29 May 2011 to [[Eugen Drewermann]] and the physician couple Rolf and Raphaela Maibach in [[Königsfeld im Schwarzwald]], where Schweitzer's former residence now houses the Albert Schweitzer Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- vh2010-02-28 Foto:--&gt;&lt;!-- rs2009-10-27 5810938 --&gt; |url=http://www.suedkurier.de/region/schwarzwald-baar-heuberg/koenigsfeld/Koenigsfeld-feiert-bdquo-Schweitzer-Erben-ldquo-;art372523,4916774 |title=Königsfeld feiert ?Schweitzer-Erben? &amp;#124; Südkurier Online |publisher=Suedkurier.de |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound recordings==
Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD. During 1934 and 1935 he resided in Britain, delivering the Gifford Lectures at [[Edinburgh University]], and those on ''Religion in Modern Civilization'' at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of London|London]]. He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old [[Queen's Hall]] in London. These records did not satisfy him, the instrument being too harsh. In mid-December 1935 he began to record for [[Columbia Records]] on the organ of [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower|All Hallows, Barking-by-the-Tower]], London.&lt;ref&gt;This fine 1909 [[Harrison and Harrison]] organ was blitzed in the War (cf W. Kent, The Lost Treasures of London (Phoenix House 1947), 94–95) but was rebuilt in 1957, see {{cite web |url=http://www.harrison-organs.co.uk/london.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705030431/http://www.harrison-organs.co.uk/london.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the [[Saint Aurelia’s Church, Strasbourg|church of Ste Aurélie]] in Strasbourg, on a mid-18th-century organ by Johann Andreas [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] (brother of Gottfried), an organ-builder greatly revered by Bach, which had been restored by the [[Lorraine]] organ-builder Frédéric Härpfer shortly before the First World War. These recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October 1936.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=139–152}}

===The Schweitzer Technique===
Schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bach's music. Known as "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a [[Microphone#Bi-directional|figure-8 microphone]] pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single [[Microphone#Cardioid|cardioid microphone]] is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm [[Microphone#Condenser microphone|condenser microphones]] pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''appserver.io''' is an [[application server]] for [[PHP]] based web environments. The project consists of [[middleware]] which delivers classical PHP web applications and provides additional services.

==History==
The basic idea of a [[WildFly]] equivalent for PHP was present within TechDivision well before July 2013 when development on the project began, due to technical shortcomings of the PHP language .

At that time the possibility of a non-blocking, [[Network socket|socket]]-based PHP middleware was given by using an asynchronous event driven workflow or forked [[Process (computing)|processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reactphp.org/|title=React|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php|title=PHP: pcntl_fork - Manual|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, as of August 2012, a [[Thread (computing)|threading]] extension for PHP by Joe Watkins enabled true [[POSIX]] compatible multithreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pthreads.org/|title=pthreads - Share Nothing, Do Everything :)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berb.github.io/diploma-thesis/original/043_threadsevents.html|title=4.3 The Case of Threads vs. Events|website=berb.github.io|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; threads were used because they allow the programmer to account for hardware usage instead of relying on the used runtime environment and enable easier communication between parallel working batches.

After deciding on the technical blueprint, development began on the [[GitHub]] platform. {{as of|2015}}, the project consisted of 36 separate [[Repository (version control)|repositories]], around 80,000 lines of code and estimated effort of 18 years ([[COCOMO]] model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.openhub.net/p/appserver-io|title=The appserver.io Open Source Project on Open Hub|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==
Appserver.io is [[open-source software]] under the [[Open Software License|OSL]] in version 3.0. It can be downloaded either as an installable package from the project page, or as a source from GitHub. The project aims at a [[freemium]] marketing approach splitting the software into a Community, Professional and an Enterprise Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserver.io/products/enterprise-edition.html|title=appserver.io enterprise edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015}}, the Community Edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserver.io/products/community-edition.html|title=appserver.io community edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained all base features and is open source and free of charge.

{{as of|2015}}, the Professional Edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserver.io/products/professional-edition.html|title=appserver.io professional edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could only be used within the [[Microsoft Azure]] cloud service and offers additional developer support.

==Product features==
Appserver.io includes a runtime environment, containing PHP extended with external libraries, PHP extensions and service daemons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/appserver-io-php/runtime/blob/master/build.default.properties|title=appserver-io-php/runtime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an out-of-the-box runtime environment for PHP development. The use of a multithreading environment is considered to break the so-called [[Shared nothing architecture|shared nothing]] concept of PHP as it allows for inter-process communication on object level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1jo517/multithreading_in_php_with_pthreads/|title=Multithreading in PHP with pthreads • /r/PHP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the bundled runtime, appserver.io bundles administration. As of version 0.6.0 application management is implemented with file-based application deployment.

Appserver.io offers [[servlet]]s, objects that persist between client requests. These can eliminate repeated bootstrapping of applications, but require the wrapping of bootstrap parts. Appserver.io offers an Enterprise Bean implementation similar to [[Enterprise JavaBeans|Enterprise Java Beans]] functionality.

Appserver.io offers modular services that can be used individually by internal and external applications.

Features:
* [https://github.com/appserver-io/webserver Webserver]
* [https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver Persistence Container]
* [https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver Message Queue]
* [https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver Servlet Engine]
* [[Aspect-oriented programming|AOP]] support
* [[Design by Contract]] support
* Annotation based [[Dependency injection|Dependency Injection]]
* Timer service
* Deployment API
* Integrated [[FastCGI]] client and backend
* Enterprise Beans similar to [[Enterprise JavaBeans|Enterprise Java Beans]]

Appserver.io allows component-based scalability. Services and servers (e.g. an [[Http|HTTP]] webserver) are adjustable in size and number based on an [[XML]] configuration file. Additional components can be configured for remote access, allowing for [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]] and component replication.

==Versions==
{{as of|2014}}, appserver.io was in an early stage of development. The project provided tested, pre-release versions over GitHub. Development releases are regularly published over the homepage.

Appserver.io follows a [[naming convention]] based on major and minor version numbers. The major digit specifies a context for minor version names exist. The 1.*.* major version is named '''Iron''' which stands for a mythological view on the [[Middle Ages|medieval age]]. Every minor version 1.x.* within this major release consist of a noun describing something common to this major context.

===Project milestones===
* 0.5.8 [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] support with a guided installation procedure
* 0.6.0 web server and modules structure ensured compatibility with non-servlet applications
* 0.10.0 separate application context allowing complete independence
* 0.10.0 enterprise beans
* 1.0.0 stable API defined by so-called [[PHP Standard Recommendation|PSR]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserver.io/get-started/psrs.html|title=appserver.io PSRs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to [[Java Specification Request|JSR]]s)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''An asset purchase agreement''' ('''APA''') is an agreement between a [[buyer]] and a [[seller]] that finalizes terms and conditions related to the [[purchase]] and [[Sales|sale]] of a company's assets.&lt;ref name=uslegal&gt;http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/asset-purchase-agreement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=divestopedia&gt;http://www.divestopedia.com/definition/893/asset-purchase-agreement-apa&lt;/ref&gt; It's important to note in an APA transaction, it is not necessary for the buyer to purchase all of the assets of the company.  In fact, it's common for a buyer to exclude certain assets in an APA.  Provisions of an APA may include payment of purchase price, monthly installments, liens and encumbrances on the assets, condition precedent for the closing, etc.&lt;ref name=inc&gt;http://www.inc.com/tools/asset-purchase-agreement.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; An APA differs from a stock purchase agreement (SPA) where company shares, title to assets, and title to liabilities are also sold.&lt;ref name=divestopedia /&gt; In an APA, the buyer must select specific assets and avoid redundant assets. These assets are itemized in a schedule to the APA. The buyer in a SPA is purchasing shares of the company. In this case, itemization is not necessary due to transfer of company's ownership occurs as is. The APA is the legal mechanism for executing a corporate [[mergers and acquisitions|merger or acquisition]].&lt;ref name=uslegal /&gt;

The oil and gas industry does not distinguish between an asset and stock purchase in naming its related purchase agreement.  In this industry, whether purchasing assets or stock, the definitive agreement is referred to as the [[Purchase and Sale Agreement]] (PSA).

==Purpose==
Defining and controlling behavior is a major objective of the APA.&lt;ref name=uslegal /&gt; The buyer must represent its authority to purchase the asset. The seller must represent its authority to sell the asset. Additionally, the seller represent that the purchase price of the asset is equal to its value, and that the seller is not in financial or legal trouble.

In the context of a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger or acquisition]] transaction, asset purchase agreements have a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages compared to using an equity (or stock) purchase agreement or a merger agreement.  In an equity or merger acquisition, the purchaser is guaranteed to receive all of the target's assets without exception, but also automatically assumes all of the target's liabilities.  An asset purchase agreement, alternatively, allows not only for a transaction where only some of the assets are transferred (which is sometimes desired) but also allows the parties to negotiate which liabilities of the target are expressly assumed by the purchaser, and allows the purchaser to leave behind those liabilities it does not wish to accept (or does not know about).  A disadvantage of an asset purchase agreement is that it can often result in a greater number of [[change of control]] issues.  For example, contracts held by a target, and acquired by a purchaser, will often require the consent of the counterparty in the context of an asset deal, whereas it is less common that such consent will be needed in connection with an equity sale or merger agreement.

Other than having the flexibility to sell only certain assets, rather than the entire company, asset purchase agreements typically also include detailed provisions regarding the transfer of liabilities from the

Black Panther Party members were involved in many fatal firefights with police including [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]] allegedly killing officer John Frey in 1967 and the 1968 [[Eldridge Cleaver]] led ambush of Oakland police officers which wounded two officers and killed Panther Bobby Hutton. The party was also involved in many internal conflicts including the murders of [[Alex Rackley]] and [[Murder of Betty Van Patter|Betty Van Patter]].

Government oppression initially contributed to the party's growth, as killings and arrests of Panthers increased its support among [[African Americans]] and on the broad political left, both of whom valued the Panthers as a powerful force opposed to [[Racial segregation in the United States|de facto segregation]] and the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]]. Black Panther Party membership reached a peak in 1970, with offices in 68 cities and thousands of members, then suffered a series of contractions. After being vilified by the mainstream press, public support for the party waned, and the group became more isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-fighting among Party leadership, caused largely by the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] operation, led to expulsions and defections that decimated the membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|loc=conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular support for the Party declined further after reports appeared detailing the group's involvement in illegal activities such as drug dealing and [[extortion]] schemes directed against Oakland merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Foner]], ''The Black Panthers Speak'', Da Capo Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972 most Panther activity centered on the national headquarters and a school in Oakland, where the party continued to influence local politics. Though under constant police surveillance, the Chicago chapter remained active and maintained their community programs until 1974.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; The Seattle chapter lasted longer than most, with a breakfast program and medical clinics that continued even after the chapter disbanded in 1977.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; Party contractions continued throughout the 1970s, and by 1980, the Black Panther Party had just 27 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2006|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the Black Panther Party is controversial. Scholars have characterized the Black Panther Party as the most influential black movement organization of the late 1960s, and "the strongest link between the domestic Black Liberation Struggle and global opponents of American imperialism".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have described the Party as more criminal than political, characterized by "defiant posturing over substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Panther Party members are shown as they marched in uniform. Students at rally marched, sang, clapped hands, and carried protest signs. Police in riot gear controlled marchers.]]
The sweeping migration of black families out of the South during [[World War II]] transformed Oakland and cities throughout the West and the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new generation of young blacks growing up in these cities faced new conditions, new forms of poverty and racism unfamiliar to their parents, and they sought to develop new forms of politics to address them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Panther Party membership "consisted of recent migrants whose families traveled north and west to escape the southern racial regime, only to be confronted with new forms of segregation and repression".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murch|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, the insurgent [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] had dismantled the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of racial caste subordination using the tactics of [[Pacifism|non-violent civil disobedience]], and demanding full citizenship rights for black people.&lt;ref name="Bloom and Martin, 2013, p. 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But not much changed in the cities of the North and West. As the wartime jobs which drew much of the black migration "fled to the suburbs along with white residents", the black population was concentrated in poor "urban ghettos" with high unemployment, and substandard housing, mostly excluded from political representation, top universities, and the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police departments were almost all white.&lt;ref name="Bloom and Martin 2013 p.12"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, only 16 of Oakland's 661 police officers were African American,&lt;ref&gt;McElrath, Jessica.

Retrieved June 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; representing less than 2.5% of the force.

Insurgent civil rights practices proved incapable of redressing these conditions, and the organizations that had "led much of the nonviolent civil disobedience" such as [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] went into decline.&lt;ref name="Bloom and Martin, 2013, p. 11"/&gt; By 1966 a "Black Power ferment" emerged, consisting largely of young urban blacks, posing a question the Civil Rights Movement could not answer: "how would black people in America win not only formal citizenship rights, but actual economic and political power?"&lt;ref name="Bloom and Martin 2013 p.12"/&gt; Young black people in Oakland and other cities developed a rich ferment of study groups and political organizations, and it is out of this ferment that the Black Panther Party emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murch|2010|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1966, [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] founded the Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense). In formulating a new politics, they drew on their experiences working with a variety of Black Power organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seale|1970|loc=part I}}; {{harvnb|Newton|1973|loc=parts 2-3}}; {{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|loc=chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Murch|2010|loc=part II and chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton and Seale first met in 1962 when they were both students at [[Merritt College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seale|1970|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They joined Donald Warden's Afro-American Association, where they read widely, debated, and organized in an emergent black nationalist tradition inspired by [[Malcolm X]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murch|2010|loc=chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually dissatisfied with Warden's accommodation-ism, they developed a revolutionary anti-imperialist perspective working with more active and militant groups like the Soul Students Advisory Council and the [[Revolutionary Action Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105851/http://kasamaproject.org/race-liberation/2005-37black-like-mao-red-china-black-revolution-part-2 Robin D. G.

Dissatisfied with the failure of these organizations to directly challenge police brutality and appeal to the "brothers on the block", Huey and Bobby sought to take matters into their own hands. After the police killed Matthew Johnson, an unarmed young black man in San Francisco, Newton observed the violent rebellion that followed. He had an epiphany that would distinguish the Black Panther Party from the multitude of organizations seeking to build Black Power. Newton saw the explosive rebellious anger of the ghetto as a force, and believed that if he could stand up to the police, he could organize that force into political power. Inspired by [[Robert F. Williams]]' armed resistance to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) and Williams' book ''[[Negroes with Guns]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/negroes-guns "Negroes With Guns-Description"], Wayne State University Press website.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton studied [[gun laws in California]] until he knew it better than many police officers. Like the Community Alert Patrol in Los Angeles after the [[Watts riots|Watts Rebellion]], he decided to organize patrols to follow the police around to monitor for incidents of brutality. But with a crucial difference: his patrols would carry loaded guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=30–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huey and Bobby raised enough money to buy two shotguns by buying bulk quantities of the recently publicized [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]] and reselling them to leftist radicals and liberal intellectuals on the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] campus at three times the price. According to Bobby Seale, they would "sell the books, make the money, buy the guns, and go on the streets with the guns. We'll protect a mother, protect a brother, and protect the community from the racist cops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seale|first1=Bobby|title=Seize the Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton|isbn=0-933121-30-X|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 1966, [[Stokely Carmichael]] – a leader of SNCC – championed the call for "[[Black Power]]" and came to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to keynote a Black Power conference. At the time, he was promoting the armed organizing efforts of the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) in Alabama and their use of the Black Panther symbol. Newton and Seale decided to adopt the Black Panther logo and form their own organization called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton and Seale decided on a uniform of blue shirts, black pants, black leather jackets, black berets.&lt;ref name="Pearson 109"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen-year-old [[Bobby Hutton]] was their first recruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015498/Black-Panther-Party|title=Black Panther Party|accessdate=March 27, 2008|date=|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oakland patrols of police====
The initial tactic of the party utilized contemporary [[Open carry in the United States|open-carry gun laws]] to protect Party members when policing the police. This act was done in order to record incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted by a police officer, Party members cited laws proving they have done nothing wrong and threatened to take to court any officer that violated their constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the end of 1966 to the start of 1967, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense's armed police patrols in Oakland black communities attracted a small handful of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker for a conference held in his honor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Black Panther Newspaper'', May 15, 1967, p. 3; {{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Panther Party's focus on militancy was often construed as open hostility,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2006|pp=x-xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=108–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeding a reputation of violence even though early efforts by the Panthers focused primarily on promoting social issues and the exercise of their legal right to carry arms. The Panthers employed a California law that permitted carrying a loaded rifle or shotgun as long as it was publicly displayed and pointed at no one.&lt;ref name="Pearson 109" /&gt; Generally this was done while monitoring and observing police behavior in their neighborhoods, with the Panthers arguing that this emphasis on active militancy and openly carrying their weapons was necessary to protect individuals from police violence. For example, chants like "The Revolution has come, it's time to pick up the gun. Off the pigs!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Age of Great Dreams: America in the 1960s|page=207 |author=David Farber}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped create the Panthers' reputation as a violent organization.

====Rallies in Richmond, California====
The black community of [[Richmond, California]], wanted protection against police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; With only three main streets for entering and exiting the neighborhood, it was easy for police to control, contain, and suppress the majority African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1967, a black, unarmed twenty-two-year-old construction worker named Denzil Dowell was shot dead by police in North Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowell's family contacted the Black Panther Party for assistance after county officials refused to investigate the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party held rallies in North Richmond that educated the community on armed self-defense and the Denzil Dowell incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police seldom interfered at these rallies because every Panther was armed and no laws were broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party's ideals resonated with several community members, who then brought their own guns to the next rallies.&lt;ref name="Bloom, Joshua 2013. p. 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protest at the Statehouse====
Awareness of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense grew rapidly after their May 2, 1967, protest at the California State Assembly. On May 2, 1967, the [[California State Assembly]] Committee on Criminal Procedure was scheduled to convene to discuss what was known as the "[[Mulford Act]]", which would make the public carrying of loaded firearms illegal. [[Eldridge Cleaver]] and Newton put together a plan to send a group of 26 armed Panthers led by Seale from Oakland to Sacramento to protest the bill. The group entered the assembly carrying their weapons, an incident which was widely publicized, and which prompted police to arrest Seale and five others. The group pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of disrupting a legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black Panther convention2.jpg|thumb|Black Panther convention, [[Lincoln Memorial]], June 19, 1970.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;In May 1967, the Panthers invaded the [[California State Assembly|State Assembly Chamber in Sacramento]], guns in hand, in what appears to have been a [[publicity stunt]]. Still, they scared a lot of important people that day. At the time, the Panthers had almost no following. Now, (a year later) however, their leaders speak on invitation almost anywhere radicals gather, and many whites wear ''"Honkeys for [[Huey P. Newton|Huey]]"'' buttons, supporting the fight to free Newton, who has been in jail since last Oct. 28 (1967) on the charge that he killed a policeman&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Panthers: A Taut, Violent Drama|date=July 21, 1968|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]&lt;!--dead URL:|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ix0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0FwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7188,187226 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ten-point program====
{{Main|Ten-Point Program}}
The Black Panther Party first publicized its original Ten-Point program on May 15, 1967, following the Sacramento action, in the second issue of ''[[The Black Panther (newspaper)|The Black Panther]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The original ten points of "What We Want Now!" follow:
#We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Black Community.
#We want full employment for our people.
#We want an end to the robbery by the Capitalists of our Black Community.
#We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.
#We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.
#We want all Black men to be exempt from military service.
#We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER of Black people.
#We want freedom for all Black men held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails.
#We want all Black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by the Constitution of the United States.
#We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.

====United Front Against Fascism====
In July 1969 the BPP organized the [[United Front Against Fascism]] conference in Oakland, which was attended by around 5,000 people representing a number of groups.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}}&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dukeupress.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/the-black-panther-party-and-black-anti-fascism-in-the-united-states/|title=The Black Panther Party and Black Anti-fascism in the United States|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=July 28, 2018|first=Robyn C.|last=Spencer|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====COINTELPRO====
[[File:COINTELPRO - Jean Seberg.jpg|thumb|[[COINTELPRO]] document outlining the FBI's plans to 'neutralize' [[Jean Seberg]] for her support for the Black Panther Party, by attempting to publicly "cause her embarrassment" and "tarnish her image".]]
&lt;!--This treatment is ok, but a bit eccentric. Needs significant revision.--&gt;
In August 1967, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) instructed its program "[[COINTELPRO]]" to "neutralize" what the FBI called "black nationalist hate groups" and other dissident groups. In September 1968, FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] described the Black Panthers as "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country".&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized "[[Black nationalism|Black Nationalist]]" COINTELPRO actions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html "COINTELPRO" A Huey P. Newton Story], Public Broadcasting System website.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the program were to prevent the unification of militant black nationalist groups and to weaken the power of their leaders, as well as to discredit the groups to reduce their support and growth. The initial targets included the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], the Revolutionary Action Movement and the [[Nation of Islam]]. Leaders who were targeted included the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[H. Rap Brown]], Maxwell Stanford and [[Elijah Muhammad]].

Part of the COINTELPRO actions were directed at creating and exploiting existing rivalries between black nationalist factions. One such attempt was to "intensify the degree of animosity" between the Black Panthers and the [[Almighty Black P. Stone Nation|Blackstone Rangers]], a Chicago street gang. They sent an anonymous letter to the Ranger's gang leader claiming that the Panthers were threatening his life, a letter whose intent was to induce "reprisals" against Panther leadership. In Southern California similar actions were taken to exacerbate a "gang war" between the Black Panther Party and a black nationalist group called the [[US Organization]].

COINTELPRO also aimed to dismantle the Black Panther Party by targeting the social/community programs they endorsed, one of the most influential being the Free Breakfast for Children Program. The success of the Free Breakfast for Children Program served to "shed light on the government's failure to address child poverty and hunger—pointing to the limits of the nation's War on Poverty".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The ability of the Party to organize and provide for children more effectively than the U.S. government led the FBI to criticize the program as a means of exposing children to Panther Propaganda. In response to this, as an effort of disassembling the program, "Police and Federal Agents regularly harassed and intimidated program participants, supporters, and Party workers and sought to scare away donors and organizations that housed the programs like churches and community centers".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilrightsteaching.org/Handouts/BPPhandout.pdf "History of the Black Panther Party, Part Two" Civilrightsteaching.org/Teaching for Change.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031024002/http://www.civilrightsteaching.org/Handouts/BPPhandout.pdf |date=October 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huey Newton charged with murdering John Frey====
&lt;!--More background is needed here on the state of the Party in late October, and the ideological and political developments following the passage of the Mulford Act in May after the Party's patrols were outlawed, and the way these changes set the stage for the Free Huey campaign.--&gt;
On October 28, 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/5125-police-officer-john-f-frey|title=Police Officer John F. Frey|author=|date=|work=The Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oakland Police Department|Oakland police]] officer John Frey was shot to death in an altercation with Huey P. Newton during a traffic stop. In the stop, Newton and backup officer Herbert Heanes also suffered gunshot wounds.  Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter at trial, but the conviction was later overturned. In his book ''Shadow of the Panther,'' writer Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton, while intoxicated in the hours before he was shot and killed, claimed to have willfully killed John Frey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=7, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free Huey! campaign====
&lt;!--This Section Needs Serious Revision--&gt;
At the time, Newton claimed that he had been falsely accused, leading to the "Free Huey" campaign. This incident gained the party even wider recognition by the radical American left.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was released after three years, when his conviction was reversed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;December 15, 1971. "Case Against Newton Dropped". ''The Dispatch'' (Lexington, North Carolina) via UPI. Retrieved August 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Newton awaited trial, the Black Panther party's "Free Huey" campaign developed alliances with numerous individuals, students and anti-war activists, "advancing an anti-imperialist political ideology that linked the oppression of antiwar protestors to the oppression of blacks and Vietnamese".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Free Huey" campaign attracted black power organizations, New Left groups, and other activist groups such as the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]], [[Bob Avakian]] of the Community for New Politics, and the Red Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Black Panther Party collaborated with the [[Peace and Freedom Party]], which sought to promote a strong antiwar and antiracist politics in opposition to the establishment democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Panther Party provided needed legitimacy to the Peace and Freedom Party's racial politics and in return received invaluable support for the "Free Huey" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Founding of the L.A. Chapter====
&lt;!--This section needs serious development--&gt;
In 1968 the southern California chapter was founded by [[Bunchy Carter|Alprentice "Bunchy" Carter]] in Los Angeles. Carter was the leader of the Slauson street gang, and many of the LA chapter's early recruits were Slausons.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Horne, ''Fire this Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s'', University of Virginia Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing of Bobby Hutton====
&lt;!--This section is in need of serious development and revision--&gt;
On April 7, 1968, seventeen-year-old Panther national treasurer [[Bobby Hutton]] was killed, and [[Eldridge Cleaver]], Black Panther Party Minister of Information, was wounded in a shootout with the Oakland police. Two police officers were also shot. Although at the time the BPP claimed that the police had ambushed them, several party members later admitted that Cleaver had led the Panther group on a deliberate ambush of the police officers, provoking the shoot-out.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Coleman, 1980, [http://colemantruth.net/kate1.pdf "Souled Out: Eldridge Cleaver Admits He Ambushed Those Cops"].

===Late 1968===
====Chronology====
*April to mid-June 1968: Cleaver is in jail.
*Mid-July 1968: Huey Newton's murder trial commences. Panthers hold "Free Huey" rallies outside the courthouse daily.
*August 5, 1968: Three Panthers were killed in a gun battle with police at a Los Angeles gas station.&lt;ref name="Epstein, 1971"&gt;{{cite news | first = Edward Jay |last = Epstein | title = The Black Panthers and the Police: A Pattern of Genocide? | newspaper = New Yorker | date = February 13, 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early September 1968: Newton is convicted of manslaughter.
*Late September 1968: days before he is due to return to prison to serve out a rape conviction, Cleaver flees to Cuba and later Algeria.
*October 5, 1968: a Panther is killed in a gunfight with police in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Epstein, 1971"/&gt;
*November 1968: the BPP finds numerous supporters, establishing relationships with the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]]. Monetary contributions are flowing in, and BPP leadership begins embezzling donated funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=185, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 20, 1968: [[William Lee Brent]] and two accomplices in a van marked "Black Panther Black Community News Service" allegedly rob a gas station in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Bayview, San Francisco, California|Bayview district]] of $80, resulting in a [[shootout]] with police.&lt;ref&gt;Fimrite, Peter, [http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/William-Lee-Brent-former-Black-Panther-2466571.php William Lee Brent -- former Black Panther hijacked jet to Cuba], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], November 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the group shortened its name to the Black Panther Party and sought to focus directly on political action. Members were encouraged to carry guns and to defend themselves against violence. An influx of college students joined the group, which had consisted chiefly of "brothers off the block". This created some tension in the group. Some members were more interested in supporting the Panthers' social programs, while others wanted to maintain their "street mentality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the party had expanded into many cities throughout the United States, among them, [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] Peak membership was near 5,000 by 1969, and [[The Black Panther (newspaper)|their newspaper]], under the editorial leadership of [[Eldridge Cleaver]], had a circulation of 250,000.&lt;ref name="Black studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Black Studies|last=Asante|first=Molefi K.|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|isbn=0-7619-2762-X|pages=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group created a [[Ten-Point Program]], a document that called for "Land, Bread, Housing, Education, Clothing, Justice and Peace", as well as exemption from [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] for black men, among other demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Huey|title=The Ten-Point Program|work=War Against the Panthers|publisher=Marxist.org|date=October 15, 1966|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/1966/10/15.htm|accessdate=June 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Ten-Point program, "What We Want, What We Believe", the Black Panther Party expressed its economic and political grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lazerow|Williams|2006|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis Austin states that by late 1968, Black Panther Party ideology had evolved to the point where they began to reject black nationalism and became more a "revolutionary internationalist movement":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Party] dropped its wholesale attacks against whites and began to emphasize more of a class analysis of society. Its emphasis on Marxist–Leninist doctrine and its repeated espousal of Maoist statements signaled the group's transition from a revolutionary nationalist to a revolutionary internationalist movement. Every Party member had to study Mao Tse-tung's "Little Red Book" to advance his or her knowledge of peoples' struggle and the revolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Panther slogans and iconography spread. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], two American medalists, gave the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black power salute]] during the playing of the American national anthem. The [[International Olympic Committee]] banned them from the Olympic Games for life. Film star [[Jane Fonda]] publicly supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers during the early 1970s. She actually ended up informally adopting the daughter of two Black Panther members, [[Mary Williams (activist)|Mary Luana Williams]]. Fonda and other Hollywood celebrities became involved in the Panthers' leftist programs. The Panthers attracted a wide variety of left-wing revolutionaries and political activists, including writer [[Jean Genet]], former ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine editor [[David Horowitz]] (who later became a major critic of what he describes as Panther criminality)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=22186|title=Black Murder Inc|last=Horowitz|first=David|date=13 December 1999|work=[[FrontPage Magazine]]|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701134234/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=22186|archive-date=July 1, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left-wing lawyer [[Charles Garry|Charles R. Garry]], who acted as counsel in the Panthers' many legal battles.

The BPP adopted a "Serve the People" program, which at first involved a free breakfast program for children. By the end of 1968, the BPP had established 38 chapters and branches, claiming more than five thousand members. Eldridge and [[Kathleen Cleaver]] left the country days before Cleaver was to turn himself in to serve the remainder of a thirteen-year sentence for a 1958 rape conviction. They settled in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/27-important-facts-everyone-should-know-about-the-black-panthers_us_56c4d853e4b08ffac1276462|title=27 Important Facts Everyone Should Know About The Black Panthers|last=Editor|first=Lilly Workneh Black Voices Senior|last2=Editor|first2=The Huffington Post Taryn Finley Black Voices Associate|date=2016-02-18|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-07|last3=Post|first3=The Huffington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, party membership peaked at around 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=173, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party members engaged in criminal activities such as extortion, stealing, violent discipline of BPP members, and robberies. The BPP leadership took one third of the proceeds from robberies committed by BPP members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=186–187, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Survival programs====
Inspired by [[Mao Zedong]]'s advice to revolutionaries in ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|The Little Red Book]]'', Newton called on the Panthers to "serve the people" and to make "survival programs" a priority within its branches. The most famous of their programs was the [[Free Breakfast for Children|Free Breakfast for Children Program]], initially run out of an [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] church.

The Free Breakfast For Children program was especially significant because it served as a space for educating youth about the current condition of the Black community, and the actions that the Party was taking to address that condition. "While the children ate their meal[s], members [of the Party] taught them liberation lessons consisting of Party messages and Black history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this program, the Party was able to influence young minds, and strengthen their ties to communities as well as gain widespread support for their ideologies. The breakfast program became so popular that the Panthers Party claimed to have fed twenty thousand children in the 1968-69 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other survival programs&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml Black Panther Party Community Programs 1966 - 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; were free services such as clothing distribution, classes on politics and economics, free medical clinics, lessons on self-defense and first aid, transportation to upstate prisons for family members of inmates, an emergency-response ambulance program, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and testing for [[Sickle cell disease|sickle-cell disease]].&lt;ref name=westneat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002270461_danny11.html|title=Reunion of Black Panthers stirs memories of aggression, activism|last=Westneat|first=Danny|date=11 May 2005|work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106035921/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002270461_danny11.html|archivedate=November 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political activities====
In 1968, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver ran for Presidential office on the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/02/news/mn-45607|title=Former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver Dies at 62|author=|date=|work=latimes|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were a big influence on the [[White Panther Party]], that was tied to the Detroit/Ann Arbor band [[MC5]] and their manager [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], author of the book ''Guitar Army'' that also promulgated a ten-point program.{{who|date=July 2015}}

*Late 1969: David Hilliard, current BPP head, advocates violent revolution. Panther membership is down significantly from the late 1968 peak.

====Shoot-out with the US Organization====
Violent conflict between the Panther chapter in LA and the [[US Organization]], a black nationalist group, resulted in shootings and beatings, and led to the murders of at least four Black Panther Party members. On January 17, 1969, Los Angeles Panther Captain [[Bunchy Carter]] and Deputy Minister [[John Huggins]] were killed in Campbell Hall on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus, in a gun battle with members of the US Organization. Another shootout between the two groups on March 17 led to further injuries. Two more Panthers died.

====Black Panther Party Liberation Schools====
Paramount to their beliefs regarding the need for individual agency in order to catalyze community change, the Black Panther Party (BPP) strongly supported the education of the masses. As part of their [[Ten-Point Program]] which set forth the ideals and goals of the party, they demanded an equitable education for all black people. Number 5 of the "What We Want Now!" section of the program reads: "We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society." In order to ensure that this occurred, the Black Panther Party took the education of their youth in their own hands by first establishing after-school programs and then opening up Liberation Schools in a variety of locations throughout the country which focused their curriculum on Black history, writing skills, and political science.&lt;ref name="autogenerated221"&gt;Wahad, D. B., Abu-Jamal, M., Shakur, A., Fletcher, J., Jones, T., &amp; Lotringer, S. (1993). Still Black, still strong: Survivors of the U.S. war against Black revolutionaries. Semiotexte. pp. 221-242&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intercommunal Youth Institute'''

The first Liberation School was opened by the Richmond Black Panthers in July 1969 with brunch served and snacks provided to students. Another school was opened in Mt. Vernon New York on July 17 of the subsequent year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated221"/&gt;  These schools were informal in nature and more closely resembled after-school or summer programs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated171"&gt;Murch, D. J. (2010). "Living for the city: Migration, education, and the rise of the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California". pp. 171-185&lt;/ref&gt;  While these campuses were the first to open, the first full-time and longest-running Liberation school was opened in January 1971 in Oakland in response to the inequitable conditions in the Oakland Unified School District which was ranked one of the lowest scoring districts in California.&lt;ref name="autogenerated168"&gt;Woodard, K., Theoharis, J., &amp; Gore, D. F. (2009). Want to start a revolution?: Radical women in the black freedom struggle. New York University Press. pp. 168-181&lt;/ref&gt;  Named the Intercommunal Youth Institute (IYI), this school, under the directorship of Brenda Bay, and later, [[Ericka Huggins]], enrolled twenty-eight students in its first year, with the majority being the children of Black Panther parents. This number grew to fifty by the 1973-1974 school year. In order to provide full support for Black Panther parents whose time was spent organizing, some of the students and faculty members lived together year around. The school itself was dissimilar to traditional schools in a variety of ways including the fact that students were separated by academic performance rather than age and students were often provided one on one support as the faculty to student ratio was 1:10.&lt;ref name="autogenerated168"/&gt;

The Panther's goal in opening Liberation Schools, and specifically the Intercommunal Youth Institute, was to provide students with an education that wasn't being provided in the "white" schools,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Programs. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://nhdblackpantherparty.weebly.com/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; as the public schools in the district employed a eurocentric assimilationist curriculum with little to no attention to black history and culture. While students were provided with traditional courses such as English, Math, and Science, they were also exposed to activities focused on class structure and the prevalence of institutional racism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Liberation Schools. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://scalar.usc.edu/works/pictures-and-progress-the-black-panther-1966-2016/liberation-schools&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall goal of the school was to instill a sense of revolutionary consciousness in the students.&lt;ref name="autogenerated171"/&gt;  With a strong belief in experiential learning, students had the opportunity to participate in community service projects as well as practice their writing skills by drafting letters to political prisoners associated with the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt;  Huggins is noted as saying, "I think that the school's principles came from the socialist principles we tried to live in the Black Panther Party. One of them being critical thinking- that children should learn not what to think but how to think ... the school was an expression of the collective wisdom of the people who envisioned it. And it was ... a living thing [that] changed every year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated171"/&gt;  Funding for the Intercommunal Youth Institute was provided through a combination of Black Panther fundraising and community support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated168"/&gt;

'''Oakland Community School'''

In 1974, due to increased interest in enrolling in the school, school officials decided to move to a larger facility and subsequently changed the school's name to Oakland Community School. During this year, the school graduated its first class.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  Although the student population continued to grow ranging between 50 and 150 between 1974-1977, the original core values of individualized instruction remained.&lt;ref name="autogenerated168"/&gt;  In September 1977, the school received a special award from Governor Edmund Brown Jr. and the California Legislature for "having set the standard for the highest 
level of elementary education in the state.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

The school eventually closed in 1982 due to governmental pressure on party leadership which caused insufficient membership and funds to continue running the school.&lt;ref name="autogenerated168"/&gt;

====Killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark====
In Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader [[Fred Hampton]]. The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI. Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard [[Mark Clark (activist)|Mark Clark]]. A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Gregory, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html "Black Panther Raid and the Death of Fred Hampton"], ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt; The only shot fired by the Panthers was from Mark Clark, who appeared to fire a single round determined to be the result of a reflexive death convulsion after he was immediately struck in the chest by shots from the police at the start of the raid.

Hampton was sleeping next to his pregnant fiancée, and was subsequently shot twice in the head at point blank range while unconscious. Coroner reports show that Hampton was drugged with a powerful barbiturate that night, and would have been unable to have been awoken by the sounds of the police raid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA672&amp;lpg=PA672&amp;dq=william+o+neal,+hampton,+drugged#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20o%20neal%2C%20hampton%2C%20drugged "BPP, Chicago Branch"], Encyclopedia of African-American History (ABC-CLIO), p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; His body was then dragged into the hallway. He was 21 years old and unarmed at the time of his death. Seven other Panthers sleeping at the house at the time of the raid were then beaten and seriously wounded, then arrested under charges of aggravated assault and attempted murder of the officers involved in the raid. These charges would later be dropped.

Former FBI agent [[M. Wesley Swearingen|Wesley Swearingen]] asserts that the Bureau was guilty of a "plot to murder" the Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/2010/fbikill.htm|title=Wes Swearigen on FBI Assassination of Fred Hampton|date=|author=|work=colorado.edu|accessdate=September 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904011339/http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/2010/fbikill.htm|archive-date=September 4, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hampton had been slipped the barbiturates which had left him unconscious by William O'Neal, who had been working as an FBI informant. Cook County State's Attorney [[Edward Hanrahan]], his assistant and eight Chicago police officers were indicted by a federal grand jury over the raid, but the charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref name="Black studies" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Encyclopedia of American Law Enforcement'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 civil action, Hampton's family won $1.85 million from the city of Chicago in a wrongful death settlement.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/pov/disturbingtheuniverse/fbi_files4.php "William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe"] https://www.pbs.org/pov/disturbingtheuniverse/, PBS website.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torture-murder of Alex Rackley====
In May 1969, three members of the New Haven chapter tortured and murdered [[Alex Rackley]], a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant. Three party officers—[[Warren Kimbro]], George Sams Jr., and [[Lonnie McLucas]]—later admitted taking part. Sams, who gave the order to shoot Rackley at the murder scene, turned state's evidence and testified that he had received orders personally from [[Bobby Seale]] to carry out the execution. Party supporters responded that Sams was himself the informant and an [[agent provocateur]] employed by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Jay Epstein, [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm "The Black Panthers and the Police: A Pattern of Genocide?"] ''New Yorker'', February 13, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The case resulted in the [[New Haven Black Panther trials]] of 1970. Kimbro and Sams were convicted of the murder, but the trials of Seale and [[Ericka Huggins]] ended with a hung jury, and the prosecution chose not to seek another trial.

====International ties====
Activists from many countries around the globe supported the Panthers and their cause. In Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Finland, for example, left-wing activists organized a tour for Bobby Seale and Masai Hewitt in 1969. At each destination along the tour, the Panthers talked about their goals and the "Free Huey!" campaign. Seale and Hewitt made a stop in Germany as well, gaining support for the "Free Huey!" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*January 1970: [[Leonard Bernstein]] holds a fundraiser for the BPP, which was notoriously mocked by [[Tom Wolfe]] in ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]''.
*Spring 1970: The Oakland BPP engages in another ambush of police officers with guns and fragmentation bombs. Two officers are wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 1970: Huey Newton's conviction is overturned, but he remains incarcerated.
*July 1970: Newton tells ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "we've never advocated violence".
*August 1970: Newton is released from prison.

In 1970, a group of Panthers traveled through [[Asia]] and they were welcomed as guests of the governments of [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], and [[China]]. The group's first stop was in North Korea, where the Panthers met with local officials in order to discuss ways in which they could help each other fight against American imperialism. [[Eldridge Cleaver]] traveled to [[Pyongyang]] twice in 1969 and 1970, and following these trips he made an effort to publicize the writings and works of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Benjamin|title=North Korea and the American Radical Left|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/north-korea-and-the-american-radical-left|work=NKIDP e-Dossier no. 14|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving North Korea, the group traveled to North Vietnam with the same agenda in mind: finding ways to put an end to American imperialism. Eldridge Cleaver was invited to speak to Black GIs by the North Vietnamese government. He encouraged them to join the Black Liberation Struggle by arguing that the United States government was only using them for its own purposes. Instead of risking their lives on the battlefield for a country that continued to oppress them, Cleaver believed that the black GIs should risk their lives in support of their own liberation. After leaving Vietnam, Cleaver met with the Chinese ambassador to Algeria in order to express their mutual animosity towards the American government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=318–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Algeria held its first Pan-African Cultural Festival, they invited many important figures from the United States. Among the important figures invited to the festival were Bobby Seale and [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. The cultural festival allowed Black Panthers to network with representatives of various international anti-imperialist movements. This was a significant time, which lead to the formation of the International Section of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, Manning; Agard-Jones, Vanessa (2008).

Eldridge also met with [[Yasser Arafat]], and gave a speech supporting the Palestinians and their goal of achieving liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Martin|2013|pp=314–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971===
====Chronology====
*January 1971: Newton expels [[Geronimo Pratt]] who, since 1970, had been in jail facing a pending murder charge. Newton also expels two of the New York 21 and his own secretary, who flee the country.
*February 1971: a fall-out between Newton and Cleaver ensues after they argue during a live broadcast link-up. Newton expels Cleaver and the entire international section from the party.
*Spring 1971: the Newton and Cleaver factions engage in retaliatory assassinations of each other's members, resulting in the deaths of four people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Donald Cox, "Split in the Party", ''New Political Science'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 1971: Bobby Seale is acquitted of ordering the Rackley murder, and returns to Oakland.
*Mid-to-late 1971: nationally, hundreds of Party members quit the BPP.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peniel Joseph]], p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;
*Late-September 1971: Newton visits and stays in China for 10 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Revolutionary Suicide Penguin classics Delux Edition" page 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton focuses the BPP on the Party's Oakland school and various other social service programs. In early 1971, the BPP founded the "Intercommunal Youth Institute" in January 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles Earl, ''The Black Panther Reconsidered'', Black Classic Press, 1998, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent of demonstrating how black youth ought to be educated. [[Ericka Huggins]] was the director of the school and Regina Davis was an administrator.&lt;ref name="BrownElaine"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was unique in that it did not have grade levels but instead had different skill levels so an 11-year-old could be in second-level English and fifth-level science.&lt;ref name="BrownElaine"/&gt; Elaine Brown taught reading and writing to a group of 10- to 11-year-olds deemed "uneducable" by the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school children were given free busing; breakfast, lunch, and dinner; books and school supplies; children were taken to have medical checkups; many children were given free clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Split====
Significant disagreements among the Party's leaders over how to confront ideological differences led to a split within the party. Certain members felt that the Black Panthers should participate in local government and social services, while others encouraged constant conflict with the police. For some of the Party's supporters, the separations among political action, criminal activity, social services, access to power, and grass-roots identity became confusing and contradictory as the Panthers' political momentum was bogged down in the [[Criminal justice#Criminal justice system|criminal justice system]]. These (and other) disagreements led to a split.

Some Panther leaders, such as [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]] and [[David Hilliard]], favored a focus on community service coupled with self-defense; others, such as [[Eldridge Cleaver]], embraced a more confrontational strategy. Eldridge Cleaver deepened the schism in the party when he publicly criticized the Party for adopting a "[[Reformism|reformist]]" rather than "[[revolutionary]]" agenda and called for Hilliard's removal. Cleaver was expelled from the Central Committee but went on to lead a splinter group, the [[Black Liberation Army]], which had previously existed as an underground paramilitary wing of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|title=Black Panther Party|author=Brian Baggins|date=|work=marxists.org|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The split turned violent, as the Newton and Cleaver factions carried out retaliatory assassinations of each other's members, resulting in the deaths of four people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Delegation to China====
In late September 1971, Huey P Newton led a delegation to China and stayed for 10 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; At every airport in China, Huey was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]] and displaying signs that said "we support the Black Panther Party, down with US imperialism" or "we support the american people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown". During the trip the Chinese arranged for him to meet and have dinner with a [[North Korea|DPRK]] ambassador, a [[Tanzania]]n ambassador, and delegations from both [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Suicide Penguin classics Deluxe Edition" page 351&lt;/ref&gt; Huey was under the impression he was going to meet Mao Zedong, but instead had two meetings with the first Premier of the People's Republic of China [[Zhou Enlai]]. One of these meetings also included Mao Zedong's wife [[Jiang Qing]]. Huey described China as "a free and liberated territory with a socialist government".&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Suicide Penguin classics Delux Edition" page 352&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972–74===
====Chronology====
*Early 1972: Newton shuts down chapters around the country, and calls the key members to Oakland.
*Mid-1972: BPP members or supporters win a number of minor offices in the Oakland city elections.
*1973: The BPP focuses nearly all of its resources on winning political power in the Oakland city government. Seale runs for mayor; [[Elaine Brown]] runs for city council. Both lose, and many Party members resign after the losses.
*Early 1974: Newton embarks on a major purge, expelling Bobby and John Seale, David and June Hilliard, Robert Bay, and numerous other top party leaders. Dozens of other Panthers loyal to Seale resigned or deserted.
*August 1974: Newton murders Kathleen Smith, a teenage prostitute. He flees to Cuba. Elaine Brown takes over the leadership in his absence.
*December 1974: Accountant Betty van Patter is murdered, after threatening to disclose irregularities in the Party's finances.

====Newton solidifies control and centralizes power in Oakland====
In 1972, the party began closing down dozens of chapters and branches all over the country, and bringing members and operations to Oakland. The political arm of the southern California chapter was shut down and its members moved to Oakland, although the underground military arm remained for a time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underground remnants of the LA chapter, which had emerged from the Slausons street gang, eventually re-emerged as the [[Crips]], a street gang who at first advocated social reform before devolving into racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Heffernan, "The Gangs of Los Angeles: Roots, Branches and Bloods", ''THE New York Times'', February 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party developed a five-year plan to take over the city of Oakland politically. Bobby Seale ran for mayor, Elaine Brown ran for city council, and other Panthers ran for minor offices. Neither Seale nor Brown were elected. A few Panthers won seats on local government commissions.

Minister of Education Ray "Masai" Hewitt created the Buddha Samurai, the party's underground security cadre in Oakland. Newton expelled Hewitt from the party later in 1972, but the security cadre remained in operation under the leadership of Flores Forbes. One of the cadre's main functions was to extort and rob drug dealers and after-hours clubs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Newton indicted for violent crimes====
In 1974, Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers. Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute. Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins. Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his "first nonpolitical murder", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|pp=265, 286, 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley, Ken 1989"&gt;Kelley, Ken. September 15, 1989. "Huey Newton: I'll Never Forget". ''East Bay Express'', Volume 11, No. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was also acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2014}}

===1974–77===
====The Panthers under Elaine Brown====
In 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed [[Elaine Brown]] as the first Chairwoman of the Party. Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Margo V 2000. p. 5"&gt;Perkins, Margo V. ''Autobiography As Activism: Three Black Women of the Sixties''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Party supported [[Lionel Wilson (politician)|Lionel Wilson]] in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition to changing the Party's direction towards more involvement in the electoral arena, Brown also increased the influence of women Panthers by placing them in more visible roles within the previously male-dominated organization.

====Death of Betty van Patter====
Panther leader Elaine Brown hired [[Murder of Betty Van Patter|Betty Van Patter]] in 1974 as a bookkeeper. Van Patter had previously served as a bookkeeper for ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine, and was introduced to the Panther leadership by [[David Horowitz]], who had been the editor of ''Ramparts'' and a major fundraiser and board member for the Panther school.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, David (December 13, 1999) [http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/12/13/betty/index.html "Who killed Betty Van Patter?"] http://www.salon.com/1999/12/13/betty/ ''[http://www.salon.com/index.html Salon.com].'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219102002/http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/12/13/betty/index.html|date=December 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, after a dispute with Brown over financial irregularities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|pp=363–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Patter went missing on December 13, 1974. Some weeks later, her severely beaten corpse was found on a [[San Francisco Bay]] beach.

There was insufficient evidence for police to charge anyone with van Patter's murder, but the Black Panther Party leadership was "almost universally believed to be responsible".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=recDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT28#v=onepage Frank Browning. The Strange Journey of David Horowitz]. ''Mother Jones Magazine'', May 1987, p. 34 (on [[Google books]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, "Left-leaving, left-leaning", ''Los Angeles Times'', November 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huey Newton later allegedly confessed to a friend that he had ordered Van Patter's murder, and that Van Patter had been tortured and raped before being killed.&lt;ref name="Kelley, Ken 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977–82===
====Return of Huey Newton and the demise of the party====
In 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and found that some men in the party were concerned about the increased power delegated to women, who now outnumbered men in the organization. According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the disciplining of school administrator Regina Davis as punishment for reprimanding a male coworker. Davis was hospitalized with a broken jaw.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite dissertation|last=Ryder|first=Ulli Kira|date=December 2008|title="As Shelters Against the Cold": Women Poets of the Black Arts and Chicano Movements, 1965–1978|type=Dissertation|publisher=ProQuest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow3vKdhH7j0C&amp;pg=PA124|page=124|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown said "The beating of Regina would be taken as a clear signal that the words 'Panther' and 'comrade' had taken a gender on gender connotation, denoting an inferiority in the female half of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notable Black American Women, Book 2|last=McClendon III|first=John H.|editor=Smith, Jessie Carney|pages=66–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssMBzqrUpjwC&amp;pg=PA67|chapter=Elaine Brown|publisher=VNR AG|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-revolution-more-50-black-panther-party-were-women-carried-guns-1525198|last=Keating|first=Fiona|title=Women of the revolution: More than 50% of the Black Panther Party were women and carried guns|date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown resigned from the party and fled to LA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|pp=444–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many scholars and activists date the Party's downfall to the period before Brown became the leader, an increasingly smaller cadre of Panthers continued to exist through the 1970s. By 1980, Panther membership had dwindled to 27, and the Panther-sponsored school closed in 1982 after it became known that Newton was embezzling funds from the school to pay for his drug addiction.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Margo V 2000. p. 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1994, pp. 299"&gt;{{harvnb|Pearson|1994|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panthers attempt to assassinate a witness against Newton====
In October 1977 Flores Forbes, the party's assistant chief of staff, led a botched attempt to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton's upcoming trial who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith's murder. Unbeknownst to the assailants, they attacked the wrong house and the occupant returned fire. During the shootout one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, was killed and the other two assailants escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gunmen Try To Kill Witness Against Black Panther Leader|journal=[[Regina Leader-Post|The Leader-Post]]|date=October 25, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two surviving assassins, Flores Forbes, fled to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy. Fearing that Malloy would discover the truth behind the botched assassination attempt, Newton allegedly ordered a "house cleaning", and Malloy was shot and buried alive in the desert. Although permanently [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down, Malloy recovered from the assault and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/14/archives/coast-inquiries-pick-panthers-as-target-murder-attempted-murders.html|title=Coast Inquiries Pick Panthers As Target; Murder, Attempted Murders and Financing of Poverty Programs Under Oakland Investigation|journal=New York Times|date=December 14, 1977|first=Wallace|last=Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said the events "might have been the result of overzealous party members".&lt;ref name="The Odyssey of Huey Newton"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946144-1,00.html|title=The Odyssey of Huey Newton|date=November 13, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Newton was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Kathleen Smith, after Crystal Gray's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, and acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.

==Women and womanism==
At its beginnings, the Black Panther Party reclaimed black masculinity and traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009&gt;{{cite journal|first=Linda|last=Lumsden|title=Good Mothers With Guns: Framing Black Womanhood in the ''Black Panther'', 1968–1980|journal=[[Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly]]|volume=86|issue=4|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} A notice in the first issue of ''[[The Black Panther (newspaper)|The Black Panther]]'', the Panthers' newspaper, applauded the Panthers—by then an all–male organization—as "the cream of Black Manhood ... there for the protection and defense of our Black community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=Robyn Ceanne|title=Engendering the Black Freedom Struggle: Revolutionary Black Womanhood and the Black Panther Party in the Bay Area, California.|journal=Journal of Women History|date=2008|volume=20|issue=1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars consider the Party's stance of armed resistance highly masculine, with the use of guns and violence affirming proof of manhood.&lt;ref name=Williams2012&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jakobi|last= Williams|title='Don't no woman have to do nothing she don't want to do': Gender, Activism, and the Illinois Black Panther Party|journal=Black Women, Gender &amp; Families|volume=6|issue=2|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} In 1968, the Black Panther Party newspaper stated in several articles that the role of female Panthers was to "stand behind black men" and be supportive.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|6}} The first black woman to join the party was [[Joan Tarika Lewis]], in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Panther party (reconsidered)|date=1998|publisher=Black Classic Press|others=Jones, Charles E. (Charles Earl), 1953-|isbn=978-0933121966|location=Baltimore|oclc=39228699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, women were present in the party from the early days and expanded their roles throughout the life of the party.&lt;ref name=":0b"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seize the time : the story of the Black Panther party and Huey P. Newton|last=1936-|first=Seale, Bobby|date=1991|publisher=Black Classic Press|isbn=9780933121300|location=Baltimore, Md.|oclc=24636234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often joined the party because they were trying to fight against gender unequal gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cleaver|first=Kathleen Neal|date=1999-06-01|title=Women, power, and revolution|journal=New Political Science|volume=21|issue=2|pages=231–236|doi=10.1080/07393149908429865|issn=0739-3148}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, the Black Panther Party newspaper officially stated that men and women are equal&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|2}} and instructed male Panthers to treat female Party members as equals,&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|6}} a drastic change from the idea of the female Panther as subordinate. That same year, Deputy Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] of the Illinois chapter conducted a meeting condemning sexism.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|2}} After 1969, the Party considered sexism counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Black Panthers adopted a ''womanist'' ideology in consideration of the unique experiences of African-American women,&lt;ref name="Blackmon2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmon|2008|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirming the belief that [[racism]] is more oppressive than [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmon|2008|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Womanism]] was a mix of black nationalism and the vindication of women,&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008 /&gt;{{rp|20}} putting race and community struggle before the gender issue.&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008 /&gt;{{rp|8}} Womanism posited that traditional feminism failed to include race and class struggle in its denunciation of male sexism&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008/&gt;{{rp|26}} and was therefore part of white hegemony.&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008/&gt;{{rp|21}} In opposition to some feminist viewpoints, womanism promoted a gender role point of view that men are not above women, but hold a different position in the home and community,&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008/&gt;{{rp|42}} so men and women must work together for the preservation of African-American culture and community.&lt;ref name=Blackmon2008/&gt;{{rp|27}}

From this point forward, the Black Panther Party newspaper portrayed women as revolutionaries, using the example of party members such as [[Kathleen Cleaver]], [[Angela Davis]] and [[Ericka Huggins|Erika Huggins]], all political and intelligent women.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009 /&gt;{{rp|10}} The Black Panther Party newspaper often showed women as active participants in the armed self-defense movement, picturing them with children and guns as protectors of the home, the family and the community.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Police killed or incarcerated many male leaders, but female Panthers were less targeted in the party for much of the 1960s and 1970s. By 1968, women made up two-thirds of the party, while many male members were out of duty. In the absence of much of the original male leadership women moved into all parts of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/grggenl9&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Whose Revolution is This - Gender's Divisive Role in the Black Panther Party Ninth Symposium Issue of Gender and Sexuality Law: Note 9 Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law 2008|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles included leadership positions, implementing community programs, and uplifting the black community. Women in the group called attention to sexism within the Black Panther Party, and worked to make changes from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forharriet.com/2015/05/say-it-loud-9-black-women-in-black.html#axzz4MKgy2NQD|title=Say It Loud: 9 Black Women in the Black Power Movement Everyone Should Know|newspaper=For Harriet {{!}} Celebrating the Fullness of Black Womanhood|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 to the end of its publication in 1982, the head editors of the Black Panther Party newspaper were all women.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|5}} In 1970, approximately 40% to 70% of Party members were women,&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|8}} and several chapters, like the Des Moines, Iowa, and New Haven, Connecticut, were headed by women.&lt;ref name=Williams2012/&gt;{{rp|7}}

During the 1970s, recognizing the limited access poor women had to abortion, the Party officially supported women's reproductive rights, including abortion.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|11}} That same year, the Party condemned and opposed prostitution.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Many African-American women Panthers began to demand childcare in order to be able to fully participate in the organization. The Black Panther Party responded to the women by establishing on-site child development centers in multiple chapters across the United States. "Childcare became largely a group activity", the children would be raised collectively during the week. This was following the Panther's commitment to collectivism and an extension of the African-American extended family tradition. Childcare allowed women Panthers to still be able to embrace motherhood, while at the same time allowing them to fully participate in the Party. Creating Childcare to the Party allowed women Panthers to not to have to make the choice between motherhood and activism.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauer|first1=Kari|title=No Revolution Without Us: Feminists of the Black Panther Party, with Lynn C.

The Black Panther Party experienced significant problems in several chapters with sexism and gender oppression, particularly in the Oakland chapter where cases of sexual harassment and gender division were common.&lt;ref name=Jennings2001&gt;Regina Jennings, "Africana Womanism in the Black Panthers Party: a Personal story", ''The Western Journal of Black Study'' 25/3 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} When Oakland Panthers arrived to bolster the New York City Panther chapter after twenty one New York leaders were incarcerated, they displayed such chauvinistic attitudes towards New York Panther women that they had to be fended off at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Austin|2006|pp=300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Party leaders thought the fight for gender equality was a threat to men and a distraction from the struggle for racial equality.&lt;ref name=Lumsden2009/&gt;{{rp|5}}

In response, the Chicago and New York chapters, among others, established equal gender rights as a priority and tried to eradicate sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name=Williams2012/&gt;{{rp|13}}

By the time the Black Panther Party disbanded, official policy was to reprimand men who violated the rules of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=Williams2012 /&gt;{{rp|13}}

===Gender Dynamics===
In the beginning, recruiting women was not at the forefront to [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]]'s and [[Bobby Seale]]'s minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alameen-Shavers|first=Antwanisha|date=Fall 2016|title=The Woman Question: Gender Dynamics within the Black Panther Party|url=|journal=Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men|volume=5|pages=33–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Seale, he stated that Newton targeted "brothers who had been pimping, brothers who had been peddling dope, brothers who ain't gonna take no shit, brothers who had been fighting the pigs". Also, they didn't realize that women could help the fight until one came into an interest meeting asking about "female leadership."  &lt;ref name=":2b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Regina|date=2001|title=Africana Womanism in The Black Panther Party: A Personal Story|url=|journal=The Western Journal of Black Studies|volume=25|pages=146–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regina Jennings recalls that many men in leadership positions had an "unchecked" sexism problem and her task was to "lift the bedroom out of their minds." She even remembers overhearing a conversation between some Panthers when were was being recruited: "Some concluded that the FBI sent me, but the captain assured them with salty good humor that, 'She's too stupid to be from the FBI.' He thought my cover and my comments too honest, too loud, and too ridiculous to be serious." She recalls her days in Oakland, California as a teenager looking for something to do to add purpose to her life and to her community. She grew up around police brutality, so it was nothing new. Her goal in joining was "smashing racism" because she viewed herself as Black before she was a women. In her community, that identity is what she felt held her back the most.&lt;ref name=":2b"/&gt;

===Women's Accomplishments===
The Black Panther Party was involved in many community projects as part of their organization. These projects included community outreach, like the breakfast program, education, and health programs.&lt;ref name=":0b"/&gt; In many cases women were the ones primarily involved with administering these types of programs.

From the beginning of the Black Panther Party education was a fundamental goal of the organization. This was highlighted in the Ten Point Platform, the newspaper that was distributed by the party, and the public commentary shared by the Panthers.&lt;ref name=":0b"/&gt; The newspaper was one of the primary and original consciousness raising and educational measures taken by the party.&lt;ref name=":0b" /&gt; Despite the fact that men were out distributing the newspaper, women like Elaine Brown and Kathleen Cleaver were behind the scenes working on those papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party: A new look at the Panthers and their legacy|last=Cleaver|first=Kathleen|last2=Katsiaficas|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaine Brown===
[[Elaine Brown]] rose to power within the BPP by filling the position of minister of information, after [[Eldridge Cleaver]] fled the country. In 1974 Elaine Brown took the seat of chair for the Black Panther Party in Oakland. She was appointed by [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]], the previous chair, while Newton and other high-ranking members were dealing with legal issues.&lt;ref name=":0b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/01/09/i-have-all-the-guns-and-money-when-a-woman-led-the-black-panther-party/|title='I have all the guns and money': When a woman led the Black Panther Party|last=Brown|first=DeNeen L.|date=2018-01-10|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of her tenure as chair, she faced opposition within the party and warned against a coup. During her time as chair she appointed many female officials, and faced backlash for her policies focused on equality within the organization. When Huey Newton returned from exile and approved of the beating of one of the female leaders of a panther school, Brown decided to leave the organization.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

===Gwen Robinson===
In an interview conducted by Judson Jeffries, Gwen Robinson reflects and relays stories and her experiences before and during her time in the Black Panther Party Detroit Division.&lt;ref name=":1b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffries|first=Judson L.|date=Fall 2016|title=Conversing with Gwen Robinson|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/634852|journal=Spectrum: A Journal of Black Men|volume=5|pages=137–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explains that she joined the Party in October 1969 with a little push back from her mother, who participated in a march with Martin Luther King Jr., in the early part of the decade. She chose the Black Panther Party (BBP) because "[She] felt a closeness and a bond with them" that she didn't feel with other organizations around at the time, like the "[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[NAACP]], the [[National Urban League|Urban League]], the [[Nation of Islam]], Shrines of Madonna, Eastside Voice of Independent Detroit (ESVID), the [[Republic of New Afrika|Republic of New Africa]], and the [[Revolutionary Action Movement]]."&lt;ref name=":1b"/&gt;

She dropped out of high school in the 12th grade because at this point she had a good standing with the Party and the environment of her high school education wasn't the best for black folks at the time. She attended [[Denby High School]] in Detroit. "There were some students who would use the N word freely" and "a P.E. instructor accused [her] of stealing her keys." She was also "shoved" into the pool when she refused to swim in fear of getting her hair wet and her White teacher who taught Afro-American history would kick people out of the class "if you challenged his position on certain Black leaders." In conclusion, dropping out of school was a means to an ends.&lt;ref name=":1b"/&gt;

She continued her work in the BBP and "was living as part of a collective" where all the work was shared and she enjoyed her time selling newspapers all day long. She climbed the ranks and became the branch's Communications Secretary for the next to the last year of her membership in January 1971. She was placed in this position after the former left due to "some issues related to [[sexism]]". In this branch, unlike the average BBP divisions, the ways of thinking of the "brothers" never turned violent or physical. She claims, "that kind of thing didn't take place in Detroit." She left the organization in 1973, but she still had a link to the group through her husband. He was their Circulation Manager. The legacy she wishes to leave behind is collective work can take you anywhere. When asked, "what is the legacy of the Detroit branch, in your opinion?" She answers, "It's crucial that people realize that the strength of the organization was rooted in discipline, deep commitment, and a genuine love for the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffries|first=Judson|date=Fall 2016|title=Conversing with Gwen Robinson|url=|journal=Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men|volume=5|pages=137–145|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
[[File:Charles Barron.jpg|thumb|New York City Councilman [[Charles Barron]] is one of numerous former Panthers to have held elected office in the US]]
There is considerable debate about what impact the Black Panther Party had on the wider society, or even on their local environment. Author Jama Lazerow writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As inheritors of the discipline, pride, and calm self-assurance preached by [[Malcolm X]], the Panthers became national heroes in black communities by infusing abstract nationalism with street toughness—by joining the rhythms of black working-class youth culture to the interracial élan and effervescence of Bay Area New Left politics&amp;nbsp; ... In 1966, the Panthers defined Oakland's ghetto as a territory, the police as interlopers, and the Panther mission as the defense of community. The Panthers' famous "policing the police" drew attention to the spatial remove that White Americans enjoyed from the police brutality that had come to characterize life in black urban communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mi2G28ZcmvsC&amp;q=%22policing%20of%20the%20police%22&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=%22policing%20of%20the%20police%22 Lazerow &amp; Williams (2006). p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Judson L. Jeffries of [[Purdue University]] calls the Panthers "the most effective black revolutionary organization in the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Green, [http://yesweekly.com/article-permalink-2333.html "The strange history of the Black Panthers in the Triad"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909003118/http://yesweekly.com/article-permalink-2333.html|date=September 9, 2014}}, ''Yes! Weekly'', April 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in a 2013 review of ''Black Against Empire'', an "authoritative" history of the BPP published by [[University of California Press]], called the organization a "serious political and cultural force" and "a movement of intelligent, explosive dreamers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/24/entertainment/la-ca-jc-joshua-bloom-20130127/2 Hector Tobar "'Black Against Empire' tells the history of Black Panthers"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', January 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Panther Party is featured in the exhibits&lt;ref&gt;[http://civilrightsmuseum.org/project/what-do-we-want/ "What Do We Want?

Numerous former Panthers have held elected office in the United States, some into the 21st century; these include [[Charles Barron]] (New York City Council), Nelson Malloy (Winston-Salem City Council), and [[Bobby Rush]] (US House of Representatives). Most of these officials hold positive assessments of the BPP's overall contribution to black liberation and American democracy. In 1990, the [[Chicago City Council]] passed a resolution declaring "Fred Hampton Day" in honor of the slain leader.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;  In [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] in 2012, a large contingent of local officials and community leaders came together to install a historic marker of the local BPP headquarters; State Representative Earline Parmone declared "[The Black Panther Party] dared to stand up and say, 'We're fed up and we're not taking it anymore' ... Because they had courage, today I stand as ... the first African American ever to represent Forsyth County in the state Senate".&lt;ref&gt;Layla Garms, [http://wschronicle.com/2012/10/black-panthers-legacy-honored-with-marker/ "Black Panther Legacy Honored with Marker"], ''The Chronicle of Winston-Salem'', October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the Black Panther Party held a 40-year reunion in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetcityorange.com/BlackPanther40thReunion/ Photos of the Black Panther Party], Oakland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BPP REUNION 2006.JPG|thumb|Black Panther 40th Reunion, 2006.]]
In January 2007, a joint California state and Federal task force charged eight men with the August 29, 1971, murder of California police officer Sgt. John Young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/24/MNGDONO11G1.DTL Ex-militants charged in S.F. police officer's '71 slaying at station] (via ''[[SFGate]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants have been identified as former members of the [[Black Liberation Army]].

Young. In July 2009, charges were dropped against four of the accused: Ray Boudreaux, Henry W. Jones, Richard Brown and Harold Taylor. Also that month Jalil Muntaquim pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter becoming the second person to be convicted in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/07/BAKJ18JUNS.DTL "2nd guilty plea in 1971 killing of S.F. officer"] (via ''SFGate'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, former Panther chief of staff David Hilliard has offered tours of sites in Oakland that are historically significant to the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/10/25/MN32268.DTL|title=Tour of Black Panther Sites: Former member shows how party grew in Oakland|author=DelVecchio, Rick|date=October 25, 1997|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groups and movements inspired and aided by the Black Panthers===
Various groups and movements have picked names inspired by the Black Panthers:
*[[Assata's Daughters]], an all-black activist group in Chicago, was founded in 2015 by Page May; the group is named after Black Panther [[Assata Shakur]] and has objectives similar to the Black Panther's 10-Point Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zedbooks.net/blog/posts/getting-free/|title=We're Assata's Daughters|last=|first=|date=19 October 2016|website=Zed Collective|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gray Panthers, often used to refer to advocates for the rights of seniors ([[Gray Panthers]] in the United States, [[The Grays – Gray Panthers]] in Germany).
*[[Polynesian Panthers]], an advocacy group for [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islander]] people in [[New Zealand]].
*[[Black Panthers (Israel)|Black Panthers]], a protest movement that advocates social justice and fights for the rights of [[Mizrahi Jews]] in [[Israel]].
*White Panthers, used to refer to both the [[White Panther Party]], a far-left, anti-racist, white American political party of the 1970s, as well as the White Panthers UK, an unaffiliated group started by [[Mick Farren]].
*[[The Pink Panthers]], used to refer to two LGBT rights organizations.
*[[Dalit Panthers]], an Indian social reform movement, which fights against Caste Oppression in Indian Society.
*The [[British Black Panthers|British Black Panther]] movement, which flourished in [[London]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was not affiliated with the American organization although it fought for many of the same rights.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Williams, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/power-struggle-a-new-exhibition-looks-back-at-the-rise-of-the-british-black-panthers-8872269.html "Power struggle: A new exhibition looks back at the rise of the British Black Panthers"], ''The Independent'', October 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazelann Williams, [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/reliving-british-black-panther-movement "Reliving The British Black Panther Movement"], ''The Voice'', January 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The French Black Dragons, a black [[Anti-fascism|antifascist]] group closely linked to the [[punk rock]] and [[rockabilly]] scene.
*The [[Young Lords]]
*[[Huey P. Newton Gun Club]], a gun club named after the Black Panther Party's founder.
*Memphis Black Autonomy Federation

In April 1977 Panthers were key supporters of the [[504 Sit-in|504 Sit-In]], the longest of which was the 25-day occupation of the San Francisco Federal Building by over 120 people with disabilities. Panthers provided daily home-cooked meals and support of the people that proved essential to the protest's success, which in turn inspired a movement that was instrumental in getting the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|''Americans with Disabilities Act'' (ADA)]] passed thirteen years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweik|first=Susan|year=2011|title=Lomax's Matrix The Black Power of 504|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1371/0|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|volume=31:1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Black Panther Party===
{{See also|New Black Panther Party}}
In 1989, a group calling itself the "[[New Black Panther Party]]" was formed in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Ten years later, the NBPP became home to many former [[Nation of Islam]] members when its chairmanship was taken by [[Khalid Abdul Muhammad]].

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] include the New Black Panthers on their lists of designated [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active U.S. Hate Groups: Black Separatist|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/type.jsp?DT=3|publisher=Splcenter.org|accessdate=June 25, 2016|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314154401/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/type.jsp?DT=3|archivedate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huey Newton Foundation, former chairman and co-founder Bobby Seale, and members of the original Black Panther Party have insisted that this New Black Panther Party is illegitimate and they have strongly objected to it by stating that there "is no new Black Panther Party".&lt;ref name="no NBPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpanther.org/newsalert.htm|title=There Is No New Black Panther Party: An Open Letter From the Dr. Huey P.

'''''Cogito''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[magazine]] published by [[Nefeli publications]] (Athens, Greece) and a member of the [[Eurozine]] network. It was founded in 2004 with the intention of making philosophy accessible to the lay reader without compromising it through oversimplification. ''Cogito'' is therefore an attempt to approach everyday issues and themes through a philosophically rigorous lens. Contributors, most of them professional philosophers but also academics from a variety of disciplines,as well as writers, consider such varied topics as colors, taste, gardens, cinema, desire and love, art and aesthetics, and logical [[paradox]]es. Each issue, consisting of a number of articles, is dedicated to a different topic: [[privacy]], intelligence both natural and [[artificial intelligence|artificial]], [[applied ethics]], history and narrative, [[friendship]]. Each issue further presents a philosopher to its readers. In the past, subjects of this 'philosophical library' have included [[Plato]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[J.S. Mill]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].

'''Conspiracy Con''' is an annual [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] that was begun in 2001 by [[Brian William Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebayareaufoexpo.com/aboutexpo.html''About the Bay Area UFO Expo'']&lt;/ref&gt; and takes place in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara, California, USA]].&lt;ref&gt;Except 2007, when it was held in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studio360.org/yore/show081305.html ''Conspiracy Con''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193826/http://www.studio360.org/yore/show081305.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Studio 360]] ([[Public Radio International]]), August 13, 2005 &amp; [http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2006/02/23 February 23, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194107/http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2006/02/23 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mojones.com/commentary/columns/2006/06/madonna_conspiracy.html ''Like a Conspiracy Virgin''], [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], [[Bill Santiago]], June 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trashcity /&gt;&lt;ref name=trashcity2 /&gt; It was held on the weekend preceding [[Memorial Day]] until 2007 and has since taken place on the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradigmresearchgroup.org/conferences.html|title=The Paradigm Clock|first=Stephen Bassett - Paradigm Research|last=Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2017}} the event has not been held since 2013, the 2014 convention being cancelled after its producer was unable to fund it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conspiracycon.com/|title=Welcome to Conspiracy Con 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The primary goals of Conspiracy Con are to directly expose and analyze the "real" problems and the "real" problem-makers of yesterday, today and tomorrow, as well as to provide courses of action and potential solutions to the challenges that are placed upon humankind by these forces, which (for the moment) may seem invisible, perpetual and insurmountable.''&lt;ref name=ccon /&gt;

Hall states that the convention looks "to the manipulation of humanity by non-human intelligences... be they [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], [[Plane (metaphysics)|inter-dimensional]], [[demon]]ic, [[satan]]ic... whatever [[consciousness]] it is, operating on (and in) this planet, that looks upon humankind as sheep and cattle to be herded and slaughtered at will."&lt;ref name=ccon/&gt; "[The convention] is meant to be [[controversial]]; it is a serious approach to serious issues that are rarely or never reported by the [[mainstream media]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2002/05/20/smallb5.html ''Conspiracy buffs don't let 'them' get in way of convention''], Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal, Danek S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34449">'''Darwinian literary studies''' (also known as '''literary Darwinism''') is a branch of [[literary criticism]] that studies [[literature]] in the context of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]], including [[gene-culture coevolution]].  It represents an emerging trend of [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] thought in intellectual disciplines beyond those traditionally considered as [[evolutionary biology]]: [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[evolutionary developmental psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[affective neuroscience]], [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary epistemology]], and other such disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of evolutionary research in the human sciences, see [http://www.hbes.com/ Human Behavior and Evolution Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and scope==

Interest in the relationship between Darwinism and the study of literature began in the nineteenth century, for example, among Italian literary critics.&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elena Canadelli|author2=Paolo Coccia|author3=Telmo Pievani|editor1-last=Glick|editor1-first=Thomas F.|editor2-last=Shaffer|editor2-first=Elinor|title=The Literary and Cultural Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe|date=2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780937120|pages=483–509|chapter=Darwin and Literature in Italy: A Profitable Relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ugo Angelo Canello]] argued that literature was the history of the human psyche, and as such, played a part in the struggle for natural selection, while [[Francesco de Sanctis]] argued that [[Emile Zola]] "brought the concepts of natural selection, struggle for existence, adaptation and environment to bear in his novels".&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014" /&gt;

Modern Darwinian literary studies arose in part as a result of its proponents' dissatisfaction with the [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] philosophies that had come to dominate literary study during the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the Darwinists took issue with the argument that [[discourse]] constructs reality. The Darwinists argue that biologically grounded dispositions constrain and inform discourse. This argument runs counter to what evolutionary psychologists assert is the central idea in the "[[Standard Social Science Model]]": that [[culture]] wholly constitutes human values and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;On the conceptual character of poststructuralism, see [[Terry Eagleton]], "Post-structuralism" in ''Literary Theory: An Introduction'', (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983); [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20027411 M. H. Abrams, "The Transformation of English Studies: 1930-1995"], ''Daedalus''; and [[Jonathan Culler]], ''Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1997). For Darwinist critiques of "cultural constructivism," see [http://www.theamericanscholar.org/getting-it-all-wrong/ Brian Boyd, "Getting It All Wrong"]; and [http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/poststructuralism_cultural_criticism_and.pdf Joseph Carroll, "Pluralism, Poststructuralism, and Evolutionary Theory,"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary Darwinists use concepts from evolutionary biology and the evolutionary human sciences to formulate principles of literary theory and interpret literary texts. They investigate interactions between [[human nature]] and the forms of cultural imagination, including literature and its oral antecedents. By "human nature", they mean a pan-human, genetically transmitted set of dispositions: motives, emotions, features of personality, and forms of cognition. Because the Darwinists concentrate on relations between genetically transmitted dispositions and specific cultural configurations, they often describe their work as "biocultural critique".&lt;ref&gt;For introductory commentaries on evolutionary studies in the humanities, see [http://hfromm.net/professional/DarwinBoth.html Harold Fromm, "The New Darwinism in the Humanities"], ''Hudson Review''; [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/magazine/the-literary-darwinists.html?pagewanted=2 D. T. Max, "The Literary Darwinists"], ''The New York Times''; [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/439388a.html John Whitfield, "Literary Darwinism: Textual Selection"], ''Nature''; [http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.09-the-other-darwin-mark-czarnecki-creationism-origin-of-the-species-evolution/ Mark Czarnecki, "The Other Darwin"], ''Walrus Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many literary Darwinists aim not just at creating another "approach" or "movement" in literary theory; they aim at fundamentally altering the paradigm within which literary study is now conducted. They want to establish a new alignment among the disciplines and ultimately to encompass all other possible approaches to literary study. They rally to Edward O. Wilson's cry for "consilience" among all the branches of learning. Like Wilson, they envision nature as an integrated set of elements and forces extending in an unbroken chain of material causation from the lowest level of subatomic particles to the highest levels of cultural imagination. And like Wilson, they regard evolutionary biology as the pivotal discipline uniting the hard sciences with the social sciences and the humanities. They believe that humans have evolved in an adaptive relation to their environment. They argue that for humans, as for all other species, evolution has shaped the anatomical, physiological, and neurological characteristics of the species, and they think that human behavior, feeling, and thought are fundamentally shaped by those characteristics. They make it their business to consult evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science in order to determine what those characteristics are, and they bring that information to bear on their understanding of the products of the human imagination.&lt;ref&gt;For general statements about the aims of scholars in this field, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v029/29.1boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Evolution: A Bio-Cultural Approach"]; [http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/what-is-literary-darwinism-an-interview-with-joseph-carroll/ Interview with Joseph Carroll, "What Is Literary Darwinism?"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v027/27.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "The Tree of Knowledge and Darwinian Literary Study"]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tx00yV_qNQ Maya Lessov, A Filmed Interview with Joseph Carroll, Brian Boyd, and Jonathan Gottschall]; and [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v026/26.2nordlund.html Marcus Nordlund, "Consilient Literary Interpretation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary literary criticism of a minimalist kind consists in identifying basic, common human needs—survival, sex, and status, for instance—and using those categories to describe the behavior of characters depicted in literary texts. Others pose for themselves a form of criticism involving an overarching interpretive challenge: to construct continuous explanatory sequences linking the highest level of causal evolutionary explanation to the most particular effects in individual works of literature. Within evolutionary biology, the highest level of causal explanation involves adaptation by means of natural selection. Starting from the premise that the human mind has evolved in an adaptive relation to its environment, literary Darwinists undertake to characterize the phenomenal qualities of a literary work (tone, style, theme, and formal organization), locate the work in a cultural context, explain that cultural context as a particular organization of the elements of human nature within a specific set of environmental conditions (including cultural traditions), identify an implied author and an implied reader, examine the responses of actual readers (for instance, other literary critics), describe the socio-cultural, political, and psychological functions the work fulfills, locate those functions in relation to the evolved needs of human nature, and link the work comparatively with other artistic works, using a taxonomy of themes, formal elements, affective elements, and functions derived from a comprehensive model of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the topics and approaches in this field, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=usZR5aXFmiUC&amp;pg=PA637&amp;lpg=PA637&amp;dq=joseph+carroll+evolutionary+approaches+to+literature+and+drama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=StMHaB_3yO&amp;sig=KJxvcQcepCmXJYqvd9cJQA4jIEw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LbWqS7X1M5OYsgOq0_HMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20carroll%20evolutionary%20approaches%20to%20literature%20and%20drama&amp;f=false Joseph Carroll, "Evolutionary Approaches to Literature and Drama"].

Contributors to evolutionary studies in literature have included humanists, biologists, and social scientists. Some of the biologists and social scientists have adopted primarily discursive methods for discussing literary subjects, and some of the humanists have adopted the empirical, quantitative methods typical of research in the sciences.  Literary scholars and scientists have also collaborated in research that combines the methods typical of work in the humanities with methods typical of work in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of evolutionary criticism making use of empirical, quantitative methodology, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v033/33.1.carroll.html Carroll, Gottschall, Johnson, and Kruger, "Agonistic Structure in Nineteenth-Century British Novels: Doing the Math"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/greater%20emphasis%20on%20female%20attract.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "Greater Emphasis on Female Attractiveness in ''Homo sapiens'': A Revised Solution to an Old Evolutionary Riddle"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/proofs_manifesto_feminist.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "A Modest Manifesto and Testing the Hypotheses of Feminist Fairy Tale Studies"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/marvels_and_tales/v023/23.2.gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "Response to Kathleen Ragan's 'What Happened to the Heroines in Folktales?'"]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v030/30.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall and Marcus Nordlund, "Romantic Love: A Literary Universal?"]; [http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep06715738.pdf Johnson, Carroll, Gottschall, and Kruger, "Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels]; and [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/shakespeare.pdf Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, "The Small World of Shakespeare's Plays"].

==Adaptive function of literature and the arts==

The most hotly debated issue in evolutionary literary study concerns the adaptive functions of literature and other arts—whether there are any adaptive functions, and if so, what they might be.   Proposed functions include transmitting information, including about kin relations, and by providing the audience with a model and rehearsal for how to behave in similar situations that may arise in the future.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 Evolutionary approaches of literature and drama by Joseph Carrol&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Pinker (''How the Mind Works'', 1997) suggests that aesthetic responsiveness is merely a side effect of cognitive powers that evolved to fulfill more practical functions,  but Pinker also suggests that narratives can provide information for adaptively relevant problems. Geoffrey Miller (''The Mating Mind'', 2000) argues that artistic productions in the ancestral environment served as forms of sexual display in order to demonstrate fitness and attract mates, similarly to the function of the [[peacock]]'s tail. Brian Boyd (''On the Origin of Stories'', 2009) argues that the arts are forms of cognitive "play" that enhance pattern recognition. In company with Ellen Dissanayake (''Art and Intimacy'', 2000), Boyd also argues that the arts provide means of creating shared social identity and help create and maintain [[human bonding]]. Dissanayake, [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] (''Literary Darwinism'' 2004), and [[Denis Dutton]] (''The Art Instinct'', 2009) all argue that the arts help organize the human mind by giving emotionally and aesthetically modulated models of reality. By participating in the simulated life of other people one gains a greater understanding of the motivations of oneself and other people. The idea that the arts function as means of psychological organization subsumes the ideas that the arts provide adaptively relevant information, enable us to consider alternative behavioral scenarios, enhance pattern recognition, and serve as means for creating shared social identity. And of course, the arts can be used for sexual display. In that respect, the arts are like most other human products—clothing, jewelry, shelter, means of transportation, etc. The hypothesis that the arts help organize the mind is not incompatible with the hypothesis of sexual display, but it subordinates sexual display to a more primary adaptive function.&lt;ref&gt;For commentaries on the adaptive (or non-adaptive) functions of the arts, see [http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/files/bboy001/boyd_ev_theories_of_art.pdf Brian Boyd, "Evolutionary Theories of Art,"] in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', ed.

==Hypotheses about formal literary features==

Some Darwinists have proposed explanations for formal literary features, including genres. [[Meter (poetry)|Poetic meter]] has been attributed to a biologically based three-second metric. Gender preferences for [[pornography]] and [[romance novel]]s have been explained by [[sexual selection]]. Different genres have been conjectured to correspond to different [[basic emotions]]: [[tragedy]] corresponding to sadness, fear, and anger; comedy to joy and surprise; and satire to anger, disgust, and contempt. Tragedy has also been associated with status conflict and comedy with mate selection. The satiric [[dystopian]] novel has been explained by contrasting universal human needs and oppressive state organization.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

==Distinguishing literary Darwinism==

''Cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism:'' Literary Theorists who would call themselves "literary Darwinists" or claim some close alignment with the literary Darwinists share one central idea: that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects the structure and character of the adapted mind. There are at least two other ways of integrating evolution into literary theory: cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism. Cosmic evolutionists identify some universal process of development or progress and identify literary structures as microcosmic versions of that process. Proponents of cosmic evolution include [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]], Alex Argyros, and Richard Cureton. Evolutionary analogists take the process of Darwinian evolution—blind variation and selective retention—as a widely applicable model for all development. The psychologist Donald Campbell advances the idea that all intellectual creativity can be conceived as a form of random variation and selective retention. Rabkin and Simon offer an instance in literary study. They argue that cultural creations "evolve in the same way as do biological organisms, that is, as complex adaptive systems that succeed or fail according to their fitness to their environment."&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Rabkin, and C. P. Simon, "Age, Sex, and Evolution in the Science Fiction Marketplace." ''Interdisciplinary Literary Studies'', 2 (2001): 45-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics or theorists who have some affiliation with evolutionary biology but who would not identify themselves as literary Darwinists include William Benzon (''Beethoven's Anvil'') and William Flesch (''Comeuppance'').

''Cognitive rhetoric:'' Practitioners of "cognitive rhetoric" or [[cognitive poetics]] affiliate themselves with certain language-centered areas of cognitive psychology. The chief theorists in this school argue that language is based in metaphors, and they claim that metaphors are themselves rooted in biology or the body, but they do not argue that human nature consists in a highly structured set of motivational and cognitive dispositions that have evolved through an adaptive process regulated by natural selection. Cognitive rhetoricians are generally more anxious than literary Darwinists to associate themselves with postmodern theories of "discourse," but some cognitive rhetoricians make gestures toward evolutionary psychology, and some critics closely affiliated with evolutionary psychology have found common ground with the cognitive rhetoricians.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v023/23.2boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Discovery," ''Philosophy and Literature'', 23 (1999): 313-33]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v025/25.3sacks.html Nancy Easterlin, "Romanticism's Gray Matter," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 26 (2002): 443-55.]&lt;/ref&gt; The seminal authorities in cognitive rhetoric are the language philosophers [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]] and [[George Lakoff]]. The most prominent literary theorist in the field is [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]. Other literary scholars associated with cognitive rhetoric include Mary Thomas Crane, F. Elizabeth Hart, Tony Jackson, Alan Richardson, Ellen Spolsky, [[Francis Steen]], and [[Lisa Zunshine]].&lt;ref&gt;On the relations between cognitive rhetoric and literary Darwinism, see [http://www.style.niu.edu/ Joseph Carroll, "An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study," ''Style'' 42 (2008): 105-108]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v025/25.2hart.html F. Elizabeth Hart, "The epistemology of cognitive literary studies, ''Philosophy and Literature'' 25 (2001): 314-34]; Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky, eds., ''The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity'', Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentaries==
Some of the commentaries included in the [http://www.style.niu.edu/ special double issue of ''Style''] are critical of literary Darwinism. Other critical commentaries include those of [http://www.entelechyjournal.com/billbenzon.html William Benzon, "Signposts for a Naturalist Criticism,"] (''Entelechy: Mind &amp; Culture,'' Fall 2005/Winter 2006); [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090608/deresiewicz William Deresiewicz, "Adaptation: On Literary Darwinism,"] ''The Nation'' June 8, 2009: 26-31; [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674032284/ William Flesch, ''Comeuppance: Costly Signaling, Altruistic Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction'',] (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2008); [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1412811473/ Eugene Goodheart, ''Darwinian Misadventures in the Humanities'',] (New Brunswick: NJ: Transaction, 2007); Jonathan Kramnick, "Against Literary Darwinism," in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2011; "Debating Literary Darwinism," a set of responses to Jonathan Kramnick's essay, along with Kramnick's rejoinder, in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2012; Alan Richardson, "Studies in Literature and Cognition: A Field Map," in [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0754638499/ ''The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity''], ed. Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004 1-29); and Lisa Zunshine, "What is Cognitive Cultural Studies?," in ''Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2010 1-33). Goodheart and Deresiewicz, adopting a traditional humanist perspective, reject efforts to ground literary study in biology. Richardson disavows the Darwinists' tendency to attack poststructuralism. Richardson and Benzon both align themselves with cognitive science and distinguish that alignment from an alignment with evolutionary psychology. Flesch makes use of evolutionary research on game theory, costly signaling, and altruistic punishment but, like [[Stephen Jay Gould]], professes himself hostile to evolutionary psychology. For a commentary that is sympathetic to evolutionary psychology but skeptical about the possibilities of using it for literary study, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v031/31.1pinker.html Steven Pinker, "Toward a Consilient Study of Literature,"] a review of ''The Literary Animal'', ''Philosophy and Literature'' 31 (2007): 162-178.[[David Fishelov]] has argued that the attempt to link Darwinism to literary studies has failed "to produce compelling evidence to support some of its basic assumptions (notably that literature is an [[adaptation]])" and has called on literary scholars to be more conceptually rigorous when they pursue "empirical research into different aspects of literary evolution." &lt;ref&gt; David Fishelov, "Evolution and Literary Studies: Time to Evolve," ''Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 2 (October 2017): 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eight Consciousnesses''' (Skt. ''aṣṭa vijñānakāyāḥ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/hvsatssu.htm|title=Sātyasiddhiśāstra|last=Harivarman|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|postscript=At vargaḥ 62 (nācaitasikavargaḥ): "ya ādhyātmiko 'sti vijñānakāyāḥ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a classification developed in the tradition of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. They enumerate the five sense consciousnesses, supplemented by the mental consciousness (''manovijñāna''), the '''defiled mental consciousness''' (''kliṣṭamanovijñāna''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), and finally the fundamental '''store-house consciousness''' (''ālāyavijñāna''),  which is the basis of the other seven.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; This eighth consciousness is said to store the impressions (''[[vasanas|vāsanāḥ]]'') of previous experiences, which form the seeds (''[[bīja]]'') of future [[karma]] in this life and in the next after [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].

==The eightfold network of primary consciousnesses==
All surviving schools of Buddhist thought accept&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;"in common"&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;the existence of the first six primary consciousnesses (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|[[vijñāna]]}}'', {{bo|t=རྣམ་ཤེས་|w=rnam-shes}}).&lt;ref name="Berzin MMF Quote"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=Mind and Mental Factors: the Fifty-one Types of Subsidiary Awareness|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors|publisher=Study Buddhism|accessdate=4 June 2016|location=Berlin, Germany; June 2002; revised July, 2006|quote=Unlike the Western view of consciousness as a general faculty that can be aware of all sensory and mental objects, Buddhism differentiates six types of consciousness, each of which is specific to one sensory field or to the mental field.  A primary consciousness cognizes merely the essential nature (''ngo-bo'') of an object, which means the category of phenomenon to which something belongs.  For example, eye consciousness cognizes a sight as merely a sight.  The Chittamatra schools add two more types of primary consciousness to make their list of an eightfold network of primary consciousnesses (''rnam-shes tshogs-brgyad''): deluded awareness (''nyon-yid''), ''alayavijnana'' (''kun-gzhi rnam-shes'', all-encompassing foundation consciousness, storehouse consciousness).

It gained its place in a distinctly {{IAST|Yogācāra}} system over a period of some three hundred years stretching from 100 to 400 {{smallcaps|C.E.}}, culminating in the ''{{IAST|[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]}}'', a short text by Asaṅga (circa 350), setting out a systematic presentation of the ''{{IAST|ālaya-vijñāna}}'' doctrine developed over the previous centuries.  It is the doctrine found in this text in particular that Tsong kha pa, in his ''Ocean of Eloquence'', treats as having been revealed in toto by the Buddha and transmitted to suffering humanity through the {{IAST|Yogācāra}} founding saints (Tib. ''shing rta srol byed''): Maitreya&lt;nowiki&gt;[-nātha]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu.&lt;ref name="Sparham" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;While some noteworthy modern scholars of the [[Gelug]] tradition (which was founded by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]]'s reforms to [[Atisha]]'s [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school) assert that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is posited only in the Yogācāra philosophical tenet system, all non-Gelug schools of Tibetan buddhism maintain that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is accepted by the various [[Madhyamaka]] schools, as well.&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=English Glossart of Buddhist Terms: 'All-encompassing Foundation Consciousness'|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xall-encompassing_20foundation_20consciousness|publisher=The Berzin Archives|accessdate=6 February 2013|location=Berlin, Germany|quote=An unspecified, nonobstructive, individual consciousness that underlies all cognition, cognizes the same objects as the cognitions it underlies, but is a nondetermining cognition of what appears to it and lacks clarity of its objects.

This was the first time Buddha’s teachings were put into written form and, in this case, they were rendered into the Pali language. This version of The Three Basket-like Collections, The Tipitaka, is commonly known as The Pali Canon. The other Hinayana Schools, however, continued to transmit the teachings in oral form.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

===Early Buddhist Texts ("EBTs")===
The first five sense-consciousnesses along with the sixth consciousness are identified in the Suttapiṭaka, especially the Salayatanavagga subsection of the [[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyuttanikāya]]:
{{quote|"Monks, I will teach you the All. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."&lt;br /&gt;
"As you say, lord," the monks responded.&lt;br /&gt;
The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html|title=Sabba Sutta: The All|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, the early Buddhist texts speak of [[anusaya|anusayā]] (Sanskrit: anuśayāḥ), the “underlying tendencies” or “latent dispositions” which keep beings caught in the circle of samsara. These potential tendencies are generally seen as unconscious processes which "lie beneath" our everyday consciousness, and according to Waldron "they represent the potential, the tendency, for cognitive and emotional afflictions (Pali: ''kilesā'', Sanskrit: ''kleśāḥ'') to arise".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Waldron, William S.

The Sautrāntika school of Buddhism, which relied closely on the sutras, developed a theory of seeds (''bīja'', 種子) in the mindstream (''cittasaṃtāna'', 心相續,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=%E5%BF%83%E7%9B%B8%E7%BA%8C|title=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism - 心相續|last=Charles|first=Muller|date=2004-09-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lit. "mind-character-continuity") to explain how karma and the latent dispositions continued throughout life and rebirth. This theory later developed into the alayavijñana view.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravāda theory of the [[Bhavanga|bhavaṅga]] may also be a forerunner of the ālāyavijñana theory. [[Vasubandhu]] cites the bhavaṅgavijñāna of the [[Sinhala Kingdom|Sinhalese]] school (''Tāmraparṇīyanikāya'') as a forerunner of the ālāyavijñāna. The Theravadin theory is also mentioned by Xuánzàng.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmithausen. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, Tokyo, 1987, I, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogācāra===
{{Main|Yogācāra}}
The texts of the Yogācāra school gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. It is "meant to be an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} The theory of the ālāyavijñana and the other consciousnesses developed out of a need to work out various issues in Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] thought. According to [[Lambert Schmithausen]], the first mention of the concept occurs in the [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhumiśāstra]], which posits a basal consciousness that contains seeds for future cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Schmithausen, Lambert. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and the Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, International Institute for Buddhist Studies (1987), pp 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] and in the [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]] of [[Asanga|Asaṅga]].

[[Vasubandhu]] is considered to be the systematizer of Yogācāra thought.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} Vasubandhu used the concept of the [[Vijñāna#Six vijñānas|six consciousnesses]], on which he elaborated in the ''Triṃśikaikākārikā'' (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135-143}}

==Vijñānāni==
According to the traditional interpretation, Vasubandhu states that there are eight consciousnesses (''vijñānāni'', singular: ''vijñāna''):
* Five sense-consciousnesses,
* Mind (perception),
* Manas (self-consciousness),{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138-140}}
* Storehouse-consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137-139}}
According to Kalupahana, this classification of eight consciousnesses is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu's Triṃśikaikākārikā by later adherents.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Kalupahana: "The above explanation of ''alaya-vijnana'' makes it very different from that found in the ''Lankavatara''. The latter assumes ''alaya'' to be the eight consciousness, giving the impression that it represents a totally distinct category. Vasubandhu does not refer to it as the eight, even though his later disciples like Sthiramati and Hsuan Tsang constantly refer to it as such".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

===Ālayavijñāna===
The ālayavijñāna (Japanese: 阿頼耶識 arayashiki), or the "All-encompassing foundation consciousness",&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC" /&gt; forms the "base-consciousness" (''mūlavijñāna'') or "causal consciousness". According to the traditional interpretation, the other seven consciousnesses are "evolving" or "transforming" consciousnesses originating in this base-consciousness. 
The store-house consciousness accumulates all potential energy as seeds (''bīja'') for the mental (''nāma'') and physical (''rūpa'') manifestation of one's existence ([[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]). It is the storehouse-consciousness which induces [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], causing the origination of a new existence.

====Role====
The ālayavijñāna is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] as the "mind which has all the seeds" (''sarvabījakam cittam'') which enters the womb and develops based on two forms of appropriation or attachment (''[[upādāna]]''); to the material sense faculties, and to predispositions (''[[vāsanā]]ḥ'') towards conceptual proliferations (''[[papañca|prapañca]]'').&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Waldron, William S. How Innovative is ALAYAVIJÑANA&lt;/ref&gt; The Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra also defines it in varying ways:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This consciousness is also called the appropriating consciousness ("adana-vijñana") because the body is grasped and appropriated by it.''

''It is also called the "alaya-vijñana" because it dwells in and attaches to this body in a common destiny ("ekayogakṣema-arthena").''

''It is also called mind ("citta") because it is heaped up and accumulated by [the six cognitive objects, i.e.:] visual forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles and dharmas.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a seemingly innovative move, the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra states that the alayavijñana is always active subliminally and occurs simultaneously with, "supported by and depending upon" the six sense consciousnesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to [[Asanga]]'s [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]], the alayavijñana is taught by other Buddhist schools by different names. He states that the alaya is what the [[Mahasamghikas]] call the “root-consciousness” (''mulavijñana''), what the Mahīśāsakas call “the aggregate which lasts as long as samsara” (''asaṃsārikaskandha'') and what the [[Sthaviras]] call the [[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rebirth and purification====
The store-house consciousness receives impressions from all functions of the other consciousnesses, and retains them as potential energy, ''[[bīja]]'' or "seeds", for their further manifestations and activities. Since it serves as the container for all experiential impressions it is also called the "seed consciousness" (種子識) or '''container consciousness'''.

According to Yogācāra teachings, the seeds stored in the store consciousness of sentient beings are not pure.{{refn|group=note|name="individual"|Each being has his own one and only, formless and no-place-to-abide store-house consciousness. Our "being" is created by our own store-consciousness, according to the karma seeds stored in it. In "coming and going" we definitely do not own the "no-coming and no-going" store-house consciousness, rather we are owned by it. Just as a human image shown in a monitor can never be described as lasting for any instant, since "he" is just the production of electron currents of data stored and flow from the hard disk of the computer, so do seed-currents drain from the store-consciousness, never last from one moment to the next.}}

The store consciousness, while being originally immaculate in itself, contains a "mysterious mixture of purity and defilement, good and evil". Because of this mixture the transformation of consciousness from defilement to purity can take place and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]] is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lankavatara Sutra, A Mahayana Text,'' Suzuki's introduction at p. xxvi, available online: [http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the process of purification the dharma practitioner can become an [[Arhat]], when the four defilements of the mental functions {{refn|group=note|心所法), self-delusion (我癡), self-view (我見), egotism (我慢), and self-love (我愛)}} of the manas-consciousness are purified.{{refn|group=note|By then the polluted mental functions of the first six consciousnesses would have been cleansed. The seventh or the manas-consciousness determines whether or not the seeds and the contentdrain from the alaya-vijnana breaks through, becoming a "function" to be perceived by us in the mental or physical world.}} {{refn|group=note|In contrast to an Arhat, a Buddha is one with all his seeds stored in the eighth Seed consciousness. Cleansed and substituted, bad for good, one for one, his polluted-seeds-containing eighth consciousness (Alaya Consciousness) becomes an all-seeds-purified eighth consciousness (Pure consciousness 無垢識 ), and he becomes a Buddha.}}

====Tathagata-garbha thought====
According to the [[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatārasūtra]] and the schools of Chan and Zen Buddhism, the ālāyavijñāna is identical with the ''[[tathagata-garbha|tathāgatagarbha]]''{{refn|group=note|The womb or matrix of the Thus-come-one, the Buddha}}, and is fundamentally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}

The equation of ālāyavijñāna and tathāgatagarbha was contested. It was seen as "something akin to the Hindu notions of ''ātman'' (permanent, invariant self) and ''{{IAST|prakṛti}}'' (primordial substrative nature from which all mental, emotional and physical things evolve)." According to Lusthaus, the critique led by the end of the eighth century to the rise of the logico-epistemic tradition of Yogācāra and a hybrid school combining ''Tathāgatagarbha'' thought with basic Yogācāra doctrines:&lt;ref name=Lusthaus /&gt;

{{quote|The logico-epistemological wing in part sidestepped the critique by using the term ''citta-santāna'', "mind-stream", instead of ''ālaya-vijñāna'', for what amounted to roughly the same idea. It was easier to deny that a "stream" represented a reified self. On the other hand, the Tathāgatagarbha hybrid school was no stranger to the charge of smuggling notions of selfhood into its doctrines, since, for example, it explicitly defined the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as "permanent, pleasurable, ''self'', and pure (''nitya'', ''sukha'', ''ātman'', ''śuddha'')". Many Tathāgatagarbha texts, in fact, argue for the acceptance of selfhood (''ātman'') as a sign of higher accomplishment. The hybrid school attempted to conflate ''tathāgatagarbha'' with the ''ālaya-vijñāna''.&lt;ref name=Lusthaus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Jan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm|accessdate=12 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190312/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm|archivedate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transformations of consciousness===
The traditional interpretation of the eight consciousnesses may be discarded on the ground of a reinterpretation of Vasubandhu's works. According to Kalupahana, instead of positing such an consciousnesses, the Triṃśikaikākārikā describes the ''transformations'' of this consciousness:
{{quote|Taking ''vipaka'', ''manana'' and ''vijnapti'' as three different kinds of functions, rather than characteristics, and understanding ''vijnana'' itself as a function (''vijnanatiti vijnanam''), Vasubandhu seems to be avoiding any form of substantialist thinking in relation to consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}}}

These transformations are threefold:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}
{{quote|Whatever, indeed, is the variety of ideas of self and elements that prevails, it occurs in the transformation of consciousness. Such transformation is threefold, [namely,]{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=192, Trimsika verse 1}}}}

The first transformation results in the ''ālāya'':
{{quote|the resultant, what is called mentation, as well as the concept of the object. Herein, the consciousness called ''alaya'', with all its seeds, is the resultant.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=194, Trimsika verse 2}}}}

The ālāyavijñāna therefore is not an eighth consciousness, but the resultant of the transformation of consciousness:
{{quote|Instead of being a completely distinct category, ''alaya-vijnana'' merely represents the normal flow of the stream of consciousness uninterrupted by the appearance of reflective self-awareness. It is no more than the unbroken stream of consciousness called the life-process by the Buddha. It is the cognitive process, containing both emotive and co-native aspects of human experience, but without the enlarged egoistic emotions and dogmatic graspings characteristic of the next two transformations.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

The second transformation is ''manana'', self-consciousness or "Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}} According to the Lankavatara and later interpreters it is the seventh consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} It is "thinking" about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} The alaya is defiled by this self-interest;
{{quote|[I]t can be purified by adopting a non-substantialist (''anatman'') perspective and thereby allowing the ''alaya''-part (i.e. attachment) to dissipate, leaving consciousness or the function of being intact.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}}}}

The third transformation is ''viṣayavijñapti'', the "''concept'' of the object".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}} In this transformation the ''concept'' of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become "susceptible to grasping after the object":{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}}
{{quote|Vasubandhu is critical of the third transformation, not because it relates to the conception of an object, but because it generates grasping after a "real object" (''sad artha''), even when it is no more than a conception (''vijnapti'') that combines experience and reflection.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141-142}}}}

A similar perspective is give by [[Walpola Rahula]]. According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogācāra storehouse-consciousness are already found in the Pāli Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', ''manas'', and ''vijñāna'') as presented by Asaṅga are also mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
{{quote|Thus we can see that 'Vijñāna' represents the simple reaction or response of the sense organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the 'Vijñāna-skandha'. 'Manas' represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, conceiving ideas, etc. 'Citta' which is here called 'Ālayavijñāna', represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the Aggregate of consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of the past actions and all good and bad future possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Understanding in Buddhist Tradition==

===China===

==== Fǎzàng and Huayan ====
According to Thomas McEvilley, although Vasubandhu had postulated numerous ālāya-vijñāna-s, a separate one for each individual person in the parakalpita,{{refn|group=note|name="individual"}} this multiplicity was later eliminated in the [[Dharma character school|Fa Hsiang]] and [[Huayan school|Huayan]] metaphysics.{{refn|group=note|See also [[Buddha-nature#Popularisation in Chinese Buddhism]]}} These schools inculcated instead the doctrine of a single universal and eternal ālaya-vijñāna. This exalted enstatement of the ālāyavijñāna is described in the Fa Hsiang as "primordial unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq=Fa-hsiang+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQErVo&amp;sig=_ueayedFHrmyNbKIjqjxOhJ8Ojw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas McEvilley further argues that the presentation of the three natures by Vasubandhu is consistent with the Neo-platonist views of [[Plotinus]] and his universal 'One', 'Mind', and 'Soul'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA572&amp;lpg=PA572&amp;dq=Plotinian+Neoplatonism+Consciousness-Only+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQysSt&amp;sig=37KFY-9Sv6RKj-EmdXMpNxniNpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chán====
A core teaching of Chan/Zen Buddhism describes the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Wisdoms]].{{refn|group=note|It is found in Chapter 7 of the [[Platform Sutra]] of the Sixth Ancestor Zen Master [[Huineng]] and other Zen masters, such as [[Hakuin Ekaku]], in his work titled ''Keiso Dokuqui'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/hakuin1.html#1|title=Hakuin Ekaku (1685-1768). Selected  Writings|website=terebess.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hsu Yun|Xuyun]], in his work titled ''Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks'', Week 1, Fourth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsuyun.budismo.net/en/dharma/chan_sessions3.html|title=Master Hsu Yun (Xu Yun) - Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks|website=hsuyun.budismo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In this teaching, Buddhist practice is to turn the light of awareness around, from misconceptions regarding the nature of reality as being external, to kenshō, "directly see one's own nature".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Thus the Eighth Consciousness is transformed into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Seventh Consciousness into the Equality (Universal Nature) Wisdom, the Sixth Consciousness into the Profound Observing Wisdom, and First to Fifth Consciousnesses into the All Performing (Perfection of Action) Wisdom.

===Korea===
The [[Huayan#Interpenetration|Interpenetration]] (通達) and [[Essence-Function (體用)]] of [[Wonhyo]] (元曉) is described in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Treatise on Awakening Mahāyāna Faith]] (大乘起信論, ''Mahāyānaśraddhotpādaśāstra,'' AMF in the excerpt below):
{{quote|The author of the ''AMF'' was deeply concerned with the question of the respective origins of ignorance and enlightenment. If enlightenment is originally existent, how do we become submerged in ignorance? If ignorance is originally existent, how is it possible to overcome it? And finally, at the most basic level of mind, the ''alaya'' consciousness (藏識), is there originally purity or taint? The ''AMF'' dealt with these questions in a systematic and thorough fashion, working through the Yogacāra concept of the ''alaya'' consciousness. The technical term used in the ''AMF'' which functions as a metaphorical synonym for interpenetration is "permeation" or "perfumation (薫)," referring to the fact that defilement (煩惱) "perfumates" suchness (眞如), and suchness perfumates defilement, depending on the current condition of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Charles A. |title=The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa |work=Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University |number=3 |date=March 1995 |pages=33–48 |url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |accessdate=18 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Epistemological solipsism''' is the view that one can only be sure of the existence of ones mind. The existence of other minds and the external world is not necessarily rejected but one can not be sure of its existence.

==Overview==
Epistemological solipsists claim that [[Philosophical realism|realism]] [[begs the question]]: assuming there is a universe that is independent of the agent's mind, the agent can only ever know of this universe through the agent's [[senses]]. How is the existence of the independent universe to be scientifically studied? If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when they are not looking at it, then at best they determine that there is an image of the moon in the camera when they eventually look at it. Logically, this does not assure that the moon itself (or even the camera) existed at the time the photograph is supposed to have been taken. To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.

This relates to [[Kantian]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} transcendental aspects of the world, in which a new factor can be included, once it is clear that the current axioms neither support nor refute it. The continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice, are examples of possible transcendental decision points. Solipsism in its weak form is characterized by the repeated decision to not take transcendental steps, a logical minimalism. In its strong form, the denial of the existence of an argument for the existence of an independent universe may be justified in principle in an empirical manner. Whether the nonexistence of a proof means the nonexistence of the entity is a transcendental choice.{{Or|date=August 2011}}

'''François Jullien''' (born 2 June 1951 in Embrun, France) is a French philosopher, [[Hellenist]], and [[sinologist]].

== Biography ==
An alumnus of the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale Supérieure (Paris)]] and holder (since 1974) of the ''[[agrégation]]'', France's professorial degree, François Jullien studied Chinese language and thought at [[Peking University]] and [[Shanghai University]] from 1975 to 1977. He received his French university doctorate (''doctorat de troisième'' cycle) in 1978 and his French research doctorate (''doctorat d'État'') in Far East studies in 1983.

Since then Jullien has been head of the Antenne Française de Sinologie in Hong Kong (1978–1981), a guest of the Maison Franco-Japonaise in Tokyo (1985–1987), president of the Association Française d'Etudes Chinoises (1988–1990), director of the East Asia department (UFR) of [[Paris Diderot University|Paris Diderot University–Paris VII]] (1990–2000), president of the [[Collège International de Philosophie]] (1995–1998), professor at Paris Diderot University, and director of both the Institut de la Pensée Contemporaine and the Centre Marcel-Granet.

He was a senior member of the [[Institut Universitaire de France]] from 2001 to 2011 and is the current Chair of [[Alterity]] at the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme (Paris).

Jullien has edited several anthologies for the [[Presses Universitaires de France|Presses Universitaires de France (PUF)]] and for the Agenda de la Pensée Contemporaine, the latter published first by PUF, then by [[Éditions Hermann]].
Several conferences dealing with his philosophy have been held in France and abroad (Germany, Argentina, China, Vietnam). Among the most recent are:

* "Dérangements-aperçus: autour du travail de François Jullien" (conference proceedings published by Hermann, 2011), at Paris Diderot University and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] (December 2010)
* "Dialogue au sommet" with [[Chung-ying Cheng]] (proceedings published as ''Sixiang yu fangfa'', December 2014), at the [[Beijing Normal University]] (December 2012)
* "Des possibles de la pensée, l'itinéraire philosophique de François Jullien" (proceedings to be published by Hermann, 2015), in Cerisy-la-Salle (September 2013)
* A conference at the Academia Sinica, Taiwan (November 2013; proceedings to be published by the Academia Sinica in spring 2015)

Jullien received the [[Hannah Arendt Prize |Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought]] in Germany in 2010 and the Grand Prix de Philosophie of the [[Académie Française]] for his body of work in 2011.

[[Marcel Gauchet]] has summed up François Jullien's work in the following terms: "The work of François Jullien seems to me to follow the grand lines of the unwritten but oh-so-influential program of what I shall call the twentieth-century anthropological school. Primarily but not exclusively French, this school came to fruition in the work of [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]], [[Marcel Granet|Granet]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], and a few others as well. It is, in a word, the school of Western decentralization. [...] These various undertakings have made it possible for us to conceive of an "outside" ["''dehors''"], to borrow a particularly felicitous term from François Jullien. [ ... ] But François Jullien is not content to contribute to this most difficult of enterprises. He has brought the decentralization to its fulfilment, for he has turned it back on the West. In particular, he has done this in the field of philosophy, something no one had ever done before, and by taking on China's alterity, which, it must be said, provided a privileged standpoint. He has thus carried decentralization further than his predecessors. He has shown us how to look from 'elsewhere' at our most theoretical and abstract thought, dealing with the fundamental categories that allow us to apprehend any object spontaneously. He has become the ethnologist of our conceptual universe."&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, Marcel, Dérangements-Aperçus, autour du travail de François Jullien, Hermann, p. 174, 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jullien was awarded the Grand Prix de Philosophie of the Académie Française (2011), [[Angelo Rinaldi]] presented his work as follows: "The variety of subjects this philosopher-sinologist has taken on could lead one to imagine a scattershot oeuvre. On the contrary, there is in François Jullien's work a strong unity of thought and a clear progression. [[Pierre Nora]] sums it up in a phrase: the thought that lies between China and Greece. The purpose, indeed, is to consider the unthought-of in our thought, which has arisen on the foundations laid by Greece. To this end, China offers an oblique way in, a chance to redirect our gaze upon ourselves and see ourselves from without. The priority for François Jullien is to constitute this exteriority, and the remainder of his work consists of a reevaluation of the foundations of European thought. Awaiting us at the far end of this road are the general questions that interest us all directly: does 'the universal' exist, what might we hold in 'common,' what is the meaning of 'unity,' 'difference,' or 'conformity'? What we now call the 'dialogue of cultures' is clearly at the center of this philosopher's concerns, and it is this ever-present theme that makes him relevant for us today."

François Jullien is among the most translated of contemporary thinkers, with works appearing in some twenty-five countries. More than twenty of his essays have been translated into German, Italian, and Spanish, and a dozen have been translated into English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;http://francoisjullien.hypotheses.org/biographie/credits&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work and concepts ==

Since first establishing what he refers to as his philosophical construction yard (''chantier'') to explore the ''écart'' between Chinese and European thought François Jullien has been organizing a vis-à-vis between cultures, rather than comparing them, so as to map out a common field for reflection. His work has led him to examine such various disciplines as ethics, aesthetics, strategy, and the systems of thought (''pensées'') of both History and nature. The aim of this "deconstruction" from without (''du déhors'') is to detect buried biases, in both cultures, as well as to elucidate the unthought-of (''l'impensé'') in our thought. It serves also to bring out the resources (''ressources'') or fecundities (''fécondités'') of languages and cultures, rather than consider them from the perspective of their "difference" or "identity." Moreover, it launches philosophy anew by extricating it from the bog of its atavisms and purging it of facile notions (''évidences'').
The enterprise has not failed to raise hackles in both philosophical and Orientalist circles. Jullien has argued in response that the way to produce the common (''produire du commun'') is to put ''écarts'' to work. Because they establish distance, ''écarts'' bring out "''the between''" ("''l'entre''") and put our reflection into tension. "The similar" ("''le semblable''"), on the other hand, produces only what is uniform, which we then mistake for "universals."
Within this construction yard between the languages and systems of thought of China and Europe, Jullien has since developed a philosophy of "living" (''philosophie du "vivre"''). This marks a departure from Being, the major bias of Greek philosophy. The result is a general philosophy that unfolds (''se déploie'') as a philosophy of existence. Some of Jullien's recent developments in this area include reflections on intimacy ("''l'intime''") and "landscape" ("''paysage''").
For a survey of Jullien's work, see ''De l'Être au vivre, lexique euro-chinois de la pensée'', Gallimard, 2015.
The readership for Jullien's work has been expanding of late beyond the disciplines of Orientalism and philosophy.
The world of management has begun to adopt such concepts as situational potential (''potentiel de situation''), as opposed to "plans of action"; maturation (of conditions), as opposed to projected modelizations; and the initiation of silent transformations ("''transformations silencieuses''"), to induce change rather than impose it.
Cf. ''A Treatise on Efficacy'', 2004; ''Conférence sur l'efficacité'', 2005.
The world of psychology and analysis has begun to adopt the concept of "silent transformation" (cf. ''The Silent Transformations'', 2011); the distinction between the word and speech (cf. ''Si parler va sans dire'', 2006); and the concepts of the allusive (''l'allusif''), availability (''la disponibilité''), indirectness (''le biais''), and obliquity (''l'obliquité'') (cf. ''Cinq concepts proposés à la psychanalyse'', 2012).
The art world has begun to adopt the concepts of silent transformation; of the "great image" ("The great image has no form"); of soaring (''l'essor'') and slackness (''l'étale'') (slackness is what is determined, what has completely come to pass, and has therefore lost its effect; soaring is the upstream of the effect, when the effect is still occurring, still at work, and has not yet gone slack); of the frontal and the oblique (evocation, being oblique, might be preferable to representation, which is frontal: "paint the clouds so as to evoke the moon"); of coherence, as opposed to sense (if a work does not deliver a "sense," then is it not co-herence that confers the work's con-sistency, that makes it "hold together" as a work?); of the evasive, as opposed to the assignable); of the allusive, as opposed to the symbolic. The art world has also begun to adopt the concepts of the ''écart'' and the between (''l'entre''). Because it is based on distinction, difference specifies an essence and stores it away as knowledge. An ''écart'', however, establishes a distance and thus maintains a tension between the things it separates. Even while producing its disturbance, the ''écart'' brings forth a between, precisely because of the distance established. If the "between" is the thing of which ontology cannot conceive—because it has no in-itself: i.e., no essence—it is also the space through which [the thing] passes, or occurs: the space of the operatory and the effective.
Cf. ''In Praise of Blandness'', 1997; ''The Impossible Nude'', 2007; ''The Great Image Has No Form'', 2012; ''This Strange Idea of the Beautiful'', 2016.

== Criticism ==

François Jullien's work has been criticized by certain sinologists, chief among them [[Jean-François Billeter]]. The two principal texts published by Billeter against Jullien and his method are:
* "Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" This article attacks the book ''Procès ou création'' (1989). Jullien's reply appears in "Lecture ou projection: Comment lire (autrement) Wang Fuzhi?"
* ''Contre François Jullien'' (2006). This book attacks the entirety of Jullien's work. In response Jullien published ''Chemin faisant, connaître la Chine, relancer la philosophie'' (Seuil, 2007). In addition, Les Empêcheurs de Penser en Rond published an anthology of articles by several intellectuals, including Alain Badiou, titled ''Oser construire : Pour François Jullien'', and Jean-Hugues Larché (co-author with [[Philippe Sollers]]  of ''Nietzsche, miracle français'') produced a DVD titled ''Disponibilité de la pensée chinoise''.

=== Replies and Arguments ===

[[File:François Jullien président du FIG 2013.jpg|thumb|François Jullien at the [[International Geography Festival]] of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, October 2013]]
François Jullien's reply to the charge that he portrays China as "an alterity" appears in ''Chemin faisant, Connaître la Chine, relancer la philosophie''. There he argues that the unreferenced quotations used by Jean-François Billeter are fabrications and that Billeter attempts to construct an imaginary version of François Jullien's work to argue against. The crux of the matter for Jullien is that ''exteriority'' and ''alterity'' are not to be conflated.  China's exteriority, Jullien's point of departure, is, he argues, evident in its language as well as in its history, whereas alterity must be constructed and, as ''internal heterotopia'', is to be found in both Europe and China. Rather than relegate China to a separate, isolated world, Jullien claims to weave a problematics between China and Europe, a net that can then fish out an ''unthought-of'' (''un impensé'') and help create the conditions for a new ''reflexivity'' (''réflexivité'') between the two cultures.

Jullien has dealt with the question of criticizing Chinese ideology several times in his work: ''La Propension des choses'', chapter II; ''Le Détour et l'accès'', chapters I to VI; ''Un sage est sans idée'', final pages; etc. He thus separates himself from those who, out of fascination with strangeness or exoticism, have upheld the image of China as an "other." He separates himself also from those who, like Jean-François Billeter, permit themselves to dip into a "common fund" of thought and thus miss a chance to benefit from the diversity of human thought, which for Jullien is its true resource. He argues that we must reject both facile universalism (which springs from ethnocentrism) and lazy relativism (which leads to culturalism) in favor of a "dia-logue" of the two cultures: the "dia" of the ''écart'', which reveals the fecundity of multiple lines of thought, and the "logos," which allows these lines to communicate through a common intelligence.

For a collective reply to the criticism of Jean-François Billeter, see ''Oser construire, Pour François Jullien'', with notable contributions from Philippe d'Iribarne, Jean Allouche, Jean-Marie Schaeffer, Wolfgang Kubin, Du Xiaozhen, Léon Vandermeersch, Bruno Latour, Paul Ricœur, and Alain Badiou.

'''''God's Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science''''' is a book by [[James Hannam]] which rebuts "the idea ‘that there was no science worth mentioning in the Middle Ages … [and] that the Church held back what meagre advances were made’."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Jones,  [http://images.spectator.co.uk/books/5258628/the-new-age-of-enlightenment.thtml The New Age of Enlightenment], review of James Hannam, ''God's Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science'', in ''The Spectator'', 15 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hannam argues that "medieval scholars overturned the false wisdom of [[ancient Greece]] to lay the foundations of [[modern science]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jameshannam.com/index.htm Book website]&lt;/ref&gt; The book rebuts a number of modern canards about [[Medieval Christianity]], such as:
* the idea that the pope tried to suppress the number [[zero]] or stop doctors from learning about anatomy through [[dissection]] of human corpses
* the idea that people in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]] thought the earth was flat (see [[Myth of the Flat Earth]])
He lists 13th century inventions such as [[glasses|spectacles]], the [[clock|mechanical clock]], and the [[windmill]].

The book was published in the UK in 2009 by Icon Books Ltd. ({{ISBN|978-1848310704}}) and is included in the short list for the [[Royal Society Prize for Science Books]] in 2010.  The US edition was published in 2011 by [[Regnery Press]] under the title '''''The Genesis of Science: How the Christian Middle Ages Launched the Scientific Revolution'''''. In 2011 the book was shortlisted for the Dingle Prize of the [[British Society for the History of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bshs.org.uk/prizes/dingle-prize BSHS Dingle Prize's webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6850">'''The Group on International Perspectives on Governmental Aggression and Peace''' [http://people.bu.edu/gipgap/ (GIPGAP)] is an international multi-disciplinary team of academics and researchers. The group has been undertaking extensive research into social attitudes to [[peace]] and [[war]], using the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, or PAIRTAPS. There is no shortage of critical literature on peace and war. However this is the first-ever global study of the attitudes of ordinary citizens to peace and war. GIPGAP is co-ordinated by [[Kathleen Malley-Morrison]] of [[Boston University]], and has its origins in an earlier group that investigated [[domestic violence]] within a project entitled International Perspectives on Family Violence and Abuse. The GIPGAP project involves surveying and analysis of the views of citizens from more than 30 countries —covering [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Western Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], the [[Asia Pacific]], [[South Asia]], [[Australia]], and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Research Instrument==
The basic research instrument, the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, is an online survey, utilizing aspects of both [[qualitative research]] and [[quantitative research]]. Respondents are encouraged to indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with certain propositions and the instrument also encourages respondents to make specific comment upon issues. The survey is available to respondents in a range of language versions, including English, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese.

==Research Findings==
Preliminary findings for individual countries can be found in the publications list and especially the 4-volume publication in 2009 by Praeger International. In general, there was disapproval for the notion that nations should have a right to invade other nations, disapproval for the use of torture, disapproval for the killing of [[civilians]], approval for the right to protest war, and tentative approval for the notion of a right to peace.  Women were very much in support of the notion of the right of children to grow up in a world of peace. Further research, analysis and scholarly publication is planned for the future.

'''Henrik Steffens''' (2 May 1773 – 13 February 1845), was a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born Danish [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Science|scientist]], and [[Poetry|poet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://literaturkritik.de/zwischen-elektrisiermaschine-elysium-zur-romantischen-nachbarschaft-literatur-naturforschung,23552.html|title=Zwischen Elektrisiermaschine und Elysium: Zur romantischen Nachbarschaft von Literatur und Naturforschung -  : literaturkritik.de|last=literaturkritik.de|first=Von Redaktion|website=literaturkritik.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=m54s4QqpM0UC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=Henrik+Steffens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPrNKtn9rVAhVGDMAKHcfEDPQQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Henrik%20Steffens&amp;f=false|title=Kierkegaard and His Danish Contemporaries: Philosophy, politics and social theory|last=Stewart|first=Jon Bartley|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754668725|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=P405AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henrik+Steffens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPrNKtn9rVAhVGDMAKHcfEDPQQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Henrik%20Steffens&amp;f=false|title=Beyträge zur innern Naturgeschichte der Erde|last=Steffens|first=Henrik|date=1801|publisher=Craz|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and lectures==
He was born at [[Stavanger, Norway]].  At the age of fourteen he went with his parents to [[Copenhagen]], where he studied [[theology]] and [[natural science]]. In 1796 he lectured at the [[University of Kiel]], and two years later went to the [[University of Jena]] to study the natural philosophy of [[Friedrich Schelling]]. He went to [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg]] in 1800, and there came under the influence of [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]].

After two years he returned to Copenhagen, and is said to have introduced [[German romanticism]] to Denmark in 1802 with nine lectures given at [[Elers Kollegium]], later published as ''Indledning til philosophiske Forelæsninger'' (''Introduction to Philosophical Lectures''). These lectures were a great success and a source of inspiration in Danish [[romanticism]].  They were attended by many who later became leading Danish thinkers, such as [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger|Oehlenschläger]] and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] was so much struck by their excellence that he endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain for Steffens a chair in the new [[Berlin University]] in 1804, in order that his own ethical teachings should be supported in the scientific department.

==Professorship and theories==
Despite&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps because of&amp;nbsp;– the deep impact made by his lectures, Steffens was not made welcome by the Danish authorities.  He moved back to Germany and took up a professorship at the [[University of Halle]] in 1804, to return to Denmark only occasionally. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]] (1813) he enlisted in the [[Royal Prussian Army of the Napoleonic Wars|Prussian Army]] as a [[second lieutenant]], and he was present at the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|capture of Paris]] the following year. He was professor of physics at [[Breslau]] from 1811 until 1832, when he accepted an invitation to [[Berlin]].

Steffens was one of the so-called "Philosophers of Nature", a friend and adherent of Schelling and of Schleiermacher. More than either of these two thinkers he was acquainted with the discoveries of modern science, and was thus able to correct or modify the highly imaginative speculations of Schelling. He held that, throughout the scheme of nature and intellectual life, the main principle is [[Individual]]isation. As organisms rise higher in the scale of development, the sharper and more distinct become their outlines, the more definite their individualities. This principle he endeavoured to deduce from his knowledge of [[geology]], in contrast to [[Lorenz Oken]], who developed the same theory on biological grounds. His influence was considerable, and both Schelling and Schleiermacher modified their theories in deference to his scientific deductions.

His chief scientific and philosophical works are:
*''Beiträge zur inneren Naturgeschichte der Erde'' (1801)
*''Grundzuge der philosophischen Naturwissenschaft'' (1806)
*''Anthropologie'' (1824)
*''Ueber die idee der Universitäten'' (1835)
*''Ueber geheime Verbindungen auf Universitaten'' (1835)
*''Karikaturen des Heiligsten'' (1819–1821)
*''Wie ich wieder Lutheraner wurde und was mir das Luthertum ist'' (1831)
*''Von tIer falschen Theolegie und dem wahren Glauben'' (new ed., 1831)
*''Die Familien Walseth'' and ''Leith'' (1827)
*''Die vier Norweger'' (1828)
*''Malcolm'' (1831)

During the last five years of his life he wrote an autobiography, ''Was ich erlebte'', and after his death his ''Nachgelassene Schriften'' (1846) was published. See Tietzen, ''Zur Erinnerung an Steffens''; Petersen, ''Henrik Steffens'' (German translation, 1884); Dilthey, ''Leben Schleiermachers''.

==Legacy==
The '''Henrik Steffens Professor''', a named [[chair (academic)|chair]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in the field of [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], is funded by the [[Government of Norway]] and administered jointly by the Humboldt University and the [[University of Oslo]]. The professorship was established in connection with the [[state visit]] of German President [[Roman Herzog]] in Norway in 1998, on the initiative of [[Lucy Smith]], the Rector of the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/geschichte/rektoren/steffens Henrik Steffens], Humboldt University&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the professorship is to promote academic cooperation between Norway and Germany in the fields of humanities and social sciences, "in the spirit of Henrik Steffens." It is one of the nine named chairs at the Humboldt University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2008/04/henrik-steffens-norges-bortblaaste-laurbaerblad.html Henrik Steffens - Norges bortblåste laurbærblad], ''Uniforum''&lt;/ref&gt;

The professorship is hosted by the Department of Northern European Studies at the Humboldt University, which is located near [[Unter den Linden]]. The department also hosts the [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] Professorship, which is funded by the Swedish government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ni.hu-berlin.de/de/institut/struktur/fachteile_html Struktur des Nordeuropa-Institutes]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Aguéli''' (born ''John Gustaf Agelii'') (May 24, 1869 – October 1, 1917) also named '''[[Sheikh]] 'Abd al-Hādī 'Aqīlī''' ({{lang-ar|'''شيخ عبد الهادی عقیلی'''}}) upon his conversion to Islam, was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] wandering [[Sufi]], painter and author. As a devotee of [[Ibn Arabi]], his metaphysics applied to the study of [[batin (Islam)|Islamic esoterism]] and its similarities with other esoteric traditions of the world. He was the initiator of [[René Guénon]] into [[Sufism]]&lt;ref&gt;Waterfield, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the Parisian ''Al Akbariyya'' society. His art was a unique form of [[:wikt:miniature|miniature]] [[Post-Impressionism]] where he used the blend of colours to create a sense of depth and distance. His unique style of art made him one of the founders of the Swedish contemporary art movement.

==Childhood and youth==
Ivan Aguéli was born ''John Gustaf Agelii'' in the small [[Sweden|Swedish]] town of [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]] in 1869, the son of [[veterinary|veterinarian]] ''Johan Gabriel Agelii''. Through his mother, he was related to the 18th century Swedish [[metaphysician]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Laude]], ''Universal Dimensions of Islam: Studies in Comparative Religion'', World Wisdom (2011), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1879–1889 Aguéli conducted his studies in [[Gotland]] and [[Stockholm]]. Early on in his youth he began showing an exceptional artistic talent and a keen interest in religious [[mysticism]].

In 1889 he adopted the name Ivan Aguéli and travelled to [[Paris]] where he became the student of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]. Before returning to Sweden in 1890 he made a detour to [[London]], where he met the [[Russia]]n [[anarchist]] scholar [[Kropotkin|Prince Kropotkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gauffin I, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Stockholm in 1890 he attended art school in [[Stockholm]] where he was taught by the Swedish artists [[Anders Zorn]] and [[Richard Bergh]]. By the end of 1892 he again returned to Paris where he learnt to know the French poet and animal-rights activist [[Marie Huot]] (1846–1930). Active in [[French anarchist]] circles he was in 1894 arrested and put on trial in the "[[Trial of the thirty]]". Within months of his release in 1895 he left France for Egypt, where he lived until he returned to Paris in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Gauffin I, pp.131&lt;/ref&gt; It was later on in Paris that Aguéli ended up converting to [[Islam]] and adopted the name '''Abd al-Hadi''.

In 1899 he travelled to [[Colombo]] (in today's [[Sri Lanka]]), again returning to France in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Gauffin II, pp.42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
In 1902 Aguéli moved to [[Cairo]] and became one of the first Western Europeans to be officially enrolled at [[Al-Azhar University]], where he studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gauffin II, pp.121&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 he was also initiated into the al-'Arabiyya [[Shadhili]]yya Sufi order by the great Egyptian Shaykh 'Abd al-Rahman Ilaysh al-Kabir (1840–1921).&lt;ref&gt;Almqvist, pp.17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

With the blessing of Shaykh Ilaysh, Aguéli and an [[Italy|Italian]] journalist and fellow-convert named Enrico Insabato (1878–1963) founded and contributed to an Italian magazine published in Cairo (1904–1913) named [[Il Convito]] (Arabic: ''An-Nadi'').

==Al Akbariyya==
{{distinguish|text=Ibn Arabi's [[Akbariyya]] school of Sufism}}
Ivan Aguéli founded ''Al Akbariyya'' as a secret [[Sufi]] society in [[Paris]] in 1911. Among its first members was [[René Guénon]]. Its purpose was to promote the teachings of [[Ibn Arabi|Muhyeddin Ibn al-Arabi]] among the "scholarly, educated and freethinking classes..."&lt;ref name=Gauffin1940&gt;{{cite book|last=Gauffin |first=Axel |title=Ivan Aguéli – Människan, mystikern, målaren |volume=2 |publisher=Sveriges Allmänna Konstförenings Publikation |year=1940 |language=Swedish |pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the practice of the [[Shadhili]] and [[Malamatiyya|Malamati]] Sufi paths. The only time this society is mentioned is in a letter written by Aguéli in September 1911 to an unknown address in [[Cairo]] announcing its founding,&lt;ref name=Gauffin1940/&gt; not much more is known.

==First World War and Spain==
Suspected to be an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] spy he was expelled to Spain in 1916. Stranded in Spain, Aguéli lacked the funds to continue back to Sweden. In Spain, Aguéli was left without money to return to Sweden and on October 1, 1917 he was killed by a train at a rail crossing in the village of [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] outside [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Brummer, pp.63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aguéli's death, Prince [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Eugen Bernadotte]], who was known as a patron of artists, made certain to return his paintings and belongings to Sweden.

==Aguéli's heritage==
[[File:Sala fontän bild 3.JPG|thumb| The Fountain of Ivan Aguéli in [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]].]]
In Sweden, Aguéli is admired as a celebrated contemporary painter. Most of his paintings are found at the [[Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Moderna Museet|Museum of Modern Art]] and the Aguéli Museum in Sala.

Aguélis prominence in Sweden was clearly shown in 1969 when, at the centenary of his birth, six of his paintings were printed as [[Postage stamp|stamps]] by the [[Posten (Sweden)|Swedish Postal Service]].

Aguéli's remains were kept in Barcelona, Spain until 1981, when he was brought back to Sweden and re-buried with Islamic rites in his hometown of Sala.

The Aguéli Museum in Sala has the largest collection of his artworks, donated by Sala's well-known [[physician]] Carl Friberg to [[Nationalmuseum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1200">'''Jing''' ({{zh|s=敬|t=敬|p=Jìng}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] which is typically translated as "reverence." It is often used by [[Confucius]] in the term ''gōngjìng'' ({{zh|恭敬}}), meaning "respectful reverence". The Confucian notion of respect has been likened to the later, western [[Immanuel Kant#Moral philosophy|Kantian]] notion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Robin S., "Respect", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/respect/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For Confucians, ''jìng'' requires ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'', or righteousness, and a proper observation of rituals (''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]''). To have ''jìng'' is vitally important in the maintenance of ''[[xiào]]'', or filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;Richey, J. (2005). Confucius, in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3130">'''Johann Adam Bergk''' (1769 – 1834, [[Leipzig]]) was a German philosopher and publicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Schmidt | first= James | year=2006 | contribution=Bergk, Johann Adam | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergk was professor of philosophy and jurisprudence at the [[University of Leipzig]]. A Kantian, he defended the French revolution in his ''Untersuchungen aus dem Natur-, Staats- und Völkerrechte'' (1796) and translated [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]] into German.

During the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation of [[Saxony]] he frequently came into conflict with the French censorship, e.g. his journal  "''Der europäische Aufseher''" (i.e. ''The European Guard'') was banned.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Buttkereit, ''Zensur und Öffentlichkeit in Leipzig 1806-1813'' (= Kommunikationsgeschichte, 28), Münster 2009, pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the father of the philologist [[Theodor Bergk]].

'''José Pablo Feinmann''' (born 10 March 1943) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] philosopher, writer, [[playwright]] and TV host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mertin-litag.de/authors_htm/Feinmann-J.htm José Pablo Feinmann]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in a [[Jewish Argentine]] family{{Verify source|date=May 2017}}, Feinmann was a militant of the [[Peronist Youth]] during the 1970s, considering [[peronism]] as a real [[mass movement]] with the potential to change the country for better. Nevertheless, he always opposed to the principle of armed violence to achieve political ends, and thus criticized the [[Foco]] theory of [[Che Guevara]] which, years after the [[Cuban Revolution]], became popular in some sectors of the leftist peronism ([[Montoneros]], [[Peronist Armed Forces]]). Feinmann abandoned peronism in the 1990s, during the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[neoliberal]] government of [[Carlos Menem]]. He later became a supporter of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] peronist president [[Cristina Fernandez]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">'''Judicial deference''' is the condition of a court yielding or submitting its judgment to that of another legitimate party, such as the [[executive branch]] in the case of [[National security|national defense]]. It is most commonly found in countries, such as the United Kingdom, which lack an [[constitution#Entrenchment|entrenched constitution]], as the essential purpose of such documents is to limit the power of the [[legislature]].

== United Kingdom ==
In ''Regina v. Director of Public Prosecutions Ex Parte Kebeline and Others'' [1999], [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]] explained that courts should "defer, on democratic grounds, to the considered opinion of the elected body as to where the balance is to be struck between the rights of the individual and the needs of society". Nevertheless, the doctrine has been criticised for representing a way in which the courts should act obediently to the [[British Parliament]] to uphold the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].

However, any suggestions that the [[House of Lords]] was being unduly servile to Parliament were overturned by ''A v Home Secretary'' [2005]. In the case, detainees imprisoned without charge under section 23 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]], on the grounds that they posed a threat to national security, appealed successfully against their detention. The court held that the powers of detention without charge had discriminatory impact (Articles 5 and 14 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]).

== United States ==
There are some examples of judicial deference in the United States, despite its entrenched constitution. For example, in [[immigration law]], the [[judiciary]] has historically sought to allow the explicit constitutional authority of the [[US Congress]]. An example is [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''Fiallo v. Bell'' (1977).

The same restraint is requested in [[foreign affairs]] as [[justiciability|not-judicable]] matters,&lt;ref&gt;Kirk A. Randazzo, ''Defenders of Liberty or Champions of Security? Federal Courts, the Hierarchy of Justice, and U.S. Foreign Policy'', 1438430477, 9781438430478, SUNY Press 	2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to safeguard the executive branch.

'''Justice''' is one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] in classical European philosophy and Roman Catholicism. It is the moderation or mean between [[selfishness]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] – between having more and having less than one's fair share.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice is closely related, in Christianity, to the practice of [[Charity (virtue)]] because it regulates the relationships with others.  It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is "pivotal", because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues.

==Early developments==
According to Aristotle, "Justice consists in a certain equality by which the just and definite claim of another, neither more nor less, is satisfied."&lt;ref name=Slater/&gt;

This is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights:  two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other. Aristotle developed the idea of [[Equity (law)|equity]] to cover irregular cases so that "the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] saw Justice as existing on four different planes or levels, rising from the everyday political virtue at the lowest to the Archetypal Form of Justice at the highest.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image'' (1976) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor.&lt;ref name=ccc1807&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1807]&lt;/ref&gt; In Colossians 4:1 St. Paul counsels "Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, realizing that you too have a Master in heaven." 
 
In Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm Slater, Thomas. "Justice." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aristotle]]'s wake,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their [[moral rights|moral]] and [[legal rights|legal]] rights to do, possess, or exact.&lt;ref&gt;D. Manuel Jr, ''Contemporary Social Philosophy'' (nd) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Justice toward God is called the "[[Religion (virtue)|virtue of religion]]".&lt;ref name=ccc1807/&gt;

==Modern developments==
With the [[Late modernity|late modern]] rise in interest in [[virtue ethics]], a new interest in articulating the virtue of justice has emerged. [[John Rawls]] saw justice as the typical virtue of the institution; [[Irene van Staveren]] saw it as that of the state, marked by such indicators as votes, legitimacy, public fairness and distributive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deidre McCloskey]], ''The Bourgeois Virtues'' (2007) p. 286 and p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Moral justice has been linked to the sixth and highest of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Nucci, ''Handbook of Moral and Character Education'' (2008) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]ians consider that in the unconscious the image of the Father embodies a stern but fair justice;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychooanalysis'' (1976) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jung]]ians similarly see the [[archetype]] of the King as representing the right ordering of society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly/M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[Dante]] made Justice the virtue of his sixth heaven (the sphere of Jupiter), and illustrated it through such martial figures as [[Joshua]] and [[Roland]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Philip Sydney]] wrote of "justice the chief of virtues";&lt;ref&gt;Sidney, ''A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] devoted the fifth book of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wallace Stevens]] rejected what he called "galled Justicia/Trained to poise the tables of the law" as part of the obsolete images of the past, and favoured instead the [[modernist]] seeking out of new ruling images – new "sovereigns of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katarina Majerhold''' (born May 20th, 1971) is an acclaimed [[Slovenia]]n [[philosopher]], writer, screenwriter, lecturer and editor. She is particularly interested in [[philosophy]] of emotions, especially in philosophy of love and sexuality, happiness, philosophical counseling and [[ethics]]. She has been the only Slovenian philosopher who had her own philosophical counseling column in the magazine O osebnosti (2007-2010) and in the biggest Slovenian newspaper, online version Delo.si. She also wrote numerous articles on philosophical counseling. In 2017 she got certificate for philosophical counseling by acclaimed Canadian philosophical counselor and professor Peter Raabe.  

She published her article History of Love in US Internet Philosophy Encyclopedia http://www.iep.utm.edu/love-his/. She has been a member of the US Society for the Philosophy of sex + love since 2000: https://philosophyofsexandlove.org/members/.

Majerhold is currently an independent [[researcher]] and [[writer]] of philosophy, screenwriter and editor. She previously worked at the Slovenian Educational Research Institute where she held the rank of a young researcher/assistant and worked on higher education for many years. In that time she wrote and edited three important books on Slovenian higher education (University and Its Autonomy (1999),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/univerza-plese-avtonomno-prispevki-k-repertoarju-univerze-za-tretje-tisocletje/oclc/442334536]&lt;/ref&gt; University and Its Power (2001), Does University Need Its Social Environment (2003)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Ali_univerza_potrebuje_socialno_okolje.html?id=l9-RAAAACAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; Ljubljana, Študentska založba). 

She was editor-in chief of international scientific review Andragoška spoznanja (Andragogic Perspectives) (2008-2011), she was a member of the editorial board of the magazine Sodobnost (Contemporary) (2002-2012) and she has been an editorial board member of the international scientific magazine JKC (1998-).

In her early career as a philosopher of love she mostly worked on learning of the western concepts of [[love]] and which prevailing concept of love each period in history offered ([[Empedocles]]' Love (Eros) and Strife (Neikos), [[Plato]]'s Eros and Aristotle's Philia, [[St. Paul]]'s Agape and [[St. Augustine]] Caritas, [[Rousseau]]'s notion of a modern romantic pair of Email and Sophie, [[Freud]]'s love as transference and [[Nussbaum]]'s compassionate, reciprocal, erotic and individual love). However, this does not mean that each representative concept of the period speaks of a totally new or innovative concept of love, many of them are interdependent and/or modification of the other. However, in the last few years she has started developing her own concept of love as an art work (i.e. installation), imagining love as innovative, democratic, individual, and common process at the same time.

Her dedication to love is seen in numerous articles she wrote about the topic, such as love and happiness, love and gift, love and art, love and truth, love and politics, love: top-down or bottom-up and alike in the scholarly magazines at home and abroad. However, she did not write not only articles but also books on love, sexuality and emotions: Love in Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psihopolis.edu.rs/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=98:ljubav-u-filozofiji&amp;Itemid=125]&lt;/ref&gt;(from Plato to Freud, Psihopolis, Novi Sad 2012), Living &lt;ref&gt;[http://cobiss.izum.si/scripts/cobiss?command=DISPLAY&amp;base=COBIB&amp;RID=260372480]&lt;/ref&gt;(Koda, Študentska založba, Ljubljana 2012), Love Through History (Mladinska knjiga, Ljubljana 2014), Love, Its Origin and Modifications Through Time (Založba Obzorja, Maribor, 2016), Čustveni izzivi (Rokus-Klett, Ljubljana, 2017). She wrote article The Gift in What Philosophy Can Tell You About Your Lover &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/What-Philosophy-Tell-About-Lover/dp/0812697634]&lt;/ref&gt;(Open Court, Chicago and LaSalle, Illinois, 2012).

She also does art, especially writing screenplays for documentaries and films through which she tries to convey her knowledge and experiences in the area of love, sexuality, happiness and play (she is the author of documentaries, such as Love; Emotions, fabrics of our lives; The Future of Clothing, Attraction of Gender 2008–2015, Radio-television Slovenia. She prepares her first film). 
She has been writing reviews of LB-films and TV-and web series for LGBT-magazine and Blog Narobe since 2008. She occasionally writes about LGBT-films for Slovenian film magazines, such as Ekran and Kino! In 2018 she created her own website LL-Passion where she publishes philosophical essays, reviews of LB-films, TV- and web-series, she also publishes interviews with either LB-women (artists, editors, researchers, humanists) or women who work in the LGBT-area. She combined her work on LGBT-rights with Unesco OER chair at Institute Jožef Štefan in a project Unesco OER for vulnerable groups (2017-2018). She worked for Slovenian LGBT-organization (2016-2018).

She is all about philosophy with heart (love), humour and joy. Majerhold is also a [[humanitarian]], and dedicates her time, knowledge and energy to people in need. She also fights for animal rights, she is a vegan, occasionally vegetarian. Her dedication to sustainable development and sustainable mobility is seen in her numerous articles at website Zeleni PR (Green PR).

Karenga was active in the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and co-founded with [[Hakim Jamal]] the [[black nationalism]] and social change organization [[US Organization|US]].

Born in [[Parsonsburg, Maryland]] to an African-American family, Karenga studied at [[Los Angeles City College]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During his student years, he involved himself in activism and joined the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Through his activism, he became involved in violent clashes with the [[Black Panther Party]]. In 1971, he was convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment. He was imprisoned in [[California Men's Colony]] until he received parole in 1974. He received his PhD shortly afterward and began a career in academia.

==Early life==
'''Ron Everett''' was born in [[Parsonsburg, Maryland]], the fourteenth child and seventh son in the family. His father was a [[tenant farmer]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister who employed the family to work fields under an effective [[sharecropping]] arrangement.&lt;ref name="fightingforus"&gt;{{cite book|first=Scot|last=Brown|date=2003|title=Fighting for US|isbn=978-0-8147-9878-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett moved to Los Angeles in 1959, joining his older brother who was a teacher there, and attended [[Los Angeles City College]] (LACC). He became active with civil rights organizations [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), took an interest in African studies, and was elected as LACC's first African-American student president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Cele C.|editor1-last=Otnes|editor2-first=Tina M.|editor2-last=Lowrey|title=Contemporary Consumption Rituals|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After earning his associate degree, he [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) and earned BA and MA degrees in [[political science]]. He studied [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Arabic]] and other African-related subjects. Among his influences at UCLA were Jamaican anthropologist and [[Négritude|Negritudist]] Councill Taylor who contested the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] view of alien cultures as primitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Maulana|last=Karenga|interviewer=Elston L. Carr|title=UCLA Center for African American Studies, Oral History Program|publisher=University of California|publication-date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he took the name ''Karenga'' (Swahili for "keeper of tradition") and the title ''[[Mawlānā|Maulana]]'' (Swahili-Arabic for "master teacher").&lt;ref name="fightingforus"/&gt;

==1960s activism==
===US Organization===
{{Main|US Organization}}
The [[Watts riots]] broke out when Karenga was a year into his doctoral studies. Karenga and the Circle of Seven established a community organization in the aftermath called US (meaning "Us black people").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayes, III | first = Floyd W. | last2 = Jeffries | first2 = Judson L. | title = Us Does Not Stand for United Slaves! | journal = Black Power in the Belly of the Beast | pages = 74–5 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | place = Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization joined in several community revival programs and was featured in press reports. Karenga cited [[Malcolm X]]'s [[Organization of Afro-American Unity|Afro-American Unity]] program as an influence on the US organization's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Malcolm was the major African American thinker that influenced me in terms of nationalism and Pan-Africanism. As you know, towards the end, when Malcolm is expanding his concept of Islam, and of nationalism, he stresses Pan-Africanism in a particular way. And he argues that, and this is where we have the whole idea that cultural revolution and the need for revolution, he argues that we need a cultural revolution, he argues that we must return to Africa culturally and spiritually, even if we can’t go physically. And so that’s a tremendous impact on US.&lt;ref name="Malcolm X and Karenga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=378&amp;category=educationMakers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519030531/http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=378&amp;category=educationMakers|archivedate=May 19, 2003|publisher="The History Makers"|title=Maulana Karenga Malcolm X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As racial disturbances spread across the country, Karenga appeared at a series of [[black power]] conferences, joining other groups in urging the establishment of a separate political structure for African-Americans.{{Citation needed|date= December 2017}} US developed a youth component with para-military aspects called the Simba Wachanga which advocated and practiced community self-defense and service to the masses.{{Citation needed|date= December 2017}}

In 1966, Karenga founded the newspaper [[Harambee (African-American newspaper)|Harambee]], which started as a newsletter for US and  eventually became the newspaper for the Los Angeles Black Congress, an umbrella organization for several groups.&lt;ref&gt;Scot Brown, US: Maulana Karenga, the US Organization, and Black Cultural Nationalism, NYU Press, 2003,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kwanzaa===
[[File:Kwanza-RonKarenga.jpg|thumb|300px|Karenga, center, with wife Tiamoyo at left, celebrating Kwanzaa at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] on December 12, 2003.]]
Karenga created [[Kwanzaa]] in 1966&lt;ref name="Kwanzaa Date"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00B1EFD395C0C738FDDAB0994DB484D81|work=[[The New York Times]]"|title=The Evening Hours|date=December 30, 1983 |access-date=2006-12-15 | first=Ron | last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the first pan-African holiday. Karenga said his goal was to "give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.brookhavencourier.com/media/storage/paper807/news/2008/11/24/News/Kwanzaa.Celebrates.Culture.Principles-3560412.shtml Kwanzaa celebrates culture, principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708095122/http://media.www.brookhavencourier.com/media/storage/paper807/news/2008/11/24/News/Kwanzaa.Celebrates.Culture.Principles-3560412.shtml |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kwanzaa is inspired by African "[[First Fruits (Southern Africa)|first fruit" traditions]], and the name chosen is from [[Swahili language|Swahili]], "matunda ya kwanza."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGCOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|title=Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition|last=Mayes|first=Keith A.|date=2009-09-10|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135284008|location=|pages=84|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals of the holiday promote African traditions and ''Nguzo Saba'', the "seven principles of African Heritage" that Karenga described as "a [[communitarian]] African philosophy":
* Umoja (unity)—To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.

* Kujichagulia (self-determination)—To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.

* Ujima (collective work and responsibility)—To build and maintain our community together and make our brother's and sister's problems our problems and to solve them together.

* [[Ujamaa]] (cooperative economics)—To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.

* Nia (purpose)—To make our collective vocation the building and development of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.

* Kuumba (creativity)—To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.

* Imani (faith)—To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

==Criminal convictions and imprisonment==

In 1971, Karenga was sentenced to one to ten years in prison on counts of felonious assault and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="dart"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Scholer | first=J. Lawrence | journal=[[The Dartmouth Review]] | title=The Story of Kwanzaa | date=January 15, 2001 | url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/767.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims gave testimony of how Karenga and other men tortured her and another woman. The woman described having been stripped and beaten with an electrical cord. Karenga's estranged wife, Brenda Lorraine Karenga, testified that she sat on the other woman’s stomach while another man forced water into her mouth through a hose.

A May 14, 1971, article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the testimony of one of the women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Deborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis' mouth and placed against Miss Davis' face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters.&lt;ref name="karengatortured"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Karenga Tortured Women Followers, Wife Tells Court | date=May 13, 1971 | page=3 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/698873952.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+13%2C+1971&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281923-Current+File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=3&amp;desc=Karenga+Tortured+Women+Followers%2C+Wife+Tells+Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jones and Brenda Karenga testified that Karenga believed the women were conspiring to poison him, which Davis has attributed to a combination of ongoing police pressure and his own [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name="fightingforus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Swanson | first=Perry | journal=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]] | title=Backers say past of founder doesn’t diminish Kwanzaa | date=November 22, 2006 | url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/karenga-19049-kwanzaa-times.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karenga denied any involvement in the torture, and argued that the prosecution was political in nature.&lt;ref name="fightingforus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halisi, Clyde (1972), "Maulana Ron Karenga: Black Leader in Captivity". ''Black Scholar'', May, pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned at the [[California Men's Colony]], where he studied and wrote on feminism, [[Pan-Africanism]] and other subjects. The US organization fell into disarray during his absence and was disbanded in 1974. After he petitioned several black state officials to support his parole on fair sentencing grounds, it was granted in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whatever happened to... Ron Karenga|journal=Ebony|date=September 1975|volume=30|number=11|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karenga has declined to discuss the convictions with reporters and does not mention them in biographical materials.&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; During a 2007 appearance at [[Wabash College]], he again denied the charges and described himself as a former political prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brandon|last=Stewart|date=December 1, 2007|title=The Story of Ron Karenga, Kwanzaa's Founder|url=http://www.wabashunion.org/dec2007/the-story-of-ron-karenga-kwanzaa’s-founder|location=Wabash Conservative Union|access-date=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
After his parole Karenga re-established the US organization under a new structure. He was awarded his first PhD in 1976 from United States International University (now known as [[Alliant International University]]) for a 170-page dissertation entitled "Afro-American Nationalism: Social Strategy and Struggle for Community". Later in his career, in 1994, he was awarded a second Ph.D., in social ethics, from the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), for an 803-page dissertation entitled "Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics."

In 1977, he formulated a set of principles called ''[[Kawaida]]'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for [[wikt:normal|normal]]. Karenga called on African Americans to adopt his [[secular humanism]] and reject other practices as [[mythology|mythical]] (Karenga 1977, pp.&amp;nbsp;14, 23, 24, 27, 44–5).{{Request quotation|date=December 2012}}

Karenga chairs the [[Africana Studies]] Department at [[California State University, Long Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/africanastudies/faculty-and-staff/ Africana Studies website] and [http://www.maulanakarenga.org/ Official Website], both accessed November 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the director of the Kawaida Institute for Pan African Studies and the author of several books, including his "Introduction to Black Studies", a comprehensive Black/African Studies [[textbook]] now in its fourth edition.{{Citation needed|date= December 2017}} He is also known for having co-hosted, in 1984, a conference that gave rise to the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations, and in 1995, he sat on the organizing committee and authored the mission statement of the [[Million Man March]].{{Citation needed|date= December 2017}}

Karenga delivered a eulogy at the 2001 funeral service of [[New Black Panther Party]] leader [[Khalid Abdul Muhammad]], praising him for his organizing activities and commitment to black empowerment.

In 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Maulana Karenga on his list of ''[[100 Greatest African Americans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). ''100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia''. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-963-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthologies==
In French, almost all of Foucault's shorter writings, published interviews and miscellany have been published in a collection called ''Dits et écrits'', originally published in four volumes in 1994, latterly in only two volumes.

In English, there are a number of overlapping anthologies, which often use conflicting translations of the overlapping pieces, frequently with different titles.

[[File:Monaldo Leopardi.jpg|thumb]]
Count '''Monaldo Leopardi''' ([[Recanati]], 16 August 1776 – Recanati, 30 April 1847) was an Italian philosopher, nobleman, politician and writer, notable as one of the main Italian intellectuals of the [[counter-revolution]]. His son [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was a poet and thinker with completely opposite views, which were probably the root cause of their discord.

Among his most successful works were the ''Dialoghetti sulle materie correnti nell’anno 1831'' appreciated among others by the young Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci (1810-1903), the future [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1878-1903) which went through six editions and was translated into [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]]; the ''Istoria evangelica'' (1832), praised by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] (1831-1846) and translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; ''Il'' ''Catechismo filosofico per uso delle scuole inferiori'' (1832), reprinted and adopted in the schools of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]; and ''La città della filosofia'' (1833).

{{Sufism}}
In [[Sufism]], a '''''murīd''''' or '''mureed''' ({{lang-ar|مُرِيد}}, literally "one who seeks") is a novice committed to spiritual enlightenment by ''sulūk'' (traversing a path) under a spiritual guide, who may take the title ''[[murshid]]'', ''[[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]'' or ''[[shaykh]]''. A ''[[sālik]]'' or Sufi follower only becomes a ''murīd'' when he makes a pledge (''[[bayʿah]]'') to a ''murshid''. The equivalent [[Persian language|Persian]] term is ''shāgird''.&lt;ref&gt;"Murīd", in ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. 7 (Brill, 1993), pp. 608–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[initiation]] process of a ''murīd'' is known as ''ʿahd'' ({{lang-ar|عَهْد}}) or ''bai'ath''. Before initiation, a ''murid'' is instructed by his guide, who must first accept the initiate as his or her [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]. Throughout the instruction period, the ''murīd'' typically experiences visions and dreams during personal spiritual exercises. These visions are interpreted by the ''murshid''. A common practice among the early Sufi orders, was to grant a ''[[khirqa]]'' or a robe to the ''murīd'' upon the initiation or after he had progressed through a series of increasingly difficult and significant tasks on the path of mystical development. This practice is not very common now. ''Murīds'' often receive books of instruction from ''murshids'' and often accompany itinerant ''murshids'' on their wanderings.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'', Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Friedrich von Gierke'''  (11 January 1841 – October 10, 1921) was a [[Germany|German]] legal scholar and historian.  In his four volume ''magnum opus'' entitled ''Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht'' (''German Law of Associations''),&lt;ref&gt;The word ''Genossenschaft'' can also be literally translated "companionship". But it is different from "companies" which in English tend to connote economic associations.&lt;/ref&gt; he pioneered the study of social groups, and the importance of associations in German life, which stood between the divide of private and public law. During his career at the [[Berlin University]]'s law department, Gierke was a leading critic of the newly drafted [[German Civil Code]], arguing that it had been moulded in an individualistic frame that was inconsistent with German social traditions. He helped to advance the concept of [[social law]], over the classical division of [[public law]] and [[private law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Die soziale Aufgabe des Privatrechts'' ([http://fama2.us.es/fde/ocr/2008/dieSocialeAusgabeDesPrivatrechts.pdf Berlin 1889]) translated by E McGaughey as '[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2861875 The Social Role of Private Law]' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Otto von Gierke was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin (Szczecin)]], [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]], and died in [[Berlin]]. He specialised in the study of the German antecedents of [[German law]]. His view of the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' (state on a legal basis), and his emphasis on the federal nature of medieval states, became important and debated. In fact, he said the society grows up because people form groups and groups of groups, from families to the State. He stood as an opponent of the trend of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] interpretation and theorising. His theory took up some older ideas from [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Dante Alighieri]] (''[[De Monarchia]]'').

Abroad he was a major influence on the British historian of law [[Frederic William Maitland|F. W. Maitland]], who translated as ''Political Theories of the Middle Ages'' some of Gierke's major works, and on [[John Neville Figgis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Political Theories of the Middle Ages by Dr. Otto  Gierke, Professor of Law in the University of Berlin; Translated with an Introduction by Frederick William Maitland, LL.D., D.C.L., Downing Professor of the Laws of England in the University of Cambridge|place= Cambridge |publisher= At the University Press |year= 1900 |url= https://archive.org/stream/politicaltheorie00gier_0#page/n5 |accessdate= 25 August 2018 |via= Internet Archive  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]], the '''Patimokkha''' is the basic code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for fully ordained monks ([[bhikkhu]]s) and 311 for nuns ([[bhikkhuni]]s). It is contained in the [[Suttavibhanga]], a division of the [[Vinaya Pitaka]].

== Parajika ==
{{Buddhism}}
The four parajikas (defeats) are rules entailing expulsion from the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] for life. If a monk breaks any one of the rules he is automatically "defeated" in the holy life and falls from monkhood immediately. He is not allowed to become a monk again in his lifetime. [[Intention]] is necessary in all these four cases to constitute an offence. The four parajikas for bhikkus are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha: The Bhikkhus' Code of Discipline|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Sexual intercourse: engaging in any sexual intercourse.
# Stealing: the robbery of anything worth more than 1/24 troy ounce of gold (as determined by local law).
# Intentionally bringing about the death of a human being — whether by killing the person, arranging for an assassin to kill the person, inciting the person to die, or describing the advantages of death.&lt;ref&gt;From Buddhist Monastic Code 1, Chapter 4: Parajika. Copyright © 1994, 2007 Thanissaro Bhikkhu Access to Insight edition © 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately lying to another person that one has attained a superior human state, such as claiming to be an [[arhat|arahant]] when one knows one is not, or claiming to have attained one of the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]s when one knows one has not.

The parajikas are more specific definitions of the first four of the [[Five Precepts]].

== Sanghadisesa ==
The thirteen sanghadisesas are rules requiring an initial and subsequent meeting of the sangha (communal meetings). If the monk breaks any rule here he has to undergo a period of probation or discipline after which, if he shows himself to be repentant, he may be reinstated by a sangha of not less than twenty monks. Like the parajikas, the sanghadisesas can only come about through the monk's own intention and cannot be accidentally invoked. The thirteen sanghadisesas for bhikkus are:
# Discharge of semen or getting someone to discharge your semen, except while dreaming 
# Lustful bodily contact with a woman, including kissing or holding hands
# Making lustful remarks to a woman alluding to her genitals or sexual intercourse
# Requesting sexual favors from a woman, or telling her that she would benefit spiritually from having sex with the monk.
# Arranging for a date, affair, or marriage between a man and woman
# Building a hut without permission from the sangha, or building a hut that exceed 3 x 1.75 meters in size
# Having someone else build a hut for you without permission from the sangha, or exceeding 3 x 1.75 meters in size
# Making unfounded charges about another bhikkhu in the hopes of having him disrobed
# Making deceitfully worded charges about another bhikkhu in the hopes of having him disrobed
# Agitating for a schism, even after having been rebuked three times
# Supporting an agitator, even after he was rebuked three times (only applies if there are fewer than four supporters)
# Rejecting well-grounded criticism, even after having been rebuked three times
# Criticizing the justice of one's own banishment, even after having been rebuked three times

== Aniyata ==
The aniyata are two indefinite rules where a monk is accused of having committed an offence with a woman in a screened (enclosed) or private place by a lay person. It is indefinite because the final outcome depends on whether the monk acknowledges the offence. Benefit of the doubt is given to the monk unless there is over-riding evidence.

Thus it is not proper for a monk to be alone with a woman, especially in screened or private places.

# Sitting in private with a woman on a seat secluded enough for sexual intercourse and the monk acknowledges the offense
# Sitting in private with a woman on a seat not sufficiently secluded for sexual intercourse but sufficiently so to address lewd words and the monk acknowledges the offense

== Nissaggiya pacittiya ==
The nissaggiya pacittiya are thirty rules entailing "confession with forfeiture." They are mostly concerned with the possessing of items which are disallowed or obtained in disallowable ways. The monk must forfeit the item and then confess his offense to another monk. The thirty nissaggiya pacittiya for bhikkhu are:
# Keeping an extra robe for more than ten days after receiving a new one
# Sleeping in a separate place from any of his three robes
# Keeping an out-of-season robe for more than thirty days when one has expectation for a new robe
# Getting an unrelated [[bhikkhuni]] to wash your robes for you
# Accepting robes from a bhikkhuni as a gift
# Accepting robes from the laity, except when one's own robes have been destroyed, or one is asking for the sake of another bhikkhu
# Accepting too many robes from the laity when one's own robes have been destroyed
# Accepting a robe from a lay person after telling them that their robe is too cheap for you
# Accepting a robe from the laity after asking two or more of them to pool their funds in order to buy a nicer robe
# Accepting a robe after coming to the treasurer to get the robe more than six times (since this indicates an excess of desire)
# Owning a blanket or rug made of silk
# Making or accepting a blanket or rug made from pure black wool
# Making or accepting a blanket or rug made from more than 50% black wool
# Making or accepting a blanket or rug fewer than six years after you last made or accepted one
# Making or accepting a sitting rug without incorporating at least one old piece of felt 25&amp;nbsp;cm. square, for the sake of discoloring it
# Carrying raw wool for more than 48&amp;nbsp;km
# Getting a bhikkhuni to wash, dye, or card raw wool
# Accepting gold or money, or telling someone how to donate it. If money is placed in a bhikkhu's presence he may not recognize it as his nor tell someone else to take care of it for him. Bhikkhus often have stewards who will take care of donations, but the stewards are always free to take the money and leave
# Buying or selling goods
# Trading goods with anyone besides other bhikkhus
# Keeping an extra alms bowl for more than ten days after receiving a new one
# Asking for a new bowl when your old bowl is not beyond repair
# Taking a medicine (healing food) from storage for more than seven days
# Using a (rains-)bathing cloth before the last two weeks of the fourth month of the hot season, or accepting one before the fourth month
# Taking back a loaned robe out of anger
# Getting thread, and getting people to weave thread for you
# Receiving cloth after telling its weavers to increase the quality for you
# Keeping robes past the end of the season after accepting them during the last eleven days of the Rains Retreat ([[Vassa]])
# Being separated from your robes for more than six nights if you are living in a dangerously distant village and need to separate yourself from your robes after the Rains Retreat
# Persuading a donor to give gifts to oneself, when they were previously intended for the sangha at large

== Pacittiya ==

'''92 pacittiya are rules entailing confession'''. There are ninety two Pacittiya and they are minor violations which do not entail expulsion or any probationary periods.

1.  A deliberate lie is to be confessed.

2.  An insult is to be confessed.

3.  Malicious tale-bearing among bhikkhus is to be confessed.

4.  Should any bhikkhu have an unordained person recite [[Dhamma]] line by line (with him), it is to be confessed.

5.  Should any bhikkhu lie down together (in the same dwelling) with an unordained person for more than two or three consecutive nights, it is to be confessed.

6.  Should any bhikkhu lie down together (in the same dwelling) with a woman, it is to be confessed.

'''Pervez Musharraf ''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پرویز مشرف}}}} ''{{transl|ur|Parvez Muśarraf}}''; born 11 August 1943) is a [[Pakistani]] [[Politics in Pakistan|politician]] and a retired [[four-star general|four-star army general]] who was the [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|tenth President of Pakistan]] from 2001 until tendering his resignation, to avoid [[Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf|impeachment]], in 2008.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dummett|first1=Mark|title=Pakistan's Musharraf steps down|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567451.stm|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=Work and report completed by BBC correspondent for Pakistan Mark Dummett|agency=BBC Pakistan|publisher=BBC Pakistan, 2008|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Old Delhi|Delhi]] during [[British Raj]], Musharraf was raised in [[Karachi]] and [[Istanbul]]. He went on to study mathematics at the [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]] and would later study at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]] in 1991. Musharraf entered the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] in 1961 and was commissioned in the [[Pakistan Army]] in 1964 and went on to play an active role in the [[Afghan Civil War (1996-2001)|Afghan civil war]].&lt;ref name="Pentagon Press, 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The General and Jihad|date=2007|publisher=Pentagon Press, 2007|isbn=9780520244481|location=Washington D.C.|chapter=General Pervez Musharraf— A Profile|last1=Wilson|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musharraf saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] as a [[second lieutenant]]; by the 1980s, Musharraf was commanding an [[artillery brigade]]. In the 1990s, he was promoted to [[major general]] and assigned an infantry division, and later commanded the [[Special Services Group]]. Later he served as deputy military secretary and the director general of [[military operation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/pervez-musharraf-9419281#military-service|title=Pervez Musharraf Biography President (non-U.S.), General (1943–)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musharraf rose to national prominence when he was elevated to a four-star general, appointed by then-[[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif|Sharif]] in October 1998, making Musharraf the head of the armed forces. He led the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1999|Kargil infiltration]] that almost brought [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] to a full-fledged war in 1999.&lt;ref name="BBC News, Islamabad" /&gt; After months of contentious relations with Prime Minister Sharif, Sharif unsuccessfully attempted to remove Musharraf from the army's leadership. In retaliation, the army staged a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|coup d'état]] in 1999 which allowed Musharraf to take-over Pakistan and subsequently placed Prime Minister Sharif under a strict [[house arrest|house-arrest]] before moving towards a trial against Sharif in [[Adiala Jail|Adiala Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pervez-Musharraf|title=Pervez Musharraf {{!}} president of Pakistan|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musharraf became the head of the military government while remaining the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] in 2001 and the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of the Army Staff]]. Although, Musharraf relinquished the position of Chairman of Joint Chiefs in 2001, he remained the Army Chief until retiring from the army in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/27/AR2007112702242.html|title=Musharraf Steps Down as Head of Pakistani Army|last=Constable|first=Pamela|date=2007-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the [[President of Pakistan]] on 20 June 2001, only to win a controversial referendum on 1 May 2002 which awarded him five years of presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/opinion/pakistan-s-dubious-referendum.html|title=Pakistan's Dubious Referendum|date=2002-05-01|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the same year, he oversaw a [[Pakistani general election, 2002|general election]] in which the army backed [[PML-Q]] was successful.

During his presidency, he advocated for a [[Third Way|third way]] for varying synthesis of [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservatism]] and [[Socialism in Pakistan|left wing]] ideas, he appointed [[Shaukat Aziz]] in place of Sharif and [[Pakistan's role in the War on Terror|directed policies]] against [[terrorism]], becoming a key player in the [[United States|American]]-led [[war on terror]].&lt;ref name="BBC News, Islamabad"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Chris|title=Pervez Musharraf's mixed legacy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=Special report published by Chris Morris BBC News, Islamabad|agency=BBC News, Islamabad|publisher=BBC News, Islamabad|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, Musharraf survived a number of assassination attempts. He reinstated the constitution in 2002, though it was heavily amended with the [[Legal Framework Order, 2002|Legal Framework Order]]. He also saw a process of [[social liberalism]] under his [[Enlightened moderation|enlightened moderation program]], while also promoting [[Economic liberalisation in Pakistan|economic liberalisation]] and banning [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/939190/labour-leaders-urge-musharraf-to-quit|title=Labour leaders urge Musharraf to quit|date=2008-03-10|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw a rise of in overall [[GDP|gross domestic product]] at around 50%, however domestic savings declined and saw a rapid rise in [[economic inequality]].

She then got married and devoted herself to raising a family.&lt;ref name="babyzarin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; His father, Syed, was an accountant who worked at the foreign office in the British Indian government and eventually became a accounting director.&lt;ref name="DEH"/&gt;

Musharraf was the second of three children, all boys.

Musharraf's first childhood home in Delhi was called 'Neharwali Haveli', literally 'canal-side house'. Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]]'s family lived next door.

==Four-star appointments (1998–2007)==

===Chief of army staff and Chairman Joint Chiefs===
{{Main article|Resignation of Jehangir Karamat}}
[[File:PervezMusharraf.jpg|thumb|Musharraf in four-star army uniform, [[Pakistan Army|PA]], [[circa|ca.]] [[2007 in Pakistan|2007]]. ]]
Although both Nawaz Sharif and [[general Jehangir Karamat]] were educated, and held common beliefs concerning national security, problems arose with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Chief of Army Staff General Karamat in October 1998.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; While addressing the officers and cadets at the [[Pakistan Naval War College|Naval War College]], General Karamat stressed the creation of [[National Security Council of Pakistan|National Security Council]],&lt;ref name="nytsoldier"/&gt; which would be backed by a "team of civil-military experts"&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; for devising policies to seek resolution ongoing problems relating the civil-military issues; also recommended a "neutral but competent [[Civil Service of Pakistan|bureaucracy]] and administration of at federal level and the establishment of [[Local government in Pakistan|Local governments]] in [[Provinces of Pakistan|four provinces]]."&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; This proposal was met with hostility, and led to Nawaz Sharif's dismissal of General Karamat.&lt;ref name="nytsoldier"/&gt; In turn, this reduced Nawaz's mandate in public circles, and led to much criticism from [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]] Benazir Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press 66"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbas|first=Hassan|title=Pakistan's Drift to Extremism|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=United States|isbn=9780765614964|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GiKm-ahTpS8C&amp;pg=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three lieutenant-general officers potentially in line to succeed General Karamat as four-star rank and chief of army staff. Lieutenant-general Ali Kuli Khan, a graduate of PMA and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|RMA, Sandhurst]],&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; was an extremely capable staff officer and well liked in public circles, but was seen as close to the former chief of army staff general (retired) [[Abdul Waheed Kakar|Abdul Vaheed]]; and was not promoted.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Second in line was lieutenant-general Khalid Nawaz Khan who was popularly known for his ruthless leadership in the army; particularly for his unforgiving attitude to his junior officers. Lieutenant-general Nawaz Khan was known for his opposition and [[Indophobia in Pakistan|anti-muhajir]] sentiment, and was particularly hardline against the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|MQM]].&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt;

Musharraf was in third-in line, and was well regarded by the general public and the armed forces. He also had an excellent academic standing from his college and university studies.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Musharraf was strongly favoured by the Prime Ministers colleagues: a straight officer with democratic views.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; [[Nisar Ali Khan]] and [[Shahbaz Sharif]] recommended Musharraf and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif personally promoted Musharraf to the rank of four-star general to replace Karamat.&lt;ref name="nytsoldier"/&gt;

After the Kargil incident, Musharraf did not wish to be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs:&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Musharraf favoured the chief of naval staff Admiral Bokhari to take on this role, and claimed that: "he did not care"&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Prime minister Sharif was displeased by this suggestion, due to the hostile nature of his relationship with the Admiral. Musharraf further exacerbated his divide with Nawaz Sharif after recommending the forced retirement of senior officers close to the Prime minister,&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; including Lieutenant-General Tariq Pervez (or ''TP''), commander of [[XII Corps (Pakistan)|XII Corps]], who was a brother-in-law of a high profile cabinet minister.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; According to Musharraf, lieutenant-general TP was an ill-mannered, foul-mouthed, ill-disciplined officer who caused a great deal of dissent within the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Nawaz Sharif's announcement of the promotion of General Musharraf to Chairman Joint Chiefs caused an escalation of the tensions with Admiral Bokhari: upon hearing the news, he launched a strong protest against the Prime minister The next morning, the Prime minister relieved Admiral Bokhari of his duties.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; It was during his time as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that Musharraf began to build friendly relations with the [[United States Army]] establishment, including General [[Anthony Zinni]], [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]], General [[Tommy Franks]], General [[John Abizaid]], and [[General Colin Powell]] of the US Army, all of whom were premier four-star generals in the [[military history of the United States]].&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinni|first=Tom Clancy with Tony|title=Battle ready|year=2004|publisher=Putnam|location=New York|isbn=0-399-15176-1|edition=Berkley trade pbk.|author2=Koltz, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawaz Sharif has maintained that the Operation was conducted without his knowledge. However, details of the briefing he got from the military before and after the Kargil operation have become public. Before the operation, between January and March, Sharif was briefed about the operation in three separate meetings. In January, the army briefed him about the Indian troop movement along the LOC in Skardu on 29 January 1999, on 5 February at Kel, on 12 March at the GHQ and finally on 17 May at the ISI headquarters. During the end of the June DCC meeting, a tense Sharif turned to the army chief and said "you should have told me earlier", Musharraf pulled out his notebook and repeated the dates and contents of around seven briefings he had given him since beginning of January.&lt;ref name="Media Monitors Network"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Zehra|first=Nasim|title=Nawaz Sharif Not A Kargil Victim|newspaper=Media Monitors Network|date=29 July 2004|url=http://usa.mediamonitors.net/Headlines/Nawaz-Sharif-Not-A-Kargil-Victim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First days===
The senior military appointments in the inter-services were extremely important and crucial for Musharraf to keep the legitimacy and the support for his coup in the joint inter-services.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse TradeMark"/&gt; Starting with the PAF, Musharraf pressured President Tarar to appoint most-junior [[air marshal]] to [[four-star rank]], particularly someone with Musharraf had experienced working during the inter-services operations.&lt;ref name="PAF Directorate for Public Relations"/&gt; Once Air-chief Marshal [[Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi|Pervez Kureshi]] was retired, the most junior air marshal [[Mushaf Ali Mir|Muschaf Mir]] (who worked with Musharraf in 1996 to assist ''ISI'' in Taliban matters) was appointed to four-star rank as well as elevated as Chief of Air Staff.&lt;ref name="PAF Directorate for Public Relations"&gt;{{cite web|last=PAF Release|title=Air Chief Marshal Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi, NI(M), S Bt|url=http://www.paffalcons.com/cas/parvaiz-mehdi.php|work=PAF Directorate for Public Relations|publisher=PAF Gallery and Press Release|accessdate=16 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116074508/http://www.paffalcons.com/cas/parvaiz-mehdi.php|archivedate=16 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two extremely important military appointments made by Musharraf in the Navy. Although Admiral Aziz Mirza (a lifelong friend of Musharraf, he shared a dorm with the admiral in the 1960s and they graduated together from the academy) was appointed by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Mirza remained extremely supportive of Musharraf's coup and was also a close friend of Musharraf since 1971 when both participated in a joint operation against the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse TradeMark"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anwar, PN|first=Commodor Dr. Muhammad|title=Stolen Stripes and Broke Medals|publisher=AuthorHouse TradeMark|location=Bloomington, Indiana (state), United States|isbn=978-1-4259-0020-5|pages=252–253;260/273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2IQ7bkak5wC&amp;pg=PA252|edition=1|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mirza's retirement, Musharraf appointed Admiral Shahid Karimullah, with whom Musharraf was trained together in [[Special Service Group Navy|special forces]] schools in the 1960s,&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse TradeMark"/&gt; to four-star rank and chief of naval staff.&lt;ref name="CNN, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=By the CNN Wire Staff|title=Former Admirals wants Musharraf to come back home.|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-01-22/asia/world_asia_pakistan-musharraf_1_zardari-and-bhutto-pakistan-s-musharraf-powerful-inter-services-intelligence-agency?_s=PM:ASIA|work=CNN 22 January 2012{{!}}|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=10 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623131911/https://articles.cnn.com/2012-01-22/asia/world_asia_pakistan-musharraf_1_zardari-and-bhutto-pakistan-s-musharraf-powerful-inter-services-intelligence-agency?_s=PM%3AASIA|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musharraf's first foreign visit was to Saudi Arabia on 26 October where he met with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]].&lt;ref name="strait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simplevisit"/&gt; After meeting senior Saudi royals, the next day he went to [[Medina]] and performed [[Umrah]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="strait"/&gt; On 28 October, he went to [[United Arab Emirates]] before returning home.&lt;ref name="strait"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7E1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dxQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6752,5793608&amp;dq=musharraf+saudi+arabia&amp;hl=en "Musharraf Holds Talks with the Saudis"].

''The New York Times'' (26 October 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of October, Musharraf appointed many technocrats and bureaucrats in his Cabinet, including former Citibank executive Shaukat Aziz as [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and [[Abdul Sattar (diplomat)|Abdul Sattar]] as [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan|Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/06/world/Pakistanis-eager-for-change-are-left-frustrated-after-coup.html?ref=pervezmusharraf | work=The New York Times | first=Celia W. | last=Dugger | title=Pakistanis, Eager for Change, Are Left Frustrated After Coup | date=6 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early November, he released details of his assets to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Kershner, Isabel, and Mark Ländler.

It was the pressure on Musharraf exerted by Saudi Arabia and the United States to exile Sharif after it became authenticated that the court is near to place her verdict on Navaz Sharif on his charges, and the court will sentenced Sharif to death. Sharif signed an agreement with Musharraf and his military government and his family was exiled to Saudi Arabia in December 2000.

Shortly after Musharraf's takeover, Musharraf issued [[The Oath of Judges Order 2000|Oath of Judges Order No. 2000]], which required judges to take a fresh oath of office swearing allegiance to the military. On 12 May 2000, the Supreme Court asked Musharraf to hold national elections by 12 October 2002. The residing President Rafiq Tarar remained in office until his voluntary resignation in June 2001. After his resignation,  Musharraf formally appointed himself as President on 20 June 2001. In August 2002, he issued the [[Legal Framework Order, 2002|Legal Framework Order No. 2002]], which added numerous amendments to the [[Constitution (Pakistan)|Constitution]].

====2002 general elections====
{{Main article|Shaukat Aziz#Prime minister|l1=Government of Prime minister Shaukat Aziz (2004-2007)|Pakistani general elections, 2002}}

Musharraf called for nationwide political elections in the country after accepting the ruling of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Musharraf was the first military president to accept the rulings of the Supreme Court and holding free and fair elections in 2002 in his vision to return the democracy in the country.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; In October 2002, Pakistan held [[Pakistani general elections, 2002|general elections]], which the pro-Musharraf [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML-Q]] won wide margins, although it had failed to gain absolute majority. The PML-Q formed government with far-right religious parties coalition, the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|MMA]] and the liberals [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|MQM]]; the coalition legitimised Musharraf's rule.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt;

After elections, the PML-Q nominated [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] for the office of Prime minister, which Musharraf also approved.&lt;ref name="Free Press 368"&gt;{{cite book|last=Musharraf|first=Pervez|title=In the Line of Fire: A Memoir|year=2006|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location=Pakistan|isbn=074-3283449|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7igVvi3aO-8C&amp;pg=PA179|edition=1|pages=145–146; 179; 234–235; 277, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; After first session at the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]], Musharraf voluntarily transferred the powers of chief executive to Prime minister of Pakistan Zafarullah Khan Jamali.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Musharraf succeeded to pass the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|XVII amendment]], which grants powers to dissolve the parliament, with approval required from the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Within two years, Jamali proved to be an ineffective prime minister to forcefully implement his policies in the country and mounted problems with elite business class of Pakistan. Musharraf accepted the resignation of Jamali and asked his close colleague [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] to appoint a new prime minister in place.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Hussain nominated Finance minister Shaukat Aziz, who had been impressive due to his performance as finance minister in 1999. Musharraf regarded Aziz as his right hand and preferable choice for the office of Prime minister.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; With Aziz appointed as Prime minister, Musharraf transferred all executive powers to Aziz as he trusted Shaukat Aziz.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Aziz proved to be extremely capable while running the government and under Aziz's government economic growth reached to a maximum level, which further stabilised Musharraf's presidency.&lt;ref name="South Asia: BBC Pakistan "&gt;{{Cite news

The presidency of Pervez Musharraf helped bring the [[Liberalism|liberal forces]] to the national level and into prominence, for the first time in the [[history of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; He granted  national amnesty to the political workers of the liberal parties like Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Pakistan Muslim League (Q), and  supported  MQM in becoming a central player in the government. Musharraf disbanded the cultural policies of the previous Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and quickly adopted Benazir Bhutto's cultural policies after disbanding [[Indian media|Indian channels]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt;

His cultural policies liberalized Pakistan's [[Media of Pakistan|media]], and he issued many television licenses to the [[Privatization in Pakistan|private-sector]] to open television centers and media houses.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; The [[Pakistani drama|television dramas]], [[Pakistan film industry|film industry]], [[Theatre of Pakistan|theatre]], [[Music of Pakistan|music]] and literature activities, were personally encouraged by Pervez Musharraf.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; Under his policies, the rock music bands gained a lot appraisal in the country and many concerts in the country were held each week.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; His cultural policies, the film, theatre, rock and folk music, and television programmes were extremely devoted to and promoted the [[Nationalism in Pakistan|national spirit]] of the country.&lt;ref name="Free Press (publisher)"/&gt; In 2001, Musharraf got on stage with the rock music band, [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]], and sang national song with the band.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, Salman Ahmad"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ahmad, Salman |title=A False Choice for Pakistan|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=19 November 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800948.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P1tf5GHK?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800948.html|archivedate=22 April 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear scandals===
{{Main article|Nuclear proliferation}}

[[9/11 attacks|Since September 2001]] until his resignation in 2007 from the military, his presidency suffered more highly controversial atomic scandals than any other government in the history of the country.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; These scandals badly affected his authoritative legitimacy in the country and in the international community.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; In October 2001, Musharraf authorised a sting operation led by [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]] to arrest two physicists [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood]] and [[Chaudhry Abdul Majeed]], due to their supposed connection with [[Taliban]] after they secretly visited Taliban government led [[Taliban-controlled Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="djinn"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EEDB1E30F931A35752C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Pakistani Atomic Expert, Arrested Last Week, Had Strong Pro-Taliban Views], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The local Pakistani media widely circulated the reports that "Mahmood had a meeting with [[Osama bin Laden]] where Bin Laden had shown the interests of building a [[Radiological bomb|radiological weapon]]."&lt;ref name="djinn"/&gt; Later, it was revealed that neither scientist was able to build such designs of the bomb and had lacked scientific knowledge of such weapons.&lt;ref name="djinn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The credibility of these two scientists were put in great doubts about their role in country's atomic bomb program.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/world/nation-challenged-nuclear-fears-pakistani-atomic-expert-arrested-last-week-had.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation Challenged: Nuclear Fears; Pakistani Atomic Expert, Arrested Last Week, Had Strong Pro-Taliban Views | first1=Dennis | last1=Overbye | first2=James | last2=Glanz | date=2 November 2001 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, he authorized the security hearings of these two scientists and were taken into the custody of the [[Judge Advocate General Branch|JAG Branch]] (JAG) where the security hearings continued until early 2002.&lt;ref name="djinn"/&gt;

Another widely controversial scandal during Musharraf's presidency arose as a consequence of the disclosure of [[nuclear proliferation|atomic proliferation]] by Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]]. Earlier on 27 February 2001, Musharraf spoke highly of Abdul Qadeer Khan in a farewell state dinner in Islamabad.&lt;ref name="AQ Khan, Archives"&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan|first=Abdul Qadeer|title=Text of Musharraf's speech honoring A.Q.

In 2004, Musharraf relieved Qadeer Khan from his post and initially denied knowledge of government's and the armed force's role in nuclear proliferation, despite Qadeer Khan urging that Musharraf was the "Big Boss" of the proliferation ring. Following this, Musharraf authorized a national security hearings of Qadeer Khan, which continued until his resignation from the army in 2007. According to Zahid Malik, Musharraf and the military establishment at that time, were exercised rough actions against Qadeer Khan to prove the loyalty of Pakistan to the United States and [[Western world]].&lt;ref name="The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last=Langewiesche|first=William Langewiesche|title=The Wrath of Khan|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/11/the-wrath-of-khan/304333/|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=November 2005|pages=1–10|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mushbush.jpg|250px|thumb|right|US president George W. Bush and his counterpart President Pervez Musharraf address the media in Cross Hall.]]

The investigations back fired on Musharraf and a wide scale public opinion turned against him soon after.&lt;ref name="Daily Times"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff report|title=ARD condemns scientists' debriefing|newspaper=Daily Times|date=30 January 2004|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_30-1-2004_pg7_31|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070422221145/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_30-1-2004_pg7_31|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massive and populist ARD movement, containing the major [[Pakistani political parties|political parties]] especially the rivals [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]], used that issue politically to malign Musharraf and to bring down his presidency alone.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=ARD urged to cooperate with MMA: Requisitioning of NA session|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2004/02/20/nat6.htm|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Dawn Archives, 2004|date=20 February 2004|agency=Dawn Media Group|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the public circles, the debriefings of Abdul Qadeer Khan had severely damaged Musharraf's own public image and his political prestige in the country.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2004"/&gt; Musharraf faced bitter domestic criticism for singularly attempting to vilify Qadeer Khan, specifically from opposition leader Benazir Bhutto who issued harassing statements towards Musharraf's role. In an interview to ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'', Benazir Bhutto maintained that Abdul Qadeer Khan was made "[[scapegoat]]" in this nuclear proliferation scandal and she didn't "believe that such a big scandal could have taken place under the nose of General Musharraf".&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Benazir"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff report|date=18 June 2004|title=Benazir points finger at MQM for Suharwardy's murder|newspaper=Daily Times, Benazir|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_18-6-2004_pg7_25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107224442/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_18-6-2004_pg7_25|archivedate=7 January 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long standing ally of Musharraf, the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|MQM]], gave bitter and a public acrimonious criticism to Musharraf over his handling of Qadeer Khan. The ARD movement and the political parties further politicized this issue after tapping a public anger and mass demonstration all over the country against Musharraf. The credibility of the United States was also badly damaged over this issue;&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, 2004"/&gt; the United States refrained itself from pressuring Musharraf to take further actions against Qadeer Khan due to their strategic calculations.&lt;ref name="CNN Archives 2005"&gt;{{cite news|author=Quraishi, Ash-har |title=U.S. supports nuclear pardon|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/02/05/pakistan.nuclear/index.html|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=CNN Archives 2005|date=5 February 2004 |agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Qadeer Khan remained insanely popular in the country,&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nirupama Subramanian|title=The undiminished popularity of A.Q.

On 4 July 2008, in an interview, Qadeer Khan laid the blame on President Musharraf and later on Benazir Bhutto for transferring the technology, claiming that Musharraf was aware of all the deals and he was the "Big Boss" for those deals.&lt;ref name="KhanPointsNYT"/&gt; Abdul Qadeer Khan said that, "Musharraf gave centrifuges to North Korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the armed forces.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Musharraf's resignation, Qadeer Khan was finally released from house arrest by the executive order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. After Musharraf departed from the country, the new Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] General [[General Tariq Majid|Tärik Majid]] terminated all further debriefings of Abdul Qadeer Khan. A complicating factor is that, few believed that Qadeer Khan acted alone and the affair risks gravely damaging the Armed Forces, which oversaw and controlled the nuclear weapons development and of which Musharraf was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, until his resignation from military service on 28 November 2007.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;Ron Moreau and Zahid Hussain, "Chain of Command; The Military: Musharraf dodged a bullet, but could be heading for a showdown with his Army", ''Newsweek'', 16 February 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption issues===
When Musharraf came to power in 1999, he promised that the corruption in the government bureaucracy would be cleaned up. However, some claimed that the level of corruption did not diminish throughout Musharraf's time.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|author=the BBC's Owen Bennett Jones |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1777889.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &amp;#124; Musharraf's corruption crackdown 'failing' |publisher=BBC News |date=23 January 2002 |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic politics===
In December 2003, Musharraf made a deal with [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|MMA]], a six-member coalition of far-right [[Islam]]ic parties, agreeing to leave the army by 31 December 2004. With that party's support, pro-Musharraf legislators were able to muster the two-thirds [[supermajority]] required to pass the Seventeenth Amendment, which retroactively legalised Musharraf's 1999 coup and many of his decrees. In late 2004, Musharraf went back on his agreement with the MMA and pro-Musharraf legislators in the Parliament passed a bill allowing Musharraf to keep both offices. Constitution Article 63 clause (1) paragraph (d), read with proviso to Article 41 clause (7) paragraph (b), allows the President to hold dual office.

On 1 January 2004, Musharraf had won a [[confidence vote]] in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], consisting of both houses of Parliament and the four provincial assemblies. Musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes, a 56% majority, but many opposition and Islamic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote. As a result of this vote, his term was extended to 2007.

Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned on 26 June 2004, after losing the support of the Musharraf's party, [[PML(Q)]]. His resignation was at least partially due to his public differences with the party chairman, [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]]. This was rumored to have happened at Musharraf's command. Jamali had been appointed with the support of Musharraf's and the pro-Musharraf PML(Q). Most PML(Q) parliamentarians formerly belonged to the Pakistan Muslim League party led by Sharif, and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties, joining the PML(Q) after the elections upon being offered positions. Musharraf nominated [[Shaukat Aziz]], the minister for finance and a former employee of [[Citibank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://financialeducation.citigroup.com/citigroup/press/1998/data/981013a.htm |title=Citigroup (NYSE:CCI) Global Consumer Business Announces Management Structure |accessdate=2006-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160932/http://financialeducation.citigroup.com/citigroup/press/1998/data/981013a.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}, 13 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and head of ''Citibank Private Banking'' as the new prime minister.

The National Assembly voted in favour of the "[[Women's Protection Bill]]" on 15 November 2006 and the Senate approved it on 23 November 2006. President General Pervez Musharraf signed into law the "Women's Protection Bill", on 1 December 2006. The bill places rape laws under the penal code and allegedly does away with harsh conditions that previously required victims to produce four male witnesses and exposed the victims to prosecution for adultery, if they were unable to prove the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2006/12/02/top7.htm |title=Musharraf signs women's bill |work=Dawn |date=2 December 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Women's Protection bill has been criticised heavily by many for paying continued lip service and failing to address the actual problem by its roots: repealing the Hudood Ordinance. In this context, Musharraf has also been criticized by women and human rights activists for not following up his words by action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zakaria, Rafia|title=Terror, tribes, and the war on women in Pakistan|year=2009|journal=Asian Conflicts Reports|volume=2009|issue=8|url=http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/CATR_AsianConflictsReports_TerrorTribesAndTheWarOnWomenInPakistan.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712231656/http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/CATR_AsianConflictsReports_TerrorTribesAndTheWarOnWomenInPakistan.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail//?ots591=4888CAA0-B3DB-1461-98B9-E20E7B9C13D4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=52716 |title='Protecting' women for political gain in Pakistan |publisher=International Relations and Security Network (ISN)|location=Zurich, Switzerland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116180012/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail//?ots591=4888CAA0-B3DB-1461-98B9-E20E7B9C13D4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=52716|archivedate=16 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said that "The so-called Women's Protection Bill is a farcical attempt at making Hudood Ordinances palatable" outlining the issues of the bill and the continued impact on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcp-web.org/pdf/Archives%20Reports/AR2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319193227/http://www.hrcp-web.org/pdf/Archives%20Reports/AR2006.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-19 |title=HRCP Report on Human Rights |format=PDF |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His government increased reserved seats for women in assemblies, to increase women's representation and make their presence more effective. Compared with 1988 seats in the National Assembly were increased from 20 to 60. In provincial assemblies 128 seats were reserved for women. This situation has brought out increase participation of women for 1988 and 2008 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/more-women-in-pakistan-polls-signals-political-freedom_10020351.html |title=More women in Pakistan polls signals 'political freedom' |publisher=Thaindian News |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, a couple of months after the rape of a Pakistani physician, Dr. Shazia Khalid, working on a government gas plant in the remote [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province, Musharraf was criticised for pronouncing, Captain Hammad, a fellow military man and the accused in the case, innocent before the judicial inquiry was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sherry points out loopholes in Dr Shazia's rape probe|newspaper=Daily Times |date=4 March 2005 |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_4-3-2005_pg7_32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430170825/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_4-3-2005_pg7_32|archivedate=30 April 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Maher |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/story/2005/02/050224_mush_media_zs.shtml |work=BBC Urdu |publisher=News |title=’دعویٰ ہے کیپٹن حماد ملوث نہیں‘ |language=Urdu |trans-title='Captain Hammad claims involved' |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rape, riots erupted in the local Bugti clan of the province, where the rape took place. They saw a rape in their heartland as being a breach of their code of honour and attacked the gas plant. In an uncompromising response Musharraf sent tanks, helicopters and an extra 4,500 soldiers to guard the installation. If the tribesmen failed to stop shooting, he warned on television, "they will not know what hit them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Walsh, Declan |title=Pakistan's gas fields blaze as rape sparks threat of civil war |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2005 |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/21/pakistan.declanwalsh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529184746/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/feb/21/pakistan.declanwalsh|archivedate=29 May 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shazia was later forced and threatened by the government to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Khalid, Shazia |author2=Mahmood, Zainab |author3=Maruf, Maryam  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Shazia Khalid and the fight for justice in Pakistan |publisher=Open Democracy Ltd.|date=25 September 2005 |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/pakistan_2868.jsp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083618/http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/pakistan_2868.jsp|archivedate=24 November 2005|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in September 2005 Musharraf said that Pakistani women, who were the victims of rape, treated rape as a "moneymaking concern" and were only interested in the publicity in order to make money and get a Canadian visa. He subsequently denied making these comments, but ''The Washington Post'' made available an audio recording of the interview, in which Musharraf could be heard making the quoted remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/audio/2005/09/23/AU2005092301253.html |title=Interview with Pakistan president Musharraf |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musharraf also denied Mukhtaran Mai, a Pakistani rape victim, the right to travel abroad, until pressured by US State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kathleen.

===Assassination attempts===
In 2000 Kamran Atif, an alleged member of [[Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami]], tried to assassinate Musharraf. Atif was sentenced to death in 2006 by an [[Anti Terrorism Court (Pakistan)|Anti Terrorism Court]]. On 14 December 2003, Musharraf survived an assassination attempt when a powerful bomb went off minutes after his highly guarded [[convoy]] crossed a bridge in Rawalpindi. It was the third such attempt during his four-year rule. On 25 December 2003, two [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] tried to assassinate Musharraf, but their [[car bomb]]s failed to kill him; 16 others died instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3351207.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Arrests follow Musharraf attack |publisher=BBC News |date=27 December 2003 |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musharraf escaped with only a cracked windshield on his car. [[Amjad Farooqi]] was an alleged mastermind behind these attempts, and was killed by Pakistani forces in 2004 after an extensive manhunt.

On 6 July 2007, there was another attempted assassination, when an unknown group fired a 7.62 [[submachine gun]] at Musharraf's plane as it took off from a [[runway]] in [[Rawalpindi]]. Security also recovered 2 [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], from which no shots had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;Masood, Salman and Nizza, Mike [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/world/asia/06cnd-pakistan.html?hp "Gunmen Fire on Musharraf's Plane"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2007, Pakistani police detained 39 people in relation to the attempted assassination of Musharraf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/17pak1.htm "attack on Musharraf: 39 detained"] rediff.com 17 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The suspects were detained at an undisclosed location by a joint team of [[Punjab Police (Pakistan)|Punjab Police]], the Federal Investigation Agency and other Pakistani intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=39 arrested for links to attack on Musharraf|newspaper=Daily Times|date=17 July 2007|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\07\17\story_17-7-2007_pg1_4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915043425/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C07%5C17%5Cstory_17-7-2007_pg1_4|archivedate=15 September 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2007, a military helicopter escorting President Musharraf, on his visit to the earthquake-affected areas on [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|its second anniversary]], crashed near [[Muzaffarabad]], killing four people, including a brigadier. The Puma helicopter crashed at Majohi near Garhi Dupatta in Azad Kashmir at 11:15&amp;nbsp;am due to technical fault.

==Fall from the presidency==
By August 2007, polls showed 64 percent of Pakistanis did not want another Musharraf term.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9622079 Pakistan: A mess in Pakistan].

Retrieved on 27 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Controversies involving the atomic issues, [[Operation Silence|Lal Masjid incident]], unpopular [[War in North-West Pakistan|operation in West]], suspension of famed [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]], and widely circulated criticisms from rivals, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, had brutalized the personal image of Musharraf in public and political circles. More importantly, with Shaukat Aziz departing from the office of Prime Minister, Musharraf could not have sustained his presidency any longer and dramatically fell from the presidency within a matter of eight months, after popular and mass public movements successfully called for his [[impeachment]] for the actions taken during his presidency.

===Suspension and reinstatement of the Chief Justice===
{{Main article|Suspension of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry}}
On 9 March 2007, Musharraf suspended Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] and pressed corruption charges against him. He replaced him with ally Acting Chief Justice Javed Iqbal.

Musharraf's moves sparked protests among Pakistani lawyers. On 12 March 2007, lawyers started a campaign called Judicial Activism across Pakistan and began boycotting all court procedures in protest against the suspension. In Islamabad, as well as other cities such as Lahore, Karachi, and [[Quetta]] hundreds of lawyers dressed in black suits attended rallies, condemning the suspension as unconstitutional. Slowly the expressions of support for the ousted Chief Justice gathered momentum and by May, protesters and opposition parties took out huge rallies against Musharraf and his tenure as army chief was also challenged in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Musharraf's tenure as army chief challenged|date=15 May 2007|newspaper=Dawn|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/247064/musharraf-s-tenure-as-army-chief-challenged|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422165741/http://www.dawn.com/news/247064/musharraf-s-tenure-as-army-chief-challenged|archivedate=22 April 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Editorial: Musharraf's political options are closing|newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]|date=14 May 2007|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C05%5C14%5Cstory_14-5-2007_pg3_1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184145/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C05%5C14%5Cstory_14-5-2007_pg3_1|archivedate=30 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lal Masjid siege===
{{Main article|Siege of Lal Masjid}}
Lal Masjid had a religious school for women and the Jamia Hafsa madrassa, which was attached to the mosque. A male madrassa was only a few minutes drive away. The mosque was often attended by prominent politicians including prime ministers, army chiefs, and presidents.

In April 2007, the mosque administration started to encourage attacks on local video shops, alleging that they were selling porn films, and massage parlours, which were alleged to be used as brothels. These attacks were often carried out by the mosque's female students. In July 2007, a confrontation occurred when government authorities made a decision to stop the student violence and send police officers to arrest the responsible individuals and the madrassa administration.

This development led to a standoff between police forces and armed students.&lt;ref name="redmosque"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6503477.stm | work=BBC News | title=Profile: Islamabad's Red Mosque | date=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosque leaders and students refused to surrender and kept firing on police from inside the mosque building. Both sides suffered casualties.

===Return of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif===
Also on 8 August 2007, Benazir Bhutto spoke about her [[Benazir Bhutto#The Deal with the Musharraf Government|secret meeting with Musharraf]] on 27 July, in an interview on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

On 14 September 2007, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim stated that Bhutto won't be deported, but must face corruption suits against her.

On 25 June 2013, Musharraf was named as prime suspect in two separate cases, first Benazir Bhutto's [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassination]] and second being [[Akbar Bugti]] case by [[Federal Investigation Agency]] for masterminding a conspiracy to assassinations of Benazir Bhutto and [[Akbar Bugti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/26-Jun-2013/musharraf-conspired-to-kill-benazir Musharraf 'conspired' to kill Benazir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627031401/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/26-Jun-2013/musharraf-conspired-to-kill-benazir |date=27 June 2013 }}.

{{Other uses|Predicate (disambiguation)}}

There are two competing notions of the '''predicate''' in theories of [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carnie (2007:51).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition between these two concepts has generated confusion concerning the use of the term ''predicate'' in theories of grammar. This article considers both of these notions.

The first concerns [[traditional grammar]], which tends to view a predicate as one of two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], the other part being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]; the purpose of the predicate is to complete an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like.

The second notion was derived from work in [[predicate calculus]] ([[predicate logic]], first order logic) and is prominent in modern theories of syntax and grammar. In this approach, the predicate of a sentence mostly corresponds to the main [[verb]] and any auxiliaries that accompany the main verb; whereas the [[verb argument|arguments]] of that predicate (e.g. the subject  and object [[noun phrase]]s) are outside the predicate.

==In traditional grammar==
The predicate in [[traditional grammar]] is inspired by propositional logic of antiquity (as opposed to the more modern [[predicate logic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Aristotelian logic as the source for the binary subject-predicate division of the sentence, see Matthews (1981:102).&lt;/ref&gt; A predicate is seen as a property that a subject has or is characterized by. A predicate is therefore an expression that can be ''true of'' something.&lt;ref&gt;See Kroeger (2005:53).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the expression "is moving"  is true of anything that is moving. This classical understanding of predicates was adopted more or less directly into Latin and Greek grammars; and from there, it made its way into English grammars, where it is applied directly to the analysis of sentence structure. It is also the understanding of predicates as defined in English-language dictionaries. The predicate is one of the two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (the other being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], which the predicate [[Grammatical modifier|modifies]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for instance The American Heritage College Dictionary (1993:1077) and The Miriam Webster's Dictionary (2004:566).&lt;/ref&gt; The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb requires or permits other elements to complete the predicate, or it precludes them from doing so. These elements are [[Object (grammar)|objects]] (direct, indirect, prepositional), [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicatives]], and [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]]:

::She '''dances'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-only predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::Ben '''reads the book'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-direct-object predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::Ben's mother, Felicity, '''gave me a present'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-indirect-object-plus-direct-object predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::She '''listened to the radio'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-prepositional-object predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::They '''elected her president'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-object-plus-predicative-noun predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::She '''met him in the park'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-object-plus-adjunct predicate&lt;/small&gt;
::She '''is in the park'''. &lt;small&gt;– verb-plus-predicative-prepositional-phrase predicate&lt;/small&gt;

The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like. The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a [[Nexus grammar|nexus]]. A ''predicative nominal'' is a [[noun phrase]], such as in ''George III is the king of England'', ''the king of England'' being the predicative nominal. The subject and predicative nominal must be connected by a [[linking verb]], also called a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]. A ''predicative adjective'' is an [[adjective]], such as in ''Ivano is attractive'', ''attractive'' being the predicative adjective. The subject and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula.

This traditional understanding of predicates has a concrete reflex in all [[phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]] theories of syntax. These theories divide the generic declarative sentence (S) into a [[noun phrase]] (NP) and [[verb phrase]] (VP), e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Constituency trees like the one here, which divides the sentence into a subject NP and a predicate VP, can be found in most textbooks on syntax and grammar, e.g. Carnie (2007), although the trees of these textbooks will vary in important details.&lt;/ref&gt;  

::[[File:Predicate tree 1.png|Predicate tree 1]]

The subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue. This concept of sentence structure stands in stark contrast to [[dependency grammar|dependency structure]] theories of grammar, which place the [[finite verb]] (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure and thus reject this binary NP-VP division.

==In modern theories of syntax and grammar==
Most modern theories of syntax and grammar take their inspiration for the theory of predicates from predicate calculus as associated with [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;There are exceptions to this statement. For instance, Matthews (1981:85), Burton-Roberts (1986:28ff.), Thomas (1993:15) and van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:326) continue to pursue the traditional stance whereby 'predicate' corresponds to the finite VP constituent.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding sees predicates as relations or [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] over [[verb argument|arguments]]. The predicate serves either to assign a property to a single argument or to relate two or more arguments to each other. Sentences consist of predicates and their arguments (and adjuncts) and are thus predicate-argument structures, whereby a given predicate is seen as linking its arguments into a greater structure.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of theories that pursue this understanding of predicates, see Langendoen (1970:96ff.), Cattell (1984), Harrocks (1987:49f.), McCawley (1988:187), Napoli (1989), Cowper (1992:54), Haegeman (1994:43ff.), Ackerman and Webelhuth (1998:39), Fromkin et al. (2000:117), Carnie (2007:51).&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of predicates sometimes renders a predicate and its arguments in the following manner:

::Bob '''laughed'''. → laughed (Bob), or laughed = ƒ(Bob)
::Sam '''helped''' you. → helped (Sam, you)
::Jim '''gave''' Jill his dog. → gave (Jim, Jill, his dog)

Predicates are placed on the left outside of brackets, whereas the predicate's arguments are placed inside the brackets.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of this use of notation, see Allerton (1979:259), van Riemsdijk and Williams (1987:241), Bennet (1995:21f.).&lt;/ref&gt; One acknowledges the [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] of predicates, whereby a given predicate can be avalent (not shown), monovalent (''laughed'' in the first sentence), divalent (''helped'' in the second sentence), or trivalent (''gave'' in the third sentence). These types of representations are analogous to [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantic analyses]], where one is concerned with the proper account of scope facts of quantifiers and logical operators. Concerning basic sentence structure, however, these representations suggest above all that verbs are predicates and the noun phrases that they appear with are their arguments. On this understanding of the sentence, the binary division of the clause into a subject NP and a predicate VP is hardly possible. Instead, the verb is the predicate, and the noun phrases are its arguments. 

Other function words&amp;nbsp;– e.g. auxiliary verbs, certain prepositions, phrasal particles, etc.&amp;nbsp;– are viewed as part of the predicate.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Parisi and Antinucci (1976:17ff.), Brown and Miller (1992:63f.), Napoli (1989:14ff, 1993:98), Ackerman and Webelhuth (1998:39f.). While the analyses of these linguists vary, they agree insofar various types of function words are grouped together as part of the predicate, which means complex predicates are very possible.&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix predicates are in bold in the following examples:

::Bill '''will have laughed'''.
::'''Will''' Bill '''have laughed'''?
::That '''is funny'''.
::'''Has''' that '''been funny'''?
::They '''had been satisfied'''.
::'''Had''' they '''been satisfied''', ...
::The butter '''is in''' the drawer. 
::Fred '''took a picture''' of Sue.
::Susan '''is pulling''' your '''leg'''.
::Whom '''did''' Jim '''give''' his dog to?
:: You '''should give''' it '''up'''.

Note that not just verbs can be part of the matrix predicate, but also adjectives, nouns, prepositions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of theories that extend the predicate to other word classes (beyond verbs), see Cattell (1984), Parisi and Antinucci (1976:34), Napoli (1986:30f.), Haegeman (1994:44ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of predicates suggested by these examples sees the main predicate of a clause consisting of at least one verb and a variety of other possible words. The words of the predicate need not form a string nor a constituent,&lt;ref&gt;That many predicates are not constituents is acknowledged by many, e.g. Cattell (1984:50), Napoli (1986:14f.).&lt;/ref&gt; but they can be interrupted by their arguments (or adjuncts). The approach to predicates illustrated with these sentences is widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany.{{cn|date=June 2014}} 

This modern understanding of predicates is compatible with the [[dependency grammar]] approach to sentence structure, which places the finite verb as the root of all structure, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Dependency trees like the one here can be found in, for instance, Osborne et al. (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  

::[[File:Predicate tree 2'.png|Predicate tree 2']]

The matrix predicate is (again) marked in blue and its two arguments are in green. While the predicate cannot be construed as a constituent in the formal sense, it is a [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]. Barring a [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuity]], predicates and their arguments are always catenae in dependency structures.

==Predicators==
Some theories of grammar seek to avoid the confusion generated by the competition between the two predicate notions by acknowledging ''predicators''.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of grammars that employ the term ''predicator'', see for instance Matthews (1981:101), Huddleston (1988:9f.), Downing and Locke (1992:48), and Lockwood (2002:4f.).&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''predicate'' is employed in the traditional sense of the binary division of the clause, whereas the term ''predicator'' is used to denote the more modern understanding of matrix predicates. On this approach, the [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb catenae briefly illustrated in the previous section are predicators. Further illustrations are provided next: 

::[[File:Predicate trees 3'.png|Predicate trees 3']]

The predicators are in blue. These verb catenae generally contain a main verb and potentially one or more [[auxiliary verb]]s. The auxiliary verbs help express functional meaning of [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical voice|voice]]. Since the auxiliary verbs contribute functional information only, they do not qualify as separate predicators, but rather each time they form the matrix predicator with the main verb.

==Carlson classes==
The seminal work of Greg Carlson distinguishes between types of predicates.&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson (1977a, 1977b).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Carlson's work, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject.

===Stage-level predicates===
A ''stage-level predicate'' is true of a ''temporal stage'' of its subject. For example, if John is "hungry", then he typically will eat some food.  His state of being hungry therefore lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan. Stage-level predicates can occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and are probably the most versatile kind of predicate.

===Individual-level predicates===
An  ''individual-level predicate'' is true throughout the existence of an individual. For example, if John is "smart", this is a property that he has, regardless of which particular point in time we consider. Individual-level predicates are more restricted than stage-level ones. Individual-level predicates cannot occur in ''presentational'' "there" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed):

:: There are police '''available'''.  &lt;small&gt;- ''available'' is stage-level predicate&lt;/small&gt;
:: *There are firemen '''altruistic'''. &lt;small&gt;- ''altruistic'' is an individual-level predicate&lt;/small&gt;

Stage-level predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers. Individual-level predicates do not, e.g.

:: Tyrone '''spoke French''' loudly in the corridor.  &lt;small&gt;- ''speak French'' can be interpreted as a stage-level predicate&lt;/small&gt;
:: *Tyrone '''knew French''' silently in the corridor.  &lt;small&gt;- ''know French'' cannot be interpreted as a stage-level predicate&lt;/small&gt;

When an individual-level predicate occurs in [[past tense]], it gives rise to what is called a ''lifetime effect'': The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise out of existence.

::John '''was available'''.  &lt;small&gt;- Stage-level predicate does NOT evoke the lifetime effect.&lt;/small&gt;
::John '''was altruistic'''. &lt;small&gt;- Individual-level predicate does evoke the lifetime effect.&lt;/small&gt;

===Kind-level predicates===
A ''kind-level predicate'' is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind. An example of this is the predicate ''are widespread''. One cannot meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread. One may only say this of kinds, as in

:: Cats '''are widespread'''.

Certain types of [[noun phrase]]s cannot be the subject of a kind-level predicate. We have just seen that a [[proper name]] cannot be.  [[Grammatical number|Singular]] [[article (grammar)|indefinite]] noun phrases  are also banned from this environment:

:: *A cat '''is widespread'''. &lt;small&gt;- Compare: ''Nightmares are widespread.''&lt;/small&gt;

===Collective vs. distributive predicates===
Predicates may also be collective or distributive. Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones do not. An example of a collective predicate is "formed a line". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject:

:: The students '''formed a line'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate appears with plural subject.&lt;/small&gt;
:: *The student '''formed a line'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate cannot appear with singular subject.&lt;/small&gt;

Other examples of collective predicates include ''meet in the woods'', ''surround the house'', ''gather in the hallway'' and ''carry the piano together''. Note that the last one (''carry the piano together'') can be made non-collective by removing the word ''together''. [[Quantifiers (linguistics)|Quantifiers]] differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with ''all the'' can, while ones formed with ''every'' or ''each'' cannot.

:: All the students '''formed a line'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate possible with ''all the''.&lt;/small&gt;
:: All the students '''gathered in the hallway'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate possible with ''all the''.&lt;/small&gt;
:: All the students '''carried a piano together'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate possible with ''all the''.&lt;/small&gt;
:: *Every student '''formed a line'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate impossible with ''every''.&lt;/small&gt;
:: *Each student '''gathered in the hallway'''. &lt;small&gt;– Collective predicate impossible with ''each''.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">'''Relevant alternatives theory''' ('''RAT''') is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory of knowledge, according to which to know some proposition ''p'' one must be able to rule out all the relevant alternatives to ''p''.

==Introduction==
Relevant alternatives theory was primarily developed by [[Fred Dretske]]. It states that "knowing a true proposition one believes at a time requires being able to rule out relevant alternatives to that proposition at that time."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  One way that Dretske attempts to motivate RAT is with examples, such as the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You take your son to the zoo, see several zebras, and, when questioned by your son, tell him they are zebras. Do you know they are zebras? Well, most of us would have little hesitation saying that we did know this. We know what zebras look like, and, besides, this is the city zoo and the animals are in a pen clearly marked "Zebras." Yet, something's being a zebra implies that it is not a mule and, in particular, not a mule cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like a zebra. Do you know that these animals are not mules cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like zebras?&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1970), p. 1015-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relevant alternatives theorist claims that one does know that they are zebras, provided that any relevant alternatives (e.g. that they are lions, that they are mules, etc.) can be ruled out and any other alternatives (e.g. the possibility of the zoo authorities cleverly disguising mules to look like zebras) are ''not'' relevant in the context in which knowledge is being attributed.  The important question, however, is: What makes an alternative relevant?

==Relation to contextualism==
[[Jason Stanley]] has argued that Dretske's relevant alternative theory was the starting point for the development of [[Contextualism#Epistemology|contextualism]] in epistemology, specifically with the subsequent work done by [[Alvin Goldman]] and [[Gail Stine]].&lt;ref name="Stanley2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jason|last=Stanley|title=Knowledge and Practical Interests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vueaTKto730C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-153709-7|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Noël Théophile Girard''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|ɪəˈr|ɑr|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Y8dVVV4To "René Girard CBC interview part 1 of 5 (audio only)"]&lt;!--at 0:05--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʒiʁaʁ|lang}}; 25 December 1923 – 4 November 2015) was a French&lt;!--American (he may have spent most of his life teaching in the U.S. but where is it indicated that he also had American citizenship?)--&gt; [[historian]], [[literary critic]], and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]] whose work belongs to the tradition of [[anthropological philosophy]]. Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas, there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as [[literary criticism]], [[critical theory]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], [[psychology]], [[mythology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[cultural studies]], and [[philosophy]].

Girard's fundamental ideas, which he developed throughout his career and provided the foundation for his thinking, were that desire is [[Mimesis|mimetic]] (i.e., all of our desires are borrowed from other people); that all conflict originates in [[#Mimetic desire|mimetic desire]] (mimetic rivalry); that the [[scapegoat mechanism]] is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human [[culture]], and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry; and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.

Girard was also a member of the [[Académie française]] from 2005 until his death on 4 November 2015.

== Biography ==
Girard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923.{{Efn |{{lang|fr|Noël}}, his second name, is also French for "Christmas", the day on which he was born.}}  Between 1943 and 1947 he studied [[medieval history]] at the [[École des Chartes]], Paris.  The subject of his thesis was "Private life in Avignon in the second half of the fifteenth century" ("{{lang|fr|La vie privée à Avignon dans la seconde moitié du XVe siècle}}").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;An excerpt from this thesis was reprinted in the René Girard issue of ''[[Les Cahiers de l'Herne]]'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

In 1947, Girard went to [[Indiana University]] on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. The subject of his [[PhD]] at Indiana University was "American Opinion of France, 1940–1943".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Although his research was in history, he was also assigned to teach [[French literature]], the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Marcel Proust]]. He received his PhD in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953.  He occupied positions at [[Duke University]] and [[Bryn Mawr College]] from 1953 to 1957, after which he moved to [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year, he also published his first book: {{lang |fr|Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque}} (''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'', 1966).

For several years he moved back and forth between the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include {{lang|fr|La Violence et le sacré}} (1972; ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'', 1977) and {{lang |fr|Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde}} (1978; ''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]'', 1987).

In 1981 he became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at [[Stanford University]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period, he published {{lang |fr|Le Bouc émissaire}} (1982), {{lang|fr|La route antique des hommes pervers}} (1985), ''A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare'' (1991) and {{lang |fr|Quand ces choses commenceront ...}} (1994).  In 1990, a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&amp;R) with a goal to "explore, criticize, and develop the [[Mimesis|mimetic model]] of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin01-1.html#_1_1 'The rationale for and goals of "The Bulletin of the Colloquium on Violence &amp; Religion"'] ''COV&amp;R-Bulletin'' No. 1 (September 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/cover/bulletin/xtexte/bulletin06-4.html "Constitution and By-Laws of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion"] ''COV&amp;R-Bulletin'' No. 6 (March 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory, [[scapegoating]], violence, and religion. Girard was Honorary Chair of COV&amp;R. Co-founder and first president of the COV&amp;R was the Roman Catholic theologian [[Raymund Schwager]].

In 1985, he received his first honorary degree from the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands; several others followed. On 17 March 2005 Girard was elected to the [[Académie française]].

His work has inspired interdisciplinary research projects and experimental research such as the Mimetic Theory project sponsored by the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Girard's thought==
=== Mimetic desire&lt;!--'Mimetic desire' redirects here--&gt; ===
After almost a decade of teaching [[French literature]] in the United States, Girard began to develop a new way of speaking about literary texts.  Beyond the "uniqueness" of individual works, he looked for their common structural properties, having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made:

{{Quote | Only the great writers succeed in painting these mechanisms faithfully, without falsifying them: we have here a system of relationships that paradoxically, or rather not paradoxically at all, has less variability the greater a writer is.{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}}}}

So there did indeed exist "psychological laws" as Proust calls them.&lt;ref&gt;For example in ''Time Regained'' ({{lang|fr|Le Temps retrouvé}}, volume 7 of ''Remembrance of Things Past''): "It is the feeling for the general in the potential writer, which selects material suitable to a work of art because of its generality. He only pays attention to others, however dull and tiresome, because in repeating what their kind say like parrots, they are for that very reason prophetic birds, spokesmen of a psychological law." In French: "...{{lang |fr|c'est le sentiment du général qui dans l'écrivain futur choisit lui-même ce qui est général et pourra entrer dans l'œuvre d'art. Car il n'a écouté les autres que quand, si bêtes ou si fous qu'ils fussent, répétant comme des perroquets ce que disent les gens de caractère semblable, ils s'étaient faits par là même les oiseaux prophètes, les porte-paroles d'une loi psychologique}}."&lt;/ref&gt; These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called '''mimetic desire'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, "the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] character of desire." This is the content of his first book, ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel'' (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person—the model—for this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire "metaphysical" in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, "all desire is a desire to be",{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 32}} it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.

Mediation is external when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of [[Amadis de Gaula]] and [[Don Quixote]]. The [[hero]] lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of [[Stendhal]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Proust]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], which are particularly studied in this book.

Through their characters, our own behaviour is displayed.  Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of one's own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, maneuvers, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but "tricks of desire", which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them.  Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-[[Sadomasochism|masochism]] inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] should the actor play this part in reverse{{Citation needed|reason=How is seeking failure masochism? How do sadism and masochism relate to the article?|date=January 2013}}.

This fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories,{{Citation needed|reason=Girard probably said this in an interview, but where?|date=January 2009}} but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them "Siamese twins"{{Citation needed|reason=Need citation for Farneti. Where is the article?|date=November 2017}}.

=== Fundamental anthropology&lt;!--'Fundamental anthropology' redirects here--&gt; ===
{{See also|Mimetic double bind|Generative anthropology}}
Since the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious, it leads to the threat of violence.  Girard himself says, "If there is a normal order in societies, it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis."{{Sfn | Girard | 1994 | p = 29}}  Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain, Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis: the [[scapegoat mechanism]], which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book ''Violence and the Sacred'' (1972), a work on '''fundamental anthropology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ryba (ed.), ''René Girard and Creative Reconciliation'', Lexington Books, 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

If two individuals desire the same thing, there will soon be a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Although explorers and anthropologists have not been able to witness events similar to these, which go back to the earliest times, indirect evidence for them abounds, such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. If Girard's theory is true, then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god, depictions of the selection of the victim, and his power to beget the order that governs the group. Girard found these elements in numerous myths, beginning with that of [[Oedipus]] which he analyzed in this and later books.  On this question he opposes [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

The phrase "[[scapegoat mechanism]]" was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by [[Kenneth Burke]] in ''Permanence and Change'' (1935) and ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1940). However, Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which [[Durkheim]] had sensed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.

According to Girard, just as the theory of [[natural selection]] of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms. The analogy with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.

=== Origin of language ===
According to Girard, the [[origin of language]] is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim, after the murder of the first scapegoat, there were the first prohibitions and rituals, but these came into being before representation and  language, hence before culture. And that means that "people" (perhaps not human beings) "will not start fighting again."&lt;ref name="MuellerInterview1996" /&gt; Girard says:
{{Quote | If mimetic disruption comes back, our instinct will tell us to do again what the sacred has done to save us, which is to kill the scapegoat.  Therefore it would be the force of substitution of immolating another victim instead of the first. But the relationship of this process with representation is not one that can be defined in a clear-cut way. This process would be one that moves towards representation of the sacred, towards definition of the ritual as ritual and prohibition as prohibition. But this process would already begin prior the representation, you see, because it is directly produced by the experience of the misunderstood scapegoat.&lt;ref name="MuellerInterview1996" /&gt;}}

According to Girard, the substitution of an immolated victim for the first, is "the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Girard|2004|p=157}}.  {{lang|fr|"premier signe symbolique jamais inventé par les hominidés"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of [[Mental representation|representation and language]], but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: "It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation."&lt;ref name = "MuellerInterview1996" /&gt;

Unlike [[Eric Gans]], Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is "a sudden shift from non-representation to representation,"&lt;ref name="MuellerInterview1996"&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a sudden shift from animality to humanity. According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot, it is hard to understand how the process of representation (symbolicity, language...) actually occurs and he has called this a ''black box'' in Girard's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard also says:
{{Quote | One great characteristic of man is what they [the authors of the modern theory of evolution] call neoteny, the fact that the human infant is born premature, with an open skull, no hair and a total inability to fend for himself. To keep it alive, therefore, there must be some form of cultural protection, because in the world of mammals, such infants would not survive, they would be destroyed.  Therefore there is a reason to believe that in the later stages of human evolution, culture and nature are in constant interaction. The first stages of this interaction must occur prior to language, but they must include forms of sacrifice and prohibition that create a space of non-violence around the mother and the children which make it possible to reach still higher stages of human development. You can postulate as many such stages as are needed. Thus, you can have a transition between ethology and anthropology which removes, I think, all philosophical postulates. The discontinuities would never be of such a nature as to demand some kind of sudden intellectual illumination.&lt;ref name="MuellerInterview1996" /&gt;}}

=== Judeo-Christian scriptures ===
==== Biblical text as a science of man ====
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'', Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the [[Bible]]. The [[Gospel]]s ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-god lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice — a material re-presentation in this case — in the [[Eucharist]].  The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers.  This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

The evangelical "good news" clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies.  Already the [[Old Testament]] shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims ([[Abel]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]…), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. With the Gospels, it is with full clarity that are unveiled these "things hidden since the foundation of the world" (Matthew 13:35), the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

This revelation is even clearer because the text is a work on desire and violence, from the serpent setting alight the desire of [[Eve]] in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] during the Passion (Mark 14: 66–72; Luke 22:54–62). Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees "scandal" (''[[Stumbling block|skandalon]]'', literally, a "snare", or an "impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = The New Testament Greek Lexicon
 | publisher = Study light
 | contribution = Skandalon
 | contribution-url = http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4625
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) as signifying mimetic rivalry, for example Peter's denial of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: "Woe to the man through whom scandal comes" (Matthew 18:7).{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

==== Christian society ====
The evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Does the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence?  Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order.  The "innocence" of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of [[Judaism]], has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature.  Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

== Influence ==
=== Psychology and neuroscience ===
Jean-Michel Oughourlian in his book ''A mime named desire'' (''Un mime nommé désir'' - Grasset 1982) has used Girard's theories in psychopathology. Hysteria and obsession are explained through mimetic rivalry and the priority of desire.

Girard's work is also attracting increasing interest from empirical researchers investigating human [[imitation]] (among them [[Andrew Meltzoff]] and [[Vittorio Gallese]]). Recently, empirical studies into the mechanism of desire have suggested some intriguing correlations with Girard's theory on the subject. For instance, clinical psychologist Scott R. Garrels wrote:
{{Quote | What makes Girard's insights so remarkable is that he not only discovered and developed the primordial role of psychological mimesis (...) during a time when imitation was quite out of fashion, but he did so through investigation in literature, cultural anthropology, history, and ultimately returning to religious texts for further evidence of mimetic phenomena. The parallels between Girard's insights and the only recent conclusions made by empirical researchers concerning imitation (in both development and the evolution of species) are extraordinary (...).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Economics and globalization===
The mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics, most notably in {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}} (1982) by [[Michel Aglietta]] and [[André Orléan]]. Orléan was also a contributor to the volume ''René Girard'' in ''[[Les cahiers de l'Herne]]'' ("{{lang |fr|Pour une approche girardienne de l'homo oeconomicus}}").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = René Girard
 | number = 89 | pages = 261–65
 | series = Cahier de L'Herne
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the philosopher of technology [[Andrew Feenberg]]:
{{Quote | In {{lang|fr|La violence de la monnaie}}, Aglietta and Orléan follow Girard in suggesting that the basic relation of exchange can be interpreted as a conflict of 'doubles', each mediating the desire of the Other. Like Lucien Goldmann, they see a connection between Girard's theory of mimetic desire and the Marxian theory of [[commodity fetishism]]. In their theory, the market takes the place of the sacred in modern life as the chief institutional mechanism stabilizing the otherwise explosive conflicts of desiring subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with the ''Unesco Courier'', anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the ''René Girard'' issue of ''Les Cahiers de l'Herne'') explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the [[gift economy]], as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity."&lt;ref name="anspach_unesco"&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by "economic rationality." This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.

===Literature===
Girard's influence extends beyond philosophy and social science, and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is [[J. M. Coetzee]], winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzee's novels ''Elizabeth Costello'' and ''Disgrace.'' In the latter work, the book's protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girard's view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays, on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lamey, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 "Sympathy and Scapegoating in J. M. Coetzee,"] in ''J. M. Coetzee and Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives on Literature,'' Anton Leist and Peter Singer eds. (New York: Columbia University Press 2010). For Girard's influence on Coetzee, see pages 181-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
=== Originality ===
Some critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that ''all'' desire is mimetic, he is by no means the first to have noticed that ''some'' desire is mimetic – Gabriel Tarde's book ''Les lois de l'imitation'' (''The Laws of Imitation'') appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde, crowd psychology, Nietzsche, and more generally on a modernist tradition of the "mimetic unconscious" that had hypnosis as its via regia, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic.&lt;ref&gt;Nidesh Lawtoo, ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; René Pommier&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare'', Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; mentions [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that "Nothing is so infectious as example" and that "There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of."&lt;ref&gt;La Rochefoucauld, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/9105/9105-h/9105-h.htm "Maxims,"] maxims 230, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stéphane Vinolo sees [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as important precursors.  Hobbes: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', I,13, World's classic, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 83. Quoted by S.Vinolo in  S.Vinolo {{lang |fr|René Girard: du mimétisme à l'hominisation}}, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza: "By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves,  and  which  we  have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected  with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|la|Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata}} Part. III  Prop. XXVII : "{{lang|la|Ex eo, quod rem nobis similem, et quam nullo affectu prosecuti sumus, aliquo affecti imaginamur, eo ipso simili affectu afficimur}}" quoted by Stéphane Vinolo, {{lang|fr|René Girard: du mimétisme à l'hominisation}}, L'Harmattan, Paris, 2005, p. 20 {{ISBN|2-7475-9047-X}}.  English translation [http://www.yesselman.com/e3elwes.htm H. M. Elwes's 1883 English translation The Ethics – Part III On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions]&lt;/ref&gt; Proof… If we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesselman.com/e3elwes.htm H. M. Elwes's 1883 English translation The Ethics – Part III On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfgang Palaver adds [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] to the list. "Two hundred years after Hobbes, the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville mentioned the dangers coming along with equality, too. Like Hobbes, he refers to the increase of mimetic desire coming along with equality."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Palaver: {{lang|fr|De la violence: une approche mimétique}} Traduit de l'anglais par Paul Dumouchel. In Paul Dumouchel (Directeur), {{lang|fr|Comprendre pour agir: violences, victimes et vengeances.}} Paris: L'Harmattan, 2000, pp. 89–110. {{ISBN|2-7637-7771-6}} [http://www.uibk.ac.at/theol/leseraum/texte/137.html English version]&lt;/ref&gt; Palaver has in mind passages like this one, from Tocqueville's ''[[Democracy in America]]'': "They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door to universal competition; the barrier has changed its shape rather than its position."&lt;ref&gt;

Maurizio Meloni highlights the similarities between Girard, [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;M Meloni: ''A Triangle of Thoughts: Girard, Freud, Lacan'', Psychomedia [http://www.psychomedia.it/jep/number14/meloni.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Meloni claims that these similarities arise because the projects undertaken by the three men—namely, to understand the role of mythology in structuring the human psyche and culture—were very similar. What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were "moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the 'rite of Oedipus' is situated."

At times, Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard. 1965. ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure'' Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1965 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, however, Girard makes stronger claims to originality, as when he says that mimetic rivalry "is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts, but strangely, no one ever speaks of it."&lt;ref&gt;René Girard. 2001. Celui par qui le scandale arrive: Entretiens avec Maria Stella Barberi. Paris: Desclée de Brouwer. p. 19: "Dès que nous désirons ce que désire un modèle assez proche de nous dans le temps et dans l'espace, pour que l'objet convoité par lui passe à notre portée, nous nous efforçons de lui enlever cet objet | et la rivalité entre lui et nous est inévitable.  C'est la rivalité mimétique. Elle peut atteindre un niveau d'intensité extraordinaire. Elle est responsable de la fréquence et de l'intensité des conflits humains, mais chose étrange, personne ne parle jamais d'elle."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of evidence ===
Girard has presented his view as being scientifically grounded: "Our theory should be approached, then, as one approaches any scientific hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''Violence and the Sacred'', translated by Patrick Gregory, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; René Pommier has written a book about Girard with the ironic title "Girard ablaze rather than enlightened" where he asserts that Girard's readings of myths and bible stories—the basis of some of his most important claims—are often tendentious. Girard notes, for example, that the disciples actively turn against Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Peter warms himself by a fire, and fires always create community, and communities breed mimetic desire, this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus, seeking his death.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, pp. 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pommier, Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair, with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind. (This is contradicted by [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] 10:45, [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]] 20:28.)&lt;ref name="René Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16"&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, pp. 115-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same goes for readings of literary texts says Pommier. For example, [[Molière]]'s Don Juan only pursues ''one'' love object for mediated reasons,&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; not ''all'' of them, as Girard claims.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard. 1965. ''Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure'' Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore, 1965 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Or again, [[Sancho Panza]] wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from [[Don Quixote]], but because he has been promised one.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; And Pavel Pavlovitch, in [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''Eternal Husband'', has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a number of scholars have suggested that Girard's writings are metaphysics rather than science.  Theorist of history [[Hayden White]] did so in an article titled "Ethnological 'Lie' and Mystical 'Truth'";&lt;ref&gt;Hayden White, "Ethnological 'Lie' and Mythical 'Truth'", ''Diacritics'' 8 (1978): 2-9, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian anthropologist [[Luc de Heusch]] made a similar claim in his piece "{{lang|fr|L'Evangile selon Saint-Girard}}" ("The Gospel according to Saint Girard");&lt;ref&gt;Luc de Heusch: "L'Evangile selon Saint-Girard" Le Monde, 25 June 1982, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean Greisch sees Girard's thought as more or less a kind of [[Gnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Greisch  "{{lang|fr|Une anthropologie fondamentale du rite: René Girard.|italic=no}}" in  {{lang|fr|Le rite. Philosophie}} {{lang|fr|Institut catholique de Paris, présentation de Jean Greisch.|italic=no}} Paris, Beauchesne, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-mimetic desires ===
René Pommier has pointed out a number of problems with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic.  First, it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Girard's defence on the other hand, Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that "one homosexual admitted to me that he just wanted to be somebody else."

Second, every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators, which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is back in the picture, then, or else the theory leads to a regress.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.&lt;ref&gt;René Pommier, "René Girard, Un allumé qui se prend pour un phare," Paris: Kimé, 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that it's not clear that the first objection really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard's philosophy of romance is compared with [[Plato|Plato’s]], [[Iain King|Iain King's]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer’s]] in [http://kindnesslovejoy.com/when-romance-and-philosophy-meet/ When Romance and Philosophy Meet (link to blog)] retrieved 2013-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, on Girard's interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#SH5d Girard, René [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;]. Iep.utm.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.

=== Beneficial imitation ===
In the early part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that "imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take  his place. …This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Oughourlian: ''Genèse du désir''. Paris: Carnets Nord, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2-35536-003-9}}. The French sentence goes: "L'imitation peut alors demeurer entièrement paisible et bénéfique; je ne me prends pas pour l'autre, je ne veux pas prendre sa place […] Cette imitation […] me conduira peut-être à me sensibiliser aux problèmes sociaux et politiques…&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a "scapegoat" himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis.  Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

More recently, Girard has made room for positive imitation.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, The Girard Reader, Trans. Yvonne Freccero, Ed. James G. Williams, New York: Crossroad Herder, 1996, pp. 63–64, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; But as Adams implies, it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture.  If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges "laughter" and other gay forms of "sovereign communication" in the formation of "community."&lt;ref&gt;Nidesh Lawtoo. ''The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious''. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2007, pp. 284-304&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthropology ===
Various anthropologists have contested Girard's claims. Elizabeth Traube, for example, reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and company—ways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach, Girard "loses … the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves, for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Traube, "Incest and Mythology: Anthropological and Girardian Perspectives, " The Berkshire Review 14 (1979): 37–54, pp. 49–50)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
One of the main sources of criticism of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-à-vis other religions leaves something to be desired.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see the criticisms in ''Violence and Truth: On the Work of René Girard'', Paul Dumouchel ed., Stanford University Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ event—as a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin—an unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say.&lt;ref name = "René Pommier 2010, pp. 115-16" /&gt; Yet, [[Roger Scruton]] notes, Girard's account has a [[Christology|divine Jesus]]: "that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it …  Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence … of his divine nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''Richard Wahle''' (February 14, 1857, [[Vienna]] – October 21, 1935, Vienna) was professor of [[philosophy]] at the Universities of [[Chernivtsi University|Czernowitz]] and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]].

Wahle pronounced in his ''Tragicomedy of Wisdom'' (2nd edition, 1925) on what he acknowledged as only "definite, agnostic, absolute critique of knowledge" and psychology as surviving, or rather maintained that critiques of knowledge, logic and psychology have nothing to do with philosophy. As a consequence of his fundamental attitude, Wahle did not recognize the ego as a nucleus of forces but only as an imprint in the texture of the universe. 

In his ''Formation of Character'' (2nd edition, 1928) Wahle made important contributions to modern [[characterology]]. Wahle's devastating criticism of philosophers spared only a few, including [[Spinoza]], [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]] and [[Herbart]], in whom he praised usefulness.

The Academy served as a private educational institution during the [[Ri Dynasty]]. The complex includes two quarters - an auditorium and a shrine. The buildings were constructed in a row on sloping land. The auditorium quarter include an east classroom and a west classroom. Behind the shrine is a pavilion with a calligraphic board hung under the eaves of the roof. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ryonggok School |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2011/201111/news19/20111119-09ee.html |newspaper=KCNA |location=Pyongyang |publisher=Korean Central News Agency |date= November 19, 2011|accessdate=August 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is also known as the Ryonggok Auditorium. The main building is known as the Taesong Hall; it is the largest building on the complex. The Taesong Hall's roof has a windbreak board on each side, “a unique form, rare to be seen in other old architectures”. The Auditorium includes an outer door, a dormitory and an inner door. The outer door has a two storied gable roof. The first floor of the complex was used as an auditorium and the second floor was used as a lecture room.  There are the eastern and western study rooms on the both sides of the inner court. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ryonggok Auditorium, Heritage of National Culture |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2007/200709/news09/28.htm |newspaper=KCNA |location=Pyongyang|publisher=Korean Central News Agency |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sign board bearing the school’s name hangs from the eaves of the shrine and a monument in the north western house explains that the school was built in 1713. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/history/?culture+2 |title= Ryonggok School |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 20, 2016 |website=Naenara |publisher= |access-date= March 22, 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>In the reference, Harold Bloom actually wrote that when he reads Sartor Resartus, it seems that it was *influenced* by Finnegans Wake, not the other way around. This apparently paradoxical description with respect to publication dates ties into the theme of the cited work, The Anatomy of Influence. In any case, source does not support the assertion so I have removed it. Replacing it with what he actually said would be fine I'm sure as it remains an interesting point.</comment>

'''''Sartor Resartus''''' (meaning 'The tailor re-tailored') is an 1836 novel by [[Thomas Carlyle]], first published as a serial in 1833–34 in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]''. The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (which translates as 'god-born devil-dung'),&lt;ref&gt;"The full name, Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, God-born Devil's Dung, indicates the combination in one person of the half malicious Swiftian satire with the ethereal idealism of a Fichte or a Goethe. Carlyle calls attention to this twofold nature of his hero in numerous places. In the chapter on ''Reminiscences'' the editor remembers seeing in his eyes 'gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire'; in the chapter on ''Characteristics'' we are told that his voice screws itself aloft 'as into the song of spirits, or else the shrill mockery of fiends,' that at times we distinguish 'gleams of an ethereal love, 'soft wailings of infinite pity,' and at others "some half invisible wrinkle of a bitter sardonic humor" so that 'you look on him almost with a shudder, as on some incarnate Mephistopheles.' His eyes again are described as sparkling with lights, which 'may indeed be reflexes of the heavenly stars, but perhaps also gleams from the region of Nether Fire'." — Johnson, William Savage (1911).

The work is, in part, a parody of [[Hegel]], and of [[German Idealism]] more generally. However, Teufelsdröckh is also a literary device with which Carlyle can express difficult truths.

==Background==

[[Archibald MacMechan]] surmised that the novel's invention had three literary sources. The first being ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]], whom Carlyle intensely admired in his college years, even going by the nicknames "Jonathan" and "The Dean". In that work, the three main traditions of Western Christianity are represented by a father bestowing his three children with clothes they may never alter, but proceed to do so according to fashion.{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xx}} The second being Carlyle's work translating [[Goethe]], particularly ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', all of which are quoted and explicitly referred to, especially in Teufelsdröckh's crisis being named "The Sorrows of Young Teufelsdröckh". The third being ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and he referred to earlier in his letters.&lt;ref&gt;"My first favourite books had been ''Hudibras'' and ''Tristram Shandy''." qtd in {{harv|Carlyle|1896n|p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picture of Carlyle's Craigenputtock.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Craigenputtock|Craigenputtock House]]]]
Carlyle worked on an earlier novel, '''''Wotton Reinfred''''' which Macmechan refers to as "The first draft of ''Sartor''".{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xxiii}} Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses with him speculative philosophy. At this point the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|pp=xxiii-xxvii}} Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle's wife [[Jane Carlyle|Jane]],{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xxiv}} Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle's death. Macmechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle's frustration and scorn due to his "zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction" spoken of in his letters of the time.{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xxvii}} Numerous parts of ''Wotton'' appear in the biographical section of ''Sartor Resartus'', in which Carlyle humorously sentences them to the bags containing Teufelsdröckh's autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains about being overly fragmented or derivative of [[Goethe]]. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form, several passages being moved verbatim to ''Sartor Resartus'' but with their context radically changed.{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xxiv}}

Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel and began composing it as an article in October 1831 at [[Craigenputtock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Kaplan (biographer)|Fred Kaplan]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4697 "Carlyle, Thomas (1795–1881)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., 2008, accessed 10 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' serialised it in 1833–1834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson's savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation that the novel did not attain in Britain.{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xix}}  The first British edition would be published in London in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Ian.

==Plot==

The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English Publication ''Fraser's Magazine'' (in which the novel was first serialized without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is upon request, reviewing the fictional German book ''Clothes, Their Origin and Influence'' by the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (Professor of "Things in General" at Weissnichtwo "Know not where" University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing as well, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdröckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book's philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests back to the Teufelsdrockh's office in Germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdröckh's book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor's many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor's frustration at the philosophy, but desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received word from the Teufelsdröckh's office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organized into bags based on the  [[Zodiac#The twelve signs|signs of the Latin Zodiac]]) on which are written autobiographical fragments.

[[File:Room in Which "Sartor Resartus" Was Written.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Room in which ''Sartor Resartus'' was written.]]
At the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organized the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdröckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl ("Duck-Pond"); his father a retired Sergeant of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] and his mother a very pious woman, who to Teufelsdröckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdröckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdröckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (slap-behind) [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. While there, Teufelsdröckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent; glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character; for both his own treatment, and his education's application to politics. While at University, Teufelsdröckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdröckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (Goddess of Flowers; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdröckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, leaving the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated [[The Everlasting No#The Everlasting Yea and No|Everlasting No]], disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdröckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a "Centre of Indifference", and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in "[[The Everlasting No#The Everlasting Yea and No|The Everlasting Yes]]". The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdröckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy.

===Characters===

'''Diogenes Teufelsdröckh:''' (Greek/German:"God-Born Devil-Dung") The Professor of "Things in General" at [[Sartor Resartus#Locales|Weissnichtwo University]], and writer of a long book of [[German idealism|German idealist philosophy]] called "Clothes, Their Origin and Influence," the review of which forms the contents of the novel. Both professor and book are fictional.

'''The Editor:''' The narrator of the novel, who in reviewing Teufelsdröckh's book, reveals much about his own tastes, as well as deep sympathy towards Teufelsdröckh, and much worry as to social issues of his day. His tone varies between conversational, condemning and even semi-Biblical prophecy. The Reviewer should not be confused with Carlyle himself, seeing as much of Teufelsdröckh's life implements Carlyle's own biography.{{sfn|Carlyle|1896|p=xxiii}}

'''Hofrath:''' Hofrath Heuschrecke (i. e. State-Councillor Grasshopper) is a loose, zigzag figure, a blind admirer of Teufelsdröckh's, an incarnation of distraction distracted, and the only one who advises the editor and encourages him in his work; a victim to timidity and preyed on by an uncomfortable sense of mere physical cold, such as the majority of the state-counsellors of the day were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nuttall|title=Heuschrecke, Hofrath|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blumine:''' A woman associated to the German nobility with whom Teufelsdröckh falls in love early in his career. Her spurning of him to marry Towgood leads Teufelsdröckh to the spiritual crisis that culminates in the Everlasting No. Their relationship is somewhat parodic of Werther's spurned love for Lotte in ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (including her name "Goddess of Flowers", which may simply be a pseudonym), though, as the Editor notes, Teufelsdröckh does not take as much incentive as does Werther. Critics have associated her with [[Kitty Kirkpatrick]], with whom Carlyle himself fell in love before marrying [[Jane Carlyle]].&lt;ref name="Simon Heffer 1995, p. 48"&gt;Heffer, Simon (1995). ''Moral Desperado – A Life of Thomas Carlyle.'' London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pakistanlink.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pakistanlink.com/Opinion/2006/Jan06/06/04.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120130745/http://www.pakistanlink.com/Opinion/2006/Jan06/06/04.HTM |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }} "East Did Meet West – 3," by Dr. Rizwana Rahim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Towgood:''' The English Aristocrat who ultimately marries Blumine, throwing Teufelsdröckh into a spiritual crisis. If Blumine is indeed a fictionalization of [[Kitty Kirkpatrick]], Towgood would find his original in Captain James Winslowe Phillipps, who married Kirkpatrick in 1829.&lt;ref name="Simon Heffer 1995, p. 48"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pakistanlink.com"/&gt;

===Locales===

'''Dumdrudge:''' Dumdrudge is an imaginary [[village]] where the natives drudge away and say nothing about it, as villagers all over the world contentedly do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nuttall|title=Dumbdrudge|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Weissnichtwo:'''' In the book, Weissnichtwo (''weiß-nicht-wo,'' German for "don't-know-where") is an imaginary European city, viewed as the focus, and as exhibiting the operation, of all the influences for good and evil of the time, described in terms which characterised city life in the first quarter of the 19th Century; so universal appeared the spiritual forces at work in society at that time that it was impossible to say where they were and where they were not, and hence the name of the city, '''"Don't-know-where"''' (cf. Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Kennaquhair]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Nuttall|title=Weissnichtwo|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and critical reception==

''Sartor Resartus'' was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where "truth" is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', to which it refers. The imaginary "Philosophy of Clothes" holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over history, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith-systems. The book contains a very [[Fichte]]an conception of [[religious conversion]]: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to see ''Sartor Resartus'' as an early [[existentialist]] text.

One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as the Teufelsdröckh's publisher being named Stillschweigen and co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdröckh's father is introduced as an earnest believer in [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Walter Shandy's]] doctrine that "there is much, nay almost all in Names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlyle|first=Thomas|title=Sartor Resartus|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ Pr|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199540372|page=67|edition=Reissued}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rodger L. Tarr, "The influence of ''Sartor Resartus'' upon American Literature is so vast, so pervasive, that it is difficult to overstate." Upon learning of Carlyle's death in 1881 [[Walt Whitman]] remarked: 'The way to test how much he has left us all were to consider, or try to consider, for the moment the array of British thought, the resultant and ensemble of the last fifty years, as existing to-day, but with Carlyle left out.  It would be like an army with no artillery.'"&lt;ref name=Carlylexxxiii&gt;{{cite book

[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] greatly admired the book, recounting that in 1916 at age 17  "[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle.

[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|360px|''Satya'' is an important concept and [[virtue]] in Indian religions. [[Rigveda]], dated to be from the 2nd millennium BC, offers the earliest discussion of ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt;&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt; It can be seen, for example, in the fifth and sixth lines, in above Rigveda manuscript image.]]
'''Satya''' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for [[truth]].&lt;ref name=aam&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|A. A.

Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen et al (2003), Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-02-865704-7}}, page 405&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to a virtue in [[Indian religions]], referring to being truthful in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt; In Yoga, ''satya'' is one of five [[yamas]], the virtuous restraint from falsehood and distortion of reality in one's expressions and actions.&lt;ref name=grg&gt;GR Garg, Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 3, {{ISBN|81-7022-3733}}, page 733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Vedas]] and later [[sutra]]s, the meaning of the word satya ({{linktext|सत्य}}) evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue.&lt;ref name=knt&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; It means being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt;

A related concept, [[sattva]], also derived from "sat", means true essence, nature, spiritual essence, character.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Sattva, {{oclc|492970792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sattva is also a [[guṇa]], a psychology concept particularly in the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy, where it means goodness, purity, clean, positive, one that advances good true nature of self.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [https://archive.org/stream/indianwisdomwith00moniuoft#page/94/mode/2up Indian Wisdom], Luzac &amp; Co London, page 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere (1977),'' The theory and practice of psychological medicine in the Ayurvedic tradition'', Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, Volume 1, Issue 2, pp 155-181&lt;/ref&gt;

Satya has [[cognates]] in a number of diverse [[Indo-European languages]], including the word "sooth" in [[English language|English]], "istina" ("истина") in [[Russian language|Russian]], "sannhet" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and "haithya" in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="prudentia"&gt;{{Citation | title= Prudentia, Volumes 11-13 | author=  Dept. of Classics and Ancient History, University of Auckland | publisher= University of Auckland Bindery, 1979 | isbn=  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S70RAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=satya | quote= ...

===Vedic literature===
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
''Satya'' is a central theme in the Vedas. It is equated with and considered necessary to the concept [[Ṛta]] (Sanskrit ऋतं ṛtaṃ) – that which is properly joined, order, rule, nature, balance, harmony.&lt;ref name=rohin&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}, pages 51-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Beversluis, Sourcebook of the World's Religions, New World Library, {{ISBN|978-1577311218}}, pages 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; Ṛta results from Satya in the Vedas, states Holdrege,&lt;ref name=bahold/&gt; as it regulates and enables the operation of the universe and everything within it. Satya (truth) is considered essential, and without it, the universe and reality falls apart, cannot function.&lt;ref name=bahold&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma", in: Mittal, S. &amp; Thursby, G. (Eds.) The Hindu World, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rigveda]], opposed to ''rita'' and ''satya'' are ''anrita'' and ''asatya'' (falsehood).&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt; Truth and truthfulness is considered as a form of reverence for the divine, while falsehood a form of sin. ''Satya'' includes action and speech that is factual, real, true and reverent to ''Ṛta'' in Book 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Rigveda.&lt;ref name=atdn&gt;[[Antonio T. De Nicolás]] (2003), Meditations Through the Rig Veda, {{ISBN|978-0595269259}}, pages 162-164&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Satya'' isn't merely about one's past that is in context in the Vedas, it has one's current and one's future contexts as well. De Nicolás states, that in Rigveda, "''Satya'' is the modality of acting in the world of ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'', as the truth to be built, formed or established".&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt;

''Satya'' is a widely discussed concept in various Upanishads, including the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] where ''satya'' is called the means to [[Brahman]], as well as Brahman (Being, true self).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n843/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], Translator: S Madhavananda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt; In hymn 1.4.14 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, ''Satya'' (truth) is equated to [[Dharma]] (morality, ethics, law of righteousness),&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; as

{{quote|
Nothing is higher than the Law of Righteousness (''Dharma''). The weak overcomes the stronger by the Law of Righteousness. Truly that Law is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks Righteousness"; and if he speaks Righteousness, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|I.4.xiv &lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, page 481, for discussion on Satya and Brahman pages 491-505, 561-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Paul Horsch (Translated by Jarrod Whitaker), ''From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma'', Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol 32, pages 423–448, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s hymn 11.11 states,&lt;ref&gt;Original hymn is: सत्यं वद । धर्मं चर, ''satyam vada dharmam cara'', [http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/tait_sa.html ॥ तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् ॥] Sanskrit Documents&lt;/ref&gt; "Speak the Satya (truth), conduct yourself according to the Dharma (morality, ethics, law)".&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt;

Truth is sought, praised in the hymns of Upanishads, held as one that ultimately, always prevails. The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, states in Book 3, Chapter 1,&lt;ref name=eeas&gt;E. Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandilya Upanishad of Atharvanaveda, in Chapter 1, includes ten&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali states five restraints, rather than ten. The complete list of 10 forbearances in Sandilya Upanishad are, in the order they are listed in original Upanishad manuscript: ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, daya, arjava, kshama, dhrti, mitahara and saucha&lt;/ref&gt;  forbearances as virtues, in its exposition of Yoga. It defines Satya as "the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well being of creatures, through the actions of one's mind, speech or body."&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), page 173-174, {{oclc|23013613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Deussen|Deussen]] states that ''Satya'' is described in the major Upanishads with two layers of meanings - one as empirical truth about reality, another as abstract truth about universal principle, being and the unchanging. Both these ideas are explained in early Upanishads, composed before 500 BC, by variously breaking the word ''satya'' or ''satyam'' into two or three syllables. In later Upanishads, the ideas evolve and transcend into ''satya'' as truth (or truthfulness), and Brahman as the Being, Be-ness, real Self, the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyupani00deusgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, Harvard University Archives, pages 128-133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics===
The ''[[Shanti Parva]]'' of the [[Mahabharata]] states, "The righteous hold that forgiveness, truth, sincerity and compassion are the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the essence of the Vedas."&lt;ref&gt;Page 392 ''Mahābhārata: Shanti parva'' (Mokshadharma parva, ch. 174-365), By Om Nath Bimali, Ishvar Chandra, Manmatha Nath Dutt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epic repeatedly emphasizes that ''Satya'' is a basic virtue, because everything and everyone depends on and relies on ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=mnd344/&gt;

===Sutras===
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], it is written, “When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him."&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"&gt;Patanjali, Sutra Number 2.36, Yoga Sutras 2.30-2.45; B. Ravikanth, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, {{ISBN|978-0988251502}}, pages 140-150&lt;/ref&gt; In Yoga sutra, ''Satya'' is one of the five yamas, or
virtuous restraints, along with ahimsa (restraint from violence or injury to any living being); asteya (restraint from stealing); brahmacharya (celibacy or restraint from sexually cheating on one's partner); and aparigraha (restraint from covetousness and craving). Patanjali considers ''satya'' as a restraint from falsehood in one's action (body), words (speech, writing), or feelings / thoughts (mind).&lt;ref name=grg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Palkhivala, [http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/teaching-the-yamas-in-asana-class/ Teaching the Yamas in Asana Class] Yoga Journal (August 28, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Patanjali's teachings, one may not always know the truth or the whole truth, but one knows if one is creating, sustaining or expressing falsehood, exaggeration, distortion, fabrication or deception.&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"/&gt; ''Satya'' is, in Patanjali's Yoga, the virtue of restraint from such falsehood, either through silence or through stating the truth without any form of distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, in Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions (Editor: Steven Rosen), Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0313397035}}, pages 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{main|Buddhism|Sacca}}

The term ''satya'' (Sanskrit; in Pali: ''sacca'') is translated in English as "reality" or "truth." In terms of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''ariyasacca''), the Pali can be written as ''sacca'', ''tatha'', ''anannatatha'' and ''[[dharma|dhamma]]''.

'The Four Noble Truths' (''ariya-sacca'') are the briefest synthesis of the entire teaching of Buddhism, since all those manifold doctrines of the threefold [[Pali canon]] are, without any exception, included therein. They are the truth of suffering (mundane mental and physical phenomenon), of the origin of suffering (tanha 'pali' the craving), of the extinction of suffering (Nibbana or nirvana), and of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] leading to the extinction of suffering (the eight supra-mundane mind factors ).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9315">'''Subjectivism''' is the doctrine that "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience.",&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"/&gt; instead of shared or communal, and that there is no external or objective truth.

The success of this position is historically attributed to [[Descartes]] and his [[methodic doubt]].&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"/&gt; Subjectivism accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law.&lt;ref&gt;William Hay (2011) [http://williamhaywriter.blogspot.com/2011/02/subjectivism.html ''Blog entry on subjectivism'']&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. One may consider the qualified [[empiricism]] of [[George Berkeley]] in this context, given his reliance on God as the prime mover of human perception. Thus, subjectivism.

== Metaphysical subjectivism ==
Subjectivism is a label used to denote the philosophical tenet that "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience."&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"&gt;Richardson, Alan and Bowden, John (1983) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFRYGphPQh4C&amp;pg=PA553 ''A new dictionary of Christian theology''] pp.552-3&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this position is historically attributed to [[Descartes]] and  his [[methodic doubt]].&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"/&gt; Subjectivism has historically been condemned by Christian theologians, which oppose to it the objective authority of the church, the Christian dogma, and the revealed truth of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallmayr1989p188"&gt;Dallmayr, Fred Reinhard (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lhffXhoB9v8C&amp;pg=PA188 ''Margins of political discourse''] p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Christian theologians, and [[Karl Barth]] in particular, have also condemned [[anthropocentrism]] as a form of subjectivism.&lt;ref name="Richardson1983p553"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kunzler (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TObDrbvQFT4C&amp;pg=PA3 ''Church's Liturgy''] p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). This is in contrast to [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|metaphysical objectivism]] and [[philosophical realism]], which assert that there is an underlying 'objective' reality which is perceived in different ways.

This viewpoint should not be confused with the stance that "all is illusion" or that "there is no such thing as reality." Metaphysical subjectivists hold that reality is real enough. They conceive, however, that the nature of reality as related to a given consciousness is dependent on that consciousness. This has its philosophical basis in the writings of [[Descartes]] (see ''[[cogito ergo sum]]''), and forms a cornerstone of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy.

=== Modern versions ===
Recently, more modest versions of metaphysical subjectivism have been explored. For example, I might hold that it is a ''fact'' that chocolate is tasty, even though I recognize that it is not tasty to everyone. This would imply that there are facts that are ''subjective''. (Analogously, one might hold that it is a fact that it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, even though this is not always the case, implying that some facts are ''temporary''.)  Giovanni Merlo has developed a specific version of metaphysical subjectivism, under which subjective facts always concern ''mental'' properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merlo|first=Giovanni|title=Subjectivism and the Mental|journal=Dialectica|year=2016|volume=70|issue=3|pages=311–342|doi=10.1111/1746-8361.12153}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar John Hare|Caspar Hare]]'s theory of [[egocentric presentism]] is another, closely related example.

=== Subjectivism and panpsychism ===
One possible extension of subjectivist thought is that conscious experience is available to all objectively perceivable substrates. Upon viewing images produced by a camera on the rocking side of an erupting volcano, one might suppose that their relative motion followed from a subjective conscious within the volcano. These properties might also be attributed to the camera or its various components as well.

In this way, though, subjectivism morphs into a related doctrine, [[panpsychism]], the belief that every objective entity (or event) has an inward or subjective aspect.

== Ethical subjectivism ==
{{main|Ethical subjectivism}}
Ethical subjectivism is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] belief that ethical sentences reduce to factual statements about the attitudes and/or conventions of individual people, or that any ethical sentence implies an attitude held by someone. As such, it is a form of
[[moral relativism]] in which the truth of moral claims is relative to the attitudes of individuals&lt;ref&gt;"moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject".[http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/relativi.htm Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to, for instance, communities). Consider the case this way&amp;nbsp;— to a person imagining  what it's like to be a cat, catching and eating mice is perfectly natural and morally sound. To a person imagining they are a mouse, being hunted by cats is morally abhorrent. Though this is a loose metaphor, it serves to illustrate the view that each individual subject has their own understanding of right and wrong.

An ethical subjectivist might propose, for example, that what it means for something to be morally right is just for it to be approved of. (This can lead to the belief that different things are right according to each idiosyncratic moral outlook.) One implication of these beliefs is that, unlike the [[Moral skepticism|moral skeptic]] or the [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitivist]], the subjectivist thinks that ethical sentences, while subjective, are nonetheless the kind of thing that can be true or false depending on situation.

== In probability ==
Broadly speaking, there are two views on [[Bayesian probability]] that interpret the probability concept in different ways.   In [[probability]], a subjectivist stand is the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves. According to the subjectivist view, probability measures a "personal belief".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Cox, R. T.]] 2001. ''Algebra of Probable Inference'', The Johns Hopkins University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0801869822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this kind of subjectivist, a phrase having to do with probability simply asserts the degree to which the subjective actor believes their assertion is true or false. As a consequence, a subjectivist has no problem with differing people giving different probabilities to an uncertain proposition, and all being correct.

Many modern machine learning methods are based on objectivist Bayesian principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bishop|Bishop, C.M.]] 2007. ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning''. Springer.  {{ISBN|978-0387310732}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the objectivist view, the rules of [[Bayesian statistics]] can be justified by requirements of rationality and consistency and interpreted as an extension of logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynes, E.T.]] 1976. "Bayesian Methods: General Background", ''Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Applied Statistics'', by J. H. Justice (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press. {{doi|10.1017/CBO9780511569678.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Finetti"&gt;[[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti, B.]] 1974. ''Theory of Probability'' (2 vols.), J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).  {{ISBN|978-0471201427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to justify subjective probability, [[Bruno de Finetti]] created the notion of [[coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|philosophical coherence]]. According to his theory, a probability assertion is akin to a bet, and a bet is coherent only if it does not expose the wagerer to loss if their opponent chooses wisely. To explain his meaning, de Finetti created a [[thought-experiment]] to illustrate the need for principles of coherency in making a probabilistic statement. In his scenario, when someone states their degree-of-belief in something, one places a small bet for or against that belief and specifies the odds, with the understanding that the ''other'' party to the bet may then decide which side of the bet to take. Thus, if Bob specifies 3-to-1 odds against a proposition A, his opponent Joe may then choose whether to require Bob to risk $1 in order to win $3 if proposition A is found to be true, or to require Bob to risk $3 in order to win $1 if the proposition A is not true. In this case, it is possible for Joe to win over Bob. According to de Finetti, then, this case is incoherent.&lt;ref name="de Finetti" /&gt;

Carman's main areas of interest are in the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]] and in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. He is the author of ''Heidegger’s Analytic: Interpretation, Discourse, and Authenticity in Heidegger's'' Being and Time (2003) and ''Merleau-Ponty'' (2008), and the editor of ''The Cambridge Companion to Merleau-Ponty'' (2005). He is also co-editor of a philosophy series with Ashgate Publishing called "Intersection: Continental and Analytic Philosophy". 

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] considers Carman to be one of the leading contemporary authorities on Heidegger and on Heidegger's concept of death in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus (2005). "Foreword," in Carol J. White, ''Time and Death: Heidegger's Analysis of Finitude'', Ashgate, p. xviiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Carman was featured, along with Dreyfus, [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Mark Wrathall]] and [[Sean Kelly (philosopher)|Sean Kelly]], in the documentary ''[[Being in the World]]'' (2010), which explores the phenomenology of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingintheworldmovie.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joaquim Teófilo Fernandes Braga''' ({{IPA-pt|tiˈɔfilu ˈbɾaɡɐ}}; 24 February 1843 – 28 January 1924) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer, playwright, politician and the leader of the Republican Provisional Government after the overthrow of King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], as well as the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|second]] elected President of the First [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]], after the resignation of President [[Manuel de Arriaga]].

==Biography==
Teófilo Braga was born in the [[Azores]], in [[São José (Ponta Delgada)|São José]], [[Ponta Delgada]], the son of Joaquim Manuel Fernandes Braga (probably a grandson of one of King D. João V's illegitimate children), from [[Braga]], and Maria José da Câmara e Albuquerque, from the island of [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], another descendant of Portuguese nobility (probably traced to [[Urraca of Portugal|Infanta D. Urraca]], as the genealogist Ferreira Serpa has shown). Teófilo was the 13th descendant of [[Diogo Gonçalves Travassos]], father of D. Pedro and de Violente Velho Cabral, daughter of the Commander of Almourol, [[Gonçalo Velho]], and descendant of Cristovão Falcão, a poet and Count of Avranches. His mother had seven children (Teófilo being the youngest), of which three died during infancy, the others being Luís, João Fernandes and Maria José.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Lúcia Costa Melo Simas, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Teófilo's father became a widower when Teófilo was only three years old (his mother died at the age of 31 years). Originally, his father was an artillery lieutenant and commander in [[Mosteiros (Ponta Delgada)|Mosteiros]], and quit the army after the [[Concession of Evoramonte]], and without means, he established a nautical school and mathematics in Ponta Delgada, eventually finding a job at the local secondary school in Ponta Delgada.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Two years later, the older Braga wed a woman (Ricarda Joaquina Marfim Pereira) with a decidedly bad attitude to the young boy,&lt;ref&gt;Of his stepmother, Teófilo would recount that his worst experiences of instances when he was kicked by the stepmother for showing her affections, and of a situation where he would take revenge by tying her boot-strings together. Simas (2007) also referred to instances when Téofilo would cry passionately at the grave of his departed mother, promising to be successful and never to succumb to despair.&lt;/ref&gt; fathering two daughters with Ricarda (Maria da Glória and Maria do Espírito Santo).

The child took refuge in literature, and specifically in the public library in Ponta Delgada or at the home of the Viscount of Praia, where his father (for a time) was a private tutor to the Viscount's daughters.&lt;ref&gt;It is likely that at this time he became friends with the Viscount; later when he was attaining the chair of Modern Literature Teófilo would count on the Viscount as a benefactor. Simas, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the [[Ribeira Grande, São Miguel|Ribeira Grande]] newspaper ''A Estrela Oriental'' (''The Oriental Star''), edited by former-pharmacist Francisco Maria Supico (a native of [[Lousã]]), that his first naive poem ''A Canção do Guerreiro'' ("A Song of the Warrior"), in a patriotic tone, dedicated to his brother João Fernandes Braga was published. He followed these with ''O Meteoro'' and ''O Santelmo''. At the age of 15 in 1859, in an edition paid for by the Viscount of Praia, he published a book of verses entitled ''Folhas Verdes'' ("Green Leaves") and edited by the newspaper ''A Ilha'' (''The Island''); it was a timid imitation of ''Folhas Caídas'' (''Fallen Leaves'') by noted author [[Almeida Garrett]].

He revealed a tenacity and combative nature and was known to have been disciplined during his time at his secondary school in Ponta Delgada (where his father was teacher) for disparaging remarks made to his teacher. At the end of secondary school Teófilo hoped for future prospects, even informing his father of his intention to leave [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] and travel to America for a professional career (likely as a typographer or merchant).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Amadeu Carvalho Homem, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; But his father suggested expanding his studies at the University of Coimbra, mindful of his child's lack of abilities in his preferred fields. Therefore, Teófilo Braga, student, arrived in [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]] in April 1861, with hopes of achieving a doctorate in Theology or Law; after a year, in which he repeated his prerequisite entrance qualifications, he joined the Faculty of Law at the University. His first lodging would be at the home of Filipe de Quental (1824–1892), professor of Medicine and paternal uncle of the author [[Antero de Quental]].

===University===

Life as a student was spartan and austere, and he did not adopt the Bohemian lifestyle on campus, preferring to concentrate on his studies. A contemporary, the writer [[Ramalho Ortigão]], had this to say of the young Teófilo:
:''"Simple, sober, hard, with habits of austerity bordering on spartan, he knows how to reduce his requirements as he lacks resources, living in his isolation like Robinson on his island, Teófilo Braga has a unique passion, a passion of a prelate of science. He does not publish a volume per week because there is no machine in Portugal that can accompany the rapidness of his pen. He writes with grace, disinterested, in the satisfaction of his supreme pleasure, pleasure of spilling ideas. This incredible force and at the same time his unique weakness; I've never met another. At his most acerbic nature, he has a passion of his ideas...in the 19th century, with his systematic activity and with his impatience guided by the profoundly pacifist philosophy of Augusto Comte, Teófilo Braga is the most perfect archetype of the uncredited worker and useful citizen. In the middle of Portuguese society...[we are] consoled by the power of contemplation, and a figure such as Teófilo Braga is a rare curiosity that we call...a human''&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Amaral, 1915, p. 437-438&lt;/ref&gt;

While at [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]] he became involved with the literary agitation; Teófilo joined his contemporaries, which included the writer [[Antero de Quental]], in what became known as ''Questão Coimbra'' (English: ''Question Coimba''), a loose affiliation of artists with non-traditionalist philosophies and ideals about 1865. He remained on the periphery of this group's activities, though, while writing many of his recognized early works: ''O Pirilampo'', ''O Fósforo'' and ''Tira-Teimas''. A few of his professors in the Faculty of Law recognized his application, and arranged tasks that helped his studies, including the organization and classification of monastic documents. But his new projects did not affect his participation with the student activists against the autocratic Rector Basílio Alberto de Sousa Pinto and many of the traditionalists at Coimbra. He reserved his best efforts for his own projects; during this time he convinced editor Gomes Monteiro, of Casa Moré (a publishing house in Oporto), to publish his poem ''Visão dos Tempos'' (in 1864). It was a work that borrowed directly for its base the themes from [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[La Légende des siècles]]'', and captured in verse all the essential classicism of Judaism and Christianity. The work received many positive reviews.  At the time the indisputable authority of Portuguese literature was [[António Feliciano de Castilho]] and his Lisbon admirers, who could establish or ruin the reputation of young authors.  Castilho, and his protégé Manuel Pinheiro Chagas were captivated by the classic prose of ''Visão'' (English: ''Vision'') and congratulated in public Bragas' work.

But this was not repeated in his follow-up book of poetry ''Tempestades Sonoras'', which were preceded by a philosophical prologue that was both obscure and indecipherable. Generally, Castilho's conservative Lisbon admirers criticized severely many of the personalities with dissident tendencies,  due to considerations both artistic and political. At the time of the publication of ''Tempestades'', Antero de Quental had just completed his ''Odes Modernas'' (English: ''Modern Odes''), a shockingly militant work that challenged the conservative constitutional monarchy in Portugal, its class society and the religious hierarchy.  Castilho and his prelates decided to begin a philosophical battle, without quarter, against the two iconoclasts, ''"that they considered exponents of a School at Coimbra of depraved tastes and highly harmful."''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The literary "conflict" began in earnest when [[Manuel Pinheiro Chagas]] published his ''obra-prima'' ''Poema da Mocidade''. António Feliciano de Castilho, in a letter-to-the-editor António Maria Pereira, to promote the book and provide a prologue to the volume, critically attacked Antero Quental and Teófilo Braga, as well as their loose affiliation of friends. This was the beginning of the ''Questão Coimbrã'' Movement, an impassioned period that involved many Portuguese literary writers, that included many critical texts and apologies. Antero de Quental responded with his work which challenged Castilho's original text, which he entitled ''Bom Senso e Bom Gosto'' (English: ''Good Sense and Good Taste''), followed by ''A Dignidade das Letras'' (English: ''A Dignity of Letters'') and ''Literaturas Oficiais'' (English: ''Official Literature''), while Teófilo challenged with his literary violent work ''As Teocracias Literárias'' (English: ''The Literary Theocracy''). After his first year at the University, won by his tenacious inflexibility and idealism, Braga was confronted by the literary conflicts between traditionalists and modernists:
:''Quickly, I found myself encircled by hate; they cut-off my life in the newspaper; in Law classes, they took my academic distinctions; the critics devastated me rudely; the bookstore owners refused to publish what I wrote; and the patriarchs of Letters, with their authoritative weight smiles with sober equivalence at my intellectual value, circulating depressive stories about my character and customs, which served to dismake my sacrifices. Another would have given up. I saw myself forced to reverse the base of my existence, abandon the Art that had seduced me, because it removed my contemplative serenity, and I launched myself into criticizing, into erudite knowledge, into science, into philosophy."''

Rocha Martins referred to an interview that he had with Braga, in 1916, and where, as a visible admirer of the writer and president, he wrote of Teófilo's life and difficulties at Coimbra. Teófolio had recalled that one time, in Oporto, at the home of the librarian Moré he had met Camilo Castelo Branco, who had extended his hand in friendship, but Braga had "turned his back". As Rocha Martins elaborated, Teófilo "was just a youth then...today he would not have turned his back on anyone...All men should learn to forgive".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Maria Luísa V. de Paiva Boléo, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It was not just an attack on aesthetic differences between political ideologies, Castilho also endorsed his protégé (Chagas) for a professorship in the department of Modern Literature of the Faculty of Letters, and used his letter to champion him for the position, in which both Teófilo and his friend Antero Quental were interested.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In April 1868 Teófilo Braga married Maria do Carmo Xavier ([[Porto]], 14 November 1841 – 14 September 1911), sister of Júlio de Matos, generally from a wealthy family (the couple would live at the Matos home for a time). Their life together would be tragic, marked by the premature deaths of their children: Joaquim, just after his birth (1869), Teófilo, at 13 (1886) and in March of the next year, Maria da Graça, at 16 (1887). Maria do Carmo, whose health was always fragile, was inconsolable (and by the time her husband held the Presidency her health was debilitated and she died away soon afterwards). [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] a declared enemy of the writer, would be unusually forgiving, when Teófilo's children died within a brief period of one another; at the time, Camilo would write the sonet ''A maior dor humana" (English: ''The Greatest Human Pain'').&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

His political affiliations made it difficult to obtain a professorship at the Academia Politécnica do Porto (English: ''Polytechnic Academy of Oporto''), as well as the Faculty of Law in Coimbra.  Teófilo Braga had to wait a year, in 1872 (when he obtained his Law degree), in order to succeed in his application to a position as a full professor in Modern Literature, in a memorable public competition.  He was the superior choice of the presiding judge of the committee, rather than his rival Manuel Pinheiro Chagas and Luciano Cordeiro, who were endorsed by semi-official patrons.

===Positivism and published works===
[[File:Teófilo Braga em 1882 na revista Galeria Republicana N.13.jpg|thumb|Teófilo Braga (1882)]]
Teófilo aspired to be a systematic thinker; a theorist based on evidence which permitted an intrepid and dogmatic interpretation of Man, world and life. It was therefore, no surprise, that he accepted the tenets of ''[[Positivism]]''. This positivist spirit would guide him between 1872 and 1877, under the influence of Joaquim Duarte Moreira de Sousa a professor of Mathematics in Castelo Branco, with whom he regularly had conversations. It was the teacher's curious spirit and admiration of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Émile Littré]] that influenced Teófilo during this period.  It was these influences that brought him to found, along with Júlio de Matos, the magazine ''O Positivismo'' in Oporto, between 1878 and 1882, to write ''Traços Gerais de Filosofia Positiva'' (English: ''General Ideas of Philosophical Positivism''), 1877 and later ''Sistema de Sociologia'' (English: ''System of Sociology''), 1884.

While still professor of Letters and research fellow, Teófilo Braga was studious and unrested, yet he continued to give all his attention to his family (showering on them gifts from his poor [[remuneration]]).  In his home on Travessa de Santa Gertrudes he lived a monastic lifestyle, usually broken by invitations from admirers or civic campaigns. But generally, he was able to concentrate on his writing, including his monumental ''História da Literatura Portuguesa'' (English: ''History of Portuguese Literature''). With a vast repository of documents he would nurture interpretations of medieval romances and produce ultra-romantic works of realism. It was also during this time when he would show interests in ethnography, especially folklore: in 1867, ''História da Poesia Popular Portuguesa'' (English: ''History of Popular Portuguese Poetry''), ''Cancioneiro Popular'' (English: ''Collection of Popular Poems'') and ''Romanceiro Geral'', and then later (1869) the book ''Cantos Populares do Arquipélago Açoreano' (English: ''Popular Stories of the Azorean Archipelago'').  He would repeat this style in 1883 ''Contos Tradicionais do Povo Português' (English: ''Traditional Stories of the Portuguese People'') and in 1885, two volumes entitled ''O Povo Português'' (English ''Collection of Portuguese Romances''), about costumes and traditions, but his studies were generally criticized during the period.

On some occasions he was considered a plagiarist; Braga read profusely and was not too careful while editing his analyses, omitting citations and mentioning unreferenced ideas or the theories of others. The medic and politician Ricardo Jorge, didn't disguise his exasperation in his book ''Contra um plágio do Prof. Theófilo Braga'' (English: ''Against a Plagiarized Work of Professor Teófilo Braga''), in 1917:

:''Teófilo Braga, the venerated image of a diverse writer...remember the Indian idols, crowned with many heads...he is multi-headed. Each head, full of knowledge. Like the [[carrancas]] of a fountain, there erupts from each mouth a torrent of recorded science''.

Even Antero de Quental, who was friendly with Teófilo, referred to him as ''a [[hierophant]] of literary charlatanism''. The Brazilian historian Sílvio Romero, called him ''Papa dos charlatães'' (English: ''Father of Charlatans''). José Relvas, another contemporary, was another person who dismissed his contributions; he noted that the ''prestige he gained was not justified, and that only those who didn't read his published works would admire him''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In its political aspects, positivism was a version of republicanism that acknowledged the stratification of classes by the capitalist model. Teófilo, while reading the works of Comte, fixated on the more radical rationalisms on Philosophical Positivism. On the philosophies of [[Auguste Comte]], defending the ideas of [[positivism]]. ''"The positivist consolidated above all the idea that the Republic could not be just a coup d'état, and that maybe, we should dispense with revolutionary intentions."''&lt;ref&gt;José Mattoso, ''História de Portugal'', vol. 6, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans believed that ''"to create a Republic required a liberation of individuals of their older ideas...[that] without a doubt, it was [their] spiritual subjugation"''&lt;ref&gt;Mattoso, idem, p.409&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal of the time, about 50,000 individuals (in a population of less than six million) had declared themselves as non-Catholics. For Republicans, they believed that the population was captive to a Roman Catholic church that (during 1864) had ''condemned'' liberalism and all modern ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Mattoso, idem, p. 4O9&lt;/ref&gt; For the historian António Reis, Teófflo Braga's doctrinaire style was important in consolidating the Republican cause. His visceral Jacobinismo, allowed him to synthesize the theses of Republican Federalists; the themes of administrative decentralization, imperial mandates and limits which would allow the management of the Portuguese republican model of public education, on the combat of clerical ultramontanism, national sovereignty, and development of democratic ideals that would include universal suffrage. All these ideas would be elaborated in the newspapers ''A Vanguarda'', ''O Século'' and ''O Rebate''. The militancy of these works would serve as guides for many republicans of his time.  Between 1879 and 1881 he would write many of his more political ideas, including ''Soluções Positivas da Política Portuguesa'' (English: ''Positivist Solutions to Portuguese Politics''), 1879, ''História das Ideias Republicanas em Portugal'' (English: ''A History of Republican Ideas in Portugal''), 1880, and ''Dissolução do Sistema Monárquico-Representativo'' (English: ''Dissolution of the Monarchical-Representative System''), 1881. These propaganda pieces did not mean an end to his other works; in addition to participating in numerous comedies, festivals, clubs and republican associations, he was one of the personalities, in partnership with [[Ramalho Ortigão]], to coordinate the fesitivities to mark the third centenary of the death of [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]], the epic Portuguese writer,(10 June 1880). He would later become a partner in the ''Academia Real das Ciências'' (English: ''Royal Academy of Sciences''), Lisbon, and the ''Academia Real de História'' (English: ''Royal Academy of History''), Madrid, where he would be honoured in subsequent years.

===Politics===
Braga became active in Portuguese politics in 1878, when he campaigned for deputy as an independent federalist republican.  Over the years, he had many jobs in the [[Portuguese Republican Party]]. He participated in the political barricades during the revolt in Oporto (31 January 1891), added to the list of members of the Republican Party and worked in partnership with [[Francisco Homem Cristo]]. The membership of the Republican Party in Lisbon never anticipated the success of the Republican revolt in the north. Teófilo and Homen Cristo attempted to win the sympathy of the army, but were largely unsuccessful, due partly to the romantic militaristic ideals of many of the soldiers. After the failure of the conspiracy, with many of those retreating or sent to a military tribunal in [[Leixões]], the two criticized Lisbon Republicans for their lack of assistance for the rebels in Oporto. Teófilo occupied himself with arguing with the objectors and taking on an important role in the propaganda of the Republican Party. By 1896 he was a member of the ''Grupo Republicano de Estudos Sociais'' (English: ''Republican Social Studies Group'').

The political situation in Portugal had degraded after the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. Further, between the 19th Century and 20th Century, the system of power that rotated between the parties was slowly dismantled; the divisions introduced by [[João Franco]] and [[José Maria de Alpoim]] resulted in the creation of splinter groups in addition to the two historical constitutional parties (respectively, the Partido Regenerador Liberal alongside the Partido Regenerador and the Dissidência Progressista from the [[Progressive Party (Portugal)|Partido Progressista]]), which would alter the rules of political coexistence. A dictatorship created by João Franco after May 1907 (endorsed by King D. Carlos) was an episode of cumulative crises provoked by [[Ernesto Hintze Ribeiro|Hintze Ribeiro]], leader of the Partido Regenerador, and [[José Luciano de Castro]], responsible for the Partido Progressista. Teófilo Braga accompanied many of these events, as well as the Franco dictatorship, the [[regicide]] and enthronement of [[Manuel II of Portugal|King D. Manuel II]], of which the journalist João Chagas wrote: ''...[Manuel II assumed the military regalia] when by now it was not needed''. The republican cause had grown in importance, helped by the Republican Party, freemasons, the Carbonária Portuguesa and by numerous groups of doctrinarian idealists influenced by the cause.

On 1 January 1910, he became an effective member of the Political Directorate of the party, joining Basílio Teles, Eusébio Leão, José Cupertino Ribeiro, and [[José Relvas]]. On 28 August 1910, he was elected deputy for Lisbon. The revolution began on the morning of 4 October 1910 and lasted until the next day. Teófilo Braga was acclaimed President of Provisional Government of the Portuguese Republic. But the old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic; factions quickly developed between groups within the party to form new organizations: [[Afonso Costa]]'s faction would form the [[Democratic Party (Portugal)|Partido Democrático]] (the most populist, Jacobin and urban party), [[António José de Almeida]] founded the [[Partido Evolucionista]] (a contemporary faction that included the rural bouregoeis) and [[Manuel de Brito Camacho|Brito Camacho]] created the [[União Republicana]] (which was an intellectual group with many of its members from Lisbon). The first conflict involved the electoral act: Afonso Costa's "democrats" wanted [[Bernardino Machado]] to be the first President of the Republic, but António José de Almeida and [[Manuel de Brito Camacho]] factions were able to elect [[Manuel de Arriaga]] for that title. Teófilo Braga, who was always more closely affiliated with the membership of the "Democrats" and owing to small problems with Arriaga, endorsed Bernardino Machado.

He would return to government in May 1915; he became the President of the Republic after the abrupt resignation of [[Manuel de Arriaga]].  Arriaga had supported [[Pimenta de Castro]] to run the government, and the General had established a dictatorship, which was eventually defeated. In disgrace the pacifist first President vacated the job, and the assembly elected Braga to the position.

===Later life===
Braga was an extremely austere man; after becoming a widower, he was a recluse and occupied much of his time in his library. Even as President, he would walk, umbrella or cane in hand, everywhere,&lt;ref&gt;Early correspondence would show his love of walking by recounting how he had walked once to the Serra do Bussaco, then to [[Figueira da Foz Municipality|Figueira]] (to see the sea), and another time to visit his aunts in [[Braga]] from [[Porto]]. He would start at seven o'clock in the morning and reach Porto by four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day. Simas, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and generally, his Presidency itself was not an exercise in ostentatious living. Over time, as a man-of-letters, Teófilo Braga was recognized by historians as an erudite author. His final home, was on the second-floor of ''70 Rua de Santa Gertrudes à Estrela'', in [[Lisbon]], and his neighbor usually accompanied him for breakfast or lunch. He wore over-used clothing, many of these clothes he repaired personally, including white linens which were his departed wife's possessions (and reminded him of their earlier life together). He was a solitary figure, and had lost many of his closest relations (his mother died early during his life, his father died in the Azores Islands, he lost his children in their infancies and his beloved wife died before he did), as well as his sight.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In his last will, he expressed his desire to be interred in a civil service, without ceremony. He died at 81 years of age, on 28 January 1924, and was buried in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Belém]], Lisbon.

==Published works==
As for his literary career, one can find books by Braga concerning the history of literature, on [[ethnography]] (mainly his search for popular stories and traditional songs), poetry, fiction, and philosophy. Braga's body of published work is also connected to historical investigation; while balancing philosophy, linguistics and culture he wrote ''História da Poesia Popular Portuguesa'' (English: ''The History of Popular Portuguese Poetry''), ''História do Teatro Português'' (English: ''History of the Portuguese Theatre'') and ''História das Ideias Republicanas em Portugal'' (English: ''The History of Republican Ideals in Portugal''). One of his most contentious, from a scientific point-of-view, was ''História do Romantismo em Portugal'' (English: ''The History of Romanticism in Portugal''), in 1880, although his four-volume ''História da Universidade de Coimbra'' (English: ''History of the University of Coimbra'') is still considered important.

'''Théodore Eugène César Ruyssen''' (11 August 1868 - 5 May 1967) was a [[France|French]] historian of philosophy and pacifist.

==Biography==
Ruyssen was born in [[Clisson]], [[Loire-Atlantique]], [[France]]. He was professor of the history of philosophy at the [[University of Bordeaux]], and president of l'Association de la Paix par le Droit from 1896-1948.

After a study trip through Germany upon leaving school in 1889, Ruyssen took up the profession of teaching in 1896. He taught philosophy in various schools and graduated as Doctor of Philosophy with a thesis on "I'Evolution psychologique du Jugement" in 1903. He lectured successively in the universities of Aix-en-Provence, Dijon and finally, Bordeaux, where he occupied the chair of History of Philosophy.

Ruyssen was the President of the ''[[Association de la paix par le droit]]'', the most important peace organization in France, which is widely known throughout the world through its official organ "La Paix par le Droit," and a member of the International Peace Bureau in Berne.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Ruyssen's "[https://archive.org/stream/98a121internatio00carnuoft/98a121internatio00carnuoft_djvu.txt What is a Nationality?]" in ''International Conciliation'' no. 109,  1917.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">[[Image:Paul Tannery.jpg|thumb|Paul Tannery, early theoriser of a Pythagorean "unit-point atomism"]]
According to some [[20th century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophers]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tannery]] (1887), ''Pour l'histoire de la science Hellène'' (Paris), and [[John Raven|J. E. Raven]] (1948), ''Pythagoreans and Eleatics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), are the major purveyors of this view.&lt;/reF&gt; '''unit-point atomism''' was the philosophy of the [[Pythagoreans]], a conscious repudiation of [[Parmenides]] and the [[Eleatics]]. It stated that atoms were infinitesimally small ("point") yet possessed corporeality. It was a predecessor of [[Democritus|Democritean]] [[atomism]]. Most recent students of [[presocratic philosophy]], such as [[:de:Kurt von Fritz|Kurt von Fritz]], [[Walter Burkert]], [[Gregory Vlastos]], [[Jonathan Barnes]], and Daniel W. Graham have rejected that any form of atomism can be applied to the early Pythagoreans (before [[Ecphantus of Syracuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Vlastos]] and Daniel W. Graham (1996), ''Studies in Greek Philosophy: The Presocratics'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unit-point atomism was invoked in order to make sense of a statement ascribed to [[Zeno of Elea]] in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'': "these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides against those who make fun of him. . . My answer is addressed to the partisans of the many. . ."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]] (1982), ''The Presocratic Philosophers'' (London: Routledge), 232&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Parmenidean pluralists were supposedly unit-point atomists whose philosophy was essentially a reaction against the Eleatics. This hypothesis, however, to explain [[Zeno's paradoxes]], has been thoroughly discredited.

'''Welayah''' ({{Lang-ar|وِلاية}}) means "guardianship".

'''Welayah''' or '''Welaya''', is a word which a power gives authority/guardianship to a person, community, or country that is under the direction and rule on behalf of another. "Wali" is someone who has "Walayah" (authority or guardianship) over somebody else.  For example, in [[fiqh]], a father is ''wali'' of his children. The word Wali holds a special importance in Islamic spiritual life and it is used with various meanings, which relate to its different functions, which include: “next of kin, ally, friend, helper, guardian, patron, and saint”. In Islam, the phrase {{lang|ar|ولي الله}} ''walīyu l-Lāh''&lt;ref&gt;"Walī (a., pl. awliyā;)"&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to denote one vested with the "authority of God":

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ar|بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ اللّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ رَاكِعُونَ}}&lt;br&gt;"In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate: Only God is your ''wali'' and his messenger and those who believe, establish worship, and pay the poor due while bowing down (in prayer)."{{Cite quran|5|55}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terminology==
Two verbal noun are derived from the Arabic root of the word w-l-y {{lang|ar|ولي }}: Walayah and Wilayah which means to be near to something, to be a friend of someone or to have power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term welayah also has similarity with AWLIA.  The term Wali derives from [[Quran]]. It occurs also in a number of [[aḥādīṯ]] qodsīya or [[Hadith]] Qudsi, such as “whoever harms a friend (walī) of Mine, I declare war against him and others".&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Algar|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Welayah means literally "nearness" or " closeness" in which there is judgmental nearness on slavery. Also it means that being dependent of slave to Truth or God in annihilating. The welayah in the Sharia is the implementation of saying to others either will or not will.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šarīf Jorjānī|1993|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arab lexicographers and semanticist distinguish between two semantic fields and two vocalizations of wilayah namely "wilayah" and "walayah". According to that, walayah sometimes represent the sense of" assistance, alliance or nusrah while wilayah very invariably denotes the idea of " power, authority or sultan along with exception  happen here.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elmore |1999|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Concept of Walayah==
There are several kinds of Walayah: Wila of love or nearness which implies that the household of the prophet are his near relatives and the believers should love them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awliya Allah means the friends of Allah or the beloved of Allah.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Corbin||p=26,27"&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=26,27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walaya is  a key word in [[Shi‘ism]] that refers among other things to the nature and function of the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]].&lt;ref name="Newman in Meri 2006 734"&gt;{{harvnb| Newman in  Meri|2006|p=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hamid Algar]], the first definition of the Wali was provided by Abu’l-Qāsem Qošayrī (d. 467/1074-75) according to which: the wali has two kind of meaning including passive and active. Wali as passive designates one whose affaires are completely guided by God the exalted.  Wali as active designated one who takes it on himself to worship God and obey him. According to Qošayrī, there meaning in a Wali.&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"/&gt; In other hand, some men of mystic like Najm-al-dīn Dāya , define the welayah according to concept of love and friendship. Also we can find out the other meaning for wali as "closeness" which means" one who is close".&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"/&gt;  wali is an elected man among believers for the sake of his spiritual proximity to God Almighty.&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"/&gt; also walayah has a close relation to imamate; in other words there is inseparable linkage between Imamiyyah belief in the imamate and question of walayah which included five pillars such as love and devotion to the people of the household of the Prophet or Imams, following them in religion, obedience to their commands and abstention from what they prohibited, imitation of their actions and conduct, and recognition of their rights and belief in their imamate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lambton in Nasr|1989|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wila of leadership or authority over religious matters, such a position needs [[Ismah]] and the speech and deed of the leader is an example for others as is regarded in verses [http://tanzil.net/#33:21 33:21], [http://tanzil.net/#3:31 3:31].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whatever he says is a divine proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Imams]] or Awliya all make up the long chain of the Friends of God who carry and transmit the divine Covenant or welayah.&lt;ref name="Newman in Meri 2006 734"/&gt; According to  an esoteric interpretation, during the World of the Pact ('âlam* al-mîthâq)-a world with  the "pure beings" in the form of particles or shadows – we can see four parts oaths including oaths of love and fidelity (walâya) toward [[Muhammad]] and his prophetic mission toward the [[Imams]] and their sacred Cause, and also toward the [[Mahdi|Mahdî]] as universal savior at the end of world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Moezzi|1994|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi believes that it is the very term of welayah that denotes the ontological-theological status of the [[Imam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Moezzi|1994|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that walâya has a quiet simple translation along with two independent and complementary meanings. First it applies to the Imams of different prophets and also refers to  their ontological status or their sacred initiatory mission. Second meaning is the "chief," the ''master" of believers par excellence. In this acceptation, walî is a synonym of wasî or the inheritor or the heir. According to second meaning , walaya Applied to the faithful of the Imams. It also denotes the unfailing love, faith, and submission that the initiated owe to their holy initiating guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Moezzi|1994|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
shia believe that every great prophet is accompanied by one or more Imams in his mission.&lt;ref name="Newman in Meri 2006 734"/&gt;

===Walayah of socio-political leadership===

Spiritual Walayah which concerns changing the potentials to the action and making the people to get to the divine nearness, therefore there is a proof in every age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wali has a kind of creative power over the world and the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbin states that Walayah is the foundation of the prophecy and the mission of the messenger.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it concerns to the esoteric dimension of the prophetic reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu al-Hasan Sharif Isfahani, a student of Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, by many hadith argues that "the walayah is the inner, esoteric meaning (batin) of the Qur'anic Revelation.".&lt;ref name="Nasr 1988 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mulla Sadra]] states that the genealogical descendants of [[Muhammad]] and his spiritual heirs are [[Auliya|Awliya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dakake describes Walayah as a spiritual inheritance, esoteric knowledge, that Imams inherit from the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=26,27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which expresses the spiritual and political authority of ahl al-Bayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabatabaei regards that Walayah is the esoteric dimension of the Imamah and it is not just guiding the man, but it is conveying the man to the Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|tabatabaei|2008|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==

===By Quran===
By verse [http://tanzil.net/#42:23 42:23] and hadith of Ghadir, the prophet called the Muslims to love his pure, sinless family. Al-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Fakhru'd-Din ar-Razi state that verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:55 5:55] is revealed about [[Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=42,43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verse implies that Allah and His prophet is the Wali and the holders of the authority of the Muslims and the believers must accept their Wila.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=47,61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond of love further causes that the Muslims follow their speeches, deeds, behaviors. In Quran, the term walayah is used in conjunction with nusrah and it is not only used in relation to God but also is used for those who have perfect devotion to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=18,19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditions state that the verse [http://tanzil.net/#7:172 7:172] deals with the primordial pact (mithaq) that God has taken for His Lordship and the Walayah to the prophet and the ahl al-Bayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the term showes a link between faithfulness to God and devotion to the members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabatabaei claims that wherever Quran ascribes the guardianship for the prophet, it means authority and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tabatabaei|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:55 5:55], he claims that as the word Walayah once is used for Allah and His messenger and those who have believed, though they are under His Guardianship and at last he proves that the prophet's obedience is God's obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tabatabaei|2002|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Hadith===
ar-Razi quotes from az-Zamakhshari that the Prophet said: "Who so ever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died a martyr; Whosoever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died in forgiveness; Whosoever died in the love of the Household of Muhammad has died a believer and in the perfection of his faith. Whosoever dies in enmity to the family of Muhammad, dies an nbeliever. Whosoever dies in enmity of the family of Muhammad,will not smell the scent of Paradise."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=54,55,58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A hadith al-Baqir narrates that "Islam is built upon five: prayer, alms-giving, fasting, pilgrimageand walayah; and not one of them was proclaimed, the way walayah was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Motahhari|1982|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan ibn Ali narrates that after professing tawhid and the mission of the prophets, nothing is more important than professing to the Walayah of Imams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ja'far al-Sadiq told that Imam separates the people of the Heaven from the Hell, without any judgement, because their love for the Imam is their Heaven or Hell respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet tells Ali that he heard Allah say to him: "I wrote thy name and his name on My Throne before creating the creatures because of my love of you both. Whoever loves you and takes you as friends numbers among those drawn-nigh to Me. Whoever rejects your walayah and separates himself from you numbers among the impious transgressors against Me."."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Baqir states that "...There was never a prophet nor an angel who did not profess the religion of our love."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological and Philosophical Argument===
In [[Shia Islam|Shia]] tradition Walayah is not only one of the pillars of Islam, but it is the religion itself.&lt;ref name="Dakake 2007 119"&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Shia, Imamah is bound with the Walayah which is believing their Imamate and loving them, following and obeying them in religion and in their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia argue that the salvation is in the practice of the Walayah to the ahl al-Bayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an intention of love is required for the acceptance of every religious act. Many hadith by Imams narrate that "the first thing about which a man is questioned after his death is his love for ahl al-Bayt. If he has professed this love (walayah) and died professing it, then his deeds are acceptable to Allah. If he has not professed this love, then none of his works will be capable of being accepted by Allah." Muhammad Baqir Majlisi states that all Imamis agree that deeds without love to Imams are empty formality and Allah's approval is conditioned to Imam.&lt;ref name="Nasr 1988 169"/&gt; The ulu l-azm got this title by accepting the Walayah of the prophet and the Imams and Mahdi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet established the religion and Imams are to preserve the religion and to lead the people by the divine guidance (Walayah) which they inherited through the prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hadith narrates "He who knows himself knows his Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without theophanic form (Mazhar) and the Face of Allah, through whom Allah displays Himself, even to speak of Allah is impossible. Without the knowledge of Allah and Divine revelation, man will be trapped in ta'til (anthropomorphism)and [[tashbih]] (agnosticism).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=170,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Shia Islam|Shia]] the end of the prophecy was the beginning of Walayah which is its esoteric dimension and complementary. Walayah embraces both the idea  of knowledge (Ma'rifah) and the idea of love (Mahabbah). While prophecy is the exoteric (zahir) dimension of religion, Walayah is its esoteric (batin) dimension; they are simultaneous.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Corbin||p=26,27"/&gt; Walayah is the esoteric dimension of Shariah which renews the man and the religion spiritually in all the times and purifies the society without any need to a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|1994|p=79,80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wali carries the Muhammadan Light which has existed in all the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|1994|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this Muhammadan Light, Imam leads over the society, propagates the religion and guides the spiritual life of the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|1994|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ism believe that the cycle of the prophecy is succeeded by the cycle of Imamah which of its essentials is Walayah e.g. "the esoteric aspect of prophecy". They as the Friends of Allah (awliya' Allah) get the divine secrets through the divine inspiration and on this basis God make them the human Guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet reveals the shariah (zahir) and Imam brings the haqiqah (batin) of the religion so the batin is not separate from the zahir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Walayah is the foundation of the prophecy (nubuwah) and the messengership (risalah), so, closer to the inner realities, more sufficient and nearer to God.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993 44"/&gt; As Wali is concerned with guiding the spiritual life of the community, his presence in  the community is not effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As all the possible beings are dependent to self-existent, this dependence results on the authority of the self-existent; so Walayah is just his right and he can designate this authority to whom he chooses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negaresh|Seraji|Khatibi|2007|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The History of the Concept of Walayah==
The concept of Walayah is present at the early Shia history which indicates the legitimacy of Alids and an allegiance to ahl al-Bayt. The term derives from a statement from the Prophet at Ghadir Khumm, in which he reportedly designated Ali as the Mawla or Wali of the believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Imamate of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, the concept of Walayah, as a prerequisite for membership in the Shia community, becomes a fundamental concept in the Shia discourse and is reinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies a state of full devotion to ahl al-Bayt and a recognition of their exclusive right to legitimate leadership of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia argues that the perfection of the religion depends on the practice of Walayah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walayah as one of the fundamentals of Islam, deriven from Ghadir Khum traditions by al-Baqir, originates at his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it is presented as the essence of the religion in this period.&lt;ref name="Dakake 2007 119"/&gt; At the Time of al-Sadiq, the focus on the term Walayah changed to Imamah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this age, the word iman and Walayah is tied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Walayah is replaced by iman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the First Civil War, It is used side by side with the word enmity (adawah) reflecting the loyalty to the Shia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dakake|2007|pp=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a problem about definition of walī   and his attributes when wali compared to prophet. It seems that the notion of wali was superior to nabi in 3rd/9th. Someones such as  Abū Bakr Ḵarrāz(d. 286/899) and following him, Ḥakīm Termeḏī (d. between 295/907 and 310/922) refuted this superiority. They believed that the prophet hood has  superiority to Wali. However they maintained that there are many different categories for welayah. In this occasion, Ḥakīm Termeḏī divided wlai into two categories as welāya ʿāmma which is embracing the totality of the believers and welāya ḵāṣṣa  which is pertaining exclusively to the spiritual elect.&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"/&gt;
[[Ibn Arabi]] also refers to relation between nabi and wali. He believes that  although the prophet is indeed superior to wali, nabi is himself a wali besides being prophet. Ibn Arabi also mentioned that the wali-aspect of nabi's being is superior to the nabi-dimension. Also [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] agreed with the [[Ibn Arabi]]'s  view and explained it.&lt;ref name="Algar 1987"/&gt;

==Ismaili and Druze pillar==
{{Ismailis|Seven Pillars}}
'''Walayah''' or '''Walayat''' is a pillar of Shia Islam specifically in [[Ismaili]] and [[Druze]] denoting:
:''"love and devotion for [[God]], the Prophets, the [[Imam]] and the [[Da'i#Ismaili|dai]].".
{{Druze|Beliefs}}
One should have '''Walayat''' (guardianship of the faith) on the wali. If someone has been made Wali of yours than have full walayat (guardianship of faith) of him. [[Dawoodi Bohras]] believe Walayah to be the most important of the seven pillars of Islam. It is the acceptance of guardian ship of Allah, through their Dai, Imam, Wasi (Wali) Ali and Nabi Muhammad. To accept that Ali is Wali of Allah is doing "Walayat" of Ali. For Shia "Walayat' of Ali ( and his further representative) is a must.

There is an incident famous amongst the [[Dawoodi Bohra]] which confirm how they mean and weigh the principle of ''walayah''. An order was issued by the 19th ''Da'i al-Mutlaq'', Syedna Idris Imaduddin, to his ''Wali al-Hind'', Moulai Adam, to follow a person named "Sakka". Moulai Adam, along with his followers, willingly performed prayer behind "Sakka", who was a simple water carrier by trade. This showed that Adam had full ''walayah'' for his Da'i and had willingly accepted his guardianship and followed his order.&lt;ref&gt;'Vali-e-Hind Maulai Adam bin Suleman [a.q.] 
By- Mu. Saifuddin Surka NKD'
{{cite web |url=http://malumaat.com/archives/articles/moulaiadam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120215648/http://malumaat.com/archives/articles/moulaiadam.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Wali]]'' in the most literal form of the word  means "a person, community, or country that is under the direction and rule of another". It is an Arabic word derived from the root ''wly'' {{lang|ar|ولي }}, which carries the basic meanings of “friendship, assistance”, and “authority or power”.&lt;ref name=eorl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/walyah-eorl-14/|title=Walyah|work=[[BookRags]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; from The word holds a special importance in Islamic spiritual life and it is used with various meanings, which relate to its different functions, which include: “next of kin, ally, friend, helper, guardian, patron, and saint”.&lt;ref name=eorl/&gt; The eternal prophetic reality has two aspects: extoric and [[esoteric]].
In its connotation of sainthood, the word describes an innate sense of selflessness and separation from one’s own wants in favor of awareness of being “under the dominion of the all-living, self-subsistent one and of the need to acquire nearness to the necessarily existent being – which is God.”.&lt;ref name=Sainthood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fethullahgulen.org/sufism-2/2014-walaya-sainthood.html|title=Walaya sainthood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals that have attained this level are believed to be both favored and live in a state of nearness with God. The first step in sainthood is indicated in the [[Qur'an]] verse (2:257):
&lt;blockquote&gt;''God is He Who loves, guards and directs those who believe; He has led them out of all kinds of darkness into the light, and keeps them firm therein.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and also in (10:62):
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Know well that the confidants (saintly servants) of God-there will be no reason for them to fear (both in this world and the next, for they shall always find My help and support with them), nor shall they grieve''.&lt;ref name=Sainthood/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One who has been favored with sainthood is called a ''[[wali]]'' or ''Waliullah'', meaning a saint.&lt;ref name=Sainthood/&gt; ''Waliullah'' may also be translated as a word used to describe a certain group of people selected by God from among millions of others to be “His friends” because of their closeness to God.  And thus, a saint, or a friend to God, is thought to have favor in the eyes of the Lord.&lt;ref name=Sainthood/&gt;
For an individual to achieve walaya, or sainthood, a person must first become, and remain, a pristine example of a truly religious person, an example for all other Muslims to look up to. Upon these individuals, the peace and blessing of God have been placed.&lt;ref name=Sainthood/&gt; In the Qur'an, walaya is expressed in the fable of the rich but immoral owner of two gardens and his poor but pious companion. The rich man ends up a loser despite his prosperity and power, for ultimately, the walayah belongs to God, the Truth (18:44).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Bookrags.com/tandf/walayah-wali-wilayah-tf/|title=WALAYAH,  WALI, WILAYAH|work=BookRags}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said that “Saints, as exemplary Muslims, represent the highest virtues and religious commitment worthy of emulation."{{cite quote|date=April 2010}} These individuals who have reached such statuses in the Muslim religion are thought to bridge the gap between followers and their God and the common folk. Waliyy, or saints can be both men and women.

[[File:Walter Charleton b1619.jpg|thumb|Walter Charleton]]
'''Walter Charleton''' (2 February 1619 – 24 April 1707) was a [[natural philosopher]] and [[English people|English]] writer. 

According to Jon Parkin, he was "the main conduit for the transmission of [[Epicurean]] ideas to England".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae'' (1999), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was the son of the rector of [[Shepton Mallett]] in [[Somerset]], where he was born 2 February 1619. He received his early education from his father, and when sixteen entered [[Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], under the tuition of [[John Wilkins]]. At the early age of 22 (1641) he received the degree of M.D. and in the same year was appointed physician to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who was then at [[Oxford]]. In 1650 Charleton settled in London, and was on 8 April admitted a candidate of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]]. A royalist, he was appointed physician to the exiled king Charles II but remained in London writing, in Russell Street, [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;[[:s:Charleton, Walter (DNB00)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was continued in his office of physician at the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and was one of the first elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society|fellows of the Royal Society]] in 1663; on 23 January 1676 he was admitted a [[fellow of the Royal College of Physicians]]. He gave the first lectures delivered in the Cutlerian Theatre in Warwick Lane, in 1680 delivered the [[Harveian oration]], and was president in 1689 and 1691. After his last year of presidency at the College of Physicians, Charleton left London and a dwindling medical practice. He retired to [[Nantwich]]; but returned to London, and was senior censor in the College of Physicians from 1698 to 1706, and delivered Harveian orations in 1702 and 1706, when he was also appointed Harveian librarian. He died 24 April 1707.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; 

He had in early life read much in [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|Van Helmont]], and spent time in reading and composition, rather than with patients. [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Lord Dorchester]], [[Sir Francis Prujean]] and [[George Ent]] were his friends.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Work==
He was a copious writer also on [[theology]], [[natural history]], and [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], and published ''[[Chorea Gigantum]]'' (1663) to prove that [[Stonehenge]] was built by the [[Danish people|Danes]]. Charleton claimed it was used by them as a place of assembly, and of the inauguration of kings. The only argument is that similar stone works exist in Denmark, a fact supplied to Charleton by the Danish antiquary, [[Wormius]], with whom he had corresponded on the book of [[Inigo Jones]] in which Stonehenge is said to be a Roman temple. The ''Chorea Gigantum'' had a poem by [[John Dryden]] written in its praise, the ''Epistle to Dr. Charleton'', prefixed to the presentation copy given to the king.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

He was one of the "character" writers, and in this kind of literature wrote an essay ''[[A Brief Discourse concerning the Different Wits of Men]]'' (1675).

'''Yuthok Yonten Gonpo the Younger''' ([[Wylie transliteration]] '''g.yu thog gsar ma yon tan mgon po''') (1126–1202) was a Tibetan doctor and ''[[ngakpa]]'' (lay, non-monastic tantric practitioner), credited with composing the ''Four Medical Tantras'' (''rgyud bzhi''), a four-book treatise on [[Traditional Tibetan Medicine]] which forms the main course of study in the Tibetan medical tradition. He is widely regarded as the main founder of Tibetan medicine, mostly based on his composition of the ''Four Medical Tantras''. His other important contribution to Tibetan culture was the ''[[Yuthok Nyingthig |Yuthok Nyingthik]]'', whose full name is the ''Yuthok Nyingthik Guru Sādhanā, ‘Compassionate Sunlight for Dispersing Suffering’s Darkness’'' (''g.yu thog snying thig bla sgrub sdug bsngal mun sel nyi ma’i ’od zer''), which is the main Tantric Buddhist practice-cycle associated with Tibetan medicine. It is traditionally considered to be an important spiritual component of healing in Tibetan medical culture, and moreover is regarded in all Tibetan Buddhist traditions as a very special method for attaining awakening and realization quickly. 

==Biography==

Born in the village of Goshi Rethang in Western [[Tibet]], his father was Yuthok Khyungpo Dorje and his mother Pema Odenma.&lt;ref&gt;''Mirror of Beryl: a Historical Introduction to Tibetan Medicine Desi Sangye Gyatso'', translated by Gavin Kilty, Wisdom Publications 2009. {{ISBN|0-86171-467-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuthok was from a family lineage of royal court Traditional Tibetan Medicine doctors who trace their origin to the time of King Lha Thothori (441–561).&lt;ref&gt;Donden, Y., &amp; Hopkins, J. (1997) ''Health through Balance: an introduction to Tibetan medicine.'' Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.&lt;/ref&gt; At age eight, he began to study—with his father and other teachers, including [[Manjusri]]—a wide range of topics from medicine, [[Buddhism]], and the arts and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Donden, Y., &amp; Hopkins, J. (1997) ''Health through balance: An introduction to Tibetan medicine.'' Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.&lt;/ref&gt; 
At age fourteen, he began traveling through Central Tibet, where he met a Geshe called Roton Konchok Kyap who transmitted the ''Four Tantras: the Essence of Ambrosia Secret Instruction'' to Yuthok.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, F. (2007) Buddhism and the historicizing of medicine in thirteenth century Tibet. ''Asian Medicine: Tradition and Modernity'' 2(2), 204-222.&lt;/ref&gt; At age eighteen, he traveled to [[India]] for the first time, where he studied the ''Eight Branches of Healing'', ''Somaradza'', and other treatises on medicine with Paldan Phreng-ba.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzang, Jampal Ven. Rinpoche (1976) ''Tibetan Medicine: illustrated in original texts''. University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-03048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When he was twenty-one, Yuthok returned to Tibet, where he set up a clinic and began teaching medicine to his students. At thirty-one, he returned to India, where he received a teaching which later became known as the ''Yuthok Nyingthig'', ''The Innermost Essence of Yuthok''.&lt;ref&gt;Chenagtsang, Nida (2011) ''The Tibetan Art of Good Karma: The hidden treasure of the Turquoise Way'' Sorig Publications Australia {{ISBN|978-0-9808232-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he traveled to India six times.&lt;ref&gt;''Mirror of Beryl: A Historical Introduction to Tibetan Medicine Desi Sangye Gyatso'', translated by Gavin Kilty, Wisdom Publications 2009. {{ISBN|0-86171-467-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His heart-disciple was Sumton Yeshe Sung, who received the ''Four Tantras'' and the ''Yuthok Nyingthig''.
It is said that at age seventy-six, Yuthok gathered his students for a final teaching before attaining the [[Rainbow Body]] and departing to Tunadug, the pure land of the [[Medicine Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Kunzang, Jampal Ven. Rinpoche (1976) ''Tibetan Medicine: illustrated in original texts''. University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-03048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
'''''The Secret Quintessential Instructions on the Eight Branches of the Ambrosia Essence Tantra''''' or '''''The Four Tantras'''''
This is a collection of four tantras which comprise the basis of Traditional Tibetan Medicine. It is divided into the ''Root Tantra'' (''rtsa rgyud''), ''The Explanatory Tantra'' (''bshe rgyud''), ''The Oral-instruction Tantra'' (''man ngag rgyud''), and ''The Subsequent Tantra'' (''phyi ma rgyud''). The ''Root Tantra'' has six chapters and gives (1) an introduction, (2) general outline of topics, (3) the basis of disease, (4) diagnosis, (5) methods of treatment, and (6) an enumeration of the metaphors used in Traditional Tibetan Medicine. The ''Explanatory Tantra'' is divided into eleven divisions and thirty-one chapters, and covers (1) a summary of fundamentals, (2) the life cycle, (3) fundamentals of pathology, (4) behavior and lifestyle, (5) diet, (6) pharmacology, (7) tools of the physician, (8) health and prevention, (9) diagnosis, (10) method of treatment, and (11) ethics of a physician. The ''Oral-instruction Tantra'' has fifteen divisions that are explained in ninety-two chapters; the divisions include (1) pathology of the three humors, (2) internal disorders, (3) fever, (4)pathology of the upper parts of the body, (5) pathology of the solid and hollow organs, (6) genital disorders, (7) common diseases, (8) dermatology, (9) pediatrics, (10) gynecological disorders, (11) disorders caused by spirit provocation, (12) injury, (13) toxicology, (14) longevity, and (15) aphrodisiacs. The ''Subsequent Tantra'' has four topics in twenty-five chapters, including (1) diagnosis, (2) pharmacological formulae, (3) purifying therapies, and (4) external therapies.

'''''[[Yuthok Nyingthik]]''''' '''''(g.yu thog snying thig)''''' is a practice of [[tantra]] featuring [[Buddhist]] practices which combine [[Traditional Tibetan Medicine]] and [[Vajrayana]]. 

These practices are part of a family lineage held by ''ngakpa''s that were handed down through the Yuthok family until they were taught to Sumton Yeshe Zung, the heart-disciple of Yuthok Yonten Gonpo the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;''Mirror of Beryl: A Historical Introduction to Tibetan Medicine Desi Sangye Gyatso'', translated by Gavin Kilty, Wisdom Publications 2009. {{ISBN|0-86171-467-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent lineage holders include the late [[Khenpo]] Truro Tsenam, the late Khenpo Tsultrim Gyaltsen, and Micho Khedrub Gyatso Rinpoche. Currently, Dr. Nida Chenagtsang is teaching this lineage as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chenagtsang, Nida (2011) ''The Tibetan Art of Good Karma: The Hidden Treasure of the Turquoise Way'' Sorig Publications Australia {{ISBN|978-0-9808232-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yuthok Nyingthik'' is a complete Vajrayana cycle, including [[Ngöndro]], [[Generation stage]] (''bskyed rim'') practices including four forms of Yuthok Guru Yoga and practices of Deva (Yidam) and Dakini, [[Completion stage]] (''rdzogs rim'') practices, including the [[Six Yogas]], and [[Dzogchen]]. The cycle includes additional practices: ''mendrub'' (''sman sgrub'') or rituals for empowering and blessing medicine, healing and protection mantras, several offering rituals, longevity practices, Medical Protectors, and instructions on a form of pulse diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, F. (2007) Buddhism and the historicizing of medicine in thirteenth century Tibet.
