Adipogenesis has been one of the most intensively studied models of cellular differentiation.[[File:Differentiated 3T3-L1 Cell line stained with Oil O Red.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Differentiated Adipocyte stained with [[Oil Red O]]]]

==Introduction==
[[Adipocytes]] play a vital role in energy homeostasis and process the largest energy reserve as [[triglycerol]] in the body of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornelius|first=P|author2=MacDougald, OA|author3=Lane, MD|title=Regulation of adipocyte development.|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|year=1994|volume=14|pages=99–129|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531|pmid=7946535|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adipocytes stay in a dynamic state, they start expanding when the energy intake is higher than the expenditure and undergo mobilization when the energy expenditure exceeds the intake. This process is highly regulated by counter regulatory hormones to which these cells are very sensitive. The hormone [[insulin]] promotes expansion whereas the counter hormones [[epinephrine]], [[glucagon]],and 
[[ACTH]] promote mobilization. Adipogenesis is a tightly regulated cellular differentiation process, in which the preadipocytes are transformed into differentiated adipocyte cells. Comparing with cells from other lineage, the in vitro differentiation of fat cells is authentic and recapitulates most of the characteristic feature of in vivo adipogenesis. The key features of differentiated adipocytes are morphological change, growth arrest, high expression of lipogenic genes and production of hormones like [[leptin]], [[resistin]] (in the mouse, not in humans) and [[TNF-alpha]].

==Models of differentiation==

===In vitro===
The transition of the fibroblast cells to mature adipocytes is one of the best characterized processes of cellular differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDougald|first=OA|author2=Lane, MD|title=Transcriptional regulation of gene expression during adipocyte differentiation.|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=1995|volume=64|pages=345–73|pmid=7574486|doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.64.070195.002021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary preadipose cells can be isolated from the [[stromal vascular fraction]] of adipose tissue; and when treated in cell culture with a combination of adipogenic effectors, they can differentiate into adipocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkland|first=JL|author2=Hollenberg, CH|author3=Gillon, WS|title=Age, anatomic site, and the replication and differentiation of adipocyte precursors.|journal=The American Journal of Physiology|date=Feb 1990|volume=258|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=C206-10|pmid=2305864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strongylocentrotus purpuratus 1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]'', a well-armoured sea urchin]]
'''Armour''' or '''armor''' in animals is external or superficial protection against attack by predators, formed as part of the body (rather than the behavioural use of protective external objects), usually through the hardening of body tissues, outgrowths or secretions. It has therefore mostly developed in 'prey' species. 

==Composition==
Armoured structures are usually composed of hardened [[mineral]] deposits, [[chitin]], [[bone]] or [[keratin]].

==Species with armour==
Armour is evident on numerous animal species from both current and prehistoric times. [[Dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', as well as other [[Thyreophora]] (armoured dinosaurs such as [[Ankylosauria]] and [[Stegosauria]]), grew thick [[Plate (anatomy)|plate]]-like armour on their bodies as well as offensive armour appendages such as the [[thagomizer]] or a [[Club (anatomy)|club]]. The armour took many forms, including [[osteoderm]]s, spikes, horns, and plates. Other dinosaurs such as [[ceratopsian]] dinosaurs as well as some [[sauropod]]s such as ''[[Saltasaurus]]'', grew armour to defend themselves, although armour in sauropods overall is uncommon.

In modern times, some [[mollusc]]s employ the use of [[Animal shell|shells]] as armour, and armour is evident in the [[chitin]]ous [[exoskeleton]] of [[arthropod]]s. Fish use armour in the form of [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], whether 'cosmoid', 'ganoid' or 'placoid' and in some cases [[Spine (zoology)|spines]], such as on fish such as the [[stickleback]]. The [[chalk]]y plate, or [[cuttlebone]], of [[cuttlefish]] also acts as armour. Most [[reptile]]s have scaly skin which protects them from predators in addition to water retention; the [[crocodile|crocodile's]] [[Crocodilian armor|exoskeleton]] and the shells of the [[Testudines|Chelonia]]: [[tortoise]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[terrapin]]s.

Numerous [[mammal]]s employ the use of spines and body armour, although not as sturdy as reptilian armour, like the spines of the [[echidna]]s and of [[porcupine]]s and [[hedgehog]]s. The bony shell of the [[armadillo]]s and the extinct ''[[Glyptodon]]'' were very much like ''Ankylosaurus''' armour and some modern armadillos curl up into a ball when threatened, making them unexposed due to their armour. Similarly, the [[hair]]y plate-like scales of the [[pangolin]] are employed in the same way and are constructed of the same material used in the offensive armour, the horn, of the [[rhinoceros]].

==Usage==
Armour, although all used for the sole intent to ward off attackers, can be split into defensive and offensive armour. Examples of offensive armour are [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[hoof|hooves]], [[antler]]s, [[claw]]s and [[beak]]s, [[Club (zoology)|clubs]] and [[pincer (biology)|pincers]], as developed in some [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s (including dinosaurs, such as the [[dromaeosaurid]] claw and the [[ceratopsian]] horn) and [[arthropod]]s. Offensive armour is often used in conjunction with defensive armour and in some cases makes an animal almost unassailable.

[[File:2016_ARIH_LOGO.jpg|thumb|200px| The Official ARIH Logo]]

The '''Asian Route of Industrial Heritage''' ('''ARIH''') is a network ([[Scenic route|theme route]]) which has the purpose to link the most important [[industrial heritage]] sites in South-east Asia. The creation of this theme route is based upon the well established example of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].

==History==
This initiative started with the “Taipei Declaration for Asian Industrial Heritage” made on November 2012, at the 15th [[TICCIH]] Congress in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdd.com.tw/ticcih/0123/TICCIH2012-Taipei%20Declaration.jpg Taipei Declaration for Asian Industrial Heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421000021/http://www.tdd.com.tw/ticcih/0123/TICCIH2012-Taipei%20Declaration.jpg |date=April 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is co-organised by various associations for industrial heritage conservation in Asia. And, on September 2014, experts and scholars from TICCIH (International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage), ERIH, and the Asian Region signed a Memorandum of Understanding to initiate its establishment.

==Anchor Points==
The route consists out of Anchor Points, filled in by historical or tourist important Industrial Heritage Sites. Those so called Anchor Points are now (2016) found in Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, India, and China.

In other words, the location of a new leaf on a growing stem is directly related to the amount of space between the previous two leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Available space theory| publisher=Dictionary of Botany| accessdate=2012-05-24| url=http://botanydictionary.org/available-space-theory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on ideas first put forth by Hoffmeister in 1868, Snow and Snow hypothesized in 1947 that leaves sprouted in the first available space on the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meristems, Growth, and Development in Woody Plants: An Analytical Review of Anatomical, Physiological, and Morphogenic Aspects| last=Romberger| first=John| publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office| year=1963| page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barristers' Ball''' is an annual event held at most [[law school in the United States|law schools]] in [[common law]] countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  It is generally a formal/semi-formal affair, often near the end of the academic year, conducted by the institution's [[Student Bar Association]] as a school-wide gathering.

Maize Bx-genes are tightly linked, a feature that has been considered uncommon for plant genes of a biosynthetic pathways. Especially notable are genes encoding the different enzymatic functions BX1, BX2 and BX8 and which are found within about 50 kilobases (Frey et al. 1995,&lt;ref name=Frey95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=M|author2=Kliem, R |author3=Saedler, H |author4= Gierl, A |title=Expression of a cytochrome P450 gene family in maize.|journal=Molecular &amp; general genetics : MGG|date=Jan 6, 1995|volume=246|issue=1|pages=100–9|pmid=7823905|doi=10.1007/bf00290138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1997&lt;ref name=Frey97 /&gt; ) Results from [[wheat]] and [[rye]] indicate that the cluster is an ancient feature (Nomura et al. 2003).&lt;ref name=Nomura03&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nomura|first=T|author2=Ishihara, A |author3=Imaishi, H |author4=Ohkawa, H |author5=Endo, TR |author6= Iwamura, H |title=Rearrangement of the genes for the biosynthesis of benzoxazinones in the evolution of Triticeae species.|journal=Planta|date=Sep 2003|volume=217|issue=5|pages=776–82|pmid=12734755|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wheat the cluster is split into two parts. The wheat genes Bx1 and Bx2 are located in close proximity on chromosome 4 and wheat Bx3, Bx4 and Bx5 map to the short arm of chromosome 5; an additional Bx3 copy was detected on the long arm of chromosome 5B (Nomura et al. 2003). Recently, additional biosynthetic clusters have been detected in other plants for other biosynthetic pathways and this organization might be common in plants (Osbourn 2010).&lt;ref name=Osbourn2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osbourn|first=A|title=Gene clusters for secondary metabolic pathways: an emerging theme in plant biology.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=Oct 2010|volume=154|issue=2|pages=531–5|pmid=20921179|doi=10.1104/pp.110.161315|pmc=2949040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maize Genes ==
The [[bx1 benzoxazin1|bx1]] gene encodes a protein, BX1, that forms [[indol]] from indol-3-glycerol phosphate in the [[plastid]]. It is the first step in the pathway and determines much of the natural variation in levels of DIMBOA in maize.&lt;ref name=Butron2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butrón|first=A|author2=Chen, YC |author3=Rottinghaus, GE |author4= McMullen, MD |title=Genetic variation at bx1 controls DIMBOA content in maize.|journal=TAG.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15209">'''Calming signals''' is a term coined by [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[Dog training|dog trainer]] [[Turid Rugaas]] to describe the [[Signal|signals]] used by [[Dog communication|dogs to communicate]] with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rugaas|first1=Turid|title=Calming Signals - The Art of Survival|url=http://en.turid-rugaas.no/calming-signals---the-art-of-survival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rugaas|first1=Turid|title=On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals |date=2006|publisher=Dogwise Pub.|location=Wenatchee, Wash.|isbn=1929242360|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canine Calming Signals and Stres|url=http://www.greenacreskennel.com/dog-behavior-and-training/canine-calming-signals-and-stress|website=greenacreskennel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calming Signals|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/lost-found-dogs-virginia/calming-signals/457474250995889|website=Facebook - Lost and Found Dogs Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rugaas there are at least 30 calming signals. What signals dog use depends on the [[dog]]. They may use a subset of these signals. The signals, however, are universal and all dogs understand all signals even if they do not use them. Dogs are known to use these signals with humans too.

The term has been used by other canine behaviour experts to explain [[dog behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Majchrowski|first1=Mary|title=Calming Signals in Dogs and How We Can Use Them|url=http://www.pet360.com/dog/behavior-and-training/calming-signals-in-dogs-and-how-we-can-use-them/_RUS-yjVgkmZlZZv0o9Jug?intcid=AR17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tripp|first1=Rollan|last2=Tripp|first2=Susan|title=What is Canine Communication?|url=http://www.animalbehavior.net/LIBRARY/Canine/PositiveDogParenting/PDPBodyLanguage.htm|website=AnimalBehaviour.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilde|first1=Nicole|title=Calming Signals|url=http://www.nicolewilde.com/articlesbynicole/calming-signals/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petpotential.ca/resources/canine-body-language-calming-signals/|website=Pet Potential|title=Canine Body Language &amp; Calming Signals

There are three main forms of communication used by dogs: [[Sound|auditory]], [[Visual perception|visual]], and [[Olfaction|olfactory]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I8HU_3ycrrEC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;ots=Bd7xYEh2ta&amp;dq=dogs%20wagging%20tails&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=dogs%20wagging%20tails&amp;f=false|title=The Domestic Dog: Its Evolution, Behaviour and Interactions with People|last=Serpell|first=James|date=1995-09-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521425377|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory includes a diverse range of sounds, such as grunts, whines, yelps, screams, tooth snapping, growling, coughing, and [[Bark (sound)|barking]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Visual communication often originates from the behaviour of [[Gray wolf|wolves]], displayed in the form of either aggressive/fearful acts, or dominant/submissive acts. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, an [[Aggression|aggressive]] wolf is characterized by pricked ears, with both head and tail held high. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similar behaviour would be displayed during an aggressive visual act of a domestic dog. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Olfactory communication is often used to distinguish a female during the period of heightened [[sexual arousal]] and activity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males are able to detect this sexual period from long distances, simply by the smell of her [[urine]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Use of signals by dogs ==
According to Rugaas, the following is a list of some typical situations that dogs are naturally uncomfortable with and try to communicate their [[Comfort|discomfort]] with calming signals.

* A person bending over the dog
* Direct, prolonged [[eye contact]]
* A person's face too close to the dog's face (e.g., kissing on the nose)
* Someone sounds angry
* There's yelling and quarreling in the family
* Someone is walking directly at the dog
* The dog is excited with happiness and anticipation (for instance, by the door, about to go for a walk)
* Someone asks the dog to do something he does not feel like doing
* [[dog training|Training]] sessions are too long and the dog gets tired
* The dog is confused
* A person [[Hug#In_non-humans|hug]]s the dog
* The dog feels trapped

== Examples ==

=== Licking/tongue flicks ===
[[File:licking.png|thumb|150px|alt=Lip Licking is a calming signal|Lip licking is a calming signal]]
[[Licking]] is a signal that is used often, especially by black dogs, dogs with a lot of hair around their faces, and others whose facial expressions for some reason are more difficult to see than those of dogs with lighter colors, visible eyes and long noses.

Sometimes it is nothing more than a very quick lick, the tip of the tongue is barely visible outside the mouth, and only for a short second. But other dogs see it, understand it and respond to it. 
&lt;gallery caption="Lip Licking"&gt;

File:Licking 1.jpg|Lip licking at the camera is typical reaction – a calming signal
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Sniffing the ground ===
[[File:Sniffing.png|thumb|150px|Sniffing the ground is a calming signal]]
[[Sniffing (behavior)|Sniffing]] the ground may look anything like moving the nose swiftly down toward the ground and back up again, to sticking the nose to the ground and sniffing persistently for several minutes.

=== Turning away/turning of the head ===
[[File:Looking away.png|thumb|upright|150px|Looking away is a calming signal]]
The dog can turn his head slightly to one side, turn the head completely over to the side, or turn completely around so that the back and tail is facing whoever the dog is calming. This is one of the signals seen most of the time in dogs.

When someone is approaching a dog from the front, he will probably turn away in one of these ways. When people or other dogs seem angry, aggressive or threatening, one of these variations of the signal may be seen. When the dog is taken by surprise or takes someone by surprise, he will turn away quickly. The same happens when someone is staring or acting in a threatening way. In most cases, this signal will make the other dog calm down.
&lt;gallery caption="Looking or Turning Away"&gt;
File:Head Turn to being Hugged.jpg|When hugged, dogs turn away. It's a reminder that you are being "impolite" – a calming signal
File:Full Body when approached.jpg|When one dog approaches the other turns away – a calming signal
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Play bow ===
Going down with [[dog communication|front legs in a bowing position]] can be an invitation to play if the dog is moving legs from side to side in a playful manner. Just as often, the dog is standing still while bowing and is using the signal to calm someone down. These signals often have double meanings and may be used in many different ways – often the invitation to play is a calming signal by itself because the dog is making a potentially dangerous situation less tense and diverts with something safe.

When two dogs approach each other too abruptly, you will often see a play bow. This is one of the signals that is easy to see, especially because they remain standing in the bow position for a few seconds.

=== Walking slowly ===
High speed can be upsetting to many dogs, and they might want to go in to try and stop the one who is running. This is partly a hunting behavior and is triggered by the sight of a running human or dog. If the one running is coming straight at the dog, it involves a threat and a defense mechanism sets in. A dog that is insecure tends to move slowly. If you wish to make a dog feel safer, then you can move slower.

=== Freezing ===
[[File:Moving slow.png|thumb|150px|Lifting a paw is a calming signal]]
"[[Fight-or-flight response|Freezing]]" is when the dog stops abruptly and remains completely still, often looking out of the corner of his eye. This behavior is believed to have something to do with hunting behavior – when the prey is running, the dog attacks. Once the prey stops, the dog will stop too. We can often see this when dogs are chasing cats. This behavior, however, is used in several different situations. When you get angry and aggressive and appear threatening, the dog will often freeze and not move in order to help you calm down. Other times the dog may walk slowly, freeze, and then move slowly again. Very often a dog will stop and remain still when someone is approaching. Should a dog be in a conflict situation with a human or dog and is unable to escape, freezing may be one attempt to calm the other dog or person.

=== Sitting down ===
To sit down, or an even stronger signal, to sit down with the back turned towards someone – for instance the owner – has a very calming effect. It is often seen when one dog wants to calm another dog who is approaching too quickly. Dogs may sit down with their backs turned against the owner when he or she sounds too strict or angry.

=== Walking in a curve ===
This signal is frequently used as a calming signal, and it is the main reason why dogs may react so strongly towards meeting dogs when they are forced to approach head on. Their instincts tell them that it is wrong to approach someone like that. Forcing dogs to approach each other head on can cause them to feel anxious and defensive, and can eventually result in aggressive behavior like barking and lunging at other dogs. Dogs, when given a chance, will walk in curves around each other. This is what they do when they meet off leash and are free to do things their own way.

=== Yawning  ===
[[File:Yawning.png|thumb|150px|Yawning is a calming signal]]
The dog may [[yawn]] when someone bends over him, when you sound angry, when there is yelling and quarreling in the family, when the dog is at the vet's office, when someone is walking directly at the dog, when the dog is excited with happiness and anticipation – for instance by the door when you are about to go for a walk, when you ask the dog to do something he doesn´t feel like doing, when your training sessions are too long and the dog gets tired, when you have said NO for doing something you disapprove of, and in many other situations.

Other animals seem to use [[Yawn|yawning as a signal too]]. Humans can use it too to calm down slightly stressed dogs.
[[File:Yawning.jpg|thumb|center|Yawning is a calming signal]]

=== "Smiling"  ===
Either by pulling the corners of the mouth up and back, or by showing the teeth as in a grin.
[[File:Smiling 2.jpg|thumb|center|"Smiling" is a calming signal]]

=== Wagging the tail  ===
Should a dog show signs of anxiety, calming or anything that clearly has little to do with happiness, a wagging tail isn’t always an expression of happiness.

=== Urinating ===
[[Urination#Dog-like_mammals_.28Canidae.29|Marking objects or locations with urine]] to claim the space as their own, or simply urinating in place.

=== Soft face ===
Making the face round and smooth with the ears close to the head in order to act like a [[puppy]]. ("No one will harm a puppy" is what the dog believes.)

=== Fiddling ===
Some dogs act like puppies, jumping around and act silly, throwing sticks around, etc. if they discover a fearful dog nearby. This is intended to have a calming effect.

=== Lying down ===
Might be seen when puppy play gets too rough. People can use this too by lying down if the dog is getting too excited.

=== Splitting ===
This is easy to observe when multiple dogs are interacting with each other. When tensions rise a bit between two dogs, a third dog might try to put his body between the two dogs. Dogs do this when they perceive tensions to rise between people too. If a dog is getting tense about something he sees at a distance, people can step between the dog and the disturbing view to "Split" and achieve the same result
[[File:Splitting.jpg|thumb|upright|Humans can stand between the dog and the threat he perceives as a way to "Split"]]

== When do dogs stop giving calming signals ==
According to Rugaas, dogs stop using calming signals in the following situations:
* If they have been [[Punishment|punished]] for using the signals in the past
* If they have been [[Dog bite|attacked]] when using them in the past
* If the stress levels are too high
* Pulling on the leash when they are giving the signal to another dog

The Big Draw, formerly the '''Campaign for Drawing,''' is a UK registered charity that promotes [[drawing]] and visual literacy. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Guild of St George]], and is now an independent charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100917/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Draw believes that drawing is a universal language that can unite people across generations, backgrounds and borders. It is inspired by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artist and writer, [[John Ruskin]], whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts [[educational]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], the Campaign demonstrates that drawing is a [[life skill]]: an essential tool for learning, expression and invention. Its [[publications]] for [[teacher]]s and other educators provide comprehensive evidence that drawing supports formal and informal [[learning]].&lt;ref name="campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignfordrawing.org]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511163743/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/|date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/ |title=The Campaign for Drawing - Press releases |publisher=NESTA |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213131726/http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/# |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/secretofdrawing/ |title=Arts - The Secret of Drawing |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013133744/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503153730/http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity leads a programme of advocacy, empowerment and engagement, and is the driving force behind The Big Draw Festival – the world’s biggest celebration of drawing.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The charity supports established and emerging artists through The John Ruskin Prize and exhibition, and regular events, awards and competitions.

The Big Draw manages collaborative research projects, campaigns and educational conferences on visual literacy, digital technology and STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Maths, Science).

==The Big Draw Festival==
The Big Draw charity is the founder and driving force behind The Big Draw Festival, which takes place each year in over 20 countries around the world. 

Events often take place at notable venues throughout the UK including [[The British Museum]], [[The National Gallery]] and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as well as schools, community centres, parks and village halls. The 2013 Big Draw highlight event offered visitors 20 different activities in the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Previous launches were held at the Natural History Museum, V&amp;A (twice), Trafalgar Square, St Pancras International Station, Welcome Collection and the British Library.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Partnerships==
The Big Draw receives no core funding. Previously, it has been sponsored by bodies as diverse as NESTA, [[Arts Council England]] (ACE), [[Crayola]], [[Daler-Rowney]], Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Barbara Whatmore Charitable Trust, [[Financial Times]], Heritage Lottery Fund, [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], [[Persil]], [[Puffin]], [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] and [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), Derwent and Cass Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145232/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:701 East Lake Drive, Cape May Point, NJ.jpg|thumb|Northwood Center in Cape May Point of the Cape May Bird Observatory]]
The '''Cape May Bird Observatory''' was founded in 1975 in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]] and is sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society.  The purpose of the Cape May Bird Observatory is to conduct research, encourage conservation, and organize educational and recreational birding activities.  It consists of two separate centers: the Center for Research and Education in Cape May Court House in the central part of Cape May County, and the Northwood Center in Cape May Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape May Bird Observatory: Our Centers|url=http://www.njaudubon.org/sectioncapemaybirdobservatory/aboutcmbo/ourcenters.aspx|publisher=[[New Jersey Audubon Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bird migration==
Cape May is at a crossroads for bird migration. Every spring and fall, thousands of migrating birds pass through the area. Subsequently, birders from all over the world have flocked to Cape May to witness the migrations. 

==Ecotourism==
Former Cape May Bird Observatory Director Paul Kerlinger published landmark studies on [[ecotourism]] in the 1990s, showing the impact of ecotourism dollars on Cape May and several other tourist areas with wildlife refuges. The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] honored his work with a special citation by then director Molly Beattie. 

The Cape May Bird Observatory, as part of the [[New Jersey Audubon Society]], also helps to organize the [[World Series of Birding]] each May. The World Series, as well as other birding festivals, such as the Cape May Fall Weekend, bring hundreds of people to the Cape May area, who enjoy its rich avifauna and support the local economy. 

==Authors==
The Cape May area is home to many birding authors, including Dunne, Kerlinger, Pat and Clay Sutton, Michael O'Brien, Richard Crossley and Kevin Karlson.

Author [[David Allen Sibley]] was also a Cape May birder. Sibley wrote his classic field guide, ''[[The Sibley Guide to Birds]]'', while he was living and birding in Cape May Point.

[[Euphemism]], [[innuendo]] and [[equivocation]] are different forms of circumlocution.

==Euphemism==
{{Main|Euphemism}}
''Euphemistic language'' often uses circumlocution to avoid saying words that are [[taboo]] or considered offensive. For example, "'''Holy mother of [[Jesus]]'''!" is a circumlocution of "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]!", but "heck", while still euphemistic, is not a circumlocution of "[[hell]]".

Euphemistic circumlocution is also used to avoid saying "unlucky words"&amp;mdash;words which are taboo for reasons connected with [[superstition]]: for example, calling the [[devil]] "Old Nick",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Speak of the devil, and he will appear" is the proverb.&lt;/ref&gt; calling [[Macbeth]] "[[the Scottish Play]]" or saying "[[baker's dozen]]" instead of [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6301">{{political anthropology}}
The '''circumscription theory''' is a  theory of the role of warfare in [[state formation]] in [[political anthropology]], created by anthropologist [[Robert L. Carneiro|Robert Carneiro]]. The theory has been summarized in one sentence by Schacht: “In areas of circumscribed agricultural land, population pressure led to warfare that resulted in the evolution of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Robert M., “Circumscription Theory: A Critical Review,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 439, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Robert B., and Paul Roscoe, “Introduction: Circumscription and the Evolution of Society,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 406, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The more circumscribed is an agricultural area, Carneiro argues, the sooner it politically unifies.

==Outline of the theory==

The theory begins with some assumptions. Warfare usually disperses people rather than uniting them. Environmental circumscription occurs when an area of productive agricultural land is surrounded by a less productive area such as the mountains, desert, or sea. Application of [[extensive agriculture]] would bring severely diminishing returns.

If there is no environmental circumscription, then losers in a war can migrate out from the region and settle somewhere else. If there is environmental circumscription, then losers in warfare are forced to submit to their conquerors, because migration is not an option and the populations of the conquered and conqueror are united. The new state organization strives to alleviate the population pressure by increasing the productive capacity of agricultural land through, for instance, more intensive cultivation using irrigation.

==Primary and secondary state development==

''Primary state development'' occurred in the six original states of the Nile Valley, Peru, Mesoamerican, Yellow River Valley China, Indus River Valley, and Mesopotamia. ''Secondary state development'' occurred in states that developed from contact with already existing states. Primary state development occurred in areas with environmental circumscription.

The presumption, under the Carneiro Hypothesis, is that agricultural intensification, and the social coordination and coercion necessary to achieve this end was a result of warfare in which vanquished populations could not disperse; the coercive coordination necessary for increased production of surplus is, under Carneiro's hypothesis, a causal factor in the origins of the State.  For example, the mountainous river valleys of Peru which descend to the Pacific coast were severely environmentally circumscribed. Amazonian populations could always disperse and maintain sparse contact with other, potentially hostile, neighbors, whereas Andean coastal populations could not.

==Criticism==

Carneiro's theory has been criticized by the Dutch "early state school" emerging in the 1970s around cultural anthropologist [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri J.M. Claessen]], on the ground that considerable contrary evidence can be found to Carneiro's theory. There are also cases of circumscribed environments and violent cultures which have failed to develop states, for example in the narrow highland valleys of interior Papua New Guinea, or the north west Pacific coastlines of North America.  Also for example, the formation of some early states in East Africa, Sri Lanka, and Polynesia do not easily fit with Carneiro's model. Hence Claessen's school developed a "complex interaction model" to explain early state formation, in which factors such as ecology, social and demographic structures, economic conditions, conflicts, and ideology become aligned in ways which favour state organisation.&lt;ref&gt;For some other criticisms see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/30911274/Circumscription_Theory_of_the_Origins_of_the_State_A_Cross-Cultural_Re-Analysis Circumscription Theory of the Origins of the State: A Cross-Cultural Re-Analysis. ''Cliodynamics'' 7/2 (2016): 187–203].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development and revision==

The theory has since been applied to many other contexts, with some arguing it can be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;One of the leading experts on [[world-systems theory]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], noted in 1990 that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system. "World State Formation: Historical Processes and Emergent Necessity," California: Institute for research on World System, working paper 1, 1990, http://irows.ucr.edu/papers/irows1.txxt&lt;/ref&gt; Carneiro has since also revised his theory in various ways. He has argued that population ''concentration'' can act as a lower level impetus for tribal conflict than geographic circumscription. He has also argued that, in addition to the necessities of conquest, a more important reason for creation of chiefdoms was the rise of war chiefs who use their military loyalists to [[coup d'etat|take over a group of villages]] and become [[Paramount chief|paramount chiefs]].&lt;ref name="Car2012"&gt;Carneiro, Robert. 2012. [https://www.socionauki.ru/journal/files/seh/2012_2/005-030.pdf The Circumscription Theory: A Clarification, Amplification, and Reformulation]. Social Evolution &amp; History 11(2): 5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

* The most common usage of the term refers to the brain's commissures, of which there are five. Such a commissure is a bundle of [[commissural fiber]]s as a [[nerve tract |tract]] that crosses the midline at its level of origin or entry (as opposed to a [[decussation]] of fibers that cross obliquely). The five are the [[anterior commissure]], [[posterior commissure]], [[corpus callosum]], [[Fornix (neuroanatomy)#Commissure|commissure of fornix]] (hippocampal commissure), and [[habenular commissure]]. They consist of fibre [[Neural pathway|tract]]s that connect the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s and span the [[longitudinal fissure]]. In the spinal cord there are the [[anterior white commissure]], and the [[gray commissure]].
* ''Commissure'' also often refers to cardiac anatomy of [[heart valve]]s. In the heart, a commissure is the area where the valve leaflets abut. When such an abutment is abnormally stiffened or even fused, [[stenosis#Valvular|valvular stenosis]] results, sometimes requiring [[commissurotomy]].
* The term may also refer to the junction of the upper and lower [[lip]]s (see [[labial commissure of mouth]]).

* It may refer to the upper and lower [[eyelid]]s.
* In female genitalia, the joining points of the two folds of the labia majora create two commissures - the anterior commissure just anterior to the prepuce of the clitoris, and the posterior commissure of the labia majora, directly posterior to the frenulum of the labia minora and anterior to the perineal raphe.

In [[biology]], the meeting of the two valves of a [[brachiopod]] or [[clam]] is a commissure; in [[botany]], the term is used to denote the place where a [[fern]]'s laterally expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal [[sorus]].

'''Community Greens''', sometimes referred to as ''backyard commons'', ''urban [[Common lands|common]]s'', or [[pocket neighborhood]]s, are shared open green spaces on the inside of city blocks, created either when residents merge backyard space or reclaim underutilized urban land such as vacant lots and [[Alley|alleyway]]s. These shared spaces are communally used and managed only by the residents whose homes abut them. They are not a public park, a private backyard, or a community garden; however, they can function as all three.

==Community Greens==
Community Greens is an organization concerned with the development of shared green spaces in residential neighborhoods in American cities. These green spaces are community greens.  The Community Greens movement believes that such an approach presents the best opportunity to add usable green space to American cities, by converting under utilized backyards and dysfunctional alleys into functional and beautiful shared green spaces that are owned, managed, and enjoyed by the people who live around them.

This has led communities in numerous American cities, including Boston, Sacramento, Baltimore, New York, and San Francisco, taking down their backyard fences, to create backyard commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112110/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Greens are multi-functional spaces for gardening, recreation, and leisure which are designed to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to urban residents. The creation of  backyard commons can lead to an increased interaction with neighbors throughout the planning and implementation process, which may result in a stronger overall sense of community. Other possible social benefits that are claimed include decreased crime, from having more eyes on the street, and safe places where children can play and adults relax. Community Greens, like other types of urban green spaces, can significantly improve the ecological functioning of urban habitats. Vegetation and permeable pavement can slow storm water runoff and increase groundwater, which in turn can reduce pollutant flowing into nearby bodies of water during a storm. Urban environments are often significantly warmer than outlying suburbs, mostly due to the prevalence of  heat retentive concrete surfaces. City trees can mitigate this effect through shading, etc..&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, AH, and Romm, JJ. (Feb/Mar97 ) “Painting the town white-and green.”''MIT's Technology Review''. 100(2):52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The taking down  of backyards fences transforms fragmented habitats to connected corridors for urban wildlife. Furthermore because city dwellers recognize value in green space, often simply from an aesthetic standpoint, and this may be reflected through increased property values.&lt;ref&gt;Been, V.

==The beginnings in Maryland==
* Community Greens was founded as an offshoot of Ashoka, by Ashoka founder [[Bill Drayton]] in 2001.
* Spearheaded a state wide legislature in [[Maryland]], which changed the City Charter which allows the city to lease and gate alleys to homeowners.
* Started the Alley Gating and Alley Greening pilot project in [[Baltimore]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alley greening [http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Divisions/AlleyGatingGreeningProgram.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local ordinance passed in the City of Baltimore in 2007.
* As of 2009, there are 3 completely gated and greened alleys in Baltimore and over 70 applications from interested neighborhoods.

===Baltimore: The pilot project===
In 2002, a group of residents from the [[Patterson Park]] neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore, and these two groups were put into contact. The Luzerne-Glover block was granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Community Greens, the Patterson Park CDC, the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association and the Luzurne‐Glover block group turned to University of Maryland law professor Barbara Bezdek, who enlisted the help of her law students, who researched existing laws and current uses of Baltimore alleyways.

[[File:Luzerne and Chandlers Yard Before.jpg|thumb|alt=Luzerne alleyway before gating and greening|The Luzerne-Glover Block alley before gating and greening]]

Looking for a permanent solution, these groups aligned themselves with the Mayor's Department of Neighborhoods and took their case to Annapolis. Maryland Delegate [[Peter A. Hammen]] sponsored House Bill 1533 to amend the Baltimore City Charter, allowing the City to close alleyways and lease them to interested parties. The Luzerne-Glover group testified before the Environmental Committee of the state legislature and House Bill 1533 passed in 2004. Community Greens then worked with law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], in collaboration with Barbara Bezdek, to draft a city alley gating and leasing ordinance, which was then submitted to the City of Baltimore.

In April 2007, the [[Baltimore City Council]] under the leadership of newly elected Mayor [[Shelia Dixon]], passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.

Interested communities need approval from several Baltimore City Departments, including Solid Waste, Transportation, Fire, and Police to ensure that proposed alley projects meet the necessary infrastructural conditions. Once initial approval is received, residents submit an application to the Department of Public Works, which includes the necessary consent forms from homeowners and a signed affidavit stating that attempts were made to obtain approval from all homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525041536/http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luzerne Glover neighborhood now has their green alleyway, and is the first community in Baltimore to use the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225084428/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, seven Baltimore communities have successfully completed this process and have created eight useful Community Greens from the underutilized alleyways in their backyards.

==Other existing greens==

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628111701/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/montgomerypark/Montgomery%20Park.htm Montgomery Park - Boston, Massachusetts]===
'''Montgomery Park''' is a third of an acre common space shared by 85 households in Boston's South End neighborhood. From the time the neighborhood was first developed in the 1860s through the 1970s, the park was separated from the residents' backyards by an alley and fence. In more recent years, residents began to connect the park to their individual yards by replacing the alley separating their private backyards from the park with a narrower brick walkway and tearing down backyard fences. Additionally, residents have moved garbage collection to the front street and convinced utility companies to bury service lines. Residents now enjoy greater access to the shared Community Green, and use it for gardening and recreation.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090625143531/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/stoneycreek/stoneycreek.htm Stoney Creek Apartments - Livermore, California]===
'''Stoney Creek Apartments''' were constructed in 1992 to address a lack of affordable housing in [[Livermore, California]]. Ten residential buildings share five courtyards, accessible from a small alleyway. Homes have front and back patios in addition to the shared courtyards, and neighbors have the opportunity to enjoy this shared outdoor space and experience a heightened sense of community. The inward-facing position of these patios allows parents to keep a watchful eye on children playing in the courtyard.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124249/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/chandlersyard/chandlersyard.htm Chandlers Yard - Baltimore, Maryland]===
Located in the Federal Hill neighborhood of downtown Baltimore and hidden behind eleven narrow rowhouses, '''Chandler's Yard''' is a tree-shaded courtyard that was carved out of the backyards of the surrounding homes by developer Bill Struever who wanted to make living on the block more attractive to potential buyers. Struever convinced some of the property owners in this block to give up part of their backyards for this shared courtyard and pay a small construction fee. The result is a beautiful shared space for these residents, who enjoy a heightened sense of security and increased property values.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163042/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/villagehomes/villagehomes.htm Village Homes - Davis, California]===
The '''Village Homes''' development is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots are smaller than the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that eliminate the need for an expensive storm-water sewer system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630004718/http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/jacksonheights/jacksonheights.htm Jackson Heights - Queens, New York]===
For nearly nine decades, the historic neighborhood of '''Jackson Heights''' in Queens has maintained its fourteen block-long shared interior courtyards, and is considered to be the first "garden apartments" constructed in the United States. These spaces have helped to sustain the blocks' distinctive appeal since their development in the early decades of the last century. Over the years, Jackson Heights residents fought to hold on to their gardens and green spaces in the midst of a city where high property values create an intense pressure to develop any available open space.  The preservation of these shared spaces has increased both community pride and residential property values; if these inner courtyards had been developed, Jackson Heights property values would have dropped by one-third. In 1993, Jackson Heights was officially declared a historic district by the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, furthering sense of place for this community.

===[http://www.communitygreens.org/st-francis-square St. Francis Square - San Francisco, California]===
A cooperative apartment community, '''St. Francis Square''' consists of 299 apartments wrapped around three shared, open spaces. These community greens are full of gardens, basketball courts, playgrounds, and quiet places to relax.  St. Francis Square was established as a limited equity co-operative apartment, although it converted to market rate ownership in 2004.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124254/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/hopecommunity/hope.htm The Hope Community - Minneapolis, MN]===
Fifteen years ago, this community was situated in an area of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, [http://www.hope-community.org/ Hope Community, Inc]. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, '''the Hope Community''' has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a troubled urban area.

==Green alleys==
Something similar has taken place in various cities in North America, involving the [[greening]] of [[back lane]]s or [[alley]]s. This includes [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/pmp/greenalleyhandbook_chicago.pdf "The Chicago Green Alley Handbook"] on the City of Seattle website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpl.org/green-alleys "Green Alleys"] on the [[Trust for Public Land]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddot.dc.gov/publication/ddot-green-alley-project-fact-sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montréal]], Canada, who have started to reclaim their alleys from garbage and crime by [[greening]] the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects+and+Planning/Environment/Green+Alley+Projects "Green Alley Projects"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104000808/http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects%2Band%2BPlanning/Environment/Green%2BAlley%2BProjects |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the District of Columbia Department of Transportation website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104095801/http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the ''Integrated Alleys'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]] has about {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of alleyways.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html "Service: Green Alleys"] on the City of Chicago website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Chicago Department of Transportation]] started converting conventional alleys which were paved with [[asphalt]] into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in [[Chicago]] are not connected to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]] in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140103190427/http://www.screamtobegreen.com/2007/11/chicago-alleys-to-go-green/ "Chicago Alleys to Go Green"] on the ''Scream to be Green'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3561">'''Conditioned satiety''' is one of the three known food-specific forms of suppression of appetite for food by effects of eating, along with [[alliesthesia|alimentary alliesthesia]] and [[sensory-specific satiety]]. ''Conditioned satiety'' was first evidenced in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Le Magnen J. Sur le mécanisme d'établissement des appétits caloriques. [Mechanism of establishment of caloric appetites] ''C. R. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci.'' 1955; 240: 2436-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in rats by the late French physiologist professor [[Jacques Le Magnen]]. The term was coined in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Conditioned satiety in the rat. ''J Comp Physiol Psychol.'' 1972;81(3):457-71.&lt;/ref&gt; by professor [[David Allenby Booth]]. Unlike the other two sorts of stimulus-specific satiety, this phenomenon is based on [[classical conditioning]]&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA, Davis JD. Gastrointestinal factors in the acquisition of oral sensory control of satiation. ''Physiol Behav.'' 1973;11(1):23-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Psychology of Nutrition. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994. 228 pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ATtP1hzNW44C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22conditioned+satiety%22+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kMyXdhG_Gv&amp;sig=29SfhS2aFBXYmrMoj5-na3OJaoQ&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=cEplTfiwF4PAhAeqpJyfBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22conditioned%20satiety%22%20definition&amp;f=false full text on google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Learnt reduction in the size of a meal. Measurement of the sensory-gastric inhibition from conditioned satiety. ''Appetite'' 2009;52(3):745-9.&lt;/ref&gt; but is distinct from [[conditioned taste aversion]] (CTA) in its dependence on internal state towards the end of a meal.

== Description of the phenomenon ==

''Conditioned satiety'' is thought to be acquired when a food with a given flavour is eaten on a partly full stomach and followed promptly by a mildly aversive digestive event ("bloat"). However, it is uncertain if and how this phenomenon may occur under real-life conditions as normally more than food of one given flavor is ingested during a meal. It has been widely misunderstood{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} as an association of the sensory properties of a food with its energy content (calories) or carbohydrate content. However that is a confusion with the conditioning of simple aversion or a contrast with simple conditioned preference. ''Conditioned satiety'' has only been evidenced in experiments with rats,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} monkeys{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} or humans{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} when a flavour and fullness together have been paired with concentrated maltodextrin. When a whole meal of concentrated maltodextrin is eaten without changing its flavour, only the conditioning of preference for the flavour early in the meal is seen. Rats, monkeys and people can learn ''conditioned satiety'' within one or two pairings{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} although in the first experiments{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} the rats needed several days to adapt their intakes because the test food was aversively flavoured or textured. The particularity of ''conditioned satiety'' is that the time lapse between intake (and thus sensory stimulation) and the aversively conditioning after-effect is much shorter (less than 15 minutes) than that feasible for the conditioning of simple aversion to taste, odour or texture by poisoning, which can occur with a delay in postabsorptive effects of 12 or more hours.

'''David Fallows''' (born 20 December 1945)&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;Rosemary Williamson; {{GroveMusic|id=47084|label=Fallows, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[Musicology|musicologist]] specializing in music of the [[ars nova|late Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[performance practice]] of music. He is a leader in fifteenth-century music studies, particularly [[Guillaume Dufay]]&lt;!-- Do not change to Du Fay, since Dufay is Fallows's preferred spelling--&gt;, [[Josquin des Prez]], and secular song.

==Biography==
Fallows was born in [[Buxton]]. He received his [[Bachelors of Arts|BA]] from [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], his Masters of Music from [[King's College, London]], and his Ph.D. (1978) from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/David.fallows/|title=Research page at University of Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an early music performer as a [[viol]] player and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]] [[harpsichord]]ist, performing with the [[Studio der frühen Musik]], [[Musica Mundana]], and [[Musica Reservata (group)|Musica Reservata]].&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Manchester]] starting in 1976, where he is now Emeritus Professor of Musicology. Visiting appointments include [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]], [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[University of Basel]], [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. He received the [[Dent Medal]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/dent_medal.htm|title=RMA Awards and Grants: The Dent Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1994, a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1997, a Corresponding Member of the [[American Musicological Society]] in 1999, and an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Musical Association]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/honorary_members.htm|title=Honorary Members of the Royal Musical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2002–2007, he was president of the [[International Musicological Society]].

His contributions were honoured with a [[Festschrift]], ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.''&lt;ref name="festschrift"&gt;Fabrice Fitch and Jacobijn Kiel, editors, ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
David Fallows's work has been called "pioneering" on the lives of composers and of the ensembles that performed music,&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; and having covered "just about every aspect of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century music."&lt;ref&gt;Noel O'Regan, review of the Festschrift in ''Music and Letters,'' 93.3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Among Fallows's first publications was, "Ciconia padre e figlio" (Ciconia: father and son; 1976), which theorized that the current biography of [[Johannes Ciconia]] was primarily that of his father, and that the composer himself was born about thirty-five years later.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Di Bacco and John Nádas, "Ciconia, Johannes: 1. Life" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has become the accepted biography of the composer. Also during his doctoral studies he reconstructed the origins of the important fourteenth-century polyphonic manuscripts in [[Cambrai]] ("L'origine du MS. 1328 de Cambrai"). His 1978 dissertation, "[[Robert Morton (composer)|Robert Morton]]'s Songs" was among Fallows's first works on English Renaissance music and fifteenth-century song, repertories that have concerned him throughout his life (including in his 2014 [[Musica Britannica]] volume on English song, 1380–1480). These studies formed the basis for his comprehensive ''A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs, 1415–1480'' (Oxford 1999). A major article on the life of [[Johannes Regis]] (1989) also had a transformative impact on the understanding of the composer. His 2009 study of the life and works of [[Josquin des Prez]] (Brepols) has been praised for understanding the conflicting information recently unearthed about the composer as well as presenting new hypotheses and understanding of the composer's music in light of new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D. Fallows, ''Josquin''|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503530659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallows's 1982 monograph ''Dufay'' is the principal reference work on the life and works of the composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. He has edited and introduced facsimile publications of the Songbook of [[Henry VIII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item101064.html|title=Songs written by Henry VIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manuscript [[Bodleian Library|Oxford]], Canon. Misc 213, the [[Chansonnier Cordiforme]], and others. As senior consulting editor for [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], Fallows contributed many major articles along with many small articles on musical diacritics (tempo and expression marks) and miscellany such as "Spoof Articles."&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, "{{GroveMusic|id=53081|label=Spoof articles|linkonly=t}}," in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">'''Eco-innovation''' is the development of products and processes that contribute to [[sustainable development]], applying the commercial application of knowledge to elicit direct or indirect ecological improvements. This includes a range of related ideas, from [[environmentally friendly]] technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards [[sustainability]]. The field of research that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new "ecological" [[Idea|ideas]] and [[technology]] spread is called [[eco-innovation diffusion]].

==Concept==

The idea of eco-innovation is fairly recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-García|first=Cristina|last2=González-Moreno|first2=Ángela|last3=Sáez-Martínez|first3=Francisco J.|date=2015|title=Eco-innovation: insights from a literature review|journal=Innovation: Management, Policy &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=6–23|doi=10.1080/14479338.2015.1011060|issn=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first appearances of the concept of eco-innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James.&lt;ref&gt;Fussler, C. &amp; P. James, 1996; ''Driving Eco-Innovation: A Breakthrough Discipline for Innovation and Sustainability'', Pitman Publishing: London, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent article, Peter James defines eco-innovation as "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts".&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, P., 1997; 'The Sustainability Circle: a new tool for product development and design', ''Journal of Sustainable Product Design'' 2: 52:57, http://www.cfsd.org.uk/journal&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Rennings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|date=2000|title=Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999001123|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00112-3|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the term eco-innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.

Eco-innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with "[[environmental innovation]]", and is also often linked with [[environmental technology]], [[eco-efficiency]], [[Ecodesign|eco-design]], [[environmental design]], [[sustainable design]], or [[sustainable innovation]]. While the term "environmental innovation" is used in similar contexts to "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco-innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. [[Ecovation]] is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.

===As a technological term===

The most common usage of the term "eco-innovation" is to refer to [[innovative]] products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco-efficiency and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards [[sustainability]]. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.

===As a social process===

Another position held (for example, by the organisation [http://www.eco-innovation.net Eco Innovation]) is that this definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this "social pillar" added to James's&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though [[environmental technology]] and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., [[waste treatment]], [[recycling]], etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for [[sustainable development]].

== Diffusion ==
Literature in the field of eco-innovations often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm specific factors rather than [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]]. However, understanding of [[diffusion of eco-innovations]] recently has gained more importance given the fact that some eco-innovations are already at a mature stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakaya|first=Emrah|last2=Hidalgo|first2=Antonio|last3=Nuur|first3=Cali|date=2014|title=Diffusion of eco-innovations: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001051|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=33|issue=|pages=392–399|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.083|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of eco-innovations. At the same time, adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kowalska-Pyzalska|first=A.|date=2015|title=Social acceptance of green energy and dynamic electricity tariffs - A short review|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7477192|journal=2015 Modern Electric Power Systems (MEPS)|volume=|issue=|pages=1–7|doi=10.1109/MEPS.2015.7477192|pmid=|access-date=|via=|isbn=978-1-5090-3101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NIMBY|"Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY)]] concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing [[intention-behavior gap]] between high levels of public support for eco-innovations and frequent non-engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renewable energy and the public: from NIMBY to participation|last=|first=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Devine-Wright|editor-first=Patrick|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyamfi|first=Samuel|last2=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first2=Susan|last3=Urmee|first3=Tania|date=2013|title=Residential peak electricity demand response—Highlights of some behavioural issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113002578|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=25|issue=|pages=71–77|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.04.006|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|last2=Jȩdrzejewski|first2=Arkadiusz|last3=Sznajd-Weron|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Weron|first4=Rafał|date=2016|title=Difficulty is critical: The importance of social factors in modeling diffusion of green products and practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211630096X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=62|issue=|pages=723–735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.063|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folk economics''' is the intuitive [[economics]] of [[Training|untrained]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Paul H. |title=Folk Economics |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=157–171 |jstor=1061637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence.  In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation.  Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple.  Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy.  While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers.  that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms.  This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration.  Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], a '''full employment theorem''' is a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done.

For example, the ''full employment theorem for compiler writers'' states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to [[halting problem|detect non-terminating computations]] and reduce them to a one-instruction [[infinite loop]]. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the [[halting problem]], which cannot exist, making the proof itself an [[undecidable problem]].  This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist.  Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. Similarly, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. In [[theoretical computer science]] this field of study is known as [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or the smallest program which outputs a given string.

Tasks such as [[computer virus|virus]] writing and detection, and [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] filtering and filter-breaking are also subject to [[Rice's theorem]].

==Additional examples==
*[[No free lunch in search and optimization]] - no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

'''Glucose''' (also called '''dextrose''') is a simple [[sugar]] with the [[Chemical formula#Molecular formula|molecular formula]] {{Chemical formula|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. Glucose is the most abundant [[monosaccharide]],&lt;ref name="DombKost1998"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLjhl6AvfIsC&amp;pg=PA275 |isbn=978-1-4200-4936-7 |page=275|title=Handbook of Biodegradable Polymers |last1=Domb |first1=Abraham J. |last2=Kost |first2=Joseph |last3=Wiseman |first3=David |date=1998-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a subcategory of [[carbohydrates]]. Glucose is mainly made by [[plants]] and most [[algae]] during [[photosynthesis]] from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. There it is used to make [[cellulose]] in [[cell wall]]s, which is the most abundant carbohydrate.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Kamide: ''Cellulose and Cellulose Derivatives''. Elsevier, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-080-45444-3}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[energy metabolism]], glucose is the most important source of energy in all [[organism]]s. Glucose for metabolism is partially stored as a [[polymer]], in plants mainly as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]] and in animals as [[glycogen]]. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as [[blood sugar]]. The naturally occurring form of glucose is D-glucose, while [[L-glucose]] is produced synthetically in comparably small amounts and is of lesser importance.

Glucose is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date=October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423005004/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |archivedate=23 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name glucose derives through the French from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γλυκός, which means "sweet," in reference to [[must]], the sweet, first press of grapes in the making of [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=glucose |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126065057/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=glucose |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thénard, Gay-Lussac, Biot, and Dumas (1838) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29662/f106.langEN "Rapport sur un mémoire de M.

==History==
Glucose was first isolated from [[raisin]]s in 1747 by the German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Food and Health"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food and Health|date=2015|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123849533|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-t9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA239|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=O-t9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA239|archivedate=2018-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marggraf (1747) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Experiences chimiques faites dans le dessein de tirer un veritable sucre de diverses plantes, qui croissent dans nos contrées"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624083152/https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |date=2016-06-24 }} [Chemical experiments made with the intention of extracting real sugar from diverse plants that grow in our lands], ''Histoire de l'académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin'', pp. 79–90.

(Raisins, being moistened with a small quantity of water, in a way that they soften, can be then pressed, and the juice that is squeezed out, [after] being purified and thickened, will provide a sort of sugar.)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose was discovered in grapes by [[Johann Tobias Lowitz]] in 1792 and recognized as different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by [[Jean Baptiste Dumas]] in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] proposed the term dextrose (from Latin dexter = right), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, D-fructose (a ketohexose) and L-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (''d'' and ''l''-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the D- and L-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of D- or L-glyceraldehyde.&lt;ref name="Robyt 7"&gt;John F.

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in [[organic chemistry]]. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], a German chemist who received the 1902 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Emil Fischer | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | publisher = Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2009-09-02 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903164859/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | archivedate = 2009-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]'s theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = van't Hoff's Glucose | first = Bert | last = Fraser-Reid | journal = Chem. Eng. News | volume = 77 | issue = 39 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible [[isomer]]s, applying van 't Hoff's theory of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, D/L nomenclature).

For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose [[Otto Meyerhof]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/meyerhof-facts.html "Otto Meyerhof - Facts - NobelPrize.org"].

== Chemical properties ==
With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a [[hexose]], a subcategory of the monosaccharides. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Glucose is one of the sixteen [[aldohexose]] [[stereoisomer]]s. The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[isomer]], &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer, [[L-glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]], does not. Glucose can be obtained by [[hydrolysis]] of carbohydrates such as milk sugar ([[lactose]]), cane sugar ([[sucrose]]), [[maltose]], [[cellulose]], [[glycogen]], etc. It is commonly commercially manufactured from cornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled [[pH]] in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;"glucose." The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. 2015. Encyclopedia.com. 17 Nov. 2015 http://www.encyclopedia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426025317/http://www.encyclopedia.com/ |date=2009-04-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of [[honey]]. All forms of glucose are colorless and easily soluble in water, [[acetic acid]], and several other solvents.  They are only sparingly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].

===Structure and nomenclature===
Glucose is a monosaccharide with formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or H-(C=O)-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-H, whose five [[hydroxyl]] (OH) groups are arranged in a specific way along its six-[[carbon]] back. Glucose is usually present in solid form as a [[monohydrate]] with a closed [[pyran]] ring (dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is has an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-[[pyranose]], which partially mutually merge by [[mutarotation]]. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and β-glucopyranose hydrate.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_457.pub2|chapter=Glucose and Glucose-Containing Syrups|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2006|last1=Schenck|first1=Fred W.|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides [[lactose]] and [[sucrose]] (cane or beet sugar), of [[oligosaccharide]]s such as [[raffinose]] and of polysaccharides such as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]], [[glycogen]] or [[cellulose]].

===Open-chain form===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|Glucose can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
In its fleeting [[open-chain]] form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to [[cyclic compound|cyclic]]) and unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, C-1 through C-6; where C-1 is part of an [[aldehyde group]] H(C=O)-, and each of the other five carbons bears one hydroxyl group -OH.  The remaining  [[covalent bond|bonds]] of the backbone carbons are satisfied by [[hydrogen]] atoms -H. Therefore, glucose is both a [[hexose]] and an [[aldose]], or an [[aldohexose]]. The aldehyde group makes glucose a [[reducing sugar]] giving a positive reaction with the [[Fehling test]].

Each of the four carbons C-2 through C-5 is a [[stereocenter]], meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents.  (Carbon C-2, for example, connects to -(C=O)H, -OH, -H, and -(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H.)  In &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, these four parts must be in a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Namely, when the molecule is drawn in the [[Fischer projection]], the hydroxyls on C-2, C-4, and C-5 must be on the right side, while that on C-3 must be on the left side.

The positions of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of [[L-Glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]].  &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose are two of the 16 possible aldohexoses; the other 14 are [[allose]], [[altrose]], [[galactose]], [[gulose]], [[idose]], [[mannose]], and [[talose]], each with two [[enantiomer]]s, “&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-” and “&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-”.

It is important to note that the linear form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in a water solution. The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose that are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) bonds to the aldehyde carbon 1 (C1).

}}
In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either "{{small|D}}-" or "{{small|L}}-") exists in equilibrium with several [[Carbohydrate#Ring-straight chain isomerism|cyclic isomers]], each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution however, more than 99% of glucose molecules, at any given time, exist as [[pyranose]] forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25% and [[furanose]] forms exists in negligible amounts. The terms "glucose" and "{{small|D}}-glucose" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a [[hemiacetal]] linkage, -C(OH)H-O-.

The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence "–ose") containing a derivatised [[pyran]] skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether [[furan]].  In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is -(C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)HOH)-H or -(CHOH)-H, respectively).

The ring-closing reaction makes carbon C-1 [[Chirality|chiral]], too, since its four bonds lead to -H, to -OH, to carbon C-2, and to the ring oxygen.  These four parts of the molecule may be arranged around C-1 (the [[anomeric carbon]]) in two distinct ways, designated by the prefixes "α-" and "β-".  When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the [[Haworth projection]], the designation "α-" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''trans'']] arrangement), while "β-" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''cis'']] arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer {{small|D}}-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, β-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, α-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose, and β-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid [[catalysis]].

}}
The other open-chain isomer {{small|L}}-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of {{small|L}}-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding {{small|D}}-glucose.

The rings are not planar, but are twisted in three dimensions. The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the "chair" and "boat" conformations of [[cyclohexane]].  Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the "envelope" conformations of [[cyclopentane]].

In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed, forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and [[acetic acid]] but poorly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].  They melt at {{convert|146|C|F}} (''α'') and {{convert|150|C|F}} (''β''), and [[Decomposition|decompose]] at higher temperatures into [[carbon]] and water.

===Rotational isomers===
Each glucose [[isomer]] is subject to [[rotamer|rotational isomerism]]. Within the cyclic form of glucose, rotation may occur around the O6-C6-C5-O5 [[torsion angle]], termed the ''ω''-angle, to form three staggered rotamer conformations called ''gauche''-''gauche'' (gg), ''gauche''-''trans'' (gt) and ''trans''-''gauche'' (tg).&lt;ref&gt;For methyl α-D-glucuopyranose at equilibrium, the ratio of molecules in each rotamer conformation is reported to be  57% gg, 38% gt, and 5% tg. See {{citation | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = Karl N. | last2 = Woods | first2 = Robert J. | title = Solvent interactions determine carbohydrate conformation | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | year = 2001 | volume = 98 | issue = 19 | pages = 10541–45 | pmid = 11526221 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.191362798 | pmc = 58501 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810541K }}.{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the ''ω''-angle to adopt a ''gauche'' conformation, a tendency that is attributed to the [[gauche effect]].

===Mutarotation===
[[File:Mutarotation D-Glucose V.1.png|thumb|upright=2|Mutarotation: D-glucose molecules exist as cyclic hemiacetals that are epimeric (= diastereomeric) to each other. The epimeric ratio α:β is 36:64. In the α-D-glucopyranose (left), the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in the axial position at the anomeric center, whereas in the β-D-glucopyranose (right) the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in equatorial position at the anomeric center.]]
Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different -OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.

The open-chain form is [[Chemical stability|thermodynamically unstable]], and it spontaneously [[isomer]]izes to the cyclic forms.  (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.)  In solutions at [[room temperature]], the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called [[mutarotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurry2nd | page = 866}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64.&lt;!--AT ANY TEMPERATURE?--&gt; The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the [[anomeric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Anomeric Effect | last1 = Juaristi | first1 = Eusebio | first2 = Gabriel | last2 = Cuevas | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 9–10 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8941-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to {{convert|0|C}}.

===Optical activity===
Whether in water or in the solid form, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-(+)-glucose is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]], meaning it will rotate the direction of [[polarized light]] clockwise as seen looking toward the light source.  The effect is due to the [[chirality]] of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-(−)-glucose, is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five [[tautomer]]s.

Note that the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory).  The fact that &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-aldohexoses are levorotatory.&lt;!--CHECK--&gt;

The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a [[polarimeter]], since pure α- D- glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, pure β- D- glucose of +17.5 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Manfred Hesse, Herbert Meier, Bernd Zeeh, Stefan Bienz, Laurent Bigler, Thomas Fox: ''Spektroskopische Methoden in der organischen Chemie''. 8th revised Edition.

(german)&lt;/ref&gt; When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse" /&gt; By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.

===Isomerisation===
In dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides [[mannose]], glucose and [[fructose]] interconvert (via a [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation|Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–van Ekenstein transformation]]), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an [[enediol]]:

Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used [[aldohexose]] in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the [[amine]] groups of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunn|first1=H.

Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable [[Glucose#Cyclic forms|cyclic form]] compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive [[Glucose#Open-chain form|open-chain form]].&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt; The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its [[Hydroxy group#Hydroxy group|hydroxy groups]] (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose) are in the [[Cyclohexane conformation|equatorial position]]. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides.&lt;ref name=Higgins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryer 531"&gt;Jeremy M. Berg: ''Stryer Biochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-662-54620-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;531. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only [[Aldohexose|D-aldohexose]] that has all five [[Hydroxy group|hydroxy]] substituents in the [[Equatorial bond|equatorial]] position in the form of β-D-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Reginald H. Garrett: ''Biochemistry.'' Cengage Learning, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-133-10629-6}}. pp. 194, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, for [[esterification]]&lt;ref name="Voet 363"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G.

Lehninger, ''Biochemistry, 6th printing'', Worth Publishers Inc. 1972, {{ISBN|0-87901-009-6}} p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, D-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural [[polysaccharides]] (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of Glucose are termed [[glucan]]s.

Glucose is produced by plants through the photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and [[chitin]], which are components of the cell wall in plants or [[fungi]] and [[arthropod]]s, respectively. These polymers are degraded to glucose during food intake by animals, fungi and bacteria using enzymes.  All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. [[Nerve cells]], cells of the [[renal medulla]] and [[erythrocytes]] depend on glucose for their energy production.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 195"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;195.

Elsevier Health Sciences, 2014, {{ISBN|978-8-131-23713-7}}. p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; of which about 4 g are present in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.90563.2008 |pmc=2636990 |pmid=18840763|year=2009 |last1=Wasserman |first1=D.

===Uptake===
Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins [[T1R2]] and [[T1R3]] makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of food,&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 404"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during [[mastication|chewing]] by means of [[amylase]], which is contained in [[saliva]], as well as by [[maltase]], [[lactase]] and [[sucrase]] on the [[brush border]] of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. [[Glucosidases]], a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin) and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, [[trehalase]] and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, [[sphingolipids]], [[mucopolysaccharides]] and [[poly(ADP-ribose)]]. Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases and trehalases, but the bacteria in the [[gut flora]] do.

In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the [[major facilitator superfamily]].

===Biosynthesis===
{{main|Gluconeogenesis|Glycogenolysis}}
In [[plant]]s and some [[prokaryote]]s, glucose is a product of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|title=Chemistry for Biologists: Photosynthesis|website=www.rsc.org|access-date=2018-02-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804060610/http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like [[glycogen]] (in animals and [[mushroom]]s) or [[starch]] (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed [[glycogenolysis]], the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith, Alison M. |last2=Zeeman, Samuel C. |last3= Smith, Steven M. |year= 2005 |title= Starch Degradation |journal= Annu.

The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all [[biomolecule]]s come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Voet 359"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G.

Bentham Science Publishers, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-608-05189-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 389"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;389. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinae, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including [[lactic acid|lactate]] or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal [[tubular cell]]s can also produce glucose.

If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs ([[Cori cycle]]). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite [[acetyl-CoA]] from the Krebs cycle can also be used for [[fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00125-016-3940-5|pmid=27048250|year=2016|last1=Jones|first1=J.

These processes are [[Hormone|hormonally]] regulated.

In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.&lt;ref name="Voet 59" /&gt; In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the [[Entner-Doudoroff pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;Entner, N. und Doudoroff, M.

Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the [[phosphorylation]] of glucose by a [[hexokinase]] to form [[glucose 6-phosphate]]. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged [[phosphate]] group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonadonna|first1=Riccardo C|last2=Bonora|first2=Enzo|last3=Del Prato|first3=Stefano|last4=Saccomani|first4=Maria|last5=Cobelli|first5=Claudio|last6=Natali|first6=Andrea|last7=Frascerra|first7=Silvia|last8=Pecori|first8=Neda|last9=Ferrannini|first9=Eleuterio|last10=Bier|first10=Dennis|last11=DeFronzo|first11=Ralph A|last12=Gulli|first12=Giovanni|title=Roles of glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation in muscle insulin resistance of NIDDM|journal=Diabetes|date=July 1996|volume=45|issue=7|pages=915–25|doi=10.2337/diab.45.7.915|pmid=8666143|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/45/7/915.full-text.pdf|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group [[Activation#Biochemistry|activates]] glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. At [[physiological condition]]s, this initial reaction is irreversible.

In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | year = 2006 | page = 52 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) through oxidative phosphorylation is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance  @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tumor]] cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833a5577 |pmid=20473153|year=2010|last1=Annibaldi|first1=A.|title=Glucose metabolism in cancer cells|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=13|issue=4|pages=466–70|last2=Widmann|first2=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen.

In [[yeast]], ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration but not to fermentation). This effect is called the [[Crabtree effect]].

Some glucose is converted to [[lactic acid]] by [[astrocyte]]s, which is then utilized as an energy source by [[brain cells]]; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and [[erythrocytes|red blood cells]], while the rest reaches the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]] and [[muscle]] cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of [[insulin]]). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In [[Adipocyte|fat cells]], glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some [[fat]] types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's "glucose energy storage" mechanism, because it is much more "space efficient" and less reactive than glucose itself.

The [[glycemic index]] is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the [[area under a curve|area under the curve]] of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100).&lt;ref name="Harvey 366"&gt;Richard A.

The [[glycemic load]] is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.

===Precursor===
Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. [[Starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]] ("animal starch") are common glucose [[polymer]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and [[chitin]], which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. [[Oligosaccharide]]s of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include [[lactose]], the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and [[sucrose]], another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and [[fructose]]. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and [[lipid]]s in a process called [[glycosylation]]. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.

Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into [[lipids]]. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various [[metabolic pathway]]s. Among them, all other monosaccharides&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;27. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; such as fructose (via the [[polyol pathway]]),&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 199"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;199, 200. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various [[uronic acids]] and the [[amino sugar]]s are produced from glucose.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 214"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;214. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to [[glucono-1,5-lactone]]. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the [[trehalose]] or the [[dextran]] biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial [[xylose isomerase]] to fructose. In addition, glucose [[metabolite]]s produce all nonessential [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar alcohol]]s such as [[mannitol]] and [[sorbitol]], [[fatty acid]]s, [[cholesterol]] and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27" /&gt; Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the [[glycosylation]] of proteins to [[glycoprotein]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[peptidoglycan]]s, [[glycoside]]s and other substances (catalyzed by [[glycosyltransferase]]s) and can be cleaved from them by [[glycosidase]]s.

==Pathology==
===Diabetes===
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate [[Blood sugar|levels of glucose in the blood]] either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and [[insulin resistance]]. The [[pancreas]] is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Röder PV, Wu B, Liu Y, Han W | title = Pancreatic Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis | journal = Exp. Mol. Med. | volume = 48 | issue = 3, March  | pages = e219– | year = 2016 | pmid =  26964835| doi = 10.1038/emm.2016.6 | pmc = 4892884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions.&lt;ref&gt;Estela, Carlos (2011) "Blood Glucose Levels," Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One + Two: Vol. 3: Iss. 2, Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.

To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. [[Blood glucose monitoring]] can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.

===Overweight and fatty liver===
An increased intake of glucose leads to [[obesity]] and, in consequence, partly to the [[metabolic syndrome]] with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70032-4 |pmid=24731669|year=2014|last1=Yki-Järvinen|first1=H.|title=Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a cause and a consequence of metabolic syndrome|journal=The Lancet. Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|volume=2|issue=11|pages=901–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the consumption of glucose as part of a normal calorie intake.

===Hypoglycemia management===
[[File:Soluţie glucoză 5%.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Glucose, 5% solution for [[infusion]]s]]
Individuals with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or other conditions that result in [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms.  One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), [[hard candy]], or [[sugar packet]].{{clear}}

Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and [[glycogen]]), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/carbohydrates-and-blood-sugar/|title=Carbohydrates and Blood Sugar|last=|first=|date=2013-08-05|work=|newspaper=The Nutrition Source|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30|via=Harvard T.H.

==Commercial production==
Glucose is produced industrially from starch by [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[hydrolysis]] using [[glucose amylase]] or by the use of [[acids]]. The enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;P. J. Fellows: ''Food Processing Technology. Woodhead Publishing'', 2016, {{ISBN|978-0-081-00523-1}}, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter)&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Ullmann 48"&gt;Thomas Becker, Dietmar Breithaupt, Horst Werner Doelle, Armin Fiechter, Günther Schlegel, Sakayu Shimizu, Hideaki Yamada: ''Biotechnology'', in: ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 7th Edition, Wiley-VCH, 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32943-4}}.

Many crops can be used as the source of starch. [[Maize]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; rice,&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[wheat]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[cassava]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[potato]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; [[barley]],&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; sweet potato,&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Alan Davidson: ''The Oxford Companion to Food.''

In the [[United States]], [[corn starch]] (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of [[invert sugar]], a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and [[fructose]] that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Conversion to fructose===
{{main|isoglucose}}
In the USA almost exclusively corn (more precisely: corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of [[isoglucose]], which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power — with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is eight million tonnes (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Ullmann 48" /&gt; When made from corn syrup, the final product is [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS).

Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and in the production of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a [[sweetener]], [[humectant]], to increase the [[volume]] and to create a softer [[mouthfeel]].&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

==Analysis==
Specifically, when a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography]] analysis or [[lectin]] [[immunostaining]] is performed with [[concanavalin A]] reporter enzyme conjugate (that binds only glucose or mannose).

===Classical qualitative detection reactions===
These reactions have only historical significance:

====Fehling Test====
The [[Fehling test]] is a classic method for the detection of aldoses.&lt;ref name="Fehling-Harn"&gt;H. Fehling: ''Quantitative Bestimmung des Zuckers im Harn.'' In: ''[[Archiv für physiologische Heilkunde]]'' (1848), volume 7, p.&amp;nbsp;64–73. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a [[carboxylic acid]], while the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; tartrate complex is reduced to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and forming a brick red precipitate (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Tollens Test====
In the [[Tollens test]], after addition of ammoniacal [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] to the sample solution, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced by glucose to elemental [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Tollens: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112025692838;view=1up;seq=535 ''Über ammon-alkalische Silberlösung als Reagens auf Aldehyd'']. In ''[[Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft]]'' (1882), volume 15, p. 1635–1639. (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barfoed test====
In [[Barfoed's test]],&lt;ref name="barfoed"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01462957|title=Ueber die Nachweisung des Traubenzuckers neben Dextrin und verwandten Körpern|journal=Zeitschrift Für Analytische Chemie|volume=12|pages=27–32|year=1873|last1=Barfoed|first1=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a solution of dissolved [[copper acetate]], [[sodium acetate]] and [[acetic acid]] is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown [[copper(I) oxide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Nylander's Test====
As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the [[Nylander's test]].&lt;ref&gt;Emil Nylander: ''Über alkalische Wismuthlösung als Reagens auf Traubenzucker im Harne'', [[Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie]].

(german)&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose forms a black mass with [[stannous chloride]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal [[lead acetate]] solution, white [[lead glycoside]] is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow [[copper oxide]] hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal [[copper acetate]] solution).&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; With [[Hager's reagent]], glucose forms [[mercury oxide]] during boiling.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; An alkaline [[bismuth]] solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose boiled in an [[ammonium molybdate]] solution turns the solution blue. A solution with [[indigo carmine]] and [[sodium carbonate]] destains when boiled with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt;

===Instrumental Quantification===
====Refractometry and Polarimetry====
In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a [[refractometer]], for example in the [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] determination in the course of the production of wine.

====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====
{{main|Glucose oxidation reaction}}
The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000456326900600108|title=Determination of Glucose in Blood Using Glucose Oxidase with an Alternative Oxygen Acceptor|journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry: An International Journal of Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine|volume=6|pages=24–27|year=1969|last1=Trinder|first1=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[phenol]] with [[4-Aminoantipyrine|4-aminoantipyrine]] to a purple dye.

====Photometric Test Strip Method====
The test strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510&amp;nbsp;nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows for routine blood sugar determination by laymen. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550&amp;nbsp;nm, 750&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/A709038B|title=Water-soluble chromogenic reagent for colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide—an alternative to 4-aminoantipyrine working at a long wavelength|journal=Analytical Communications|volume=35|issue=2|pages=71–74|year=1998|last1=Mizoguchi|first1=Makoto|last2=Ishiyama|first2=Munetaka|last3=Shiga|first3=Masanobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amperometric glucose sensor====
The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=18154363|year=2008|last1=Wang|first1=J.|title=Electrochemical glucose biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=814–25|doi=10.1021/cr068123a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The GOx is immobilised on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2008.04.023 |pmid=18656655|year=2008|last1=Chen|first1=X.|title=Amperometric glucose biosensor based on boron-doped carbon nanotubes modified electrode|journal=Talanta|volume=76|issue=4|pages=763–7|last2=Chen|first2=J.|last3=Deng|first3=C.|last4=Xiao|first4=C.|last5=Yang|first5=Y.|last6=Nie|first6=Z.|last7=Yao|first7=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cu-CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes. This way a detection limit of 50 µmol/L has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-009-0260-1|title=Enzyme-free amperometric sensing of glucose using Cu-CuO nanowire composites|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=168|pages=87–92|year=2010|last1=Wang|first1=Guangfeng|last2=Wei|first2=Yan|last3=Zhang|first3=Wei|last4=Zhang|first4=Xiaojun|last5=Fang|first5=Bin|last6=Wang|first6=Lun}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly promising method is the so-called "enzyme wiring". In this case, the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred directly from the enzyme via a molecular wire to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac00087a008 |pmid=8092486|year=1994|last1=Ohara|first1=T. J.|title="Wired" enzyme electrodes for amperometric determination of glucose or lactate in the presence of interfering substances|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=66|issue=15|pages=2451–7|last2=Rajagopalan|first2=R.|last3=Heller|first3=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sensory methods====
There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose.&lt;ref name="Borisov"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr068105t |pmid=18229952|year=2008|last1=Borisov|first1=S. M.|title=Optical biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=423–61|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=O. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/193229681100500507 |pmc=3208862 |pmid=22027299|year=2011 |last1=Ferri |first1=S. |title=Review of glucose oxidases and glucose dehydrogenases: A bird's eye view of glucose sensing enzymes |journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=1068–76 |last2=Kojima |first2=K. |last3=Sode |first3=K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-008-0947-8|title=Boronic acid based probes for microdetermination of saccharides and glycosylated biomolecules|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=162|pages=1–34|year=2008|last1=Mader|first1=Heike S.|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=Otto S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolised products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(99)00073-1|title=Sol–gel based glucose biosensors employing optical oxygen transducers, and a method for compensating for variable oxygen background|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|volume=15|pages=69–76|year=2000|last1=Wolfbeis|first1=Otto S.|last2=Oehme|first2=Ines|last3=Papkovskaya|first3=Natalya|last4=Klimant|first4=Ingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.&lt;ref name="Borisov" /&gt;

====Copper iodometry====
Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.&lt;ref name="Galant"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.071 |pmid=26041177|year=2015|last1=Galant|first1=A. L.|title=Glucose: Detection and analysis|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=188|pages=149–60|last2=Kaufman|first2=R. C.|last3=Wilson|first3=J. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromatographic methods===
In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] and [[gas chromatography]]&lt;ref name="Galant" /&gt; are often used in combination with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Sanz, J. Sanz, I. Martínez-Castro: ''Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of disaccharides and trisaccharides in honey.'' In: ''[[Journal of Chromatography A]]'', volume 1059, issue 1–2, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;143–148; {{PMID|15628134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpg-210190"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glucose mass spectrum|periodical=Golm Metabolome Database|publisher=|url=http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/Spectrums/8dee81a1-8d98-4a73-b55d-9de42f10e190.aspx|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-06-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=[[Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology]] in Golm Database|date=2007-07-19|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Cabañero, J. L. Recio, M. Rupérez: ''Liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry: a new perspective on honey adulteration detection.'' In: ''[[J Agric Food Chem]].'' 54(26), 27 December 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;9719–9727; {{PMID|17177492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatisation using silylation reagents is commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=24054643|year=2013|last1=Becker|first1=M.|title=Ethoximation-silylation approach for mono- and disaccharide analysis and characterization of their identification parameters by GC/MS|journal=Talanta|volume=115|pages=642–51|last2=Liebner|first2=F.|last3=Rosenau|first3=T.|last4=Potthast|first4=A.|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2013.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified.

====In vivo analysis====
Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with [[2-deoxy-D-glucose]] or [[fluorodeoxyglucose]].&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;Donard Dwyer: ''Glucose Metabolism in the Brain.'' Academic Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-123-66852-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in [[positron emission tomography]] in oncology and neurology,&lt;ref name="gdch"&gt;[[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]]: [http://www.gdch.de/strukturen/fg/nuklear/posi2.pdf   wayback=20100331071121 ''Anlagen zum Positionspapier der Fachgruppe Nuklearchemie''], February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/214748 |pmc=4058687 |pmid=24991541|year=2014 |last1=Maschauer |first1=S. |title=Sweetening pharmaceutical radiochemistry by (18)f-fluoroglycosylation: A short review |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1–16 |last2=Prante |first2=O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hill tribe''' ({{lang-th|ชาวดอย, ชาวเขา, คนเขา,}}, {{IPA-th|tɕʰāːw.dɔ̄ːj, tɕʰāːw.kʰǎw, kʰōn.kʰǎw}}) ([[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]]: จาวดอย, คนดอย, {{IPA-nod|t͡ɕāːw.dɔ̄ːj, xōn.dɔ̄ːj}}; "mountain people/folk")&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/226017 English-Thai dictionary entry for "hill tribe"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tumsorn|first1=Maneewan|last2=Chansiriyotin|first2=Supaporn|title=Northern-Central Thai Dictionary (Revised Edition)|date=1986|publisher=Peace Corps/Thailand|location=Thailand|url=http://www.livelingua.com/peace-corps/Thai/Northern-Central%20Thai%20Dictionary.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2014|language=English, Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in Thailand for all of the various [[ethnic group]]s who mostly inhabit the high mountainous [[Northern Thailand|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand|Western]] regions of [[Thailand]], including both sides of the border areas between Northern Thailand, [[Laos]] and [[Burma]], the [[Phi Pan Nam Range]], the [[Thanon Range]], the latter a southern prolongation of the [[Shan Hills]], as well as the [[Tenasserim Hills]] in [[Western Thailand]]. These areas are known for their often mountainous terrain which is in some areas covered by thick forests, while in others it has been heavily affected by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Thailand.htm Forest data: Thailand Deforestation Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill dwelling peoples have traditionally been primarily [[subsistence farmers]] who use [[slash-and-burn]] [[agricultural]] techniques to farm their heavily [[forest]]ed communities.&lt;ref name=Highlanders-Intro&gt;{{cite book|last=Geddes|first=W. R.|title=Highlanders of Thailand|year=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur|editor=John McKinnon and Wanat Bhruksasri|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perceptions that slash and burn practices are environmentally destructive, government concerns over borderland security, and population pressure has caused the government to forcibly relocate many hill tribe peoples.&lt;ref name="Border Lanscapes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Janet C.|title=Border Landscapes: The Politics of Akha Land Use in China and Thailand|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, hill tribes were also a migratory people, leaving land as it became depleted of [[natural resource]]s or when trouble arose. Cultural and adventure travel tourism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alienadv.com/activityDetails/1204/Trekking-with-Hill-Tribes-in-North-Thailand/|title=Trekking with Hill Tribes in North Thailand|website=www.alienadv.com|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in visiting the tribal villages is an increasing source of income for the hill tribes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/life/gallery-thailands-longneck-women-controversial-tourist-attraction-154136/|title=Gallery: Thailand's 'longneck' women, a controversial tourist attraction {{!}} CNN Travel|website=travel.cnn.com|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its ethicacy is often debated.

A 2013 article in ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' said that "Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders—criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land".&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "hill tribe"==
In the 19th century, the tribes living in the mountain ranges were the largest non-Buddhist group in Thailand. Their mountain locations were then considered remote and difficult to access.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"/&gt; In Thai official documents, the term ''hill tribe'' (''Chao Khao'') began to appear in the 1960s. This term highlights a ''Hill and Valley'' [[dichotomy]] that is based on an ancient social relationship existing in most of [[Thai Highlands|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand]], as well as in [[Sipsongpanna]] and [[Northern Vietnam]]. For the most part, the [[Dai people|Dai]]/[[Tai peoples|Tai]]/[[Thai people]] occupied the more fertile [[intermontane basin]]s and the valleys, while the less powerful groups lived in the poorer, higher altitudes. This dichotomy was often also characterized by a master/[[Serfdom|serf relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusuma Snitwongse &amp; W Scott Thompson eds. ''Ethnic Conflicts in Southeast Asia'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (October 14, 2005) {{ISBN|978-9812303370}}, pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, ''Highland Thais'' is a more recent term also used to designate groups living in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"&gt;Sukrittaya Jukping, ''Mae Khru Khong Chaat: A study of women teachers of Thai hilltribe children.'' University of Iowa, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549750161}}, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven major hill tribes within Thailand are the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong/Miao]], [[Yao people|Mien/Yao]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]] each with a distinct language and culture.

===The Akha===

{{main|Akha people}}

The Akha are closely related to the [[Hani people|Hani]] of China's [[Yunnan]] province.&lt;ref name=Hilltribe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known derogatorily in [[Thai language|Thai]] as the Gaw or the E-gaw. The Akha are one of the dominant cultural influences in the area. There are two to three million Akha and Akha-Hani in total, 70,000 of whom live in Thailand. The Akha speak a language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] language group, but have no traditional written language.

Although many Akha, especially younger people, profess [[Christianity]], Akha Zang (The Akha Way) still runs deep in their consciousness. The Akha are a shamanic group that share the ancient universal archetype that the Goddess spins a universe where nature is not distinguished from humankind. They embody the essence of its consciousness into a holistic continuum where there is no dichotomy between themselves and the natural world. The Akha Way, a prescribed lifestyle derived from religious chants, combines [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], shamanism and a deep relationship with the land. The Akha Way emphasizes [[rituals]] in everyday life and stresses strong family ties and the hymn of creation; every Akha male can recount his [[genealogy]] back over fifty generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. AFECT NGO ([http://www.akhathai.org akhathai.org]) is the oldest [[non-governmental organization]] for tribes in Asia helping to protect the deeply shamanic tribal culture. Akha Asia ([http://www.akhaasia.org akhaasia.org]) runs an Akha cultural school.

===The Lahu===

{{main|Lahu people}}

===The Mien or Yao===

{{main|Yao people}}

===The Karen===

{{main|Karen people}}

The Bwa G'Naw,({{Lang-ksw|ပှၤကညီကစၢၢ်ခိၣ်}}) known to many as Karen, and to others as [[Kariang]] or Yang, are one of the largest hill tribes in [[Southeast Asia]]. The total population of Karen people is unknown, since they are spread throughout Burma, Laos and Thailand, and no reliable census has been conducted in Burma since the 1930s. Population estimates range from 7.5 million to 14 million people. (The more conservative estimate makes their population equivalent to that of Switzerland). The approximately 320,000 Karen in Thailand comprise half of the country's total hill tribe population.

While the Karen still practice slash and burn farming as other hill tribes do, they differ in that they live in permanent villages at lower elevations and have been aggressive in developing environmentally sustainable terraced rice fields. These factors have allowed the Karen to better integrate themselves into Thai society.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===The Hmong===

{{main|Hmong people}}

The Hmong are believed to have been the original inhabitants of the [[Yellow River Valley]] in ancient China. The expansion of the neighboring Chinese from the north, caused a disruption in the Hmong culture and forced them to migrate southwards to Laos and Vietnam to escape oppression and persecution. Over the centuries, many wars have been waged against the Chinese. Greatly outnumbered, the Hmong suffered heavy casualties.

The futile efforts to establish themselves as an independent people apart from the expanding Chinese led to their mass exodus further south of China, and eventually into Southeast Asia. From here, they made their way into the territories of the European colonies that later gained independence and became known as Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. While the Hmong came to inhabit the hillside of Thailand because of helping the Americans fight the Vietnam War and lost, the country had always maintained its sovereignty from the colonists.

Today, the Hmong are located in the [[Thai Highlands]], although some are found elsewhere within the country. Among the hilltribes, the Hmong are becoming well integrated into Thai society as well as being among the most successful. The current population of Hmong in Thailand is estimated to be roughly 151,080.

==History==
The practice of modern "real time" disc jockey mixing was preceded by radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music on broadcast radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewster|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Brewster (DJ)|title=Last Night a DJ Saved my Life|publisher=Headline|pages=29|year=2006|isbn=0-7553-1398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, American radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] coined the term "disc jockey" (the combination of ''disc'', referring to the disc records, and ''jockey'', which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer [[Martin Block]], the first radio announcer to gain widespread fame for playing popular recorded music over the air.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Marc | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Something in the Air | publisher = Random House | date = | location = | pages = 11| url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-375-50907-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1943, radio DJ [[Jimmy Savile]] launched the world's first DJ dance party by playing [[jazz]] records in the upstairs function room of the [[Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds]] in [[Otley]], [[England]]. In 1947, he claims to have become the first DJ to use twin turntables for continuous play, and in 1958 became a radio DJ at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Day Belongs To The Local Hero|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830912&amp;id=iPU9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2175,2128192|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=12 September 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1947, the Whiskey à Go-Go nightclub opened in [[Paris, France]], considered to be the world's first commercial discothèque, or disco (deriving its name from the French word meaning a nightclub where the featured entertainment is recorded music rather than an on-stage band). [[Régine Zylberberg|Regine]] began playing on twin turntables there in 1953. Discos began appearing across Europe and the United States.

In the 1950s, American radio DJs would appear live at [[Sock hop|sock hops]] and "platter parties" and assume the role of a human jukebox. They would usually play 45-rpm records, featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs. In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor. In 1955, [[Bob Casey (DJ)|Bob Casey]], a well-known "sock hop" DJ, brought the two-turntable system to the U.S. 

In the late 1950s, [[Reggae sound system|sound system]]s, a new form of public entertainment, were developed in the [[ghetto]]s of [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Promoters, who called themselves DJs, would throw large parties in the streets that centered on the disc jockey, called the "selector," who played dance music from large, loud [[PA systems]] and bantered over the music with a boastful, rhythmic chanting style called "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records.

==1960s and 1970s==
In the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discothèques continued to grow in Europe and the United States. Specialized DJ equipment, such as [[Rudy Bozak]]'s classic CMA-10-2DL mixer, began to appear on the market. In 1969, American club DJ [[Francis Grasso]] popularized beatmatching at [[New York City|New York]]'s Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with ''matching'' ''beats'', or tempos. Grasso also developed [[slip-cueing|slip-cuing]], the technique of holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath, releasing it at the desired moment to create a sudden transition from the previous record. (This technique had long been used in radio.)

By 1968, the number of dance clubs started to decline; most American clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands. Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the [[borough]]s of [[New York City]].

In 1973, [[Jamaica|Jamaican-born]] [[DJ Kool Herc]], widely regarded as the "father of [[hip-hop culture]]," performed at block parties in his [[The Bronx|Bronx]] neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or ''[[break (music)|break]]''. Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turntable Teaching .Berklee College Offers Course On Scratching.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&amp;dat=20040218&amp;id=lghHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kfMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3334,3014916|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] released the first [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200]] turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979—which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. In 1974, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] released the 22-minute song "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]," which takes up the entire first side of [[Autobahn (album)|the album of the same title]]. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[house music]] pioneer [[Frankie Knuckles]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Hip hop music|Hip-hop music]] and culture began to emerge, originating among urban [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in New York City. The four main elements of [[hip hop|Hip Hop culture]] are [[graffiti]], DJing, [[b-boying]], and [[Rapping|MCing (rapping)]].

In the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], causing discothèques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discothèques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975, [[record pool]]s began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method.

In 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html Rane.com]&lt;/ref&gt; hip-hop DJ [[Grand Wizard Theodore]] invented the scratching technique by accident. In 1976, American DJ, editor, and producer [[Walter Gibbons]] remixed "Ten Percent" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]], one of the earliest commercially released 12&amp;Prime; singles (a.k.a. "maxi-single"). In 1979, the [[Sugar Hill Gang]] released "[[Rapper's Delight]]", the first hip-hop record to become a hit.

In 1977, [[Saratoga Springs, NY]] disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor. Today, DJs can find the beats per minute of songs in the BPM List.

==1980s==
In 1981, the cable television network [[MTV]] was launched, originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. The term "[[video jockey]]", or VJ, was used to describe the fresh-faced youth who introduced the music videos. In 1982, the demise of disco in the mainstream by the summer of 1982 forced many nightclubs to either close or change entertainment styles, such as by providing MTV-style video dancing or live bands. Released in 1982, the song "Planet Rock" by DJ [[Afrika Bambaataa]] was the first hip-hop song to feature [[synthesizer]]s. The song melded [[Electro music|electro]] hip-hop beats influenced by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] with the melody from Kraftwerk's "Trans-Europe Express." In 1982, the [[Compact Disc]] reached the public market in Asia, and early the following year in other markets. This event is often seen as the "Big Bang" of the [[digital audio]] revolution.

In the early 1980s, NYC disco DJ [[Larry Levan]], known for his electric mixes, gained a cult following, and the [[Paradise Garage]], the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called [[house music]] emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the [[Warehouse Club]] in [[Chicago]], where resident DJ [[Frankie Knuckles]] mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a [[drum machine]] or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth [[bassline]]. In 1983, [[Jesse Saunders]] released what some consider the first house music track, "On &amp; On." The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of [[New York house|New York Garage]], a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the [[Chicago house]] sound.

During the mid-1980s, [[techno music]] emerged from the [[Detroit]] club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.

In 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by American Record Pool in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the [[Macintosh]] computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, "[[Walk This Way]]", a rap/rock collaboration by [[Run DMC]] and [[Aerosmith]], became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988, ''DJ Times'' magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.

==1990s==
During the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the [[acid house]] scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first [[superstar]] DJs who established marketable "brands" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century—particularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels.

In 1991, ''Mobile Beat'' magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first [[internet]] "radio station", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by [[Carl Malamud]]. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer.

[[File:DJ performing with Danny Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|DJ performing with [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]] in 2014]]

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded [[vinyl record]]s or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard Vinyl DJs", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

In 1998, Nathan Burton (England) started using Computers to Dj instead of vinyls using the popular mpeg3 format at the time.

In 1999, [[Shawn Fanning]] released [[Napster]], the first of the massively popular [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.

==2000s==
At the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds to be developed. The introduction of the Pioneer SVM-1000 Audio and Video Mixer and other high tech digital sound mixers made a whole new culture of disco DJ integration. The proliferation of Internet technologies have also created a culture of disc jockey enthusiast groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeromagnitude.com/|title=ZeroMagnitude - Professional DJs Extreme Remixes|work=ZeroMagnitude}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJ battles imitating the events on the game gave the DJ industry a more competitive phase. The DJ industry has become increasingly about the atmosphere that goes along with a performance. Now not only does the DJ show deal with music and mixing but also lights and effect go along with it.

[[File:Logo iso radiation.svg|thumb|[[ISO]] radiation warning sign.]]

The field of '''[[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|nuclear semiotics]]''' arose in 1981 when a team of engineers, anthropologists, nuclear physicists, behavioral scientists and others was convened on behalf of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and [[Bechtel]] Corp. The goal of this "'''Human Interference Task Force'''" was to find a way to reduce the likelihood of future humans unintentionally intruding on [[radioactive waste]] isolation systems.

Specifically, the task force was to research ways to prevent future access to the planned, but stalled, [[Deep geological repository|deep geological nuclear repository]] project of [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]].

==Problem==
When atomic or fusion bombs are detonated in a war, or nuclear power plants are used in times of peace, an unnaturally high amount of radioactive waste is produced. This material will threaten human life and health for thousands of years. Consequently, nuclear technology necessitates the creation of a secure means of terminal storage for such materials for an unusually long time period.

Unfortunately, there is no method available to continuously provide the necessary knowledge about the location of nuclear waste over thousands of years. The culture of earlier centuries becomes incomprehensible when it is not translated into new languages every few generations. National institutions do not exist longer than a few hundred years. Even religions are not older than a few millennia and do not typically hand down scientific knowledge.

Furthermore, the necessary length of storage is disputed among specialists. One work group in Germany concluded that nuclear waste must be separated from the biosphere up to one million years&amp;nbsp;– about 30,000 human generations{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Earlier assumptions were based on a period of 10,000 years, which seems to be too short given the half-life of certain radioactive isotopes (e.g. [[Plutonium]]-239 at 24,000 years).

The written historical tradition of humanity, in contrast, is only about 5000 years. Warnings in [[cuneiform script]] could be interpreted by some specialists, but others, such as the writing of the [[Indus Valley civilization]], are already illegible after a few thousand years.

==Proposals==
Three parts of any [[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|communication about nuclear waste]] must be conveyed to posterity:
#that it is a message at all
#that dangerous material is stored in a given location
#information about the type of dangerous substances

==Answers==
To determine how to convey these three things, the "''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''" ([[Tübingen]], Germany) issued a poll in 1982 and 1983 asking how a message might be communicated for a duration of 10,000 years. The poll asked the following question: "''How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?" ''leading to the following answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Und in alle Ewigkeit: Kommunikation über 10 000 Jahre: Wie sagen wir unsern Kindeskindern wo der Atommüll liegt?|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=And into Eternity... Communication over 10000s of Years: How Will We Tell our Children's Children Where the Nuclear Waste is?|location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Sebeok===
The linguist [[Thomas Sebeok]] was a member of the [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel]] working group. Building on earlier suggestions made by [[Alvin Weinberg]] and [[Arsen Darnay]] he proposed the creation of an ''atomic priesthood'', a panel of experts where members would be replaced through nominations by a council. Similar to the [[Catholic church]] - which has preserved and authorized its message for over 2000 years&amp;nbsp;— the ''atomic priesthood'' would have to preserve the knowledge about locations and dangers of radioactive waste by creating rituals and myths. The priesthood would indicate off-limits areas and the consequences of disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Thomas |last1=Sebeok|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |trans-title=Pandora's box and its protection:   A relay system in the care of an atom priesthood|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|title=Die Büchse der Pandora und ihre Sicherung: Ein Relaissystem in der Obhut einer Atompriesterschaft    |location=Berlin |language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/enricaLovaglio/pandora/Pandora.html|title=Pandora's Box: How and Why to Communicate 10,000 Years into the Future|website=www.mat.ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has a number of critical problems:
#An ''atomic priesthood'' would gain political influence based on the contingencies that it would oversee.
#This system of information favors the creation of hierarchies.
#The message could be split into independent parts.
#Information about waste sites would grant power to a privileged class. People from outside this group might attempt to seize this information by force.

===Stanisław Lem===
Polish science-fiction author [[Stanisław Lem]] proposed the creation of [[satellites|artificial satellites]] that would transmit information from their orbit to Earth for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stanisław |last1=Lem|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Mathematische Kodierung auf lebendem Trägermaterial |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Mathematical coding on living carrier material   |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also described a biological coding of [[DNA]] in a mathematical sense, which would reproduce itself automatically. ''Information Plants'' would only grow near a terminal storage site and would inform humans about the dangers. The DNA of the so-called atomic flowers would contain the necessary data about both the location and its contents.

Lem acknowledged the problem with his idea that humans would be unlikely to know the meaning of atomic flowers 10,000 years later, and thus unlikely to decode their DNA in a search for information.

===Françoise Bastide and Paolo Fabbri===
French author [[Françoise Bastide]] and the Italian semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed the breeding of so called ''"radiation cats"'' or ''"ray cats"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Françoise|last1=Bastide|first2=Paolo |last2=Fabbri|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Lebende Detektoren und komplementäre Zeichen: Katzen, Augen und Sirenen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Living detectors and complimentary signs: Cats, eyes and sirens |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/27476/ray-cats-artificial-moons-and-atomic-priesthood-how-government-plans-protect-our|title=Ray Cats, Artificial Moons and the Atomic Priesthood: How the Government Plans to Protect Our Nuclear Waste|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|date=2011|website=Mental Floss|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theraycatsolution.com/|title=Ray Cat Solution|website=10,000|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/the-plan-to-protect-humans-from-radioactive-waste-with-cats-2015-8|title=Color-changing cats were once part of a US government plan to protect humankind|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=August 16, 2015|website=Tech Insider|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cat]]s have a long history of cohabitation with humans, and this approach assumes that their domestication will continue indefinitely. These radiation cats would change significantly in color when they came near radioactive emissions and serve as living indicators of danger. In order to transport the message, the importance of the cats would need to be set in the collective awareness through fairy tales and myths. Those fairy tales and myths in turn could be transmitted through poetry, music and painting. The story of this original project was depicted in the 2016 short documentary "The Ray Cat Solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/138843064|title=The Raycat Solution|last=Huguet|first=Benjamin|year=2016|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vilmos Voigt===
Vilmos Voigt from Loránd-Eötvös university ([[Budapest]]) proposed the installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around the terminal storage location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Vilmos |last1=Voigt |publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Konzentrisch angeordnete Warntafeln in zunehmend neueren Sprachformen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Concentrically arranged warning signs in increasingly newer language forms |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a certain time span new signs with translations would be installed, but the old signs would not be removed. Newer signs would be posted farther away from the location, thus the warning would be understandable as languages change and it would be possible to understand the older languages through the translation.

===Emil Kowalski===
Physicist Emil Kowalski from [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], [[Switzerland]] proposed that terminal storage locations be constructed in such a way that future generations could reach them only with a high technical ability. The probability of an unwanted breach would then become extremely small. Furthermore, cultures able to perform such excavations and drillings would most certainly be able to detect radioactive material and be aware of its dangers.

'''Hügelkultur''' is a [[horticulture|horticultural]] technique where a mound constructed from decaying wood debris and other [[compost]]able [[biomass]] plant materials is later (or immediately) planted as a [[raised bed]].  Adopted by [[permaculture]] advocates, it is suggested the technique helps to improve soil fertility, water retention, and soil warming, thus benefiting plants grown on or near such mounds.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name="Permaculture Magazine" /&gt;

==History==
Hügelkultur is a German word meaning mound culture or hill culture.&lt;ref name=Lauterbach /&gt; It is said to have been practiced in German and Eastern European societies for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

The term is first published in a 1962 German gardening booklet by Herrman Andrä.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Inspired by observation of the diversity and success of plants growing in a pile of woody debris, "mound culture" is suggested (as opposed to "flatland culture").&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; This was also posited as an easy way to utilise woody debris without burning, which was illegal.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Andrä appears to have been influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[biodynamic agriculture]]. Steiner developed his biodynamic philosophy through [[meditation]] and [[clairvoyance]], and rejected scientific inquiry on the grounds that his methods were “true and correct unto themselves.”&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=The Science Behind Biodynamic Preparations: A Literature Review |journal=HortTechnology |date=December 2013 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=814-819 |url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/23/6/814.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrä quotes a 1924 lecture on biodynamics by Steiner, which describes mixing of soil with composting or decaying material in earthen hillocks.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Joined by author Hans Beba, another German gardener, "Hill Culture - the horticultural method of the future" was revised and republished several times in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndräBeba"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beba, Hans |author2=Andrä, Herrman |title=Hügelkultur – die Gartenbaumethode der Zukunft |publisher=Waerland |location=Mannheim, Germany |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was later adopted and developed by [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture advocate.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; More recent permaculture advocates such as [[Paul Wheaton]] and [[Geoff Lawton]] strongly promote Hügelkultur beds as a perfect permaculture design.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul, [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds], retrieved 6/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===Construction===
[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed construction, shown without the top layer of soil]]
[[File:Hugelkultur.png|thumb|right|200px|Hügelkultur layout]]
In its basic form, mounds are constructed by piling logs, branches, plant waste, compost and additional soil directly on the ground. The pile has the form of a pyramid. The sides of the two slopes both have a grade of between 65 and 80 degrees.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt; The beds are usually about {{convert|3|ft|m}} by {{convert|6|ft|m}} in area and about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt; However, this height reduces as decomposition progresses.&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=Hugelkultur: What is it, and should it be used in home  gardens? |url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/12233/FS283E.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |publisher=Pullman, Washington : Washington State University Extension |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When positioned on sloped terrain, the beds need to be put at an angle to the hillside (rather than having them parallel to it). This makes sure the beds do not receive unequal amounts of water. In most cases, it is useful to have the beds positioned against the prevailing wind direction.

The raised bed can form light-duty [[swale (landform)|swales]], circles and mazes.&lt;ref name=Hemenway /&gt;&lt;ref name=Feineigle /&gt; Mounds may also be made from alternating layers of wood, sod,&lt;ref name=Shein /&gt; compost, straw, and soil. Although their construction is straightforward, planning is necessary to prevent steep slopes that would result in erosion.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

In his book ''Desert or Paradise: Restoring Endangered Landscapes Using Water Management, Including Lake and Pond Construction'', Holzer describes a method of constructing Hügelkultur which incorporates rubbish such as cardboard, clothes and kitchen waste. He recommends building mounds that are {{convert|1|meter|ft}} wide and any length. Mounds are built in a {{convert|0.7|meter|ft}} trench in sandy soil, and without a trench if the ground is wet.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt;

===Planting===
The mound is left to rest for several months before planting,&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017 /&gt; although some advise immediate planting.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Anything can be grown on the raised beds, but if the bed will decompose/release its nutrients quickly (so long as it is not made of bulky materials like tree trunks), more demanding crops such as pumpkins, courgettes, cucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, sweet corn, celery, or potatoes are grown in the first year, after which the bed is used for less demanding crops like beans, peas, and strawberries.
===Lifespan===
The original German publications described the mounds as having a lifespan of 5-6 years, after which they had to be rebuilt from scratch.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

==Evidence==
As of 2017 there are no peer-reviewed scientific studies available regarding the efficacy of the technique.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; A few university student projects investigate Hügelkultur but have not been published in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

One small scale and short term student project investigated the Hügelkultur method as a potential use for yard trimmings waste, and also if lima beans, kale and okra planted on a Hügelkultur mound showed any signs of nutrient deficiency compared to a non-raised control bed. It was found that over 11 tons of yard trimmings were used in the mound, and no evidence of macronutrient deficiency could be detected in the crops in the short term.&lt;ref name="Adams2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=A |title=UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM SOLID WASTE RESEARCH PROGRAM Student Project Report: Hugelkultur  Gardening Technique Does not Result in Plant  Nutrient  Deficiencies and is a Potential Source Reduction   Strategy for Yard Trimmings Wastes |url=https://www.wisconsin.edu/waste-research/download/2013_student_reports/13%20MSN%20Adams%20Hugelkultur.pdf |date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, despite concerns that incorporation of large quantities of high carbon woody matter would lead to nitrogen immobilization and hence nitrogen deficiency in the crop, a higher level of nitrogen was found in the raised bed. However the micronutrient iron was lower relative to the control bed.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt; The author speculated that no nitrogen deficiency occurred since the roots of the plants did not penetrate past the superficial layers of the mound into the deeper wood-containing region.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt;

A student thesis investigated the water holding capacity of Hügelkultur beds and whether the technique could be useful to prevent [[karst]] rocky [[desertification]] in China.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laffoon |first1=M |title=A Quantitative Analysis Of Hugelkultur And Its Potential Application On Karst Rocky Desertified Areas In China |url=https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1641&amp;context=stu_hon_theses |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3 months of measurements, water concentration in hügel mounds remained high. Samples from hugel sites contained almost twice as much water as those from flat control plots. It was suggested that 1 Hectare of hügels has 3-10 times more water than a flat plot affected by karst rocky desertification.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016 /&gt;

==Theory==
Many publications and websites advocate the technique based on personal experience of the authors.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Some have criticised the technique as lacking genuine scientific principles, and running counter to the ecological principles of soil building with [[litterfall]].&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

Hügelkultur is said to replicate the natural process of decomposition that occurs on forest floors, however in natural ecosystems wood would be present at the soil surface.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Trees that fall in a forest often become [[nurse log]]s&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; decaying and providing [[ecological facilitation]] to seedlings. As the wood decays, its porosity increases, allowing it to store water like a sponge. The water is slowly released back into the environment, benefiting nearby plants.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Hügelkultur beds are said to be ideal for areas where the underlying soil is of poor quality or compacted. They tend to be easier to maintain due to their relative height above the ground.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; 

Decomposition speed of organic material depends on the [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] of the material, among other factors. Wood breaks down relatively slowly because it has one of the highest carbon to nitrogen ratios of all organic matter that is used in composting. If the wood is not processed into smaller pieces with larger surface area to speed up chemical reactions, breakdown is even slower. The decomposition process may in the short term take more nitrogen from the soil through microbial activity ([[nitrogen immobilization]]), if not enough nitrogen is available.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008" /&gt; Thus in the short term the fertility of the soil may be decreased before eventually, perhaps after 1-2 years, the nitrogen level is increased past the original level.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seymour |first1=John |title=The new self-sufficient gardener : the complete illustrated guide to planning, growing, storing and preserving your own garden produce |date=2008 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405321334 |pages=12,13 |edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally therefore, it is said to be advantageous to balance "browns" (e.g. woodchippings) with "greens" (e.g. leaves) for efficient composting, and to allow compost to become well-rotted before applying it a bed to prevent competition between soil bacteria and plants for nitrogen, reducing yield.

==Criticisms and controversy==
===Hügelkultur mounds as solid earthworks===
[[File:Hugelkultur arboretum.jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed with wildflower overplanting]]
Although Hügelkultur beds can safely retain water in light-duty applications (for example, conserving the moisture of rain that falls on the bed), creating heavy-duty rainwater retention areas behind Hügelkultur beds on contour, to catch [[surface runoff]] from surrounding areas, can be dangerous. Some designers conflate the Hügelkultur bed's appearance with that of solid [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], but Hügelkultur beds cannot predictably control large amounts of [[stormwater]] in the way that solid earthworks can. Whereas [[embankment dam]]s or the hillsides of [[swale (landform)|swales]] can be relied on to hold back many thousands of gallons of water for weeks to allow it to seep into the ground, and [[berm]]s can slow runoff, Hügelkultur beds are different in two ways: earthworks have no buoyant core (whereas Hügelkultur mounds contain logs), and the soil that they are made of is compacted. If fresh or dried timber is used in the bed, it may become buoyant in the water-saturated substrate, bursting from the soil covering and releasing all the sitting water through a breach. This can be an issue for years, until the wood is sufficiently rotten and infused with water. Another consideration is that Hügelkultur beds will degrade, shrinking over time into much lower mounds of soft, rich soil. This means that the retention area will have less depth as time goes on, but it also means that the uncompacted soil will remain a threat to breaching even if the logs become saturated.

There is a recorded instance of a breach occurring in a new project. Upon the first rainstorm, the retention areas behind the Hügelkultur beds filled with water and broke through. The released water carried the freshly-buried logs and dirt downhill, smashing a hole in a building being used as a church and filling the space with mud. No injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://permaculturenews.org/2015/11/06/dont-try-building-hugel-swales-this-is-a-very-and-i-mean-very-bad-idea/ |title=Don't Try Building Hugel Swales |publisher=permaculturenews.org |first=Jack |last=Spirko |date=November 6, 2015 |access-date=March 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some permaculturists have taken mild positions against the "hügel swales" still being promoted by other permaculturists, citing the danger and cross-purposes of Hügelkultur beds and swales.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Overfertilization, contamination of soil and water habitats===
Over-fertilized plants are said to have less flavor,&lt;ref name="Holzer2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holzer |first1=Sepp |title=Sepp Holzer's Permaculture: A Practical Guide to Small-Scale, Integrative Farming and Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |isbn=9781603583831 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNXK9kE-lOoC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and too much nitrogen can be consumed by eating certain plants which have been over-fertilised (e.g. spinach).&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Advocates state that overfertilization is a risk in the first year if woodchips are used, which will break down too fast.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Instead raised beds made with whole logs release nutrients slowly over a period of years.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; It has been suggested that excessive use of decomposing organic matter in Hügelkultur could leach out and contaminate and disrupt soil and water habitats.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">The '''International N. D. Kondratiev Foundation''' is an economic research organization founded in 1992 at an international conference devoted to the centenary of the birth of [[Nikolai Kondratiev]]. The foundation is accredited by the Department of Social Sciences, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The founding (and now honorary) president was [[Leonid Abalkin]], with A. A. Nikonov, Yu. V. Yakovets, G. Pallavicini (Italy), and Yakob van Dein (Netherlands) as vice-presidents. The present president is Ruslan Grinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikf2011.ru/index.php?id=160_0_1_0_C|title=МФК - Международный фонд Н. Д.

The foundation has three basic activities:
# Carrying out international conferences, symposia, Kondratieff readings;
# Coordinating interdisciplinary research performed on the orders of the state organizations and according to the plans of the foundation itself;
# Conducting jointly with the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] international competitions for the N.D. Kondratieff gold, silver, and bronze medals for contributions to the development of the social sciences, and the commemorative N.D. Kondratieff medal for young scientists.

== Kondratiev medals ==
In 1993 the foundation and the Russian Academy of Sciences established gold, silver, and bronze medals in honour of Kondratiev. These are awarded every three years after a competition. Three are awarded to local and three to foreign scientists for their contribution to the development of social sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8181">'''Johann Jakob Griesbach''' (4 January 1745 – 24 March 1812), German biblical [[textual critic]], was born at [[Butzbach]], a small town in the state of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], where his father, Konrad Kaspar (1705–1777), was pastor. Griesbach's fame rests upon his work in [[New Testament]] criticism, in which he inaugurated a new epoch. His solution to the [[synoptic problem]] bears his name, but the [[Griesbach hypothesis]] has been modernly referred to as the [[Two-Gospel hypothesis]].
[[File:Griesbach1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johann Jakob Griesbach]]

==Education and career==
Griesbach was educated at [[Frankfurt]], and at the universities of [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[university of Halle|Halle]], where he became one of [[Johann Salomo Semler|J. S. Semler]]'s most ardent disciples. It was Semler who induced him to turn his attention to the textual criticism of the New Testament. At the close of his undergraduate career he undertook a literary tour through Germany, the Netherlands, France and England. In England he may have met [[Henry Owen]] whose seminal work ''Observations on the Four Gospels'' (1764) is listed among the books of Griesbach's estate, although he does not seem to have acknowledged any indebtedness to Owen.

On his return to Halle, Griesbach acted for some time as ''Privatdozent'', but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial chair; in 1775 he went to the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|University of Jena]], where he spent the rest of his life (though he received calls to other universities).

==New Testament text critic==
[[File:Johann Jacob Griesbach.jpg|thumb]]
Griesbach's critical edition of the [[New Testament]] first appeared at Halle, in three volumes, in 1774-1775. The first volume contained the first three Gospels, synoptically arranged; the second, the [[Epistles]] and the [[book of Revelation]]. All the historical books were reprinted in one volume in 1777, the synoptical arrangement of the Gospels having been abandoned as inconvenient. Of the second edition, considerably enlarged and improved, the first volume appeared in 1796 and the second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition, edited by David Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four Gospels, appeared (1827).

For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his basis the [[House of Elzevir|''Elzevir'']] edition. Where he differed from it he placed the ''Elzevir'' reading on the inner margin along with other readings he thought worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in smaller type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special marks indicating the precise degree of probability in his opinion attaching to each. In weighing these probabilities he proceeded upon a particular theory which in its leading features he had derived from [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]] and J. S. Semler, dividing all the manuscripts into three main groups – the [[Alexandria]]n, the Western and the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]].

A reading supported by only one [[recension]] he considered as having only one witness in its favour; those readings which were supported by all the three recensions, or even by two of them, especially if these two were the Alexandrian and the Western, he unhesitatingly accepted as genuine. Only when each of the three recensions gives a different reading does he proceed to discuss the question on other grounds.

See his ''Symbolae criticae ad supplendas et corrigendas variarum N. T. lectionum collectiones'' (Halle, 1785, 1793), and his ''Commentarius criticus in textum Graecum N. T.'', which extends to the end of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and discusses the more important various readings with great care and thoroughness (Jena, 1794 if.).

Among the other works of Griesbach (which are comparatively unimportant) may be mentioned his university thesis ''De codicibus quatuor evangelislarum Origenianis'' (Halle, 1771) and a work upon [[systematic theology]] (''Anleitung zur Kenntniss der populären Dogmatik'', Jena, 1779). His ''Opuscula'', consisting chiefly of university "Programs" and addresses, were edited by [[Johann Philipp Gabler|Gabler]] (2 vols, Jena, 1824).

==Gospel Synopsis==
In 1776 Griesbach published his Greek Gospel synopsis of Matthew, Mark and Luke as a volume separate from his critical edition of the New Testament (cf. above), of which it had previously been a part, and thereby established the tool of a synopsis as an essential research aid in New Testament studies.

For Griesbach's hypothesis concerning the interrelation of the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and its modern variant, see [[Griesbach hypothesis]].

==Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976==
To mark the bicentenary of the publication of Griesbach's Gospel synopsis as a separate volume a group of distinguished international biblical scholars met in July 1976 at Münster/Westphalia for ''The Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976''.

A selection of the papers presented at the colloquium appraising Griesbach's life, work and influence, aimed "to indicate why an understanding of this scholar's contribution to New Testament criticism is important both for the history of New Testament scholarship and for contemporary research", together with the text in Latin and in English translation of ''The Dissertation of J. J. Griesbach, Doctor of Theology and Principal Professor in the University of Jena, in which he demonstrates that the entire Gospel of Mark has been extracted from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written in the name of the University of Jena (1789–1790), now revised and furnished with many additions'', are to be found in [[Bernard Orchard]] and [[Thomas R. W. Longstaff]] (ed.), ''J. J. Griesbach: Synoptic and Text-Critical Studies 1776-1976'', Volume 34 in the SNTS Monograph Series (Cambridge University Press, hardback 1978, paperback 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-02055-7}}).

[[File:Junior-Jaguar-Belize-Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[jaguar]], a keystone, [[flagship species|flagship]], and [[umbrella species]], and an [[apex predator]]]]
A '''keystone species''' is a [[species]] that has a disproportionately large effect on its [[natural environment|environment]] relative to its abundance. Such species are described as playing a critical role in maintaining the structure of an [[ecological community]], affecting many other [[organism]]s in an [[ecosystem]] and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community. A keystone species is a plant or animal that plays a unique and crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions. Without keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. Some keystone species, such as the wolf, are also [[apex predator]]s.

The role that a keystone species plays in its ecosystem is analogous to the role of a [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] in an [[arch]]. While the keystone is under the least pressure of any of the stones in an arch, the arch still collapses without it. Similarly, an ecosystem may experience a dramatic shift if a keystone species is removed, even though that species was a small part of the ecosystem by measures of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]].
It became a popular concept in [[conservation biology]], alongside [[flagship species|flagship]] and [[umbrella species]]. Although the concept is valued as a descriptor for particularly strong inter-species interactions, and it has allowed easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized for oversimplifying complex ecological systems.

==History==
{{double image|right|Ochre sea stars.jpg|170|California Mussels 002.jpg|192|Ochre seastars (''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]''), a keystone [[predator]]|California mussels (''[[Mytilus californianus]]''), the seastar's prey}}

The concept of the keystone species was introduced in 1969 by the zoologist [[Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|Robert T. Paine]].&lt;ref name="paine1969"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |year=1969 |title=A Note on Trophic Complexity and Community Stability |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=103 |issue=929 |pages=91–93 |doi=10.1086/282586 |jstor=2459472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Keystone Species Hypothesis |url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1969g.html | publisher=University of Washington | accessdate=2011-02-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110060757/http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1969g.html| archivedate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine developed the concept to explain his observations and experiments on the relationships between [[marine invertebrate]]s of the [[intertidal zone]] (between the high and low tide lines), including [[starfish]] and [[mussel]]s. He removed the starfish from an area, and documented the effects on the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="mills1993"/&gt; In his 1966 paper, ''Food Web Complexity and Species Diversity'', Paine had described such a system in [[Neah Bay, Washington|Makah Bay]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="paine1966"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R.

In his 1969 paper, Paine proposed the keystone species concept, using ''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]'', a species of starfish, and ''[[Mytilus californianus]]'', a species of mussel, as a primary example.&lt;ref name="paine1969"/&gt; The concept became popular in conservation, and was deployed in a range of contexts and mobilized to engender support for conservation, especially where human activities had damaged ecosystems, such as by removing keystone predators.&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | title=Mobilizing metaphors: the popular use of keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation| volume=20 | issue=7 | year=2011 | doi=10.1007/s10531-011-0035-y | pages=1427–1440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HHMI |first=BioInteractive |title=Some Animals Are More Equal than Others: Keystone Species and Trophic Cascades – HHMI (2016) |url=http://naturedocumentaries.org/14877/animals-equal-others-keystone-species-trophic-cascades-hhmi-2016/ |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
A keystone species was defined by Paine as a [[species]] that has a disproportionately large effect on its [[natural environment|environment]] relative to its abundance.&lt;ref name="paine1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |year=1995 |title=A Conversation on Refining the Concept of Keystone Species |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=962–964 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined operationally by R. D. Davic in 2003 as "a strongly interacting species whose top-down effect on [[biodiversity|species diversity]] and [[competition (biology)|competition]] is large relative to its [[biomass]] dominance within a functional group."&lt;ref name=Davic2003&gt;{{cite web | title=Linking Keystone Species and Functional Groups: A New Operational Definition of the Keystone Species Concept| url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/resp11/ | author=Davic, Robert D. | publisher=Conservation Ecology | year=2003 | accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic keystone species is a [[predator]] that prevents a particular [[herbivorous]] species from eliminating dominant [[plant]] species. If prey numbers are low, keystone predators can be even less abundant and still be effective. Yet without the predators, the herbivorous prey would explode in numbers, wipe out the dominant plants, and dramatically alter the character of the ecosystem. The exact scenario changes in each example, but the central idea remains that through a chain of interactions, a non-abundant species has an outsized impact on ecosystem functions. For example, the herbivorous [[weevil]] ''[[Euhrychiopsis lecontei]]'' is thought to have keystone effects on aquatic plant diversity by foraging on nuisance [[Myriophyllum spicatum|Eurasian watermilfoil]] in North American waters.&lt;ref name="creed2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Creed, R. P., Jr. |year=2000 |title=Is there a new keystone species in North American lakes and rivers? |journal=OIKOS |volume=91 |issue=2 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910222.x |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the wasp species ''[[Agelaia vicina]]'' has been labeled a keystone species for its unparalleled nest size, colony size, and high rate of brood production. The diversity of its prey and the quantity necessary to sustain its high rate of growth have a direct impact on other species around it.&lt;ref name="paine1995"/&gt;

The keystone concept is defined by its ecological effects, and these in turn make it important for conservation. In this it overlaps with several other species conservation concepts such as [[flagship species]], [[indicator species]], and [[umbrella species]]. For example, the [[jaguar]] is a charismatic big cat which meets all of these definitions:&lt;ref name=Maehr2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maehr |first1=David |last2=Noss |first2=Reed F. |last3=Larkin |first3=Jeffery L. |title=Large Mammal Restoration: Ecological And Sociological Challenges In The 21St Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3n_pBQFxVQC&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2001 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-817-3 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The jaguar is an umbrella species, flagship species, and wilderness quality indicator.

==Predators==

===Sea otters and kelp forests===
{{Double image|right|Seaurchin 300.jpg|150|Mother sea otter with rare twin baby pups (9137174915).jpg|204|Sea urchins like this [[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus|purple sea urchin]] can damage kelp forests by chewing through kelp [[holdfast]]s|The [[sea otter]] is an important predator of [[sea urchin]]s, making it a keystone species for the kelp forests.}}

[[Sea otters]] protect [[kelp forest]]s from damage by sea urchins. When the sea otters of the North American west coast were hunted commercially for their fur, their numbers fell to such low levels – fewer than 1000 in the north Pacific ocean – that they were unable to control the sea urchin population. The urchins in turn grazed the [[holdfast]]s of [[kelp]] so heavily that the kelp forests largely disappeared, along with all the species that depended on them. Reintroducing the sea otters has enabled the kelp ecosystem to be restored. For example, in Southeast Alaska some 400 sea otters were released, and they have bred to form a population approaching 25,000.&lt;ref name="Szpak2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Szpak | first=Paul | last2=Orchard | first2=Trevor J. | last3=Salomon | first3=Anne K. | last4=Gröcke | first4=Darren R. | title=Regional ecological variability and impact of the maritime fur trade on nearshore ecosystems in southern Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada): evidence from stable isotope analysis of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) bone collagen | journal=Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences | volume=5 | issue=2 | year=2013 | doi=10.1007/s12520-013-0122-y | pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estes1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=James E. |author2=Smith, Norman S. |author3=Palmisano, John F. |year=1978 |title=Sea otter predation and community organization in the Western Aleutian Islands, Alaska|journal=Ecology |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=822–833 |doi=10.2307/1938786 |publisher=Ecology |jstor=1938786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohn1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohn, J.

===The wolf, Yellowstone's apex predator===

{{further|Apex predator}}

Keystone predators may increase the [[biodiversity]] of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. They can have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular [[ecosystem]]. Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Botkin, D. |author2=Keller, E. |date=2003 |title=Environmental Science: Earth as a living planet |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-38914-9 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elimination of the [[gray wolf]] from [[Yellowstone National Park]] had profound impacts on the [[trophic pyramid]]. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the beavers helped slow the water down, allowing soil to stay in place. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. When wolves were reintroduced, the beaver population and the whole riparian ecosystem recovered dramatically within a few years.&lt;ref name="Ripple2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ripple | first=William J. | last2=Beschta | first2=Robert L. | title=Wolves and the Ecology of Fear: Can Predation Risk Structure Ecosystems? | journal=BioScience | publisher=Oxford University Press  | volume=54 | issue=8 | year=2004 | doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0755:WATEOF]2.0.CO;2 | page=755 |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/8/755/238242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea stars and other non-apex predators===

As described by Paine in 1966, some [[sea stars]] (e.g., ''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]'') may prey on [[sea urchin]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other [[shellfish]] that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably, driving out most other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |date=1966 |title=Food web complexity and species diversity |journal=American Naturalist |volume=100 |pages=65–75 |jstor=2459379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These creatures need not be [[apex predator]]s. Sea stars are prey for [[sharks]], [[Ray (fish)|rays]], and [[sea anemones]]. Sea otters are prey for [[orca]].&lt;ref name="estes1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Estes, J. A. |author2=Tinker, M. T. |author3=Williams, T. M. |author4= Doak, D. F. |date=1998-10-16 |title=Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5388 |pages=473–476 |doi=10.1126/science.282.5388.473 |bibcode=1998Sci...282..473E |pmid=9774274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[jaguar]], whose numbers in Central and South America have been classified as [[near threatened]], acts as a keystone predator by its widely varied diet, helping to balance the [[mammalian]] jungle ecosystem with its consumption of 87 different species of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Nowell, K. |editor2=Jackson, P. |date=1996 |work=Wild Cats, Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=''Panthera onca'' |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |pages=118–122 |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/6998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion]] is another keystone species.&lt;ref name="HaleKoprowski2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hale | first=Sarah L. | last2=Koprowski | first2=John L. | title=Ecosystem-level effects of keystone species reintroduction: a literature review | journal=Restoration Ecology | date=February 2018 | doi=10.1111/rec.12684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banksia prionotes 3 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|Acorn banksia, ''[[Banksia prionotes]]'', is the sole source of nectar for important [[pollinator]]s, [[honeyeater]]s.]]

==Mutualists==

Keystone mutualists are organisms that participate in mutually beneficial interactions, the loss of which would have a profound impact upon the ecosystem as a whole. For example, in the [[Avon Wheatbelt]] region of [[Western Australia]], there is a period of each year when ''[[Banksia prionotes]]'' (acorn banksia) is the sole source of [[nectar]] for [[honeyeater]]s, which play an important role in [[pollination]] of numerous plant species. Therefore, the loss of this one species of tree would probably cause the honeyeater population to collapse, with profound implications for the entire ecosystem. Another example is [[frugivores]] such as the [[cassowary]], which spreads the seeds of many different trees, and some will not grow unless they have been through a cassowary.&lt;ref name="Lambeck 1999"&gt;{{cite paper | title=Landscape Planning for Biodiversity Conservation in Agricultural Regions: A Case Study from the Wheatbelt of Western Australia | version=Biodiversity Technical Paper No. 2 | first=Robert J. | last=Lambeck | publisher=[[CSIRO]] Division of Wildlife and Ecology | year=1999 |isbn=978-0-642-21423-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Conserving Biological Diversity through Ecosystem Resilience | first=Brian | last=Walker | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=9 | issue=4 | year=1995 | pages=747–752 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineers==
[[File:PrairieDogTownGregg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prairie dog]] town. Drawing by [[Josiah Gregg]], 1844]]
{{further|Ecosystem engineer}}

A term used alongside keystone is [[ecosystem engineer]].&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"/&gt; In [[North America]], the [[prairie dog]] is an ecosystem engineer. Prairie dog burrows provide the nesting areas for [[mountain plover]]s and [[burrowing owl]]s. Prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater into the [[water table]] to prevent [[surface runoff|runoff]] and [[erosion]], and can also serve to change the composition of the soil in a region by increasing aeration and reversing soil compaction that can be a result of cattle grazing. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators.&lt;ref name="NGPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/prairiedogs.asp  |title=Prairie Dogs |website=Wildlife Species Guide |publisher=Nebraska Game and Park Commission |accessdate=10 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819031734/http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/prairiedogs.asp |archivedate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing species such as [[plains bison]], [[pronghorn]], and [[mule deer]] have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Rosmarino2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prairiedogcoalition.org/pd-associated-species.php |author=Rosmarino, Nicole |year=2007 |title=Associated Species : Prairie Dogs are a Keystone Species of the Great Plains |publisher=Prairie Dog Coalition |accessdate=10 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110163932/http://www.prairiedogcoalition.org/pd-associated-species.php |archivedate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeaverDam 8409.jpg|thumb|Beaver dam, an [[structures built by animals|animal construction]] which has a transformative effect on the environment]]

The [[beaver]] is a well known ecosystem engineer and keystone species. It transforms its territory from a stream to a pond or swamp. Beavers affect the environment first altering the edges of [[riparian]] areas by cutting down older trees to use for their dams. This allows younger trees to take their place. Beaver dams alter the riparian area they are established in. Depending on topography, soils, and many factors, these dams change the riparian edges of streams and rivers into wetlands, meadows, or riverine forests. These dams have been shown to be beneficial to a myriad of species including amphibians, salmon, and song birds.&lt;ref name="wright2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright, J. P. |author2=Jones, C.

In the African [[savanna]], the larger herbivores, especially the [[elephants]], shape their environment. The elephants destroy trees, making room for the grass species. Without these animals, much of the savanna would turn into [[woodland]].&lt;ref name="leakey1995"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leakey |first1=Richard |author1link=Richard Leakey |first2=Roger |last2=Lewin |author2link=Roger Lewin |title=The sixth extinction: biodiversity and its survival |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix |isbn=1-85799-473-6 |pages=216–217 |chapter=11 The modern elephant story |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian studies have found that [[parrotfish]] on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] are the only reef fish that consistently scrape and clean the coral on the reef. Without these animals, the Great Barrier Reef would be under severe strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gruber, Karl |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/09/single-keystone-species-may-be-key-to-reef-health/ |title=Single keystone species may be the key to reef health |publisher=Australian Geographic |date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Although the concept of the keystone species has a value in describing particularly strong inter-species interactions, and for allowing easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized by L. S. Mills and colleagues for oversimplifying complex ecological systems. The term has been applied widely in different ecosystems and to predators, prey, and plants (primary producers), inevitably with differing ecological meanings. For instance, removing a predator may allow other animals to increase to the point where they wipe out other species; removing a prey species may cause predator populations to crash, or may allow predators to drive other prey species to extinction; and removing a plant species may result in the loss of animals that depend on it, like [[pollinator]]s and seed dispersers. Beavers too have been called keystone, not for eating other species but for modifying the environment in ways that affected other species. The term has thus been given quite different meanings in different cases. In Mills's view, Paine's work showed that a few species could sometimes have extremely strong interactions within a particular ecosystem, but that does not automatically imply that other ecosystems have a similar structure.&lt;ref name="mills1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mills, L.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

The '''Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung'') was founded in 1969 and is one of the 82 Max Planck Institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]]. It is located on a campus in Stuttgart, together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems]].

== Research Focus ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research is focused on the physics and chemistry of condensed matter, including especially complex materials and nanoscale science. In both of these fields, electronic and ionic transport phenomena are of particular interest.

== Organization ==
The institute currently has eight departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.fkf.mpg.de/3721/10_Departments|title=Departments|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic Structure Theory===
Led by Ali Alavi, the Department of Electronic Structure Theory is concerned with the development of [[ab initio]] methods for treating [[correlated electronic systems]], using [[Quantum Monte Carlo]], quantum chemical and many-body methodologies. Ab initio methods (including density functional theory) will be applied to problems of interest in heterogeneous catalysis, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and photochemistry.

===Solid State Spectroscopy===
The Department of Solid State Spectroscopy is headed by Bernhard Keimer. [[Collective quantum phenomena]] in highly correlated electronic materials are studied by spectroscopic and scattering techniques. Topics of particular current interest include the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides, the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, and the control of electronic phase behavior in metal-oxide superlattices. The department also develops new spectroscopic methods such as high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and spectral ellipsometry.

===Nanoscale Science===
Research efforts in the Department of Nanoscale Science, directed by Klaus Kern, are centered on nanometer-scale science and technology with a focus on the bottom-up paradigm. The aim of the interdisciplinary research at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology is to gain control of materials at the atomic and molecular level, enabling the design of systems and devices with properties determined by quantum behavior on one hand and approaching functionalities of living matter on the other hand.

===Low Dimensional Electron Systems===
The main focus of the scientific work in the Department Low Dimensional Electron Systems is on electronic properties of 2-, 1-, and 0-dimensional electron systems, in particular the influence of quantum phenomena on the transport and optical response. It is headed by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Physical Chemistry of Solids===
Under Joachim Maier, the Department of Physical Chemistry of Solids is concerned with [[electrochemistry]] and [[ion transport]]. Emphasis is laid on ion conductors (such as inorganic or organic proton, metal ion and oxygen ion conductors) and mixed conductors (typically perovskites). The research ranges from the exploration of basic mechanisms to the design of materials for electrochemical applications (batteries, fuel cells, sensors). Of special significance is the scientific foundation of the field Nanoionics.

===Solid State Quantum Electronics===
Induced by quantum mechanical phenomena, heterostructures grown from complex materials offer a fascinating potential to create novel electron systems. Many have outstanding properties that are not otherwise found in nature. The design, growth, and exploration of such electron systems are at the focus of the Department of Solid State Quantum Electronics spearheaded by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Quantum Many-Body Theory===
Directed by Walter Metzner, Electronic properties of solids are analyzed and computed in the Department of Quantum Many-Body Theory with a main emphasis on systems where electronic correlations play a crucial role, such as [[cuprates]], [[manganites]] and other [[transition metal oxides]]. Besides symmetry-breaking phase transitions leading to [[magnetism]], orbital and charge order, or [[superconductivity]], correlations can also cause electron localization and many other striking many-body effects not described by the independent electron approximation.

===[[Quantum materials|Quantum Materials]]===
Entanglement of electrons in solids, in combination with details of the crystal lattice structure, produce a surprisingly rich variety of electronic phases, that are liquid, liquid-crystal and crystalline states of the charge and spin degrees of freedom. These complex electronic phases and the subtle competition among them very often give rise to novel functionality. The Department of Quantum Materials, led by Hidenori Takagi, is studying these interesting novel phases in transition metal oxides and related compounds where the narrow d-bands, which give rise to strong electron correlations, in combination with the rich chemistry of such materials provide excellent opportunities for new discoveries.

{{Politics}}

A '''merger''', '''consolidation''' or '''amalgamation''', in a political or administrative sense, is the combination of two or more political or administrative entities, such as [[municipality|municipalities]] (in other words [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, etc.), [[county|counties]], [[district]]s, etc., into a single entity. This term is used when the process occurs within a sovereign entity.

Unbalanced growth or outward expansion of one neighbor may necessitate an administrative decision to merge (see [[urban sprawl]]). In some cases, common perception of continuity may be a factor in prompting such a process (see [[conurbation]]).  Some cities (see [[#Notable municipal mergers|below]]) that have gone through amalgamation or a similar process had several administrative sub-divisions or jurisdictions, each with a separate [[Mayor|person in charge]].

[[Annexation]] is similar to amalgamation, but differs in being applied mainly to two cases:
#The units joined are sovereign entities before the process, as opposed to being units of a single political entity.
#A city's boundaries are expanded by adding territories not already incorporated as cities or villages.

==Notable municipal mergers==
The act of merging two or more [[Municipality|municipalities]] into a single new municipality may be done for a variety of reasons, including urban growth, reducing the cost of local government and improving the efficiency of municipal service delivery.

===Belgium===
In 1977, the 2,359 [[municipalities of Belgium]] were merged to 596 new municipalities.

===Brazil===
In 1975, the [[Guanabara (state)|state of Guanabara]] and the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil were merged. The former consisted of only the territorial limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro, formerly the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] as Brazilian capital until 1960, when it was moved to newly built [[Brasília]]. When merged, Guanabara became the [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|municipality of Rio de Janeiro]] within the new state. In geographical terms, it would seem the state of Rio would have incorporated Guanabara; but, as the administrative and financial resources of the former capital were significant and even larger than the rest of the state, the change was more correctly referred to as a merger (''fusão'').

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the 1990s saw the forced amalgamation of several municipal entities in the provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] into larger new municipalities. The process created what was labeled a ''megacity'' by the media, although none of the created municipalities fit in the definition of a megacity in the international sense and some of them have fewer than a million inhabitants.

The provincial government of [[Mike Harris]] undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to just 447.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx Municipal restructuring since 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105084333/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx |date=2012-11-05 }}.

* [[Toronto]] – In 1967, the towns of [[Leaside]], [[Mimico]], [[New Toronto]] and [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] and the villages of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch]] and [[Swansea, Toronto|Swansea]] amalgamated into the city and boroughs comprising [[Metropolitan Toronto]]. In 1998, the former boroughs within Metropolitan Toronto were merged into a new [[Toronto|City of Toronto]].
* [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] – In 1973, the provincial government created the new City of Cambridge by amalgamating the City of Galt, the towns of [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]] and [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], and the hamlet of Blair.
* [[Thunder Bay]] – On January 1, 1970, the twin cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], merged into one city.
* [[Ottawa]] – In 2001, the municipalities of Ottawa, [[Cumberland, Ontario|Cumberland]], [[Osgoode Township, Ontario|Osgoode]], [[Rideau Township, Ontario|Rideau]], [[Goulbourn Township, Ontario|Goulbourn]], [[West Carleton Township, Ontario|West Carleton]], [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]], [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]], [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]], [[Vanier, Ontario|Vanier]] and [[Rockcliffe Park, Ontario|Rockcliffe Park]] amalgamated.
* [[Greater Sudbury]] – resulted from the merger of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 2001; the regional municipality itself was created by a series of municipal amalgamations in 1973.
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] – In 2001, the former City of [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]] and the former towns of [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]] and [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]] merged to create the new City of Hamilton.
* [[Temiskaming Shores]] – In 2004, the towns of New Liskeard and Haileybury, along with the township of Dymond, merged to create the new town of Temiskaming Shores.

;Quebec
{{See also|Reorganization of Montreal|Municipal reorganization in Quebec}}
* [[Gatineau]] – five municipalities in southwestern Quebec (Gatineau, [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], [[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]], [[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]] and [[Masson-Angers, Quebec|Masson-Angers]]) were merged into a new city of Gatineau in 2002.
* [[Longueuil]]
* [[Montreal]] – In the [[Reorganization of Montreal|Montreal Merger]] on January 1, 2002, the [[Parti Québécois]] provincial government merged all municipalities on the [[Island of Montreal]] into a new City of Montreal. On January 1, 2006, a partial demerger occurred.
* [[Quebec City]]
* [[Rouyn-Noranda]]
* [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] – The cities of [[Chicoutimi]], [[Jonquière]], [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]] and [[Laterrière, Quebec|Laterrière]], along with the municipalities of Lac-Kénogami and Shipshaw and part of the township of Tremblay, were amalgamated into the City of Saguenay in 2002.

;Manitoba
* [[Winnipeg]]: in 1971, the municipalities of [[Transcona, Winnipeg|Transcona]], [[St. Boniface, Manitoba|St. Boniface]], [[St. Vital, Winnipeg|St. Vital]], [[West Kildonan]], [[East Kildonan, Winnipeg|East Kildonan]], [[Tuxedo, Winnipeg|Tuxedo]], [[Old Kildonan]], [[North Kildonan]], [[Fort Garry, Winnipeg|Fort Garry]], [[Charleswood, Winnipeg|Charleswood]], and [[St. James, Manitoba|St. James]] were amalgamated via the [[City of Winnipeg Act]]. The word ''unicity'' is used more commonly than megacity to describe that particular amalgamation.

===Denmark===
In 1970, mergers brought the number of [[municipalities of Denmark]] from 1,098 to 277. In 2007, the (by then) 270 municipalities were consolidated into 98 municipalities, most of them results of mergers.

===Finland===
An ongoing series of mergers has reduced the number of [[municipalities of Finland]] from 432 in 2006 to 311 in 2017.

===Germany===
Several [[states of Germany|states]] of [[West Germany]] carried out municipal merger programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], the number of municipalities dropped from 3,379 to 1,110 between 1968 and 1975; in [[Bavaria]], from roughly 7,000 to roughly 2,000 between 1972 and 1978; in [[Hesse]], from 2,642 to 421 between 1972 and 1977; in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], from 2,365 to 396 between 1967 and 1975; and in [[Saarland]], from 345 to 50 in 1974. In the Bavarian town of [[Ermershausen]], citizens occupied the town hall to resist the merger with [[Maroldsweisach]] – unsuccessfully, although Ermershausen was reconstituted as an independent municipality in 1994 – and [[Horgau]], also in Bavaria, successfully appealed its merger with [[Zusmarshausen]] to the Constitutional Court of Bavaria (''Bayerischer Verfassungsgerichtshof''). Mergers have also taken place in the former [[East Germany]] after 1990, for example in [[Brandenburg]] in 2003.

===Greece===
The [[Kallikratis Plan]] replaced the 1033 [[municipalities and communities of Greece]] with 325 new municipalities in 2011.

===Hungary===
[[Budapest]], the capital and largest city in Hungary, was formed from the merger of the cities of Buda and Pest across the river Danube in 1873.

===Israel===
In 2003 the cities of [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] and [[Jatt, Israel|Jatt]] joined to form the city of [[Baqa-Jatt]], but the merger was dissolved in 2010.

===Japan===
{{main|Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan}}

===Malaysia===
On 21 April 2018, The Negeri Sembilan state government declared about merger of [[Seremban Municipal Council]] (MPS) and [[Nilai Municipal Council]] (MPN) to become Seremban City Council (MBS). Thus making [[Seremban]] elevated to city status in Jan 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/node/534043&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In November 2010, the Seven Councils of Auckland City: Auckland City Council, Manukau City Council, Waitakere City Council, North Shore City Council, Papakura District Council, Rodney District Council and most of Franklin District Council has seen amalgamated to form Auckland City Council.

===Portugal===
[[Portugal]] was one of the first countries in the world to make an enlarged modern administrative reform, particularly during the 19th century. In early 19th century, the country was divided into more than 800 municipalities. In 1832, during [[Portuguese Civil War]], a law from [[Mouzinho da Silveira]], minister from the liberal [[government-in-exile]] (which then ruled only in the [[Azores]]) simplified the public administration, and reduced the number of municipalities to 796. In 1836, after the liberal victory, Passos Manuel, minister from the government of the [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira|Marquess of Sá da Bandeira]] made a profound administrative reform which reduced significantly the number of municipalities, fixing it to 351. Passos Manuel reform followed a trend very decentralist, creating an elected municipal administration. In 1855, another series of mergers reduced the number of municipalities to 254. In the rest of the 19th century, some series of mergers occurred (particularly during the 1890s), meanwhile other municipalities were restored. Thereafter, the changes to the municipal map focused mainly on the restoration and creation of new municipalities, particularly in the 20th century. Nowadays, there are 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities in Portugal]]. The last alteration to the municipal map, occurred in 1998, with the creation of the municipalities of [[Odivelas Municipality|Odivelas]] (in [[Lisbon district]]), [[Trofa Municipality|Trofa]] (in [[Porto district]]) and [[Vizela Municipality|Vizela]] (in [[Braga district]]).

In 2013, more than 1,000 [[parish]]es/[[freguesia]]s were merged.

===Sweden===
Many rural [[municipalities of Sweden]] were merged in 1952; the number of them decreasing from 2,281 to 816. Another series of mergers, this time also including cities and market towns, reduced the total number of municipalities from roughly 1,000 in the early 1960s to 278 in 1974. As of 2013, Sweden has 290 municipalities.

===United States===
In United States politics, such a merged entity may be called a [[consolidated city–county]].
* [[City of Greater New York]] – The amalgamation of the 5 boroughs ([[Manhattan]], [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) of New York.
* [[Unigov]] – The local government amalgamation of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].
* In [[New Jersey]], [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]] and [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]] became one municipality ([[Princeton, New Jersey]]), in January 2013, after voters passed a referendum in early November 2011, supported by residents of both municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Mancuso/The Times |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2011/11/princeton_voters_approve_conso.html |title=Princeton voters approve consolidation of borough, township into one municipality |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">'''Metaphoric criticism''' is one school of [[rhetoric]]al analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.

==Origins==
The term "metaphor" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in ''The Elements of Rhetoric'', defines metaphor as "an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'"&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, James. (1878). "The Elements of Rhetoric." New York: Harper and Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally "display" and "magnet" are not considered synonyms. However, in using "magnet" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the "display" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.

In a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of [[Kenneth Burke]] and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by [[George Lakoff]].

==Application==
Metaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled "Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor," George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a "war" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a "crime" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the "war" metaphor: "The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Evan Frisch. (2006) "[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060927081227/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.

Critics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the "enemy" that the bear represents.

==Conduction==
In ''Rhetorical Criticism'',&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K. (1995). ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.'' 2nd edition. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:

# First, the critic reads or views the entire artifact with specific attention to its context.
# Second, to the critic isolates the metaphor(s) within the text, both obvious and more subtle substitutions of meaning. Here Foss invokes Max Black's interaction theory of "tenor" (the principal subject or focus) and "vehicle" (secondary subject or frame for the metaphor), a method to analyze ways in which the related dissimilar objects actually share similar characteristics.
# Third, the critic sorts the metaphors and look for patterns of use within the text. The more comprehensive the text, the longer this step will take.
# The critic analyzes the metaphor(s) or groups of metaphors in the artifact to reveal how their structure may affect the intended audience. Foss writes, "Here, the critic suggests what effects the use of the various metaphors may have on the audience and how the metaphors function to argue for a particular attitude toward the ideas presented."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11703">The '''radix economy''' of a number in a particular base (or [[radix]]) is the number of [[digit (math)|digit]]s needed to express it in that base, multiplied by the base (the number of possible values each digit could have). This is one of various proposals that have been made to quantify the relative costs of using different radices in representing numbers, especially in computer systems. 

Radix economy also has implications for organizational structure, networking, and other fields.

==Definition==
The '''radix economy''' ''E''(''b'',''N'') for any particular number ''N'' in a given base ''b'' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;E(b,N) = b \lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor \,  &lt;/math&gt;

where we use the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;]] and the base-b [[logarithm]] &lt;math&gt;\log_{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

If both ''b'' and ''N'' are positive integers, then the radix economy &lt;math&gt;E(b,N)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of [[digit (math)|digit]]s needed to express the number ''N'' in base  ''b'', multiplied by base ''b''.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Third Base | author = [[Brian Hayes (scientist)|Brian Hayes]] | journal = [[American Scientist]] | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | year = 2001 | pages = 490 | doi = 10.1511/2001.40.3268 | url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2001/11/third-base | accessdate=2013-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The radix economy thus measures the cost of storing or processing the number ''N'' in base ''b'' if the cost of each "digit" is proportional to ''b''. A base with a lower average radix economy is therefore, in some senses, more efficient than a base with a higher average radix economy.

For example, [[100 (number)|100]] in [[decimal]] has three digits, so its radix economy is 10×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;30; its binary representation has seven digits (1100100&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) so it has radix economy 2×7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14 in base 2; in [[base 3]] its representation has five digits (10201&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with a radix economy of 3×5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15;  in base 36 (2S&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;) its radix economy is 36×2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;72.

If the number is imagined to be represented by a [[combination lock]] or a [[tally counter]], in which each wheel has ''b'' digit faces, from &lt;math&gt;0, 1, ..., b-1&lt;/math&gt; and having &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; wheels, then the radix economy &lt;math&gt;b \lfloor \log_b (N) +1 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of digit faces needed to inclusively represent any integer from 0 to ''N'' (assuming all wheels must have the same number of faces each).

==Radix economy of different bases==
===''e'' has the lowest radix economy===
Here is a proof that [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] is the ''real''-valued base with the lowest average radix economy:

First, note that the function

: &lt;math&gt; y = \frac {x} {\ln(x)}\, &lt;/math&gt;

is strictly decreasing on 1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''e'' and strictly increasing on ''x'' &gt; ''e''. Its minimum, therefore, for x &gt; 1, occurs at [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']].

Next, consider that
: &lt;math&gt; {E(b,N)} \approx {b\ {\log_b (N)}} = {b {\ln(N) \over \ln(b)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Then for a constant N, &lt;math&gt;{E(b,N)}&lt;/math&gt; will have a minimum at [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] for the same reason y does, meaning e is therefore the base with the lowest average radix economy.  Since 2 / ln(2) ≈ 2.89 and 3 / ln(3) ≈ 2.73, it follows that 3 is the ''integer'' base with the lowest average radix economy.

===Comparing different bases===
The radix economy of bases ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be compared for a large value of ''N'':

: &lt;math&gt; {{E(b_1,N)} \over {E(b_2,N)}} \approx {{b_1 {\log_{b_1} (N)}} \over {b_2 {\log_{b_2} (N)}}}
= {\left( \dfrac{b_1 \ln (N)} {\ln (b_1)} \right) \over \left( \dfrac{b_2 \ln (N)} {\ln (b_2)} \right)} = {{b_1 \ln (b_2)} \over {b_2 \ln (b_1)}} \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Choosing ''e'' for ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the economy relative to that of ''e'' by the function:

: &lt;math&gt; {{E(b)} \over {E(e)}} \approx {{b \ln (e)} \over {e \ln (b)}} = {{b} \over {e \ln(b)}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The average radix economies of various bases up to several arbitrary numbers (avoiding proximity to powers of 2 through 12 and ''e'') are given in the table below.  Also shown are the radix economies relative to that of ''e''.  Note that the radix economy of any number in base 1 is that number, making it the most economical for the first few integers, but as ''N'' climbs to infinity so does its relative economy.

==Ternary tree efficiency==
One result of the relative economy of base 3 is that [[ternary search tree]]s offer an efficient strategy for retrieving elements of a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/database/ternary-search-trees/184410528 |title=Ternary Search Trees |last1=Bentley |first1=Jon |last2=Sedgewick |first2=Bob |date=1998-04-01 |website=Dr. Dobb's Journal |publisher=UBM Tech |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis suggests that the optimum design of a large [[Interactive voice response|telephone menu system]] to minimise the number of menu choices that the average customer must listen to (i.e. the product of the number of choices per menu and the number of menu levels) is to have three choices per menu.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

==Computer hardware efficiencies==
The 1950 reference ''High-Speed Computing Devices'' describes a particular situation using contemporary technology. Each digit of a number would be stored as the state of a [[ring counter]] composed of several [[triode]]s. Whether [[vacuum tube]]s or [[thyratron]]s, the triodes were the most expensive part of a counter. For small radices ''r'' less than about 7, a single digit required ''r'' triodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=22–23 |chapter=3-6 The ''r''-triode Counter, Modulo ''r'' |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Larger radices required 2''r'' triodes arranged as ''r'' [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], as in [[ENIAC]]'s decimal counters.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=23–25 |chapter=3-7 The 2''r''-triode Counter, Modulo ''r'' |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So the number of triodes in a numerical register with ''n'' digits was ''rn''. In order to represent numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, the following numbers of tubes were needed:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Radix ''r''
! Tubes ''N'' = ''rn''
|-
| 2
| 39.20
|-
| 3
| 38.24
|-
| 4
| 39.20
|-
| 5
| 42.90
|-
| 10
| 60.00
|}

The authors conclude,
{{quote|Under these assumptions, the radix 3, on the average, is the most economical choice, closely followed by radices 2 and 4. These assumptions are, of course, only approximately valid, and the choice of 2 as a radix is frequently justified on more complete analysis. Even with the optimistic assumption that 10 triodes will yield a decimal ring, radix 10 leads to about one and one-half times the complexity of radix 2, 3, or 4. This is probably significant despite the shallow nature of the argument used here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=84–87 |chapter=6-7 Economy Attained by Radix Choice |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other criteria==
In another application, the authors of ''High-Speed Computing Devices'' consider the speed with which an encoded number may be sent as a series of high-frequency voltage pulses. For this application the compactness of the representation is more important than in the above storage example. They conclude, "A saving of 58 per cent can be gained in going from a binary to a ternary system. A smaller percentage gain is realized in going from a radix 3 to a radix 4 system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engineering Research Associates Staff |title=High-Speed Computing Devices |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1950 |pages=419–421 |chapter=16-2 New Techniques |url=https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedComputingDevices |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary encoding has a notable advantage over all other systems: greater noise immunity. Random voltage fluctuations are less likely to generate an erroneous signal, and circuits may be built with wider voltage tolerances and still represent unambiguous values accurately.

==Academic life==
Rottenburg studied social anthropology, sociology and Arab studies (1973-1978) at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. For his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[anthropology]] he conducted 39 months of [[fieldwork]] in [[South Kordofan]] (Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazin.uni-halle.de/14469/forschen-zwischen-krieg-und-krise/ Ines Godazgar. ''Forschen zwischen Krieg und Krise.'' In: Scientia Halensis] Retrieved February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984-1987, he lectured at the University of Transkei, South Africa. Later he did research on formal organization in companies and city administrations in Europe. In the 1990s Rottenburg worked as a consultant for projects in development cooperation, carrying out research in Africa and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/personal/richard_rottenburg/publications_richard_rottenburg/ a list of his consultancy paper] Retrieved March 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These engagements provided him with the ethnographic material for his [[habilitation]], which he completed at [[Viadrina European University]] (Frankfurt/Oder) in 1999. In 2002 Rottenburg became full professor and founding director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Anthropology at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. There he established a research group around his research focus on Law, Organisation, Science and Technology (LOST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/lost/ LOST homepage at the University of Halle-Wittenberg] Retrieved January 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006-2012 he was a Max Planck Fellow, heading a project on Biomedicine in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/de/research/fellow_groups/mpfg01/bio-africa.html Homepage Biomedicine in Africa project at the MPI for Social Anthropology Halle, Germany] Retrieved January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was head or spokesperson of several research programs.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, he headed the program 'Traveling Models in Conflict Management' (2006-2009), funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

==Research interests==
In his early work, Rottenburg's focus was on the effects of so-called modern traits in African settings. In his book on the life and economic strategies of the Lemwareng ([[Moro Nuba]]) in South Kordofan (Sudan) he conceptualized processes of [[cultural syncretization]] and hybridization as ''accretion'' (Akkreszenz). Rottenburg expanded this interest throughout his career, theorizing the travel of ideas, technologies and procedures and their intercultural translation, as well as the making of objectivity and rationality in various avenues. Thereby he combines insights from Science and Technology Studies with his expertise on Africa and his ethnographic attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dasts.dk/wp-content/uploads/Concept-Paper-STSAfirca.pdf his recent activities to establish a Network for Science and Technology Studies] Retrieved March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the book '[[Far-Fetched Facts]]', an 'epistemological thriller of development aid' as a critic of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung put it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezension-sachbuch-es-muss-umgekrempelt-sein-11323422.html Book review of the German version 'Weit hergeholte Fakten', FAZ December 2, 2002] Retrieved April 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By connecting [[Social Anthropology]] to approaches from [[Science and Technology Studies]], Rottenburg is a leading figure in taking German anthropology in new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-bonn.de/~hevers/papers/Evers2004-Rottenburg.pdf Hans-Dieter Evers 2004.

The project was conceived and carried out under the auspices of the [[Fabian Society]]'s Women's Group, which she co-founded in 1908. The report was originally published as a political pamphlet or tract, arguing for specific reforms, but is still in print and considered relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzine.co.nz/views/maud_reeves.html nzine review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/30/round-about-pound-maud-pember-reeves] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review of 2008 reissue&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
[[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09|A Royal Commission]] was gathering evidence on the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]]; [[Beatrice Webb]] was a commissioner, and contributed to [[Minority report (Poor Law)|the Minority Report]], but she could see that most of the commission had a [[Majority report (Poor Law)|different vision to implement]].  Webb was also a member of the Fabian Society, a precursor to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as was Pember Reeves. They wanted to understand and alleviate poverty, so they focussed their attention on a few dozen families in [[Lambeth]], a poor borough in [[South London]] and still one of the poorest parts of Britain,&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; and recorded their attempt at [[social reform]] over the four years just before the [[Great War]], i.e. 1909–1913. The families they selected were ''not'' the poorest; they were the "respectable poor" of the working class, with the menfolk in relatively stable employment, earning "about a [[pound (sterling)|pound]] a week"; nonetheless, one in five of the [[infant mortality|children died at birth]], and another one in ten before they reached adulthood. The project targeted pregnant women, and offered them money for extra food from a few months before the birth until several months afterwards. The families kept detailed budgets of their income and expenditure. 

The book contains details of the division of food within the family, with the breadwinner being given a much greater share of the food than the rest of the family. This was because the other family members were completely dependent on the breadwinner. Nonetheless, this was rarely a sufficient amount.&lt;ref name=Oren /&gt; The conditions in the book have been described as "appalling",&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;Rose, Sonya O, 1993, "Limited Livelihoods. Gender and Class in nineteenth-Century England".

It has also been noted that Reeves avoided the "sense of moral superiority" common in outside observers of these people, seeing them as "independent, resourceful, hard-working, respectable, but poor".&lt;ref name=Perkin&gt;Perkin, Joan, 1989.

{{citation style|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], a '''schema''' (plural ''schemata'' or ''schemas'') describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = P | year = 1997 | title = Culture and cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 263–287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadkarni | first1 = S. | last2 = Narayanan | first2 = V. K. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic schemas, strategic flexibility, and firm performance: The moderating role of industry clockspeed | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 243–270 | doi = 10.1002/smj.576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" /&gt;

People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include [[Rubric (academic)|academic rubrics]], [[Social cognition#Social schemas|social schemas]], stereotypes, [[social role]]s, [[Behavioral script|scripts]], [[worldview]]s, and [[archetype]]s. In [[Piaget's theory]] of development, children construct a series of schemata, based on the interactions they experience, to help them understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgeon | first1 = O.R. | last2 = Ritter | first2 = F.E. | year = 2011 | title = An intrinsically motivated schema mechanism to model and simulate emergent cognition | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.07.003 | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 15–16 | issue = | page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before psychology separated from philosophy, the term "schema" was prominently discussed in philosophy by [[Schema (Kant)|Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nevid | first1 = J. S. | year = 2007 | title = Kant, cognitive psychotherapy, and the hardening of the categories | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 605–615 | doi = 10.1348/147608307X204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] and [[Jean Piaget]]: the term "schema" was introduced by Piaget in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1923). {{cite web|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP23_Langag_pensee_chap1_fonctionslang.pdf|title=Langage et pensée chez l'enfant}} (3e éd. 1948 revue et avec un nouvel avant-propos et un nouveau chapitre II inséré  utgave  bind). Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, p. 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was popularized in psychology and education through the work of the British psychologist [[Frederic Bartlett]],&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bartlett |first=F.C. |year=1932 |title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who drew on the term [[body schema]] used by neurologist [[Henry Head]]. It was expanded into schema theory by educational psychologist Richard C. Anderson.&lt;ref name=lingualinks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ImplementALiteracyProgram/SchemaTheoryOfLearning.htm|title=Schema theory of learning|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|date=2 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other terms have been used to describe schema such as "frame", "scene" and "script".

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a [[heuristic]] technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleider | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Pezdek | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldinger | first3 = S. D. | last4 = Kirk | first4 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Schema-driven source misattribution errors: Remembering the expected from a witnessed event | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1002/acp.1361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information ([[proactive interference]]), such as when existing [[stereotype]]s, giving rise to limited or [[bias]]ed discourses and expectations ([[prejudice]]s), lead an individual to "see" or "remember" something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = M. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = N. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of schemas, stimulus ambiguity, and interview schedule on eyewitness memory over time | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 101–118 | doi = 10.1037/1076-898X.9.2.101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to "remember" the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See {{section link||Background research}} below.)

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Which schema is selected can depend on factors such as current activation, accessibility, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and emotion.

''Accessibility'' is how easily a schema comes to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut; it allows the [[availability heuristic|most common explanation to be chosen for new information]].

With priming, a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of [[subliminal message]]s, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the [[mere exposure effect]]—which requires consciousness of the stimuli—is far more effective than priming.

==Background research==
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by Bartlett.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; By presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations and then monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc.), Bartlett was able to establish that individuals' existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret "schema-foreign" new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, "The War of the Ghosts", and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:
* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be "padded out" and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett's work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor immutable but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. In a sense it supports the [[existentialism|existentialist]] view that people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment, and that much of what people "remember" is actually confabulated (adjusted and rationalized) narrative that allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable at any given time.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E. (1980) [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4 Schemata: the building blocks of cognition]. In: R.J. Spiro et al. (Eds) Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. See also: Mandler, J. M. (1984). Stories, scripts, and scenes: Aspects of schema theory. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its erroneous recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Treyens | first2 = J. C. | title = Role of schemata in memory for places | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages= 207–230 | year = 1981 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90008-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic's study and were later asked about the room's contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants' expectations that books are present in academics' studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=The Psychology of Computer Vision|editor=Patrick H. Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, [[David Rumelhart]] extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the [[mental representation]] of complex knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|title=Schemata: The Building Blocks of Cognition|year=1980|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|edition=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Rodger C.|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Abelson|first2=Robert P.|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual's schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their [[worldview]]. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Crocker, J. (1981). Schematic bases of social information processing. In E. T. Higgins, C. A. Herman, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), Social cognition: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology (pp. 89-134). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen on a deep level— frequently an individual does not become conscious of or even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of [[disconfirmation bias]], the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations.&lt;ref name="taberandlodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taber | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Lodge | first2 = Milton | title = Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs | journal = American Journal of Political Science | publisher = Midwest Political Science Association | volume = 50 | number = 3 | pages= 755–769 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x | issn = 0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Chris S. | last2 = Durso | first2 = Francis T. | year = 1984 | title = Effect of schema-incongruent information on memory for stereotypical attributes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | pmid = 6747816 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema. Accommodation usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Studies in Reflection Abstraction|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Sussex|isbn=1-84169-157-7|editor=Robert L. Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says "chickens with red feathers can lay eggs". This schemata will then be either changed or removed, in the future.

[[Assimilation (psychology)|Assimilation]] is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. An example would be, when an unfamiliar dog is seen, a person will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that doesn't seem dog-like, there will be [[Accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]] as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With Accommodation and Assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into existing schema this is called disequilibrium and this is an unpleasant state for the child's development. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the child remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S. A|title=Jean Piaget {{!}} Cognitive Theory|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-schema==
{{Main|Self-schema}}
Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one's self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and selectively ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = J. D. | year = 2000 | title = On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 906–92 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 | pmid=11138760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanitioso | first1 = R. | last2 = Kunda | first2 = Z. | last3 = Fong | first3 = G. T. | year = 1990 | title = Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 229–41 | pmid = 2213492 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, memories may even be distorted to become more favorable, for example, people typically remember exam grades as having been better than they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bahrick | first1 = Harry P | last2 = Hall | first2 = Lynda K | last3 = Berger | first3 = Stephanie A | year = 1996 | title = Accuracy and Distortion in Memory for High School Grades | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 265–271 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00372.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when people have negative self views, memories are generally biased in ways that validate the negative self-schema; people with low self-esteem, for instance, are prone to remember more negative information about themselves than positive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Story | first1 = A. L. | year = 1998 | title = Self-esteem and memory for favorable and unfavorable personality feedback | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | doi=10.1177/0146167298241004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent's pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swann | first1 = W. B. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Pelham | first3 = B. W. | year = 2002 | title = Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates | url = | journal = Journal of Self and Identity | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 219–233 | doi=10.1080/152988602760124856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of self-verification.

As researched by [[Aaron T. Beck|Aaron Beck]], automatically-activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–449 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url= http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate= |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: "If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine." This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Glossary|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Self-Schema|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schema therapy==
{{Main article|Schema therapy|List of maladaptive schemas}}
Schema therapy was founded by [[Jeffrey Young]] and represents a development of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) specifically for treating [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. E. (1999) Cognitive therapy for personality disorders: A schema-focused approach. (rev ed.) Sarasota, FL: Professional Resources Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Klosko &amp; Weishaar (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vScjGGgJEZgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Schema Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide]. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Early maladaptive schemata'' are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one's relationships with others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[object relations]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] and [[psychoanalytic]] therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy is the latter "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on [[Schema therapy#Limited reparenting|limited reparenting]]".&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffery|title=Schema Therapy|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310804.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be [[eating disorder]]s and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

The term '''serious play''' refers to an array of [[Play (activity)|playful]] inquiry and innovation methods that serve as vehicles for complex [[problem solving|problem-solving]], typically in work-related contexts.  [[Lego Serious Play]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/seriousplay|title=Lego Official Serious Play Site|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best known examples; however, serious play methods also include [[Improvisational theatre|improv theater]], [[Roleplay simulation|role play exercise]]s, low fidelity prototyping, as well as certain simulations and [[gamification]] interventions, etc.

In recent years, an increasing body of academic and popular literature have argued that being in a playful mode (engaging in playful processes and applying a playful, open mindset) can foster creativity and innovation as it emphasizes possibilities, freedom, and process versus outcome, [[self-consciousness]], responsibility and shame. According to Gauntlett (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Gauntlett|title=Creative explorations: new approaches to identities and audiences|year=2007|isbn=978-0415396592|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The non-judgmental environment of play, it is claimed, is more likely to foster surprising and innovative ideas" (see Stephenson (1998);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Stephenson|title=Play Theory of Mass Communication|isbn=9780887387050|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1988|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terr (2000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lenore|last=Terr|title=Beyond Love and Work: why adults need to play|year=2000|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0684863160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee (2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Paul Gee|title=[[What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kane (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Kane|title=The Play Ethic: a manifesto for a different way of living|year=2005|isbn=9780330489300|publisher=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The term "serious play" was popularized with the publication of Michael Schrage's book ''Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schrage|title=Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=9780875848143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious play methods can be used as vehicles for engaging teams in the five stages of the [[design thinking]] process: empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dschool.stanford.edu/redesigningtheater/the-design-thinking-process/ | title=The Design Thinking Process | work=ReDesigning Theater | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods are designed to create a safe environment for exploring and sharing ideas and help engage teams in behaviors and mindsets that integrate disparate knowledge and align team efforts towards problem-solving and organizational change. Serious play methods are most often used in creative industries (e.g. product and service design), yet also hold a promise to foster creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in general management practices as well. While much of the serious play literature focuses on [[business]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristiansen|author2=Rasmussen|title=Building A Better Business: Using The Lego Serious Play Method|year=2014|isbn=978-1118832455|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burgi|author2=Victor|author3=Lentz|title=Modeling how their business really works prepares managers for sudden change|year=2004|doi=10.1108/10878570410525106|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=32|issue=2|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sorensen|author2=Spoelstra|title=Play at Work: continuation, intervention, and usurpation|year=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258174266_Play_at_Work_Continuation_Intervention_and_Usurpation|doi=10.1177/1350508411407369|journal=Organization|volume=19|issue=1|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; its benefits are applied in numerous fields, including [[military]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check out the US military's sandbox of silly-putty that predicts disasters and war|author=Aliya Sternstein|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/06/check-out-us-militarys-sandbox-silly-putty-predicts-disasters-and-war/129509/?oref=defenseone_today_nl|date=June 29, 2016|work=Defense One}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|last2=Palmer|title=Intergroup Encounters of a Different Kind: the experiential research model|year=1989|doi=10.1080/03075078912331377683|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=14|issue=3|pages=297–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Mann: Serious Play (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montesa-Andres|author2=Garrigos-Simon|author3=Narangajavana|chapter=A Proposal for Using Lego Serious Play in Education|year=2011|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-04825-3_10|isbn=978-3-319-04824-6|title=Innovation and Teaching Technologies|publisher=Springer International Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[healthcare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katie Watson|title=Teaching Medical Skills with Improvisation Techniques|year=2011|journal=Acad.

Because serious play is still an emergent field and used in various contexts, it is sometimes branded as or referred to by other names. For instance, the University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, utilizes an array of serious play methods when dealing with complex problems, which they refer to as liberating structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/ufmcs-red-teaming | title=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies / Red Teaming | publisher=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to serious play is the concept of strategic play, which was the subject of a facilitator's guide book written by Jacqueline Lloyd Smith &amp; Denise Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Strategic Play: The Creative Facilitator's Guide | publisher=Wordzworth Publishing | author=Jacqueline Lloyd Smith | year=2015 | isbn=978-1783240258 | author2=Denise Meyerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

While the concept of "serious play" may sound like an [[oxymoron]], it is the dual nature of the concept that makes it powerful. It is play with a purpose and intentionality that goes beyond simply having fun.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Statler|last2=Heracleous|last3=Jacobs|title=Serious Play as a Practice of Paradox|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0021886311398453|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|volume=47|issue=2|pages=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|last2=Victor|title=Towards a New Model of Strategy-making as Serious Play|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0263-2373(99)00015-8|journal=European Management Journal|volume=17|issue=4|pages=348–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rieber|last2=Smith|last3=Noah|title=The Value of Serious Play|year=1998|journal=Educational Technology|volume=38|issue=6|pages=29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serious aspect requires a degree of focus on a task or challenge, while the play aspect emphasizes imagination and toying with boundaries. Together, these seemingly juxtapose components are able to foster a deeper engagement – also known as a state of flow&lt;ref name=Csikszentmyhalyi&gt;{{cite book|author=Csikszentmyhalyi, M.|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1990|isbn=9780060162535}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participants lose track of time and their inner critique. Being playful also enables us to better tolerate the ambiguity and uncertainty that characterizes many of the problems modern organizations face.

Using play as a way to develop adaptive human potential is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutton-Smith, B.|title=The ambiguity of play|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780674017337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play", Mabogunje et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.designsociety.org/publication/27350/product_design_and_intentional_emergencefacilitated_by_serious_play | title=Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play | author=Mabogunje | year=2008 | editor=L. Roosimölder|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their non-judgmental and cross sector/hierarchy communicative approaches, serious play methods allow for solutions and connections to emerge that more rigid traditional methods had missed.

There exists an array of serious play methods – from "energizers" to prototyping methods and from open-ended, emergence-oriented interventions to goal-achievement-oriented interventions (e.g. gamification) – all of which offer different affordances in terms of knowledge creation, sharing, and conversion.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

== Characterizing different methods ==

Table 1 below characterizes five types of serious play methods, that are reoccurring in the academic literature, according to the following five parameters:

[[File:Wheel of Knowledge.png|thumb|Wheel of Knowledge]]

'''Purpose/rational:''' What is the purpose of applying the method?

'''Role(s) of the participant(s):''' Do the participants work individually or in teams? Which types of roles/activities do they engage in?

'''Level of Materiality:''' Does the method typically involve physical artifacts? Are the meaning or these literal or metaphorical? Or, in contrast, is the intervention typically delivered through a digital/virtual game or an incentive structure?

'''Degree of structure:''' Is the method explorative/open-ended? Does it allow for emergence? Or is there a "one best way" of doing the activity? Is there a quantifiable output?

'''Phase applicability:'''  In which of the phase(s) mentioned in the Wheel of Knowledge&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|first=Camilla|last=Jensen|title=Play is the Proper Prescription for Entrepreneurship|year=2016|url=http://www.pubpub.org/pub/play-is-the-proper-prescription-for-entrepreneurship|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is this method applicable? (Socialization, Externalization, Internalization, and/or Combination).

| '''LEGO® Serious Play®''' || To access and make knowledge, wisdom, and perspectives shared through model construction and storytelling. To facilitate a constructive dialogue (ideate, reflect, and strategize) about a given topic/ issue. || Participants take on roles as: individual builder, storyteller, active listener, co-constructor of physical models and metaphorical meaning. Non-competitive. The physical constraints of the building system puts emphasis on metaphors and meaning-making and takes pressure off making something that resembles. || Material and metaphorical || Semi structured: Facilitated, structured process and turn taking. Process does allow for pursuing new directions as new knowledge emerge.

| '''[[Gamification]]''' || To incentivize productivity and/or behavior change through competition and/or a game-like reward- structure || Participants strive to achieve the goals outlined to obtain rewards and reinforcing, positive feedback. This can be individually or collaboratively. Typically competitive (against personal best or other participants/teams) || Immaterial (e.g. company incentive structure) or virtual (e.g. game or app) || Highly structured: "one best way", desired goals and outcomes are predefined. May appear open-ended to the participant, however, structure is imposed through the underlying game algorithms or company policies (incentives).|| Optimization, exploitation || (Jagoda, 2013) (Millen, DiMicco, &amp; Street, 2012) (Muntean, 2011)

Workshops will often use multiple serious play methods to compliment each other and allow participants to explore different applicability phases of the challenges they face.

'''Stellar drift''', or the motion of stars, is a necessary result of the [[Special relativity#Lack of an absolute reference frame|lack of an absolute reference frame]] in special relativity.

Nothing in space stands still—more precisely, standing still is meaningless without defining what "still" means. Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been moving away ever since the [[Big Bang]], as explained by the [[metric expansion of space]]. Galaxy motion is also influenced by [[galaxy groups and clusters]]. Stars orbit moving galaxies, and they also orbit moving [[star cluster]]s and [[binary star|companion star]]s. Planets orbit their moving stars.

Stellar drift is measured by two components: [[proper motion]] (multiplied by distance) and [[radial velocity]]. Proper motion is a star's motion across the sky, slowly changing the shapes of [[constellation]]s over thousands of years. It can be measured using a telescope to detect small movements over long periods of time. Radial velocity is how fast a star approaches or recedes from us. It is measured using [[redshift]]. Both components are complicated by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so the motions of stars are described relative to the Sun, not the Earth ([[Star#Kinematics|kinematics of stars]]).

This is also true of the better-known [[Ackermann function]]. The Sudan function was the first function having this property to be published.

It was discovered (and published&lt;ref&gt;Bull. Math. Soc. Roumaine Sci. 30 (1927), 11 - 30; Jbuch 53, 171&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1927 by [[Gabriel Sudan]], a [[Romania]]n [[mathematician]] who was a student of [[David Hilbert]].

:&lt;math&gt;F _{n+1} (x, y+1) = F _n (F_{n+1} (x, y), F_{n+1} (x, y) + y + 1), \ n\ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15966">'''TNP-ATP''' is a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[molecule]] that is able to determine whether or not a [[protein]] binds to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and the constants associated with that binding. It is primarily used in [[fluorescence]] [[spectroscopy]], but is also very useful as an acceptor molecule in [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]], and as a fluorescent [[Fluorophore|probe]] in fluorescence [[microscopy]] and [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[File:TNP BINDING.jpg|thumb|TNP BINDING]]

== Constituent parts ==
TNP refers to the [[chemical compound]] 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, also known as [[Picric acid]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Xiang |last2=Huang |first2=Xiaomei |last3=Wu |first3=Di |date=June 2015 |title=Förster Resonance-energy-transfer Detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol Using Copper Nanoclusters |journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry |volume=407 |issue=16 |pages=4607–4613 |doi=10.1007/s00216-015-8657-7 |pmid=25893800}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary constituent of many unexploded landmines, and is a cousin to [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], but less stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is recognized as an environmental contaminant and is [[Toxicity|toxic]] to many organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is still commonly used in the manufacturing of [[fireworks]], [[explosives]], and [[rocket fuels]], as well as in leather, pharmaceutical, and dye industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is an essential mediator of life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fluorescent and colored trinitrophenylated analogs of ATP and GTP |last=Hiratsuka |first=Toshiaki |date=February 2003 |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=270 |issue=17 |pages=3479–3485 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x |pmid=12919312 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x/asset/j.1432-1033.2003.03748.x.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to overcome unfavorable energy barriers to initiate and fuel chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also used to drive biological machinery and regulate a number of processes via protein-[[phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the proteins that bind ATP for both regulation and [[Enzymatic hydrolysis|enzymatic]] reactions are very diverse—many yet undiscovered—and for many proteins their relationship to ATP in terms of number of [[binding site]]s, [[binding constant]]s, and [[dissociation constant]]s remain unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== TNP-ATP ==
Conjugating TNP to ATP renders this nucleotide triphosphate fluorescent and colored whilst allowing it to retain its biological activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; TNP-ATP is thus a  [[Fluorophore|fluorescent]] [[Substrate analog|analog]] of ATP.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fujita |first1=Suguru |last2=Nawata |first2=Tomoko |last3=Yamada |first3=Kazuhiro |date=March 1999 |title=Fluorescence Changes of a Label Attached near the Myosin Active Site on Nucleotide Binding in Rat Skeletal Muscle Fibres |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=515 |issue=3 |pages=869–880 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.869ab.x |issn=1469-7793 |pmc=2269193 |pmid=10066911}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conjugation is very useful in providing information about interactions between ATP and an ATP-binding protein because TNP-ATP interacts with proteins and enzymes as a substitute for its parent nucleotide, and has a strong binding affinity for most systems that require ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TNP is [[Excited state|excited]] at a [[wavelength]] of 408 and 470&amp;nbsp;nm, and [[Fluorescence|fluoresces]] in the 530–560&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiratsuka |first1=T. |last2=Uchida |date=October 1973 |first2=K. |title=Preparation and Properties of 2′(or 3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) Adenosine 5′-triphosphate, an Analog of Adenosine Triphosphate |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=320 |issue=3 |pages=635–47 |doi=10.1016/0304-4165(73)90143-8 |pmid=4270904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guarnieri |first1=Michael T. |last2=Blagg |first2=Brian S.

Thus, with enhanced fluorescence, it can be seen whether or not a protein binds to ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When TNP-ATP in water is excited at 410&amp;nbsp;nm, TNP-ATP shows a single fluorescence maximum at 561&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This maximum shifts as the fluid's viscosity changes. For example, in [[Dimethylformamide|N,N-dimethylformamide]], instead of having its maxima at 561&amp;nbsp;nm as in water, the maxima is instead at 533&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Binding to a protein will also change the wavelength of maximal emission, as well as a change in fluorescent intensity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, binding to the [[chemotaxis]] protein CheA indicates a severalfold enhancement of fluorescence intensity and a blue-shift in wavelength of the maximal emission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Using this TNP nucleotide analog has been shown in many instances to be superior to traditional [[Nucleotide|radionucleotide-labelling]] based techniques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The health concerns and the cost associated with the use of radioactive [[isotope]]s makes TNP-ATP an attractive alternative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first fluorescent [[ribose]]-modified ATP is 2’,3’-O-(2,4,7-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene) adenosine 5’triphosphate (TNP-ATP), and was introduced in 1973 by Hiratsuka and Uchida.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  TNP-ATP was originally synthesized to investigate the ATP binding site of [[myosin ATPase]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Reports of TNP-ATP’s success in the investigation of this motor protein extended TNP-ATP’s use to other proteins and enzymes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; TNP-ATP has now been used as a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] probe for numerous proteins suspected to have ATP interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These include several protein [[kinase]]s, [[ATPase]]s, [[myosin]], and other nucleotide binding proteins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over the past twenty years, there have been hundreds of papers describing TNP-ATP’s use and applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many applications involving this fluorescently labeled nucleotide have helped to clarify structure-function relationships of many ATP-requiring proteins and enzymes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There have also been a growing number of papers that display TNP-ATP use as a means of assessing the ATP-binding capacity of various mutant proteins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Preparation ==
Preparing TNP-ATP is a one-step synthesis that is relatively safe and easy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adenosine’s ribose moiety can be trinitrophenylated by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonate ([[2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid|TNBS]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The resulting compound assumes a bright orange color and has visible absorption characteristics, as is characteristic of a [[Meisenheimer complex|Meiseinheimer spiro complex compound linking]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

To see the exact method of preparion, please refer to T. Hiratsuka's and K. Uchida's paper ''"Preparation and Properties of 2'(r 3')-O(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) Adenosine 5'-triphosphate, an Analog of Adenosine Triphosphate,"''  found in the reference section.

To revert TNP-ATP back to its constituent parts, or in other words to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] TNP-ATP to give equilmolar amounts of picric acid (TNP) and ATP, TNP-ATP should be treated with 1 M [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] at 100 degrees Celsius for 1.5 hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is because if TNP-ATP is acidified under mild conditions, it results in the opening of the [[dioxolane]] ring attached to the 2’-oxygen, leaving a 3’O-TNP derivative as the only product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Storage ==
TNP-ATP should be stored at −20 degrees Celsius, in the dark, and used under minimal lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When in solution, TNP-ATP has a shelf-life of about 30 days.

== pKa and Isosbestic Point ==
When absorption was measured against wavelength at various pH values, the changes at wavelength 408&amp;nbsp;nm and 470&amp;nbsp;nm yielded a [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] line with a midpoint at 5.1.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This indicated that the absorbance at these two wavelengths depends upon the ionization of the [[Chromophore|chromophoric]] portion of TNP-ATP and is unaffected by ionization of ATP.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although this [[ionization]] constant of 5.1 is not in physiological range, it has been shown that the absorbance of TNP-ATP is sensitive enough to detect changes due to slight shifts in neutral pH.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] superposition indicated TNP-ATP’s [[Isosbestic point|isosbestic]] point to be 339&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Constants and calculations ==
At low concentrations of TNP-ATP (≤1&amp;nbsp;μM), fluorescent intensity is proportional to the concentration of TNP added.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, at concentrations exceeding 1&amp;nbsp;μM, inner filter effects cause this relationship to no longer be linear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To correct this, researchers must determine the ratio of the predicted theoretical fluorescence intensity (assuming linearity) to the observed fluorescence intensity and then apply this correction factor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in most cases, researchers will try to keep the concentration of TNP to lower than 1&amp;nbsp;μM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

To determine binding affinities, TNP-ATP is added to a solution and then titrated with protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This produces a saturation curve from which the binding affinity can be determined.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The number of binding sites may also be determined through this saturation curve by looking to see if there are sudden changes in slope.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One can also [[Titration|titrate]] a fixed amount of protein with increasing additions of TNP-ATP to obtain a saturation curve.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To do so, however, may get complicated due to the inner filter effects that will need to be corrected for.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

To determine dissociation constants, TNP-ATP can be competed off of a protein with ATP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The value of the dissociation constant K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; for a single-site binding can then be obtained by applying the [[Langmuir adsorption model|Langmuir equation]] for a curve fit:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} = \mathrm{RFU_{free}} + \frac{(\mathrm{RFU_{bound}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}) \times \left( (\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \mathrm{K_d}) - \sqrt{(\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \mathrm{K_d})^2 - (4 \times \mathrm{[protein]_{total}} \times \mathrm{[TNP]})} \right)}{2 \mathrm{[TNP]_{total}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where RFU is relative fluorescent units, RFU&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence observed, RFU&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence of free TNP-ATP, and RFU&lt;sub&gt;bound&lt;/sub&gt; is the fluorescence of TNP-ATP when completely bound to a protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

To measure an ATP competitor, one can add competitor to pre-incubated samples of protein:TNP-ATP. The fraction of TNP-ATP bound to the protein can be calculated via:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}}{\mathrm{RFU_{max}} - \mathrm{RFU_{free}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is that fraction, and RFU&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of fluorescence intensity at saturation, meaning when 100% of TNP-ATP is bound.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The dissociation constants for TNP and competitor can then be calculated through the equation:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{[TNP]} \times \left( \mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \frac{\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \times \mathrm{[competitor]} + \mathrm{[TNP]} + \mathrm{[protein]} - \sqrt{\left( \mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \frac{\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \times \mathrm{[competitor]} + \mathrm{[TNP]} + \mathrm{[protein]}\right)^2 - 4 \times \mathrm{[TNP]} \times \mathrm{[protein]}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For reasons not yet fully understood, TNP-ATP typically binds the ATP binding sites of proteins and enzymes anywhere from one to three times tighter than regular ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dissociation constants are usually around 0.3–50&amp;nbsp;μM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Other uses ==
In addition to using TNP-ATP to determine whether or not a protein binds ATP, its binding affinity and dissociation constants, and number of binding sites, TNP-ATP can also be used in ligand binding studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To do this, titrations of the protein are added to TNP-ATP. Then, ligand is added to displace the bound analog.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is measured by decreases in fluorescence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One can also do this by titrating protein with TNP-ATP in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of the ligand of interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using either experiment will allow the binding affinity of the ligand to protein to be measured.

TNP-ATP is also valuable fluorescence acceptor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because, as with any good acceptor, TNP-ATP absorbs over a wide wavelength range that corresponds to the range of emission of common [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] donors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, TNP-ATP can be used to look at the conformational changes that proteins undergo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, Na+/K+ ATPase, the distance between the active site and Cys457 was shown to change from 25 Angstroms to 28 Angstroms in changing from the Na+ conformation to the K+ conformation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to fluorescent spectroscopy, TNP-ATP is very useful in fluorescent [[microscopy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is because it greatly increases the sensitivity of the observations when bound to proteins—the enhanced fluorescence greatly reduces the problem of background fluorescence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is especially true under [[Epifluorescence microscopy|epifluorescent]] illumation (illumination and light are both on the same side of the specimen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TNP-ATP has also been used in [[X-ray crystallography]] because it can be used to determine binding constants of crystallized substrates. This technique also demonstrates the structure of proteins in the presence or absence of TNP-ATP, which may or may not correspond to the structure of proteins when they bind ATP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Tacpac''' (Touch and Communication Pac) is a sensory communication resource using touch and music to align the [[sense]]s and develop [[communication skills]]. It helps those who have any kind of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]] or communication difficulties. It can also help those who have [[tactile defensiveness]], profound and multiple [[Learning impairment|learning difficulties]], [[autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[dementia]].

Tacpac uses specially composed music that matches the texture of the object for each activity so that those who are receiving Tacpac have an aligned experience. Over time, users can employ this to help them communicate. 

Tacpac comes in the form of a subscription which is accessed both on the website and also on the app for phones and tablets. The resources include the full music tracks, instruction videos for each activity, and downloadable/printable records that keep sheets and instruction sheets. The app enables users to play full music tracks without an [[internet connection]].

Through repetition of activities in the Tacpac repertoire, a receiver learns to show responses that can be understood: e.g., those manifesting like/dislike; want/rejection; and know/nescient. Users can begin to move in response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], anticipate activities, and relate to the helper. These primal responses that comprise pre-intentional and [[Affect (psychology)|affectiv]]e communication can be crucial steps toward more clearly defined intentional communication and even [[language acquisition]].

As one researcher writes{{ref|pease}}: "One of the most effective ways of establishing contact with [[Deafblindness|deafblind]] children and so encouraging a communicative response is to share activities with a high levels of [[physical contact]] and pleasant sensations. These include [...] Tacpac, a package where taped music is linked to a range of [[tactile sense|tactile sensations]]."

The number of research projects around Tacpac is growing{{ref|panter}}{{ref|serpa}}{{ref|spevi}}. It has found support from the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] in the UK, and has growing followers amongst multi-sensory impairment networks.

{{Conservation status}}
'''Threatened species''' are any species (including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.) which are vulnerable to [[Species endangerment|endangerment]] in the near future.  Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the [[population dynamics]] measure of ''[[critical depensation]]'', a mathematical measure of [[biomass]] related to [[population growth rate]]. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liermann|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Depensation: evidence, models and implications|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/LiermannM_2001_FishFish.pdf|journal=Fish and Fisheries|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IUCN definition==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*[[Vulnerable species]]
*[[Endangered species]]
*[[Critically endangered species]]

Less-than-threatened categories are [[near threatened]], [[least concern]], and the no longer assigned category of [[conservation dependent]]. Species which have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data ([[data deficient]]) also are not considered "threatened" by the IUCN.

[[File:Status iucn3.1 threatened.svg|thumb|left|The three categories of the threatened species [[IUCN Red List]].]]

Although ''threatened'' and ''vulnerable'' may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term ''threatened'' is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while ''vulnerable'' is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (''vulnerable'' is a category of ''threatened species''); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely ''endangered'' and ''critically endangered'') must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a [[red-listed]] species, as they are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

[[Subspecies]], populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==United States definition==
[[File:Status ESA LT.svg|left|thumb|"Threatened" in relation to "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]].]]

Under the [[Endangered Species Act]] in the United States, "threatened" is defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Laws &amp; Policies - Endangered Species Act - Section 3 Definitions|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|last=Program|date=|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155642/https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'') is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the ESA.

Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species.  For example, the [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') is threatened in the state of [[Minnesota]], while large populations still remain in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|title=Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List|author=|date=|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114000/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian definition==
The Commonwealth of Australia has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], which is known in short as the EPBC Act.  This act has six categories;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html#categories Threatened species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072705/http://environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, defined in Section 179 of the act, and could be summarised as;
*"Extinct" - "no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died",
*"Extinct in the wild" - "known only to survive in cultivation" and "despite exhaustive surveys" has not been seen in the wild,
*"Critically endangered" - "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future",
*"Endangered" - "very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future",
*"Vulnerable" - "high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future", and
*"Conservation dependent" - "focus of a specific conservation program" without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The EPBC Act also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and [[Ramsar Convention]] wetlands used by migratory birds.

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia's [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].  Some species, such as [[Lewin's rail]] (''Lewinia pectoralis''), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.
===NSW Definition===
====Threatening Processes====
Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes facing native plants and animals [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/about-threatened-species/key-threatening-processes listed by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">The '''torque effect''' experienced in helicopters and single propeller-powered aircraft is an example of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's Third Law|third law]] of motion that "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."

In helicopters, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. A small tail rotor is the most common configuration to counter the torque effect.

In a single-propeller plane, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the plane to want to turn upwards and left in response to the propeller wanting to turn (bank) the plane in the opposite direction of the propeller spin.

'''The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies''' (UAJS) is a non-profit academic and professional non-governmental organization that brings together Ukrainian scholars and students who work in the field of  [[Jewish studies]]. The UAJS was established in 2015. 

The mission of the UAJS is to coordinate efforts of the scholars resident in Ukraine and abroad, aimed at the development of research on history, languages, art and other aspects of Jewish life in Ukraine and worldwide. There are two membership categories, Full membership and Student membership. The UAJS’ Articles of Association allows membership for foreign academicians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/3|title=Membership - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current UAJS President is [[Vitaly Chernoivanenko]], PhD, Associate Professor in the History Department at the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] (NaUKMA), the Vice President is [[Oleksiy Khamray]], Dr. hab. in Philology, Director of the Near and Middle East Department at the [[Ahatanhel Krymskyi Institute of Oriental Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. Secretary of the UAJS is [[Serhiy Hirik]], PhD in History, Senior Research Fellow at the [[State Research Institution "Encyclopedia Press"]].

Practical activity of the UAJS includes the organization of the academic conferences, roundtables, workshops, public talks, and mini courses on Jewish Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/5|title=Projects - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The UAJS publishes an annual academic journal [[Judaica Ukrainica]], established in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua/content/volumes|title=Volumes - Judaica Ukrainica|website=judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The UAJS also is a publisher of “Library of ''Judaica Ukrainica'' journal”.

The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies co-administers the MA in Jewish Studies Program at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy (founded in 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/8|title=Master in Jewish Studies Program at NaUKMA - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hromadskeradio.org/programs/zustrichi/shcho-take-yudayika-abo-yak-vidkryti-universytety-poyednuyut-istoriyu-movy-ta-religiyu|title=Що таке юдаїка, або Як «відкриті університети» поєднують історію, мови та релігію?|date=21 January 2018|website=Громадське радіо}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The organization cooperates with a number of academic and educational institutions and non-governmental organizations from Ukraine and abroad: [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], [[Ukrainian Catholic University]], Institute of Jewish Studies of the [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Université de Montréal]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Ukrainian Jewish Encounter]] Initiative, [[Nadav Foundation]], [[:uk:Асоціація єврейських громадських організацій та общин України|Vaad of Ukraine]], [[European Association for Jewish Studies]], [[:he:האיגוד העולמי למדעי היהדות|World Union of Jewish Studies]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/6|title=Partners - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with its partner institutions the UAJS acts as a co-organizer of academic events in educational and research institutions of Ukraine.

In 2015–2016 academic year, in partnership with the [[Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy]] (Canada–USA), the UAJS organized at the NaUKMA the series of public lectures and discussions "Contemporary Antisemitism in Ukraine and Worldwide" by well known researchers, public figures and journalist from Ukraine and abroad: [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], [[Yosyf Zisels]], [[Vakhtang Kipiani]], [[Taras Voznyak]], [[Vitaly Portnikov]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgap.org/seminar-series/national-university-ukraine/|title=National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy » ISGAP|website=isgap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies and the NaUKMA’s Master Program in Jewish Studies with the support of the [[European Association for Jewish Studies]] organized the International conference “Ukrainian Jews: Revolution and Post-Revolutionary Modernization.

The '''National University of South''' (in Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional del Sur'', '''UNS''') is the largest [[national university]] in southern [[Argentina]]. Its motto is ''Ardua Veritatem'', which means "through the difficulties to the truth".

The university was founded on January 5, 1956, and absorbed what had been the '''Technological Institute of South''' (Instituto Tecnológico del Sur, ITS), a former [[National University of La Plata]] affiliate established in 1946. Located in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], the school became the sixteenth in Argentina's national university system &lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2016&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The Instituto Tecnológico del Sur was created on October 9, 1946 by Provincial Act No. 5051, and it began its activities under the academic dependence on the National University of La Plata. In 1947, the Nation and the province Buenos Aires signed an agreement that stated that both of them would supply the funds for the operation and maintenance of the institute. On February 12, 1948, the incumbent president, [[Juan Domingo Perón]], appointed Dr. Miguel López Francés as President of the University, who was in charge of adopting the necessary measures for the organization thereof. The official inauguration ceremony of the ITS was held on February 20, 1948. The category of university was granted in 1950, however, it was cancelled in 1952, and it depended again on the Ministry of Economy of the Nation. The first graduate of the Institute was Engineer Nereo Roberto Parro, in 1953, who was a natural of the town of Tornquist. In 1955, after the fall of Perón's government, Professor Pedro González Prieto was appointed auditor of the institute, and proceedings before the national government began for the institute to become a national university. After the studies carried out by an advisor committee appointed by the Executive Power, the creation of the Universidad Nacional del Sur was approved by decree law No. 154, dated January 5, 1956.

==The Universidad Nacional del Sur==

In 1956 Professor Vicente Fatone was appointed Auditor President. Classes at the brand new institution began on April 1 of that same year. The UNS was the seventh national university created in the country, after the universities of Córdoba (1613), La Plata (1890), Tucumán (1912), Litoral (1919), and Cuyo (1939).

The new institution organized its academic structure into Departments, instead of the traditional Schools. Departments have a smaller administrative structure and allow for knowledge flexibility and inter-disciplinarity. Thus, academic units do not have to create for their careers those courses given at other departments, so that students can take them at the corresponding departments. The first Departments were Accountancy, Economics, Physics, Geology and Geography, Mathematics, Engineering, Humanities, and Chemistry.

After just a month of its opening, two students who had begun their careers at the Institute, Jorge Laurent and David Tomás Prieto, took the exams for the last courses, thus becoming the first graduates in the institution. The first woman to obtain her degree at the UNS was Betty Kerlleñevich, from Bahía Blanca, one of the founding students of the ITS, who also obtained a degree in engineering.

==Campus and facilities==

The main university complex is located at Alem 1253, where most of the Departments and laboratories operate as well as the Central Library. It is a large building that takes up more than a block and at the front there is a fountain with a sculpture by the artist Lola Mora. There are other buildings at the same premises:

At the intersection of 12 de Octubre and San Juan streets, are the buildings for the Departments of Humanities, Economics, Geography and Tourism, and Administration Sciences.

In the area known as "Altos del Palihue" there is another complex where the Departments of Agronomy and Law are located. There, the university has several acres of land, in which the Escuela de Agricultura y Ganadería "Ing. Agr. Adolfo J. Zabala" is also located.

The building located at Colon 80 originally corresponded to the headquarters of the Universidad Nacional del Sur. At present, the activities of the President's Office and its Secretariats are focused here, together with other administrative offices.

At Alem 925 is the "Casa de la Cultura", a colonial mansion that was formerly the center of an important villa. In this building, the General Secretariat of Communication and Culture organizes artistic and cultural activities. The University Foundation (FUNS) and Publishing House (EdiUNS) are also located there. In the buildings located at 11 de Abril 445 are the Escuela Superior de Comercio, Escuela de EGB (Initial Level, Levels 1, 2, and 3) and Escuela Normal Superior.

Currently, it includes sixteen departments: 
*[[Agronomy]]
*[[Biochemistry]]
*[[Biology]]
*[[Chemistry]]
*[[Computer science]]
*[[Economics]]
*[[Electrical engineering]]
*[[Engineering]]
*[[Geography]]
*[[Geology]]
*[[Humanities]]
*[[Law]]
*[[Management]]

The '''University of Wisconsin–Madison''' (also known as '''University of Wisconsin''', '''Wisconsin''', '''UW''', or regionally as '''UW–Madison''', or simply '''Madison''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Founded when [[Wisconsin]] achieved [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1848, UW–Madison is the official state university of Wisconsin, and the flagship campus of the [[University of Wisconsin System]]. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. It became a [[land-grant university|land-grant institution]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/timeline.html The Wisconsin Idea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828081902/http://www.wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/timeline.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|933|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} main campus, located on the shores of [[Lake Mendota]], includes four [[National Historic Landmark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Historic Landmarks Survey |publisher=National Park Service |url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/wi/WI.pdf |accessdate=March 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UW–Madison is organized into 20 schools and colleges, which enrolled 30,361 undergraduate and 14,052 graduate students in 2018. Its comprehensive academic program offers 136 undergraduate majors, along with 148 master's degree programs and 120 [[Doctorate|doctoral]] programs.&lt;ref name="Academics"&gt;{{cite web | title = Academics | publisher = University of Wisconsin | url = http://www.wisc.edu/academics/ | accessdate = September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018Enrollment"/&gt; A major contributor to [[Wisconsin#Economy|Wisconsin's economy]], the University is the largest employer in the state,&lt;ref name="Wisconsin's Largest Employer: Badger State Bucks National Trend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patch|publisher=Patch |url=https://patch.com/wisconsin/milwaukee/wisconsins-largest-employer-badger-state-bucks-national-trend|accessdate=November 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 21,600 faculty and staff.&lt;ref name="2018Enrollment" /&gt; 

The UW is one of America's [[Public Ivy]] universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Howard R.|title=The public ivies: America's flagship public universities|year=2001|publisher=Cliff Street Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0060934590|edition=1st|author2=Greene, Matthew W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to top public universities in the United States capable of providing a collegiate experience comparable with the [[Ivy League]]. UW–Madison is also categorized as a Doctoral University with the Highest Research Activity in the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Wisconsin–Madison |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=240444|accessdate=March 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it had research expenditures of more than $1.1 billion, the third highest among universities in the country.&lt;ref name="Research"&gt;Ronda Britt.

[[File:Bascom Hall at dusk.JPG|thumb|Bascom hall at dusk]]

The university had its official beginnings when the [[Wisconsin Territory|Wisconsin Territorial Legislature]] in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a "'''University of the Territory of Wisconsin'''", and a high-ranking [[board of visitors|Board of Visitors]] was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the U.W. [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|board of regents]]) never actually accomplished anything before [[Wisconsin]] was incorporated as a state in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1883 Heg, J. E., ed. "Wisconsin and her institutions: University of Wisconsin: History" in ''The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1883'' Madison, 1883; p. 393]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wisconsin Constitution]] provided for "the establishment of a state university, at or near the seat of state government..." and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a [[Higher education governing board#Regents|board of regents]] and administered by a [[chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]. On July 26, 1848, [[Nelson Dewey]], Wisconsin's first [[Governor of Wisconsin|governor]], signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Timeline|url=http://www.wisc.edu/about/historical-timeline/|website=University of Wisconsin-Madison|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hiram Lathrop|John H. Lathrop]] became the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hove. ''The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[John Whelan Sterling|John W. Sterling]] as the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at [[Madison Female Academy]] on February 5, 1849. A permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of {{convert|50|acre|ha|1}} "bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street", [later State Street] "south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake." The regents' building plans called for a "main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/WIReader/Thwaites/Chapter03.html |title=Thwaites, Reuben Gold.

Purcell, 1900; Chap. 3 |publisher=Library.wisc.edu |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building, University Hall, now known as [[Bascom Hill|Bascom Hall]], was finally completed in 1859. On October 10, 1916, a fire destroyed the building's dome, which was never replaced. [[North Hall, University of Wisconsin|North Hall]], constructed in 1851, was actually the first building on campus. In 1854, Levi Booth and Charles T. Wakeley became the first graduates of the university, and in 1892 the university awarded its first PhD to future [[university president]] [[Charles R. Van Hise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chancellor.wisc.edu/past-presidents-and-chancellors/ |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison, Office of the Chancellor |title=Past Presidents and Chancellors |accessdate=January 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wisconsin Idea===
Research, teaching, and service at the UW is influenced by a tradition known as "the [[Wisconsin Idea]]", first articulated by UW–Madison President [[Charles Van Hise]] in 1904, when he declared "I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisc.edu/wisconsin-idea/ |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison |title=The Wisconsin Idea |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wisconsin Idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state, and that the research conducted at UW–Madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the [[Natural environment|environment]], and agriculture for all citizens of the state. The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=580&amp;search_term=Wisconsin+Idea |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Wisconsin Idea| publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society | accessdate=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Stark.

Madison: Wisconsin Legislature Joint Committee on Legislative Organization, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During World War II, University of Wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="wisconsin-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.library.wisc.edu/oral-history/guide/501-600/521-530.html#stewart |title=Oral History Entries |publisher=[[Madison, Wisconsin]]: University of Wisconsin Archives |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121013953/http://archives.library.wisc.edu/oral-history/guide/501-600/521-530.html#stewart |archive-date=January 21, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
{{main|University of Wisconsin System}}
Over time, additional campuses were added to the university. The [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] was created in 1956, and UW–Green Bay and UW–Parkside in 1968. Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system.&lt;ref name=Wisconsin&gt;[http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm History and Organization of the University of Wisconsin System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202182105/http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }}. Retrieved on Feb, 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the [[University of Wisconsin System#Former Wisconsin State Universities|Wisconsin State Universities System]], creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents.

[[File:1554 sterlingmarker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker near Sterling Hall commemorating fatal 1970 bombing]]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW–Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film ''[[The War at Home (1979 film)|The War at Home]]''. The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of [[recruitment|recruiters]] for the [[Dow Chemical]] Company, which supplied the [[napalm]] used in the [[Vietnam War]]. Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book, ''[[They Marched into Sunlight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;David Maraniss, ''They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace Vietnam and America, October 1967''(New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the PBS documentary ''[[Two Days in October]]''.&lt;ref&gt;PBS Film, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/twodays/ "Two Days in October,"], aired on October 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the students injured in the protest was current Madison mayor [[Paul Soglin]].

Another target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper, ''[[The Daily Cardinal]]'', published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to [[US Department of Defense]] requests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted "U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!"

On August 24, 1970, near 3:40&amp;nbsp;am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.&lt;ref name="Stucki"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/4/2006_4_69.shtml Heinz Stucki] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203162921/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/4/2006_4_69.shtml |date=December 3, 2008 }} "Army Math: A Home Grown Terrorist Bombing," ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the late hour, a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post doctoral physics researcher]], [[Robert Fassnacht]], was in the lab and was killed in the explosion. The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected. [[Karleton Armstrong]], [[Dwight Armstrong]], and [[David Fine]] were found responsible for the blast. [[Leo Burt]] was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bates, ''Rads: The 1970 Bombing of the Army Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin and Its Aftermath'' (New York: Harper, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Wisconsin–Madison, the flagship campus of the [[University of Wisconsin System]], is a large, four-year research university comprising twenty associated colleges and schools.&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt; In addition to undergraduate and [[Quaternary education|graduate]] divisions in agriculture and life sciences, business, education, engineering, [[human ecology]], journalism and [[mass communication]], letters and science, music, [[nursing]], [[pharmacy]], and [[social welfare]], the university also maintains graduate and professional schools in [[environmental studies]], law, [[library science|library]] and [[information science|information studies]], medicine and [[public health]] [[University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health|(School of Medicine and Public Health)]], [[public administration|public affairs]], and [[veterinary medicine]].

The four year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] as "arts and science plus professions" with a high graduate coexistence; admissions are characterized as "more selective, lower transfer-in."&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt; The largest university college, the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Letters and Science|College of Letters and Science]], enrolls approximately half of the undergraduate student body and is made up of 38 departments and five professional schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=College of Letters &amp; Science | publisher=University of Wisconsin Foundation | url=https://www.supportuw.org/how-to-give/school-college/letters-and-science/ | accessdate=January 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that instruct students and carry out research in a wide variety of fields, such as [[astronomy]], economics, [[geography]], history, [[linguistics]], and [[zoology]]. The graduate instructional program is classified by Carnegie as "comprehensive with medical/veterinary." In 2008, it granted the third largest number of doctorates in the nation.&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSFDoctorates"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10309/ | title=Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: Summary Report 2007–08 | publisher=National Science Foundation | accessdate=April 10, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410085357/http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10309/ | archive-date=April 10, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College of Agriculture and Life Sciences===
The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agricultural and Life Sciences]] fulfills the UW–Madison's mission as a land-grant university, which dates back to 1862, when Congress passed legislation to establish a national network of colleges devoted to agriculture and mechanics and Wisconsin received 240,000 acres of allotted federal land.&lt;ref name="cals.wisc.edu"&gt;[http://www.cals.wisc.edu/about-cals/history/ History | College of Agricultural and Life Sciences – University of Wisconsin–Madison]. Cals.wisc.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 the university began offering a winter course for farmers, the Agriculture Short Course, which was greatly developed and enhanced by [[Ransom Asa Moore]] from 1895 until 1907 and continues today as the Farm and Industry Short Course. In 1889 the university put all of their agricultural offerings under a new College of Agriculture, with W.A. Henry as dean.&lt;ref name="cals.wisc.edu"/&gt; Professors listed in the 1896 Agricultural Short Course for the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin–Madison listed popular professors such the Dean of the College of Agriculture, W.A. Henry (Feeds and Feeding), [[S.M. Babcock]] (Agricultural Chemistry; Farm Dairying), [[F.H. King]] (Agricultural Physics, Agricultural Mechanics, and Meteorology), E.S. Goff (Plant Life, Horticulture, and Economic Entomology), H.L. Russell (Bacteriology), J.A. Craig (Breeds: Breeding and Judging Live Stock), Wm. A. Scott (Economics of Agriculture), C.I.

Practical studies related to crop and livestock production and farm life gradually delved deeper as scientists strove to understand the underlying biological processes. Today the college generates new knowledge about agriculture, natural resources management and protection, human health and nutrition, community development and related topics. Faculty and staff in 19 academic departments and a number of interdisciplinary programs carry out these lines of study."&lt;ref name="cals.wisc.edu"/&gt;

This Victorian Gothic building, built in 1878 and initially named Assembly Hall, was designed to house an 800-seat [[auditorium]], a library, and a [[clock tower]]. Dedicated on March 2, 1880, the building originally held [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], dances, and [[graduation|commencement ceremonies]], along with its primary purpose of a library. After the library moved to a different building on campus, a portion of the hall was assigned to the School of Music in 1900. Shortly after renovations in the early 1900s, the building was officially named Music Hall in 1910. It remains an important music venue and is home to the university opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Music Hall| publisher=Mills Music Library| url=http://music.library.wisc.edu/geninfo/mushall.htm | accessdate=January 20, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828165629/http://music.library.wisc.edu/geninfo/mushall.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building also is home to the Department of [[Urban and Regional Planning]], with part of the building being used as office space and classrooms.

===George L. Mosse Humanities Building===
The [[George Mosse|George L. Mosse]] Humanities Building, located on Library Mall, was built in the late 1960s in the [[Brutalist]] style.

===The Wisconsin Union===
[[File:Memorial Union and quadrangle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]] as seen from the Library Mall on the UW–Madison campus]]

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has two [[Student activity center|student unions]]. The older, [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]], was built in 1928 to honor American World War I [[veteran]]s. Also known as the Union or the Terrace, it has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful [[student activity center|student centers]] on a university campus. Located on the shore of [[Lake Mendota]], it is a popular spot for socializing among both students and the public, who enjoy gazing at the lake and its sailboats. The union is known for the [[Rathskeller]], a German pub adjacent to the lake terrace. Political debates and [[backgammon]] and [[sheepshead (game)|sheepshead]] games over a beer on the terrace are common among students. The Rathskeller serves "Rathskeller Ale", a beer brewed expressly for the Terrace. Memorial Union was the first union at a public university to serve beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.union.wisc.edu/history/1933.html |title=Wisconsin Union History |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |date=May 8, 2006 |publisher=The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807172306/http://www.union.wisc.edu/history/1933.html |archive-date=August 7, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, a movie theater, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craftshop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory [[referendum]] to [[Renovation|renovate]] and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university is currently undergoing the expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Memorial Union | publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison | url=https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/ | accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Union South, the newer campus union, was built in 1971 to better accommodate a growing student enrollment and was demolished in 2008. A new "green" Union South, located on the site of the old union, opened April 15, 2011. It is a certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) gold building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newunion.wisc.edu/sustainability.html |title=Sustainability – New Union South |publisher=Newunion.wisc.edu |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building contains several dining options, an art gallery, a climbing wall, a bowling alley, event spaces, and a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newunion.wisc.edu/index.html |title=New South Campus Union |publisher=Newunion.wisc.edu |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.union.wisc.edu/visit-unionsouth.htm |title=Union South – Wisconsin Union |publisher=Union.wisc.edu |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wisconsin Union]] also provides a home for the Wisconsin Union Directorate Student Programming Board (WUD), which provides regular programs for both students and community members. One of the most well-known members of WUD is the [[Wisconsin Hoofers]], a club that organizes outdoor recreational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Butts |first=Porter |title=Wisconsin Hoofers, An Early History |url=http://hoofers.org/historyoral |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308143045/http://hoofers.org/historyoral |archive-date=March 8, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dejope Hall===
[[File:Dejope Hall-front.JPG|thumb|right|Dejope Residence Hall]]
On May 22, 2012, the [[Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin]] passed a resolution permitting the usage of the name "Dejope" for a new residence hall at the university. ''Dejope'' means "Four Lakes" in the Ho-Chunk language, and Native Americans have used this word to describe the Madison area for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.wisc.edu/dejope Dejope Residence Hall] Retrieved on December 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The residence hall was planned as a symbol of the ongoing cooperative relationship between University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Ho-Chunk nation and the building and its grounds contain imagery of the mounds and lakes in the area. A fire circle in front of the building contains plaques representing all 11 Native American nations in Wisconsin. Images of the four effigy mounds that are located on the campus (Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point and Eagle Heights) are embedded into the flooring of the building's main floor. An acrylic depiction of Lake Mendota is located in the conference room, and another artwork of glass and metal depicting the Four Lakes is located in the East Hall.

===DeLuca Biochemistry Building===
The [[DeLuca Biochemistry Building|Hector F. DeLuca Biochemistry Building]], part of the Hector F. DeLuca Complex, was built in 1912 and was extensively remodeled in 2012. The building is home to floor-to-ceiling murals painted by [[John Steuart Curry]]. Home to the Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, the building also includes Department of Biochemistry facilities.

UW–Madison claims more distinct archaeological sites than on any other university campus.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Dejope Hall'' http://www.housing.wisc.edu/dejope/history Retrieved December 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The campus contains four clusters of [[effigy mounds]] located at Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point, and Eagle Heights. These sites, reflecting thousands of years of human habitation in the area, have survived to a greater or lesser degree on campus, depending on location and past building activities. Surviving sites are marked and fenced on the campus, ensuring that they are not disturbed. Wisconsin statutes protect effigy mounds by giving them a five-foot buffer zone.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, George. W. ''Archaeological Investigations University of Wisconsin–Madison Campus.

[[File:Kohl Center hockey.jpg|thumb|right|Men's [[hockey]] game played at the [[Kohl Center]]]]
Badger ice hockey first became a men's varsity sport in 1922. Although dropped after the 1934–35 season, it again became a varsity sport in the 1963–64 season. The men's team played in the [[Dane County Coliseum]] until moving to the [[Kohl Center]] (capacity 15,359) in the fall of 1998. The first ice hockey game played at the Kohl was the Hall of Fame game against the [[University of Notre Dame]]. From 1999 to 2012 the men's team led the nation in college hockey attendance, setting an NCAA attendance record (averaging 15,048) during the 2009–10 season, which surpassed their previous record set in 2006–07.&lt;ref&gt;NCAA. ''[http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_icehockey_rb/2014/Attend.pdf Men's Ice Hockey Attendance Records]'', p. 4. Accessed February 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Johnson (ice hockey b. 1931)|Bob Johnson]], nicknamed "Badger Bob" by fans, took over the reins in 1966. Johnson coached the Badger men to three national championships in 1973, 1977 and 1981. Jeff Sauer coached the Badger men to two more titles in 1983 and 1990. [[Mike Eaves]], member of the 1977 NCAA title team, coached the Badger men's team to its sixth national championship in 2006. The six Badger titles rank 4th in NCAA men's ice hockey history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncaa.com/history/default.aspx?id=87986 "NCAA History"] {{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaves' 2010 squad advanced to the national championship game during the Badgers' 11th appearance in the men's [[Frozen Four]] before bowing to [[Boston College]].

The school's strong ice hockey tradition gained another dimension with the addition of a women's team that began play in the 1999–2000 season. Coached by [[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]], son of "Badger Bob" and another member of the men's 1977 title team, the Badger women won their first NCAA championship on March 26, 2006.

The two universities also compete in the ''Border Battle'', a year-long athletic competition in which each team's wins earn points for their university.

Men's basketball rivalries include [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] and non-conference, in-state [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]].

The Wisconsin–Madison men's and women's hockey teams' most recognized rivals are the [[Golden Gophers]] of the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Fighting Sioux]] of the [[University of North Dakota]]. Other rivals include the [[University of Denver]], [[Colorado College]], [[Michigan Tech University|Michigan Tech]], [[University of Minnesota Duluth]], and [[St. Cloud State University|St. Cloud State]].

===Mascot===
{{main|Bucky Badger}}
The school mascot is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[badger]] named [[Bucky Badger|Bucky]] who dons a sweater affixed with the UW–Madison athletic logo (currently the red "Motion W"). Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly [[badger]] who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the "Badgers", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or "Bucky", for short.

At Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-mâché badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hove. [http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0099.htm ''The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History.''], University of Wisconsin Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-299-13000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's nickname originates from the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]]. In the 1820s, many lead miners and their families lived in the mines in which they worked until adequate above-ground shelters were built, and thus were compared to badgers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Badger Notables: Badger Nickname| publisher = UWBadgers.com – The Official Web Site of Badger Athletics|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html|accessdate=October 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112063315/http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html |archivedate = November 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Fulton Market Films produced the documentary ''Being Bucky'' which followed the lives of seven Wisconsin students who take on the role of Bucky Badger.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1509737|Being Bucky (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Being Bucky'' won "Best Documentary Film" at the [[Wisconsin Film Festival]] and went on to play in local Wisconsin movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingbucky.com A buckumentary about being a mascot].

It was founded in 2003 by David Coddon with the support of the University of Wisconsin–Madison Leadership Trust.

====Campus radio====
The University of Wisconsin–Madison campus radio station is [[WSUM]] 91.7 FM, "The Snake on the Lake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WSUM | publisher=WSUM.org|url=http://www.wsum.org|accessdate=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, UW–Madison has been home to a collection of student run radio stations, a number of which stopped broadcasting after run-ins with the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). The current radio station, WSUM, began in 1997 in a [[webcast]] only format because of the prolonged battle to get an FCC license and construct a tower. This lasted five years until February 22, 2002, when the station started broadcasting over [[frequency modulation|FM]] airwaves at 91.7 from its tower in [[Montrose, Wisconsin]]. The radio station currently has around 200 volunteer DJs and eight paid managers. All UW–Madison students, as well as a limited number of community members, are eligible to participate in running the station. WSUM remains entirely free format, which means that the on-air personnel can showcase a large variety of music and talk programming at their discretion with few limitations. WSUM has garnered many awards from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association for their news, play-by-play broadcasts of Badger athletic events, and unique [[public service announcements]].&lt;ref&gt;"Free-spirited Radio Shows", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', February 22, 2007, p.

[[File:"Prove it with a Kodak".jpg|thumb|An early woman amateur photographer. Kodak advertisement from 1918]]

The participation of '''women in photography''' goes back to the very origins of the process. Several of the earliest women photographers, most of whom were from Britain or France, were married to male pioneers or had close relationships with their families. It was above all in northern Europe that women first entered the business of photography, opening studios in Denmark, France, Germany, and Sweden from the 1840s, while it was in Britain that women from well-to-do families developed photography as an art in the late 1850s. Not until the 1890s did the first studios run by women open in New York City.

Following Britain's [[The Linked Ring|Linked Ring]], which promoted artistic photography from the 1880s, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] encouraged several women to join the [[Photo-Secession]] movement which he founded in 1902 in support of so-called [[pictorialism]]. In Vienna, [[Dora Kallmus]] pioneered the use of photographic studios as fashionable meeting places for the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy.

In the United States, women first photographed as amateurs, several producing fine work which they were able to exhibit at key exhibitions. They not only produced portraits of celebrities and Native Americans but also took landscapes, especially from the beginning of the 20th century. The involvement of women in [[photojournalism]] also had its beginnings in the early 1900s but slowly picked up during [[World War I]].

==Early participants==

While the work of the English and French gentlemen involved in developing and pioneering the process of photography is well documented, the part played by women in the early days tends to be given less attention.&lt;ref name="Newhall1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhall|first=Beaumont|title=The history of photography: from 1839 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9xTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1982|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|isbn=978-0-87070-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings===

Women were however involved in photography from the start. [[Constance Fox Talbot]], the wife of [[Henry Fox Talbot]], one of the key players in the development of photography in the 1830s and 1840s, had herself experimented with the process as early as 1839.&lt;ref name="Buckland1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=Gail|title=Fox Talbot and the invention of photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtBTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=D. R. Godine|isbn=978-0-87923-307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ovenden]] attributes to her a hazy image of a short verse by the Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]], which would make her the earliest known female photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Maev Kennedy, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/09/bodleian-library-bid-fox-talbot-archive "Bodleian Library launches £2.2m bid to stop Fox Talbot archive going overseas"], ''The Guardian'', 9 December 2012.

[[Anna Atkins]], a botanist, was also introduced to photography by Fox Talbot, who explained his "photogenic drawing" technique to her as well as his camera-based [[calotype]] process. After learning about the [[cyanotype]] process from its inventor, [[John Herschel]], she was able to produce cyanotype [[photogram]]s of dried algae.

===The first professionals===

In France, [[Geneviève Élisabeth Disdéri]] was an early professional in the photography business. Together with her husband, [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri]] who is remembered for patenting the [[carte de visite]] process, she established a [[daguerrotype]] studio in [[Brest, France|Brest]] in the late 1840s. After Disdéri left her for Paris in 1847, she continued to run the business alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly E.

===Pioneering artists===
Two British ladies are remembered for their early contributions to artistic photography. In the late 1850s, [[Lady Clementina Hawarden]] began to take photographs. The earliest images were landscapes taken on the Hawarden estate in [[Dundrum, County Tipperary|Dundrum]], Ireland. After the family moved to London, in 1862 she converted the first floor of her [[South Kensington]] home into a studio, filling it with props which can be seen in her photographs. She specialised in portraits, especially of her two eldest daughters clad in the costumes of the day. Her work earned her silver medals at the exhibitions of the [[Royal Photographic Society|Photographic Society]] in 1863 and 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/pictures/the-scottish-aristocrat-whose-pioneering-photography-drew-admiration-from-lewis-carroll-1-2778249 Mike Merritt, "The Scottish aristocrat whose pioneering photography drew admiration from Lewis Carroll"], ''The Scotsman'', 7 February 2013.

Although her interest in photography did not begin until 1863 when she was 48 years old, she consciously set out to ensure photography became an acceptable art form, taking hundreds of portraits of children and celebrities. While her commitment to soft focus was frequently criticized as technically deficient during her lifetime, it later formed the basis for the [[Pictorialism]] movement at the beginning of the 20th century and is now widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/collections/permanent/object_genres/photographers/women/cameron.html "Artistic Portraiture: Julia Margaret Cameron"], Woman Photographers, UCR/California Museum of Photography.

===History of Female Photographers in America===

Prior to the roaring twenties there were little to non female photographers in existence. After the huge advancement in culture after the roaring twenties the number of photographers that were women increase drastically. Estimated to be about 5,000 female photographers. Despite there still being an apparent line of gender limitations photography allowed for females to bring forth their creativity. Along came with many different opportunities including different publications such as "American Amateur Photographer" that allowed for women photographers whether she was an amateur or not to further showcase their skills. With no longer being labeled as "a wife of a photographer" women who already have a keen eye for the fashionable side of things photographer seem to be strong suit for them.The emergence of women in photography can be attributed to the progressive era. Where the roles of women in our every day society were changed tremendously and reversed. This time period a vast number of women photographers were reportedly apart of photography organizations.

The use of photography as an art form had existed almost from the very beginning but it was towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that under the influence of the American [[Alfred Stieglitz]] its artistic potential, termed [[pictorialism]], became widely recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsmia.org/get-the-picture/print/stieglitz.shtml "Get the Picture: Alfred Stieglitz"], Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Their association with Stieglitz led in 1902 to their becoming co-founders of the [[Photo-Secession]] movement.

==Surrealism==
A number of women used photography as a medium for expressing their interest in [[Surrealism]]. [[Claude Cahun]] (1894–1954) from France is remembered for her highly staged self-portraits which she began taking in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Salter, [http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3363979/Claude-Cahun-The-surreal-deal.html "Claude Cahun: The surreal deal"], ''The Telegraph'', 6 January 2008.

Surrealism continued to attract the interest of women photographers in the second half of the 20th century. [[Henriette Grindat]] (1923–1986) was one of the few Swiss women to develop an interest in artistic photography, associating with André Breton and later collaborating with [[Albert Camus]], with whom she published images of the [[Sorgue|River Sorgue]] in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lejournaldelaphotographie.com/entries/4942/henriette-grindat-ou-l-anticonformisme "Henriette Grindat or the nonconformist"], ''Journal de la Photographie''.

==Evolving American participation==
Peter E. Palmquist who researched the history of women photographers in California and the American West from 1850 to 1950 found that in the 19th century some 10% of all photographers in the area were women while by 1910 the figure was up to about 20%. In the early days, most women working commercially were married to a photographer. Indeed, up to 1890, any woman working on her own was considered to be daring. As the process became easier to handle, more amateurs emerged, many participating in photographic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/palmquist/Essays.htm#e21 Peter E.

== African-American women in photography ==

=== History ===

Photographs are pictures ''about'' and ''of'' things (Birt). As society has evolved, African-American photographers have been critical in the preservation of authentic portrayals of images ''about ''and ''of ''black culture. The participation of African-American women in photography began to receive widespread acknowledgment in the mid-20th century and with growing recognition came a shift in focus on social, economic, and political conditions. Some of the most prominent female African-American photographers include [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Lorna Simpson]], and [[Coreen Simpson]].

==== Carrie Mae Weems ====
Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]] started her career in 1973 when she received her first camera. Her initial interest in the arts started in 1965, when she met lifelong friend Tom Vinters and began participating in street theater and dance. Though noted as an accomplished photographer, Weems' work spans text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation, and video. "…from the very beginning I've been interested in the idea of power and the consequences of power; relationships are made and articulated through power."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Carrie Mae Weems|last = Bey|first = Dawoud|date = Summer 2009|journal = BOMB|doi = |pmid = |jstor=40428266|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exploring the idea of power, Weems oftentimes uses herself as the subject of her work, not for her own admiration, but "as a vehicle for approaching the question of power…"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Through different mediums, Weems has made it her mission to explore the family relationships, gender roles, the histories of racism, sexism, class and different types of political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carriemaeweems.net/bio.html|title= Carrie Mae Weems|date= |accessdate=12 April 2015 |website = carriemaeweems|publisher = Lisa Goodlin Design|last = Weems|first = Carrie Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was introduced to [[Dawoud Bey]] in 1976 and developed a long lasting friendship and professional relationship with the photographer. While on a work trip to Europe, Bey interviewed Weems in BOMB, a magazine focused on artists in conversation. 
[[File:LornaSimpsonApr09 cropped.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Lorna Simpson]]

==== Lorna Simpson ====
[[Lorna Simpson]] began her career in fashion photography, taking pictures of people whose style she admired. Simpson was able to develop her skills and became a photojournalist who captured images in politics, culture, music, and sports.

Receiving her education in photography at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York and the [[University of California, San Diego]], Lorna Simpson was considered a pioneer of conceptual photography well before the peak of her career. Through her work, Simpson aims to challenge the traditional views of gender, identity, culture, history, and memory as viewed by society. Her combination of large-scale photography with meaningful text work together to provide strong visual implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lsimpsonstudio.com/#mi=11&amp;pt=0&amp;pi=6&amp;p=-1&amp;a=-1&amp;at=0|title = Lorna Simpson|accessdate =15 April 2015|website = Lorna Simpson Studio|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work can be found in museums across the country at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York|Museum of Modern Art]] (NY), the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Chicago, IL), and the [[Walker Art Center]] (Minneapolis), and many others around the world.

==== Coreen Simpson ====
Making her mark as a photojournalist, [[Coreen Simpson]] started her career as a published writer. Her interest in documenting experiences in writing grew into a love for the visual arts when she contacted Essence magazine about an article she wanted to write about a business trip to the Middle East. Although the article was never published, her interest in photojournalism was heightened.

In his article "Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation", Rodger Birt describes looking at a photograph as being "let in on the workings of another human consciousness" allowing for the simultaneous opportunity to receive an authentic depiction of the physical world.&lt;ref name="Birt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birt|first1=Rodger|title=Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|journal=Black American Literature Forum|date=1987|volume=21|issue=3|pages=289–304|jstor=2904032|doi=10.2307/2904032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her work, Simpson has created visual narratives that aesthetically tell the stories of diverse groups of people. Not only is she able to evoke emotional responses through her storytelling, but through design, [[chiaroscuro]], and color as well.

Simpson's friend, Walter Johnson, became one of her biggest mentors and guide as she expanded her knowledge in photography. She also studied Frank Stewart's process and developed a strong capacity for the history of photography. One of her biggest struggles was to differentiate her visual style from those of her inspiration.

The four greatest influences of Simpson's work include [[Diane Arbus]], [[Adolph de Meyer|Baron Adolph DeMeyer]], [[Joel Peter Witkin]], and [[Weegee]]. Whether conceptually, methodically, or creatively, each of these photographers have contributed to her approach in different ways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2904032|title = Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|last = Birt|first = Rodger|date = Autumn 1997|journal = Black American Literature Forum|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of her admiration for Arbus's uniqueness, Weegee's hunt, DeMeyer's study of the compostition, and Witkin's manipulation of the print work together in encompassing the personality of Coreen Simpson's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth "Tex" Williams'''

[[Elizabeth Williams (photographer)|Elizabeth "Tex" Williams]] was a world war 2 military photographer. She was in the last year of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29733207|title=Viewfinders : black women photographers|last=1951-|first=Moutoussamy-Ashe, Jeanne,|date=1993|publisher=Writers &amp; Readers Pub|isbn=0863161588|location=New York|oclc=29733207}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first women to have a photography career beyond "camera girl".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
