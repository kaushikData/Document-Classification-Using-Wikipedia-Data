      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">The '''Alberger process''' is a method of producing [[salt]].

It involves mechanical evaporation and uses an open evaporating pan and steam energy. This results in a three-dimensional "cup-shaped" flake salt, which has low [[bulk density]], high solubility and good adhesiveness. The extremely low bulk density makes the salt highly prized in the fast-food industry due to its lower sodium content and stronger flavor for a given volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cargill.com/salt/brands/alberger/index.jsp |title=Alberger® Brand Flake Salts: It's the Shape that Makes it Great |publisher=Cargill |accessdate=November 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107142948/http://www.cargill.com/salt/brands/alberger/index.jsp |archive-date=2014-11-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "it is a mixture of the grainer-type flake and the flake grown on seed crystals. About 3,000 pounds of steam are required to produce one ton of salt"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119140628/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-12642/Alberger-process Encyclopædia Britannica's entry for Alberger process]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cargill]] operates a plant in [[St. Clair, Michigan]] that is the only plant in the United States that makes such salt.

The method was patented by [[Charles L. Weil]] on June 8, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Patent Office]]: {{patent|US|1141999}}. For original patent drawings and description of the process see: [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument;jsessionid=9E494D3C426CCC5A5A146BDC2E564F1F.espacenet_levelx_prod_6?CC=US&amp;NR=1141999A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP Original document].

The''' Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|1564}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The bill would "amend the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX) to deny the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] any authority to require that [[Financial audit|audits]] conducted for a particular issuer of securities in accordance with SOX standards be conducted by specific auditors, or that such audits be conducted for an issuer by different auditors on a rotating basis," according to a summary by the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="1564sum"/&gt;  The bill passed the House 321-62 on July 8, 2013.

==Background==
In 2011, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked for public comments on a [http://pcaobus.org/rules/rulemaking/docket037/release_2011-006.pdf concept release] they made about whether auditor term limits and rotations would actually improve auditor independence.&lt;ref name="wsjJune19"/&gt;  As of June 2013, the PCAOB had not decided whether to move forward with the concept or abandon it.&lt;ref name="wsjJune19"/&gt;

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=1564sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1564 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1564|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act would amend the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX) to deny the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] any authority to require that [[Financial audit|audits]] conducted for a particular issuer of securities in accordance with SOX standards be conducted by specific auditors, or that such audits be conducted for an issuer by different auditors on a rotating basis.&lt;ref name="1564sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo1564&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1564|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44398|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 1564 would prohibit the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from requiring public companies to use a specific auditor or to use different auditors on a rotating basis. The bill also would require the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) to update a report completed in 2003 that reviewed the potential effects of mandatory rotation for auditing firms.&lt;ref name="cbo1564"/&gt;

Based on information from the PCAOB, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 1564 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The PCAOB has no immediate plans to issue a ruling specifying how public companies should choose a financial auditor; therefore, the prohibition in H.R. 1564 would not change its workload. Based on information about similar reporting efforts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1564 would have a discretionary cost of about $1 million for the GAO to complete the required study and report.&lt;ref name="cbo1564"/&gt;

H.R. 1564 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded mandate#Unfunded Mandate Reform Act|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo1564"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
===House===
The Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act was introduced into the House on April 15, 2013 by [[Robert Hurt (politician)|Rep. Robert Hurt (R-VA)]].&lt;ref name=1564allCongActions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1564 - All Congressional Actions|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.1564:@@@X|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="1564allCongActions"/&gt;  It was reported alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt142/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt142.pdf House Report 113-142]. On July 8, 2013, the House voted 321-62 to pass H.R. 1564 in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll306.xml Roll Call Vote 306].&lt;ref name="1564allCongActions"/&gt;

===Senate===
The Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act was received in the [[United States Senate]] on July 9, 2013 and referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]].&lt;ref name="1564allCongActions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Lawmakers in favor of the bill argued that the bill is necessary because mandatory auditor rotations would be an expensive burden on businesses, cause significant disruptions, and would be generally "unworkable" due to the small number of auditing firms.&lt;ref name=wsjJune19&gt;{{cite news|last=Chasan|first=Emily|title=Bill to Ban PCAOB From Forcing Auditor Rotation Advances|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business groups also agreed that mandatory auditor rotations were a poor idea, since it would take time for the new auditor to learn the details of the business they were newly assigned to audit, lowering the quality of the audit.&lt;ref name="wsjJune19"/&gt;

Opponents of the bill argued that the current audit system has clear flaws that are not being addressed - that many public companies have long-term, close relationships with the firms that are supposed to be holding them accountable.&lt;ref name=McKennaJuly9&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenna|first=Francine|title=House Counts On Honor Amongst Thieves: Votes Against Mandatory Auditor Rotation|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2013/07/09/house-counts-on-honor-amongst-thieves-votes-against-mandatory-auditor-rotation/|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], [[Illinois]], Affleck was educated in the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s there.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; He did not have much formal higher educational background; one co-industrialist described him as having learned his trade in the "[[school of hard knocks]]".&lt;ref name="JACI"&gt;{{citation|title=Foreword|journal=Journal of the American Concrete Institute|page=8|date=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he spent four years working for the Harrison Machine Works company in his home town, leaving afterwards to work for [[American Express]].&lt;ref name="Lesley"/&gt; In 1890, at the age of 21, he joined the Alton Terre Haute Railroad where he worked until 1896, before taking a position at the Illinois Steel Company.&lt;ref name="JACI"/&gt; He was hired initially as a [[machinist]], but rose to the position of sales manager in the cement department with his knack for bringing in profits and business acumen. In 1906, the Illinois Steel Company spun off their cement department, incorporating it as the Universal Portland Cement Company; Affleck continued as sales manager of the new company until 1915, when he became its president.&lt;ref name="Audrey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesley"/&gt;

On March 2, 1921, Affleck and thirty-nine other officers of [[cement]] corporations were indicted by a federal grand jury under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] for restraint of trade and attempts at monopoly. The companies involved were alleged to have tightly controlled the supply of cement, refusing to sell any builder more than the amount needed for a single job, and preventing them from using any unexpected surplus on other jobs; prices quoted on cement were invariably the same to the penny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2 March 1921|accessdate=2008-03-27|periodical=The New York Times|page=1|title=Indict 40 Officers and 74 Companies in Cement 'Trust'|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9401E3D61639E133A25751C0A9659C946095D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affleck became president of the Universal Atlas Cement Company after its merger with the Universal Portland Cement Company in January 1930; however, he retired from the position just six years later, in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/187860092.html?dids=187860092:187860092&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+15%2C+1944&amp;author=Special+to+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Benjamin+Franklin+Affleck&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Christian Science Monitor|title=Benjamin Franklin Affleck|date=15 February 1944|accessdate=2008-03-27|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hadley|date=1945|title=The Magic Powder|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Affleck lived in [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], a middle-class suburb, for some time; by the 1920s, he was well-off enough financially to move to [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Millionairea|periodical=Time|date=21 May 1928|accessdate=2008-03-27|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731749,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one daughter, Mildred, with his wife, Rene Mansfield of [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], [[Wisconsin]]; Mildred married Victor Spoehr of Winnetka in October 1923.&lt;ref name="ChicagoClub"&gt;{{citation|title=Chicago Social and Club Register|date=1921|publisher=Crest Publishers|url=http://libsysdigi.library.uiuc.edu/oca/Books2007-09/chicagosocialclu00chic/chicagosocialclu00chic_djvu.txt|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Weddings: Mildred Affleck and Victor Spoehr, Winnetka|periodical=Wilmette Life|page=13|url=http://news.wilmette.lib.il.us/details.asp?NewsID=76672|date=23 October 1923|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Victor Spoehr Gives His Bachelor Dinner Tomorrow Evening|periodical=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=2 October 1923|accessdate=2008-04-21|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/358618972.html?dids=358618972:358618972&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Oct+02%2C+1923&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=Victor+Spoehr+Gives+His+Bachelor+Dinner+Tomorrow+Evening&amp;pqatl=google|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affleck served as trustee of a number of local institutions, including the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and the Chicago Association of Commerce, while his wife was active in the [[Alliance française]] and the Chicago Woman's Musical

Affleck later moved back to Winnetka, where he would remain until his death. On February 13, 1944, he died while [[snow removal|shoveling snow]] off the walk outside of his home.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; After his death, it came to light that, despite his illustrious career, his estate was worth much less than previously believed, possibly as little as [[United States dollar|$]]20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hint Affleck Estate's Value is Only $20,000|periodical=Chicago Tribune|page=10|date=29 February 1944|accessdate=2008-03-27|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/462207162.html?dids=462207162:462207162&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Feb+29%2C+1944&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=HINT+AFFLECK+ESTATE'S+VALUE+IS+ONLY+%2420%2C000&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[steamboat|steamer]] of the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; His grandson, Peter Adams Spoehr, went on to attend [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and married Sally Rambeau of [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on December 1, 1956 in her hometown; the elder Spoehr was already deceased by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marriage Announcement|date=9 September 1956|accessdate=2008-04-21|periodical=The New York Times|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F17FA3A5815738FDDA00894D1405B8689F1D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00B13FD3B5C14738DDDAB0894DA415B8689F1D3|title=Sally Rambeau, P.

'''Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr''' (February 5, 1848&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1889), better known as '''Belle Starr''', was a notorious American [[outlaw]].

Belle associated with the [[James–Younger Gang]] and other outlaws. She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized by Richard K. Fox—editor and publisher of the ''[[National Police Gazette]]''—and she later became a popular character in television and movies.

==Early life==
Belle Starr was born Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father's farm near [[Carthage, Missouri]], on February 5, 1848. Most of her family members called her May. Her father, John Shirley, prospered raising wheat, corn, hogs and horses, though he was considered to be the "[[black sheep]]" of a well-to-do Virginia family which had moved west to Indiana, where he married and divorced twice.&lt;ref&gt;[Shirley, Glenn. ''Belle Starr and Her Times: The Literature, the Facts and the Legends''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1982, pp 31–65]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, Elizabeth "Eliza" Hatfield Shirley, was John Shirley's third wife and a distant relative to the Hatfields of the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|famous family feud]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shirley, Glenn. Belle Starr and Her Times: The Literature, the Facts and the Legends. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1982, p 34]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, her father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage, where he bought an [[Public house#Inns|inn]], [[livery stable]] and blacksmith shop on the [[town square]].

May Shirley received a classical education and learned piano, while graduating from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy, a private institution that her father had helped to found.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/17/local/me-then17|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=February 17, 2002|title= L.A. Then and Now: Truth Dims the Legend of Outlaw Queen Belle Starr|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Civil War==
After a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] attack on Carthage in 1864, the Shirleys moved to [[Scyene, Texas]]. According to legend, it was at Scyene that the Shirleys became associated with a number of Missouri-born criminals, including [[Jesse James]] and the Youngers. In fact, she knew the [[James-Younger Gang|Younger brothers]] and the James boys because she had grown up with them in Missouri. Her brother, John A. M. "Bud" Shirley, was called Captain Shirley by local Confederate sympathizers. He does not appear on any list of Quantrill's Raiders, but rode with a group who were called [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s by some and [[bushwackers]] by Union sympathizers.  Bud Shirley was killed in 1864 in [[Sarcoxie, Missouri]], while he and another scout were eating at the home of a Confederate sympathizer. Union troops surrounded the house and when Bud attempted to escape, he was shot and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Janet Ariciu family Bush |author=Janet Ariciu |url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=monkeys&amp;id=I61536 |publisher=RootsWeb – an [[Ancestry.com]] community |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Civil War==
[[File:Jim Reed and Belle Starr.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Reed (outlaw)|Jim Reed]] and Belle Starr in 1866]]

Following the war, the Reed family also moved to Scyene and May Shirley married [[Jim Reed (outlaw)|Jim Reed]] in 1866, after having had an earlier crush on him as a teen. Two years later, she gave birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which would feed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride [[sidesaddle]] while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and a plumed hat, carrying two pistols, with cartridge belts across her hips.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; Jim turned to crime and was wanted for murder in [[Arkansas]], which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.

Later returning to Texas, Jim Reed was involved with several criminal gangs. While Jim initially tried his hand at farming, he would grow restless and fell in with bad company—the Starr clan, a [[Cherokee]] Indian family notorious for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), as well as his wife's old friends the James and Younger gangs. In April 1874, despite a lack of any evidence, a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for her arrest for a [[stagecoach]] robbery by her husband and others. Jim Reed was killed in August of that year in [[Paris, Texas]], where he had settled down with his family.

==Marriage to Sam Starr==
[[File:Belle Starr, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Belle Starr, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1886]]

Allegedly, Belle was briefly married for three weeks to Charles Younger, uncle of Cole Younger in 1878, but this is not substantiated by any evidence.  There are numerous claims that Belle's daughter Pearl Reed was actually Pearl Younger, but in Cole Younger's own biography (quoted in Glen Shirley's "Belle Starr and her times") Cole Younger discounted that as rubbish and set down what he truly knew of Belle. In 1880 she did marry a Cherokee man named Sam Starr and settled with the Starr family in the [[Indian Territory]]. There, she learned ways of organizing, planning and fencing for the rustlers, horse thieves and bootleggers, as well as harboring them from the law. Belle's illegal enterprises proved lucrative enough for her to employ bribery to free her cohorts from the law whenever they were caught.

In 1883, Belle and Sam were arrested by [[Bass Reeves]] charged with [[horse theft]] and tried before [[Isaac Parker|"The Hanging Judge" Isaac Parker]]'s [[United States Federal Court|Federal District Court]] in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]];  the prosecutor was United States Attorney [[W. H. H. Clayton]].  She was found guilty and served nine months at the [[Detroit House of Corrections]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Belle proved to be a model prisoner and during her time in jail she won the respect of the prison matron, while Sam was more incorrigible and was assigned to hard labor.

In 1886, she escaped [[conviction (law)|conviction]] on another theft charge, but on December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with Officer Frank West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/14019-police-officer-frank-west|author=|date=|title=Police Officer Frank West, United States Department of the Interior - Bureau of Indian Affairs - Division of Law Enforcement, U.S. Government|publisher=Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both men were killed, while Belle's life as an outlaw queen—and what had been the happiest relationship of her life—abruptly ended with her husband's death.

==Unsolved murder==
[[File:Belle Starr and Blue Duck.jpg|thumb| Blue Duck and Belle Starr, May 24, 1886.]]

For the last two-plus years of her life, gossips and scandal sheets linked her to a series of men with colorful names, including Jack Spaniard, Jim French and [[Blue Duck (outlaw)|Blue Duck]], after which, in order to keep her [[Home|residence]] on Indian land, she married a relative of Sam Starr, Jim July Starr, who was some 15 years younger than she was.

On February 3, 1889, two days before her 41st birthday, she was killed. She was riding home from a neighbor's house in [[Eufaula, Oklahoma]], when she was ambushed. After she fell off her horse, she was shot again to make sure she was dead. Her death resulted from [[shotgun]] wounds to the back and neck and in the shoulder and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double barrel shotgun.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

According to [[Frank Eaton|Frank "Pistol Pete" Eaton]], her death was due to different circumstances. She had been attending a dance. Frank Eaton had been the last person to dance with Belle Starr when Edgar Watson, clearly intoxicated had asked to dance with her. When Belle Starr declined, he later followed her. When on the way home, she stopped to give her horse a drink at a creek, he shot and killed her. According to Frank Eaton, Watson was tried, convicted and executed by hanging for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oklahomaterritory.org{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, another story says there were no witnesses and no one was ever convicted of the murder. Suspects with apparent motive included her new husband and both of her children, as well as [[Chokoloskee, Florida#Edgar Watson|Edgar J. Watson]], one of her [[sharecroppers]], because he was afraid she was going to turn him in to the [[authorities]] as an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on his head. Watson, who was killed in 1910, was tried for her murder, but was acquitted, and the ambush has entered Western lore as "[[Cold case (criminology)|unsolved]]".

One source suggests her son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her horse, may have been her killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiertimes.com/outlaws/belle_starr.html|title=FrontierTimes - Outlaws - Belle Starr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story becomes popularized==
[[File:Woolaroc - Belle Star 2.jpg|thumb|Statue of Belle Starr at [[Woolaroc]] in [[Oklahoma]]]]

Although an obscure figure outside Texas throughout most of her life, Belle's story was picked up by the [[dime novel]] and ''[[National Police Gazette]]'' publisher, Richard K. Fox. Fox made her name famous with his novel ''Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James'', published in 1889 (the year of her murder). This novel is still often cited as a historical reference.  It was the first of many popular stories that used her name.

==Children==
Belle's son, Eddie Reed, was convicted of horse theft and [[receiving stolen property]] in July 1889. Judge Parker sent him to prison in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Belle's daughter, Rosie Reed, also known as [[Pearl Starr]], became a prostitute to raise funds for Eddie's release. She did eventually obtain a [[Pardon|presidential pardon]] in 1893.

The '''Better Business Bureau''' ('''BBB'''), founded in 1912, is a private, nonprofit organization whose self-described mission is to focus on advancing marketplace trust,&lt;ref name="BBB Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Better Business Bureau Vision, Mission &amp; Vision|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/vision-mission-and-values//|publisher=Council of Better Business Bureaus|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 106 independently incorporated local BBB organizations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], coordinated under the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/ |title=Council of Better Business Bureaus – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Better Business Bureau is not affiliated with any governmental agency. Businesses that affiliate with the BBB and adhere to its standards do so through [[industry self-regulation]]. To avoid bias, the BBB's policy is to refrain from recommending or endorsing any specific business, product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/frequently-asked-questions/ |title=The Better Business Bureau FAQs and Information – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been the subject of controversy, particularly related to its alleged practice of giving higher ratings to businesses that pay a membership fee. The BBB disputes the claim that payment from businesses is required for them to receive an "A"&amp;nbsp;rating.&lt;ref name="ABC Resigned" /&gt;  Business consultant and previous national Manager of Customer Service for [[Checker Auto Parts]] Eva Love observed, "Complaining about a business to the Better Business Bureau is like complaining to the mouse's mother after a mouse steals your cheese. It will help if the wind is blowing in your direction."&lt;ref&gt;Sixty Years In The American Southwest, A. Rasmussen, J&amp;S Books, Uniontown, Wa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 400,000 local businesses in North America are accredited by the BBB.&lt;ref name=annual&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbb.org/council/about/annual-reports/|title=CBBB Annual Reports|publisher=BBB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB prospects successfully vetted businesses to become dues-paying 'accredited businesses' that pledge and continue to adhere to the BBB Code of Business Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/vision-mission-and-values/ |title=BBB Code of Business Practices – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the BBB allows accredited businesses in good standing to use its trademarked logo in marketing materials.

==History==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=article sections needs major overhaul. Entire section was commented in without solving previous source issue.|date=September 2017}}

"Medical quackery and the promotions of nostrums and worthless drugs were among the most prominent abuses which led to the establishment of formal self-regulation in business and, in turn, to the creation of the NBBB."&lt;ref name=Ladimer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ladimer |first=Irving |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1256406&amp;blobtype=pdf |format=PDF |title=The Health Advertising Program of the National Better Business Bureau  |journal= A.J.P.H. |volume= 55|issue= 8|date= August 1965 |pmc=1256406 |pmid=14326419 |pages=1217–27 |doi=10.2105/ajph.55.8.1217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Better Business Bureau has been credited to several court cases, such as [[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]], initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the [[Coca-Cola Company]], in 1906 after the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] had become law. [[Samuel Candler Dobbs]], sales manager of Coca-Cola and later its president, took up the cause of [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|truth in advertising]] in the wake of those judgments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1909, Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the "Ten Commandments of Advertising," one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission,&amp;nbsp;Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World  (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus,&amp;nbsp;Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) was established.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Structure and funding==
The 112 BBBs are independently governed by their own boards of directors and must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the CBBB. The CBBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as by senior executives from major corporations, and community leaders such as academics and legal experts. Each BBB is run separately and is chiefly funded by its accredited businesses, who often serve on its board. A study by a business school dean at [[Marquette University]] found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.&lt;ref name=Parmar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/Investigating-the-Better-Business-Bureau-23879/?page=all|title= Is the BBB Too Cozy With the Firms It Monitors?|first=Neil |last=Parmar|date=September 24, 2008|work=[[SmartMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. CBBB receives membership dues from BBBs, which amounted to US $4,884,226 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/237/237079691/237079691_200912_990O.pdf|title=Income Tax Form 990|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute resolution procedures===
The organization's dispute resolution procedures are established by the Council of the Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no‑cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB.  The BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process/ |title=Dispute Resolution Processes and Guides – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402220704/http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by the BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roos |first=Dave |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/better-business-bureau4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "File a Complaint with a BBB " |publisher=Money.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternative entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/901 |title=Alternatives to Going to Court &amp;#124; The People's Law Library |publisher=Peoples-law.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a BBB receives a consumer dispute, the BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of the BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that the BBB compiles scores based upon their ability to collect their money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Associated Press |author2=Patrick Preston |url=http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |title=Better Business Bureau Changes Ratings System Following Criticism |publisher=NBC 4i |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130002526/http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |archive-date=2013-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Advertising Division====
The '''National Advertising Division''' of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in the United States and Canada reviews factual claims made in national advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2221968/|title=How New Is "New"?

Compliance with findings is voluntary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Rating system and accreditation==
Until 2008, the BBB rated companies "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory." On January 1, 2009, the BBB moved to a new system based on a school-style A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to F rating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enewspf.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7686:new-bbb-letter-grade-a-through-f-ratings-system-helps-businesses-evaluate-suppliers-improve-operations-&amp;catid=88888960&amp;Itemid=88889783 |title=New BBB Letter-Grade A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Through F Ratings System Helps Businesses Evaluate Suppliers, Improve Operations |publisher=eNews Park Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16 factors have been posted on each business review since the program's inception&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/business-reviews/ratings/ |title=What are BBB Ratings? |publisher=BBB |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050613/http://www.bbb.org/business-reviews/ratings/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the details on the points awarded as well.&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"/&gt; Initially there was a 17th factor worth 4&amp;nbsp;points for businesses that were Accredited and paid a fee to BBB.  That process was changed in November 2010 in response to criticism in the media and from the Connecticut attorney general who accused BBB of using "pay to play" tactics.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"/&gt;

If a business chooses not to provide basic information, such as size and start date, the BBB may assign a not-rated (NR) rating.&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/pressroom/2010/11/the-better-business-bureau-checks-up-on-companies-but-who-checks-up-on-the-better-business-bureau-brian-ross-investigates-on.html |title=The Better Business Bureau checks up on companies but who checks up on the Better Business Bureau? |publisher=blogs.absnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low rating due solely to a company not providing information would read: "BBB does not have sufficient background information on this business."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A business is eligible for BBB accreditation if it meets, in the opinion of the BBB, the "BBB Standards for Trust".&lt;ref name="BBB Mission"/&gt; There are eight BBB Standards for Trust that the BBB expects its accredited businesses to adhere to build trust ("maintain a positive track record in the marketplace"), advertise honestly, tell the truth, be transparent, honor promises, be responsive (address marketplace disputes), safeguard privacy (protect consumer data) and embody integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-standards-for-trust/ |title=The Better Business Bureau Standards for Trust – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323122353/http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-standards-for-trust |archive-date=2012-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Connecticut Attorney General|Attorney General of Connecticut]] demanded that the BBB stop using its weighted letter grade system, calling it "potentially harmful and misleading" to consumers.&lt;ref name=Rhee/&gt; Responding to the Attorney General of Connecticut and others, the BBB has since modified its letter grade system.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"/&gt;

==Criticism==

In 2010 ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' reported in a segment titled "The Best Ratings Money Can Buy" about the irregularities in BBB ratings.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2020"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/business-bureau-best-ratings-money-buy/story?id=12123843|title=BBB Ratings|publisher=[[ABC News|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported that a man created two dummy companies which received ''A+'' ratings as soon as he had paid the membership fee. They also reported that business owners were told that the only way to improve their rating was by paying the fee. In one case a ''C'' was turned to an ''A'' immediately after a payment and in another case a C‑minus became an ''A+''. The chef [[Wolfgang Puck]] said that some of his businesses receive ''F''{{'s}} because he refuses to pay a fee. [[Ritz Carlton]], which does not belong either, also receives Fs for not responding to its complaints.&lt;ref name=Rhee&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror Group Gets 'A' Rating From Better Business Bureau?

In response, the president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has stated the BBB ratings system will cease awarding points to businesses for being BBB members.&lt;ref&gt;"A Message from the President of CBBB", November 18, 2010, reproduced at {{cite web |url=http://reloroundtable.com/blog/examinercom/bbb-revises-rating-system-to-regain-consumer-trust/ |title=BBB revises rating system to regain consumer trust |publisher=RELO RoundTable |accessdate=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national BBB's executive committee voted to address the public's perception of the ratings system. It voted that the BBB ratings system would no longer give additional points to businesses because they are accredited.&lt;!--The BBB ratings system no longer gives additional points to businesses who pay accreditation fees. -- Commented out as this fails verification -- warranting an {{fv}} tag. -- The PR says the system WILL change, not that it HAS changed.

In Canada, CBC News reported in 2010 that Canadian BBBs were downgrading the ratings scores of businesses who stopped paying their dues. For example, a moving business who had an ''A'' rating and had been a BBB member for 20&amp;nbsp;years, dropped to a D‑minus rating when they allegedly no longer wanted to pay dues.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News, The National, November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

BBBs have been accused of unduly protecting companies. If a branch does not act reasonably on behalf of a consumer, a complaint may be filed with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Moreover, recent reports have suggested that the Austin chapter of the Better Business Bureau refused to resolve complaints against companies if customers do not pay a $70 mediation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/your-money/13haggler.html?hp|title=Complaint Resolved? Well, Not Exactly|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=13 March 2011|first=David|last=Segal|date=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, while the BBB publishes names of corporations, it withholds the names of individuals lodging complaints.  The BBB also publishes the complainant's claim without any attempt at verification.  The net result is that the BBB can be used to launch anonymous attacks on businesses with the onus falling on the business to refute any untrue or exaggerated claims made by the complainant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Criticism on case resolutions ===
It has been reported that the BBB encourages and solicits money from the very businesses they monitor which, again, raises the question of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feefighters.com/blog/the-bbb-is-a-scam/ |title=Report: Better Business Bureau BBB &amp; CBBB |author=FeeFighters |date=July 22, 2011 |publisher=FeeFighters.com |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB states that they hold their Accredited businesses to a higher standard, as outlined in their Accreditation standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-accreditation-standards/ |title=BBB Online Business Best Practices – - U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063642/http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-accreditation-standards |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is likely the reason for such backronyms as, "Better for Businesses Bureau" and "Bribes from Businesses Bureau," popular nicknames for the organization presumably stemming from the frustration regarding the above criticisms.

On December 22, 2010, William Mitchell, CEO of the [[Los Angeles]] BBB, and originator of the BBB letter grading system, resigned as a result of an internal investigation conducted by the CBBB.&lt;ref name="ABC Resigned"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/la-business-bureau-chapter-head-bill-mitchell-quits/story?id=12458713 |title=Report: Controversial Head of L.A.

===Integration of US and Canadian operations===
On August 16, 2011 the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced the formal integration of operations in the United States &amp; Canada, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations|title=Login|publisher=|access-date=2015-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122223359/http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBBB Board of Directors voted earlier this month on the integration plan. The Council of Better Business Bureaus is the international headquarters of the BBB system and the governing body that licenses local BBBs and provides support services to increase their effectiveness.

According to the statement, integration marks the way "...for an improved customer experience for those who purchase goods and services across the border." "The U.S. and Canada remain each other's largest trading partners," noted Stephen A. Cox, President and CEO of CBBB. "We are really one North American marketplace, and the BBB system now reflects that. Not only will it be easier for consumers to check out businesses in either country, it will be simpler for them to file a complaint or resolve a dispute."

The move was supported by the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus (CCBBB). "Given the advances in technology and the globalization of services, it no longer makes sense to maintain two separate systems," said M. Jean Lemyre, chair of the CCBBB. "The vast majority of consumers initially contact BBB through the Internet. Aligning BBB services into one integrated system will be more efficient for businesses in Canada, and will ensure that consumers continue to receive the high quality of services they've come to expect from BBB."&lt;ref name="thespec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2164412-hamilton-better-business-bureau-vows-to-stay-open/|title=Hamilton Better Business Bureau vows to stay open|date=24 August 2011|publisher=|via=The Hamilton Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|title=Login|publisher=|access-date=2015-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122223359/http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windsorchamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Oct-31-2011-Battle-brews-over-business-accreditation-in-Windsor.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122231908/http://www.windsorchamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Oct-31-2011-Battle-brews-over-business-accreditation-in-Windsor.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBB Revokes Trademark Authorization from four Canadian offices===
The Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) revoked the BBB name &amp; trademark from four Canadian Better Business Bureaus. The CBBB said it made the move to withdraw trademark authorization from the offices in Hamilton, Windsor, Montreal and St. John's after determining these four Canadian offices did not meet the defined standards of operation.

CBBB realigned the boundaries of its affected Canadian offices and folded them into larger offices. Hamilton has been gathered under the banner of the BBB's Kitchener office,&lt;ref name="thespec.com"/&gt; while the territories in SW Ontario (including Windsor) are now part of the Western Ontario region&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"/&gt; based in London, ON.

The former President of the Better Business Bureau of Windsor and South Western Ontario claims that he continues to operate under the name [[IntegrityLink]] in 2011, although services offered under that name have not been verified and the CBBB maintains concerns that some of the former BBB's continue to make use of proprietary information to which they are no longer entitled.&lt;ref name="thespec.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsor-star-2011-08-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=d2d6c03b-cd79-47fc-8446-2151aa050783 |title=Local BBB president not happy with change |first=Kristie |last=Pearce |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903070737/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=d2d6c03b-cd79-47fc-8446-2151aa050783 |archivedate=September 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 the Hamilton, Montreal &amp; St. John's offices have also changed their names or closed following what they termed a takeover by the U.S.-based Council of Better Business Bureaus.&lt;ref name="toronto-star-2011-09-07" /&gt;  The Hamilton, Ontario BBB adopted the name Canadian Businesses and Charity Bureau.&lt;ref name="spectator-2011"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6847">'''Bill Boyer Jr.''' is a 50% owner and former [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Hawaii]]'s [[Mokulele Airlines]].  In March 2009, he was replaced as the airline's CEO and was put in charge of expanding sales and marketing efforts after [[Republic Airways]] became a 50% shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starbulletin.com/business/20090320_Mokulele_gets_cash_new_CEO.html Mokulele gets cash, new CEO], by David Segal, Honolulu Star Bulletin, March 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer is a native of [[Tacoma, Washington]]. 

==Background==
Boyer, who dropped out of college, was an [[entrepreneur]]ial-minded [[baggage handler]] at [[Seattle]] based [[Alaska Airlines]] when, in response to information posted about [[in-flight entertainment]] challenges on the Alaska Airlines employee website, he conceived of a portable [[hard-disk]] based [[video on demand]] media player that he later named the "[[digEplayer]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/138884_airdvd10.html ‘Sky's the limit for a baggage handler's in-flight entertainment system”] [[Seattle PI]], September 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.airfax.com/airfax/features/viewstory.asp?filepath=feb2004%5Calaskadigeplayer.htm “DigEplayer Portable VOD Big Hit With Alaska Air Passengers”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618130448/http://www.airfax.com/airfax/features/viewstory.asp?filepath=feb2004%5Calaskadigeplayer.htm |date=June 18, 2006 }} – AIRFAX.com, February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 
On behalf of [[digEplayer|Aircraft Protective Systems]] (APS), a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] corporation he founded earlier to commercialize other products he developed for the aircraft industry, he obtained $2.5 million initial financing from family and an [[Angel investor]] to fully develop and market his conceived product, which became the first self-contained portable [[video on demand]] (VOD) [[in-flight Entertainment]] (IFE) device.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.seattlepi.com/venture/funding.asp?company=APS “In the Money – APS”]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - [[Seattle PI]], Venture Capital Notebook, 9/8/2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_8_32/ai_n6121821 “Flight of fancy?

Boyer was able to convince [[20th Century Fox]] to provide first-run movies and other studio content for the player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NUH/is_11_37/ai_110461912 “Video on demand takes off—literally”] - Telecommunications Americas, Oct, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divx.com/company/press/press_detail.php?pr_id=75 APS and DivXNetworks Partner to Bring Portable Video-on-Demand to Airline Industry]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer's then employer, [[Alaska Airlines]], became the first customer for the APS digEplayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskasworld.com/newsroom/asnews/ASstories/AS_20030909_084339.asp “Alaska To Become First Carrier to Offer APS DigEPlayer Portable Video On Demand Entertainment System”]- Alaska Airlines Press Release, 9/9/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the apparent success of the Alaska Airlines digEplayer implementation, APS was able to sell the digEplayer to additional airlines.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mcneilwilson.com/text/page.jsp?docid=64&amp;page=news_detail&amp;ref=3&amp;section=news "HAWAIIAN AIRLINES GETS PERSONAL WITH DIGEPLAYER IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - [[Hawaiian Airlines]] press release, July 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2004/oct/1087627.htm North American Airlines to Offer digEplayer On New Routes; New Oakland, CA routes to Hawaii] - APS Press Release, Oct. 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2003, Boyer signed an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with [[Springville, Utah]]-based aircraft parts distributor Wencor and two months later sold the company to Wencor, which renamed APS "[[digEcor]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wencor.com/info/pr_082004.html APS SIGNS EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING ALLIANCE WITH WENCOR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625072655/http://www.wencor.com/info/pr_082004.html |date=June 25, 2007 }} - Wencor Press Release, August 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/205999_entrepreneurs31.html "Five entrepreneurs with solid records back in ring"] - [[Seattle PI]], December 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Blindspots analysis''' (also '''blind spots analysis''') is a method aimed at uncovering obsolete, incomplete, or incorrect assumptions in a decision maker’s mental scheme of the environment. [[Michael Porter]] used the term "blind spots" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter Michael, E. |date=1980|title= Competitive Strategy|location= NY|publisher= Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further popularized by [[Barbara Tuchman]], in her book ''The March of Folly'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuchman, Barbara |date=1985|title= The March of Folly|location= NY|publisher= Ballantine Books |edition=Paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in their study of [[prejudice]].

==Uncovering blind spots==
Ben Gilad fully developed, in his book, ''Business Blindspots'' (1994), the following three-step "Gilad method" for uncovering blind spots&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step One'': Conducting a [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure – aka 5 force analysis]] on a given industry or segment (market), augmented with identification of possible change drivers, which are defined as trends with the potential to have profound (structural) effect on the balance of power among the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step Two:'' Collecting [[competitive intelligence]] on the target company’s top executives assumptions regarding the same industry structure as in Step One. Sources may include annual reports' letters to shareholders, autobiographies, interviews in the press, public appearances and speeches, industry meetings, congressional testimonies, conference calls with security analysts (transcripts are publicly available), and all other statements regarding vision and beliefs. An alternative technique is known among competitive intelligence professionals as “strategy’s reverse engineering” which looks for the underlying assumptions which can rationalize existing strategy.
#''Step Three:'' Compare the results of Step Two with the analysis in Step One. Any contradiction with the analysis in Step One is a potential blindspot.

== Underlying assumptions ==

Underlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent [[cognitive bias|biases]] of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liff, Stewart|author-link=Stewart Liff|title= The Complete Guide to Hiring and Firing Government Employees|pages= 109–111|publisher= AMACOM|location= New York|date=2009|isbn= 978-0-8144-1450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including [[cognitive dissonance]], motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement.&lt;ref&gt;(Cramer et al., 2005),(Rosenzweig, 2007), (Bossidy and Charan, 2004), (USA Today, 2005), (Gilad, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenzweig, Phil|title= The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|location= NY|publisher=The Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0743291255|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders

Lloyd Warner]].

In the late 1920s, Garner started his academic career as a field worker for Warner's Department of Industrial Research at the Harvard Graduate School of Business.

'''Carlo Hein Tabalujan''' (born '''Tan Tjin Hin''' 譚欣下巴;&lt;ref name="Setyautama50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setyautama|1980|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 April 1924—10 November 2011) is a [[Chinese Indonesian]] [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[Hokkien]] origin.&lt;ref name=Setyautama50 /&gt;  He is the head and founder of Indonesian [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] '''PT. Sumber Selatan Nusa'''.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Buitenzorg]] (today's [[Bogor]]) in 1924, Tan Tjin Hin, adopted the Indonesian family name of Tabalujan soon after Indonesia became independent on '''17 August 1945'''.&lt;ref name="Frey242"&gt;{{Harnvb|Frey-Tan Tai Yong|2003|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth son of an Indonesian Chinese trader in a small town near [[Bogor]]. The family moved to [[Manado]] in [[Sulawesi]] and prospered until the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941&lt;ref name="Soebadio250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Soebadio-Noto Soebagio|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the complete loss of the family business.

Educated at the Anglo-Chinese College on the island of Kulangsu near [[Xiamen]], (Amoy) and at a business college in [[Jakarta]], Carlo Tabalujan at the age of seventeen was stranded entirely alone and without money when the Japanese occupied [[Java]]. He survived for three and a half years with the help from schoolmates and some poorly paid work. In 1945, his first real job was with the '''British Seaforth Highlanders''', part of the [[Allied Forces]]&lt;ref name=Tallboys120 /&gt;  that landed to take back control of Indonesia from the Japanese.

==Business==
In 1945, he began trading on his own by renting a desk in the office of a businessman. From that basic beginning, Carlo Tabalujan built up successful [[International trade|trading]] and [[manufacturing]] businesses. These include relationships with a number of international companies as his long-term partners, leading to  [[joint ventures]] controlling about a dozen affiliated companies under the Sumber Selatan umbrella, including  PT [[Nestlé]] Indonesia, PT Danapaints Indonesia, PT Century Batteries, PT Maskapai Ansuransi; Union-Far East and PT Dan Motor Indonesia [[Vespa]] which at the time became Indonesia's leading manufacturers and distributors of motorcycles, [[automotive]] and decorative parts.&lt;ref name= "Tallboys120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabalujan|Tallboys|1996|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Carlo Tabalujan strengthened the company's interest in the motorcycle industry by a joint venture with [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] motorcycles and heavy industries.

In 1972, The Australian Dairy Board monopoly expired. Ever since then, [[Nestlé]] Indonesia continued to diversify its consumer goods catering to local markets. Products such as [[Nescafé]] Coffee, Milkmaid and Dancow milk powder.
Carlo Tabalujan currently continues as a member of the board of [[Nestlé]] Indonesia with his two eldest sons Hans and James Tabalujan.

==Family==
Carlo is married to wife, Tine Kamboean and together have four sons and one daughter; Hans G. Tabalujan, James D. Tabalujan, Heyley L. Tabalujan, Peter L. Tabalujan and Benny S. Tabalujan.
Carlo has fifteen grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

==Autobiography==
'''Fifty Years of Business In Indonesia'''

"''&lt;small&gt;This is the remarkable story of Carlo Tabalujan. Beginning in pre-war Indonesia, we learn how, as a seventeen year old schoolboy, he was stranded without family or money how he survived three and a half years of the Japanese occupation in Jakarta and how he then started out his business empire on his own; with nothing but a rented desk and a telephone"&lt;/small&gt;''

The '''Conference Board of Canada''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] not-for-profit [[think tank]] dedicated to researching and analyzing economic trends, as well as organizational performance and public policy issues.

Describing itself as "objective" and "non-partisan", the Conference Board of Canada claims not to lobby for special interests. It is funded through fees charged for services delivered to the private and public sectors alike.  The organization conducts, publishes and disseminates research on various topics of interest to its members. It publishes research reports, conducts meetings, holds [[business conference|conferences]] and provides on-line information services, which aim to develop individual leadership skills and organizational capacity.

The Conference Board of Canada was established in 1954 as a division of the American National Industrial Conference Board, now simply known as [[The Conference Board]].  The Conference Board of Canada acquired a separate legal identity in 1981, and currently has over 200 employees, mostly based out of its main office in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001845 The Canadian Encyclopedia].  Retrieved on 2007-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently registered as a Canadian charitable organization and maintains a presence across Canada with an office in [[Calgary]] and an affiliate in Quebec, L'Institut du Québec.

==Plagiarism Controversy==
In May 2009, The Conference Board of Canada was criticised over its claim to be objective and [[non-partisan]]. It released a report related to copyright regulations in Canada, which plagiarised papers published by the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] (the primary movie, music, and software lobby in the US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/4000/125/ Michael Geist - The Conference Board of Canada's Deceptive, Plagiarized Digital Economy Report].

Retrieved on 2009-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; which drew further criticism, claiming they ignored a commissioned report, for [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeremydebeer.ca/content/view/254/2/ Jeremy deBeer - Research on Copyright and Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530080753/http://www.jeremydebeer.ca/content/view/254/2 |date=2009-05-30 }}.

Retrieved on 2009-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference Board recalled the reports after conducting an internal review, which determined that there was undue reliance on feedback from a funder of the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conferenceboard.ca/press/speech_oped/09-06-17/Statement_On_Review_Of_Intellectual_Property_Rights_Reports.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference Board hosted a roundtable discussion on intellectual property in September 2009 and published a new report, ''Intellectual Property in the 21st Century'', in February 2010.

==Stereotyping Controversy==
In November 2016, a recording surfaced of Michael Bloom, the Vice-President of The Conference Board, which contained a number of generalizing statements about indigenous peoples, people of Caribbean, Asian, and middle-eastern descent. The statements were made in the presence of an employee that is of indigenous heritage. Upon learning of the recording, The Conference Board of Canada placed the Vice-President on immediate leave of absence and initiated an internal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aptn.ca/news/2016/11/11/top-think-tank-vp-facing-probe-over-racially-prejudiced-remarks-about-indigenous-peoples-asians/ Jorge Barrera - Top think tank VP facing probe over racially prejudiced remarks about Indigenous peoples, Asians]. Retrieved on 2016-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the recording was made public, it was further revealed that a former employee commenced legal action against The Conference Board of Canada. This employee had worked under Michael Bloom and alleged a "toxic work environment." The former employee was also of indigenous heritage. A lawsuit was filed in Ontario and sought $175,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aptn.ca/news/2016/11/17/indigenous-scholar-alleges-toxic-workplace-at-think-tank-investigating-vice-president-over-racially-prejudiced-remarks/ Jorge Barrera - Indigenous scholar alleges 'toxic' workplace at think tank investigating Vice-President over 'racially prejudiced' remarks].

Since 2017, two of his books have been on the required reading list for the [[Society of Actuaries]] exam prep.  In addition to his books, Mr. Hubbard has been published in several periodicals including ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]]'', ''[[OR/MS Today]]'', ''Analytics'', ''CIO'', ''[[InformationWeek|Information Week]]'', and ''[[ArchitectureBoston|Architecture Boston]]''. His books have been selected for required, recommended, and suggested reading by multiple business schools such as the [[College of Charleston School of Business and Economics|School of Business and Economics]] (College of Charleston), [[Jon M. Huntsman School of Business]] (Utah State University), and [[Carl H. Lindner College of Business]] (University of Cincinnati).  

He is known for taking a critical view of several popular methods and standards in risk management and decision making in organizations.  He argues that extensive research in methods such as "risk matrices", the use of weighted scores in decision making, and even expert intuition are inferior to certain quantitative methods.  

Mr. Hubbard began his management consulting career at [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] (subsequently merged with Price Waterhouse to form Price Waterhouse Coopers) in 1988 after finishing his MBA at the University of South Dakota.  He formed [Http://www.hubbardresearch.com Hubbard Decision Research] in 1998 to focus on the practical application of several fields of quantitative analysis.  His methods have been adopted in insurance, financial services, pharmaceutical, healthcare, utilities, energy, federal and state government, entertainment media, military logistics, aerospace R&amp;D, cybersecurity, and manufacturing. His work is frequently cited in both management and academic publications.

'''Eduardo Georgetti''' (October 11, 1866 – 1937), was an agriculturist, businessman, philanthropist, and politician. Georgetti, who came from a family of prosperous land owners, became one of Puerto Rico's wealthiest sugar barons and benefactors. In 1917, he became the [[1st Puerto Rican Senate|first Vice-president of the Puerto Rican Senate]].

==Early years==
Georgetti (sometimes also spelled as "'''Giorgetti'''") was born in the town of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manatí]]. His father was Dr. Pedro Juan Giorgetti Battesti, an immigrant from [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]] and his mother Guadalupe Fernandez Vanga y Freites, native of Puerto Rico whose family were land owners. He became orphaned at a young age and went to live with his maternal uncle. He received his primary education in the ''Colegio de los Jesuitas de San Juan'' (School of the Jesuits of San Juan). Georgetti inherited the lands of his parents which his uncle administrated, during the time that he was in [[Corsica]] pursuing his secondary education at the ''Liceo de Córcega'' (Lyceum of Corsica).&lt;ref name="PIB"&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/super2/barceloneta/personasimportantes/politica/eduardogeorgetti.html Personas Importantes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sugar baron==
Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found that the lands which he had left in the hands of his uncle had prospered enormously. Georgetti married Aúrea Balseiro Dávila in 1888. Together with is father-in-law, Rafael Balseiro, he purchased a company called ''Florida Agrícola'' and renamed it ''Sociedad Agrícola Industrial Balseiro y Georgetti'' (the Balseiro and Georgetti Industrial Agricultural Society). Georgetti founded and was the owner of the ''Plazuela Sugar Company,'' a sugar refinery, in the town of [[Barceloneta, Puerto Rico|Barceloneta]] which had its own dock that was used to transport sugar by barge to the waiting ships on the ocean. The company, which was the core of his fortune, was the main source of income and employment of the towns' inhabitants.&lt;ref name="PIB"/&gt; 

Georgetti expanded his sugar industry empire by purchasing land and other sugar refineries. Among the sugar plantations which Georgetti purchased were ''Los Canos'' in [[Arecibo]] and the ''Central Plata,'' in which he served as the corporation's president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carloslopezdzur.blogspot.com/2009/07/cronologia-del-comercio-y-la-indudstria.html Cronologia del Comercio y la indudstria]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the owner of the island's second largest pineapple plantation. Giorgetti was also a member of the board of directors of various banks, including the American Colonial Bank, ''Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico'' and ''Banco Nova Scotia.''&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;Eduardo Giorgetti Y Su Mundo: La Aparente Paradoja De Un Millonario Genio Empresarial Y Su Noble Humanismo"; by [[Delma S. Arrigoitia]]; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto; {{ISBN|0-942347-52-8}}; {{ISBN|978-0-942347-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
It was common practice in Puerto Rico for businessmen to become involved in politics.&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt; On December 23, 1897, Georgetti was named Mayor of Barceloneta by Sabas Marin Gonzalez, the then-appointed Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. After the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the island became a U.S. territory as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which ended the [[Puerto Rico Campaign|Spanish–American War]], the military-appointed governor, Major General John R. Brooke, permitted, upon the advice of Luis Muñoz Rivera, that Georgetti continue as mayor. Under the new administration, Barceloneta was merged with the town of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manati]], as part of a joint municipality. Georgetti did not agree with this, and fought successfully for the re-establishment of Barceloneta as a separate, stand-alone municipality.&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;        

Georgetti continued to serve as mayor of Barceloneta from 1897 to 1898. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, which supported the Spanish government headed by [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], which had promised an autonomous government for Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;[http://www.ortizal.com/barceloneta.html Historia de Barceloneta]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish–American War]], when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Georgetti, together with his friend [[Luis Muñoz Rivera]], [[Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón]], [[Antonio R. Barceló]] and [[José de Diego]], founded the Union Party of Puerto Rico. The party won the elections in 1904 and Georgetti was elected to the Puerto Rican House of Representatives. This Union Party opposed the passage of the U.S. [[Foraker Act]], which extended every U.S. federal law into Puerto Rico, and subsumed the entire body of Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory code under the framework of U.S. federal law. The Union Party also favored the acquisition of greater political autonomy for Puerto Rico, as a pathway to full independence.

In 1916, Georgetti's long-time friend Luis Muñoz Rivera fell gravely ill in [[New York City]] and returned to Puerto Rico, staying in Georgetti's house to recuperate. Georgetti summoned Muñoz Rivera's wife and son, [[Luis Muñoz Marin]], to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the [[gallbladder]], before expanding throughout his body.&lt;ref name="p.22"&gt;Bernier-Grand et al., p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1916, Muñoz Rivera died during his stay in the Georgetti residence. Georgetti's 1914 [[Pierce Arrow]] [[automobile]] was used in the statesman's funeral procession. Together with a group of friends, Georgetti purchased Muñoz Rivera's newspaper ''La Democracia'' and provided Muñoz Rivera's widow Amalia Marín Castilla with a small monthly pension. ''La Democracia'' also provided Rivera's son, Muñoz Marin, with an outlet to publish his written works. Georgetti also purchased the Muñoz Rivera home in 1916 and donated it together with the Pierce Arrow car to the town of [[Barranquitas, Puerto Rico|Barranquitas]] to be preserved as a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/puerto_rico/visitors_info/eng/article_detail.php?nt_id=261&amp;ct_id=3 Caribbean Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muñoz Rivera's death, Barceló became the leading force behind the Union Party and its liberal ideas for the island. In the elections of 1917, the Union Party was victorious. Antonio R. Barceló was named President of the [[Puerto Rican Senate]] and Georgetti was named vice-president, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to hold said position. In 1924, Barceló later formed a political coalition with [[José Tous Soto]], the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and founded the [[Alianza Puertorriqueña]] (''Puerto Rican Alliance''). This coalition came about because both Barceló and Tous Soto came to believe that neither independence nor statehood would be considered by the United States. Therefore, rather than wage a futile political battle, their "Alliance"  would concentrate on Puerto Rico's economic situation. This led to ideological conflict between Georgetti and Barceló. 

Georgetti was committed to the original ''independentista'' ideals of the Union Party, and found these incompatible with an "economic partnership" with the United States, as espoused by the Alliance coalition. Barceló and a group of party delegates had traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to seek changes in the [[Jones–Shafroth Act|Jones Act]] of 1917, by claiming that the Puerto Rican economy was sound and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. In response, Georgetti traveled to Washington as a representative of various island organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' (Live Forces). 

Georgetti and the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' submitted a "Fiscal Memorandum" to the U.S. Secretary of War, which presented a much bleaker view of the Puerto Rican economy. According to this memorandum, the island was on the brink of economic ruin unless it diversified its agricultural production, and become less dependent on the sugar industry as its sole source of income. Georgetti's actions were viewed by Barceló as an attempt by Georgetti and the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' to discredit Barceló and weaken the Alliance. Georgetti denied this, and quit the Alliance.&lt;ref name="El Pensador"&gt;[http://www.ellibrepensador.com/2010/01/06/gente-de-mi-pueblo-jeremias-beauchamp/ El Pensador]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Pensador"/&gt;

==Later years==

In 1923, Georgetti and his wife built a mansion in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]. Known as the "Mansion Georgetti," it was located on the ''Avenida Ponce de León'' (Ponce de León Avenue), designed and built by [[Czech people|Czech]] architect [[Antonin Nechodoma]], and considered to be the grandest mansion in the [[Caribbean]] at the time.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;[http://www.prfrogui.com/home/mansion.htm Mansion Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the mansion, Georgetti lived in a [[Rio Piedras]] house built in 1868. The house, known as the "Casa Georgetti," is the oldest Spanish colonial structure in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Casa Georgetti"&gt;[http://www.grf.pr/casa-georgetti Casa Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Georgetti and his wife did not have any offspring, however they were the benefactors of many talented children who lacked the economic means to pursue an education. As a [[philanthropist]], he was a sponsor of the arts and sciences. Georgetti was also the president of the Children's Tuberculosis Sanitarium of Puerto Rico. 

Eduardo Georgetti died in his Santurce residence in 1937. His wife Aúrea died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/BiografiasPr/eduardo_georgetti.htm Eduardo Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Mansion Georgetti'' was sold in 1971, demolished, and replaced with an apartment building complex.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; 

The ''Casa Georgetti'' in Rio Piedras was landmarked and restored to its original condition.&lt;ref name="Casa Georgetti"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The town of Barceloneta honored Georgetti's memory by naming a principal avenue and an urbanization (Villa Georgetti) after him. In the town of Santurce there is also a theater, ''Teatro Georgetti,'' named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foro.univision.com/t5/Cesar-Evora/Pareja-Abierta-TEATRO-GEORGETTI-SANTURCE/m-p/301529206 Univision]&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities in Puerto Rico have honored his memory by naming several streets after him, including [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Humacao, Puerto Rico|Humacao]], [[Comerio, Puerto Rico|Comerio]] and [[Vega Alta, Puerto Rico|Vega Alta]].

'''Electric Transit, Inc.''' (ETI) was a [[joint venture]] between the [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] group in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[AAI Corporation]] in the United States which made [[trolleybus]]es for the [[Trolleybuses in Dayton|Dayton]] and [[Trolleybuses in San Francisco|San Francisco trolleybus systems]], constructing a total of 330 trolleybuses. ETI was formed in 1994, and ownership was divided as 65% by [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] and 35% by [[AAI Corporation|AAI]]. The latter was a wholly owned subsidiary of United Industrial Corporation. Up to that time, Škoda had built more than 12,000 trolleybuses since 1935,&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;Wilkins, Van. "New Electric Trolley Buses in Dayton", in ''Bus World'' (ISSN 0162-9689). Summer 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; but none for cities outside Europe and Asia.

==History and production==
[[File:Dayton ETI trolleybus 9601.jpg|thumb|left|170px|ETI's first trolleybus was Dayton 9601, model 14TrE.]]
[[Image:SanFran 14TrSF trolleybus 5592.jpg|thumb|right|170px|An ETI 14TrSF trolleybus descending a hill in San Francisco]]

The company was awarded its first contract in November 1994, when the [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority]], of [[Dayton, Ohio]] placed an order for 63 two-axle trolleybuses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (now GDRTA)]] (Nov. 1, 1994). “RTA Awards Official Contract for 63 New Electric Trolleybuses.” ''[[Press release]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was later reduced to 61 vehicles,&lt;ref name= TM206&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine (TM)'' No. 206, March–April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to 57.&lt;ref name= TM207&gt;''TM'' No. 207, May–June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[prototype]] trolleybuses were delivered in December 1995 and January 1996.&lt;ref name=TM206/&gt; These were designated by ETI as model 14TrE, the E standing for "export", and were given fleet numbers 9601–9603 by MVRTA.&lt;ref name=TM207/&gt; Following modifications to the design, construction of the 54 production-series ETI trolleybuses for Dayton took place in 1998–99. These were model 14TrE2 and were numbered 9801–9854 in MVRTA's fleet. Among the modifications were the moving of the [[wheelchair lift]] from the rear door to the front door, which necessitated widening the body from {{convert|98|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|102|in|mm|abbr=on}} and changing from a one-piece windshield to a two-piece one.&lt;ref name="wilkins"/&gt;

In July 1997, the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni) contracted with ETI for the provision of 250 trolleybuses, comprising 220 [[Rigid bus|standard/two-axle]] ({{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}) and 30 [[Articulated bus|articulated]] ({{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}) vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Finnie, Chuck (June 1, 1999). “Muni trolley firm in crisis”, ''San Francisco Examiner'', p. A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; ETI designated the two types for San Francisco as models 14TrSF and 15TrSF, respectively. In February 2000, Muni exercised contract options to purchase an additional 20 two-axle and three articulated vehicles. Two prototypes for the two-axle trolleybuses (numbered 5401–5402) were received by Muni in January 1999 and June 1999, respectively, while an articulated prototype (No. 7101) was received in April 2000. The 238 production-series two-axle trolleybuses (Nos. 5403–5640) were delivered between May 2001 and early 2004. The production-series articulateds (7102–7133) were all delivered in 2003. All 273 of Muni's ETI trolleybuses had entered service by April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''TM'' No. 256, July–August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With both the Dayton and San Francisco orders, the chassis/body-frame (or shell) and motors of each vehicle were fabricated at Škoda's plant in [[Ostrov (Karlovy Vary District)|Ostrov nad Ohří]], [[Czech Republic]], then shipped to a facility in [[Hunt Valley, Maryland]] (near other [[AAI Corporation|AAI]] facilities) for initial fitting-out.&lt;ref name="frames"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bus frames have arrived|newspaper=[[Dayton Business Journal]]|date=March 25, 1997|url= http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/1997/03/24/daily7.html|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Trolley Buses: Procurement Program Highlights|publisher=[[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency|San Francisco MTA]]|url=http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218092119/http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2011 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except in the case of the prototypes, final fitting-out was undertaken in leased premises located in the two cities purchasing the vehicles, Dayton and San Francisco.

ETI originally was based in Dayton,&lt;ref name="frames"/&gt; but after completion of the contract for that city, the Dayton office was closed and ETI moved its administrative office to Hunt Valley, sharing space with partner AAI there.

[[File:SF Muni ETI 15TrSF 7108.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An ETI 15TrSF in San Francisco]]
In 2003, ETI engaged in a competitive bidding for a large contract (245 trolleybuses) being offered by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]], [[Canada]] for supply of trolleybuses to the [[Trolleybuses in Vancouver|Vancouver trolleybus system]], but lost out to [[New Flyer Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouc, Frantisek (July 15, 2004).

The '''Glenmere mansion''' is a luxury hotel and spa overlooking [[Glenmere Lake]], approximately 50 miles northwest of [[New York City]] in [[Orange County, New York]]. It was built in 1911 as the residence of real estate developer [[Robert Wilson Goelet]] (not to be confused with his first cousin, [[Robert Walton Goelet]]) on the grounds of his sprawling estate in [[Sugar Loaf, New York|Sugar Loaf]], a hamlet of the town of [[Chester (town), New York|Chester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Andrew (1947). ''Era of Elegance''. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. pp. 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Glenmere.jpg|thumb|The wall pools of Glenmere's southern garden, c. 1920]]
[[Robert Wilson Goelet]] (1880–1966), the only son of [[Ogden Goelet]], commissioned the architects [[Carrère and Hastings]] to design a country villa in 1911. It was designed in a Tuscan style because Goelet's wife, the former Miss Elsie Whelen of Philadelphia, had always wanted to live in an Italian villa. The house features a central courtyard with an Italian marble fountain, and ochre-colored stucco walls. [[Beatrix Jones Farrand]] was hired to landscape the grounds, and [[Samuel Yellin]] did the ironwork for the house.&lt;ref&gt;Ossman, Laurie and Heather Ewing (2011). ''Carrère and Hastings: The Masterworks''. New York: Rizzoli.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their horses, Goelet and his wife were breeders of Highland Terriers and Great Danes, and they maintained extensive kennels. Soon, the estate and its storied hunting grounds became a regular haunt of [[Babe Ruth]], and the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Duke]] and [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Duchess of Windsor]].

Goelet hosted numerous sporting-set events at the estate, including equine ice-racing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/12/31/100332011.pdf "Racing on snow and ice"], ''New York Times'' Dec. 31 1914&lt;/ref&gt; The younger of Goelet's two sons, Peter, began radio station [[WGNY (AM)|WGNY]] on the grounds of the mansion in 1930.

Glenmere was sold to [[Abraham Prusoff]] during World War II. He transformed the private mansion into a resort hotel with upscale amenities, including a golf course, ski run, and tennis courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strausnews.com/articles/2007/11/30/the_chronicle/news/5.txt "Chester's slippery past"], ''The Chronicle'', November 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, Prusoff found it increasingly difficult to keep the resort's finances in order. In the next decade, the mansion and estate were seized by Orange County as a tax lien. In 1985, the mansion and estate were purchased at a tax auction by real estate magnate Rickey Mandel.

==Current use==
The mansion changed hands again in 2007, becoming a luxury 19-room hotel, restaurant, and spa, after undergoing an extensive and costly renovation. In 2008, the restoration project was temporarily halted over concern for the endangered [[Northern cricket frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080629/NEWS/806290334/-1/NEWS14 |title=Cricket frog halts development |first=Matt |last=King |publisher=The Times Herald-Record |work=Recordonline.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation again halted the construction when it became apparent that the developers were operating without the required permits and endangering the Northern cricket frog and plant life in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=John |title=Fines, stop work order issued for Glenmere mansion |publisher=The Times Herald-Record |work=Recordonline.com  |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100108/NEWS/1080344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion's developers were fined and cited by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation for violations of having improper paperwork with regard to the impact of construction on the endangered Northern cricket frog. Studies found no frog habitats on the property, and the mansion was made into a luxury hotel whose amenities include a luxury penthouse costing $3,400 a night.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100207/NEWS/2070334 |title=Chester mansion restored to glory |first=John |last=Sullivan |publisher=The Times Herald-Record |work=Recordonline.com  |date=2010-02-07 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercules Crosse Jarvis''' (18 June 1802 – 8 February 1889) MLC, MLA, was a [[mayor of Cape Town]] and a powerful merchant of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kent Rasmussen: Dictionary of African historical biography. University of California Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-520-06611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Born in [[Plymouth]], England on 18 June 1802,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamson.co.za/family/tree/HerculesCrosseJARVIS_baptism.jpg|title=Baptism recorded on 29 August 1802 at St George the Martyr church, Holborn (image)|website=williamson.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a close relative of [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent]], the admiral who fought Napoleon. His father, also named John Jervis, was an [[army captain]] from [[Staffordshire]] who died young, leaving his wife and six children. 
Coming from an intensely military family, the 14-year-old Hercules Crosse was offered a commission in the army by his relative the [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral of St Vincent]], but he had other plans and turned the offer down. He was also of a very gentle and sensitive nature, and the idea of war deeply repelled him.

After briefly visiting the [[British Cape Colony|Cape]] in 1816, he decided to move to the colony permanently, and arrived in [[Cape Town]] in 1821 with the intention of settling and making his fortune.

==Early life in Cape Town==
Soon after moving to Cape Town, he found a job as a clerk in the trading firm ''Hudson, Donaldson &amp; Dixon'' and worked his way up to being its manager - a position he held throughout his life until he retired from business in 1864. 
He was enormously influential in starting and developing the Cape's wine exports, and founded a distillery for that purpose in the vicinity of [[Paarl]]. He came to have a presence in many of the Cape's institutions, including directorship in Mutual Life (1846), the Union Bank (1847), the Harbour Board and even the [[South African College]] (1860). He was also a veteran member of the Cape Town Commercial Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Encyclopedia of Southern Africa''. Vol. 6. Nasou Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Jarvis married an [[Afrikaner|Afrikaans]] woman, Elizabeth Maria Vos, joining the local [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (where he was later made an Elder) in order to do so. He was aged 19 at the time, and she was only 16. They had five daughters. One of them, Elizabeth Maria, met and married the young [[John Charles Molteno]], who was later to become the Cape's first Prime Minister. Another daughter, Elizabeth Magdalena Christina ("Betty") married the [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]] Mayor [[James Bisset (mayor)|James Bisset]] and was mother to the Governor and cricketer [[Murray Bisset|Sir Murray Bisset]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Jenkins, C. (1996) ''World Cricketers: A Biographical Dictionary'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-210005-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A third daughter, Sophia St Ives married the influential Cape businessman and exporter [[Percy John Allport]]. Anne Jarvis married the widower and Indian army officer Major William Bazett Gordon Blenkins C.B. The youngest daughter Emmie never married.

==Political career==
[[File:Cape Town - Speeches on the Convict Crisis by T Bowler1849 Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A 19th Century depiction of the speeches and public debates on the Convict Crisis in Cape Town, 1849]]

Hercules Crosse became a prominent fighter for the establishment of a representative [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape parliament]], and when it was finally created he took a seat as the first minister to stand for Cape Town. In addition, the city of Cape Town was set up with a ''Board of Commissioners'' (later, ''Municipal Council'') in 1840 and Jarvis was immediately elected onto it, soon becoming its chairman. He had particularly good relations with the [[Cape Malay]] community of Cape Town, and throughout his political career he derived a good deal of his political support from this important voting bloc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/places/villages/westernCape/capetown/index.php?id=9&amp;page=3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moltenofamily.net/biographies/|title=Biographies|work=Molteno Family History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to become [[Mayor of Cape Town|mayor and first citizen of Cape Town]] from 1848 to 1861, making him the longest serving of any first citizen of Cape Town. 
As mayor, Jarvis was responsible for much of the early development of Cape Town's infrastructure. He drew up the plans for the city's first breakwater and harbour, and was a member of the Harbour Board for forty years. 

He was an impartial and influential spokesman of the city during the Anti-Convict Movement (1848-1850), holding public meetings and presiding over debates. This local movement had developed in response to an attempt by the British government to turn the Cape Colony into a [[penal colony]]. In the end, it was Jarvis' resolutions on the matter that ended up being conveyed to the Governor and the Queen. He subsequently suggested a renaming of a portion of the Heerengracht to "[[Adderley Street]]" - now the central street of the Cape Town CBD - after the man who had championed the opinion of the Cape citizens in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;RFM Immelman: ''Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954''. CTCC: Cape Town, 1955. Chapter 6 ''The Anti-convict Agitation''. p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s he joined the growing movement for [[Responsible government]] that was led by his son-in-law [[John Molteno]].&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}
==Later life==
The Cape's economy was in a severely depressed state in the 1860s, and Jarvis's vast business interests were one of the many victims of this economic stagnation. Once the leading wine merchant in the country, he eventually declared bankruptcy in 1864 and, already elderly, never completely recovered financially, even in the country's 1870s economic boom. He sold his Somerset Road house and moved in with the extended family of his son-in-law John Molteno, in Claremont. 
In later life, he took an avid interest in mining. He unsuccessfully prospected for coal in the Cape Town [[City Bowl]] area, before setting up a [[Manganese]] mining venture outside [[Paarl]].

He died at the house of his daughter Sophia St Ives Mary Alport, in [[Claremont, Cape Town]], in 1889 and was buried beside his wife at Claremont St. Saviours Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=61337|title=JARVIS Hercules Crosse 1803-1889|work=eggsa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10650">The '''Kilkenny Design Workshops''' (KDW) were a government-funded research and development centre of excellence for [[design]] (and design advocacy, research and promotion) which was established in [[Ireland]] in 1963. It was created to inspire, support and demonstrate to industry how design could be the key factor in change and lead to economic success. This was a new departure, up to this point no model had existed anywhere in the world for this type of practice. Teamwork is common today in design practices but this method was new for its time. KDW operated from the converted Ormonde Stables in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]] from its official opening in 1965 until its closure in 1988.

==History==
William H. Walsh was the founder of KDW and Chief Executive of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta (CTT) or [[Irish Export Board]]. He had a vision for improving standards of design in industry to encourage commerce, trade and export. Walsh also realised the importance of design for the Irish market and how the existing situation in Ireland in the early 1960s  (including protective tariffs) meant that a strategy would be required to encourage appreciation and promotion of good design.

Steps had been taken to ensure that the design situation in Ireland was carefully assessed. A group of selected [[Scandinavia]]n designers were commissioned to compile the ''Design in Ireland'' report (also known as ''The Scandinavian Report''), auditing the standards of design in Ireland. William H. Walsh spearheaded the establishment of Kilkenny Design Workshops, itself a revolutionary move as this was to be the first state agency established outside [[Dublin]].

The early workshops in Kilkenny were Ceramics, Candle making, Precious Metals and Metalwork Woodturning and Textiles; which comprised weaving and printed textile departments. Graphic Design was added to in 1969 and 3D work included Furniture Design. Designers also contributed to packaging production and exhibition’s design. Industrial Design and Design Consultancy services were offered to clients as the shift moved from traditional industry to engineering based production industries.

Workshops were staffed with teams of creatives; artists designers, craftspeople, apprentices, graduates and students, including technicians and chemists to assist with research and development. The management team also consisted of a creative and active board that included artists Louis le Brocquy, Pat Scott and Sir Basil Goulding.

Retail was seen as an opportunity from the early days of KDW and the KDW shop was used to sell prototypes, promote design and provide manufacturers with a working example of the business opportunities around well designed and promoted Irish products. Links were forged with buyers from American and UK retailers. KDW opened a shop in [[Ghirardelli Square|Ghiradelli Square]] in [[San Francisco]] and participated in in-store promotions in [[B. Altman and Company|Altman's]] in New York, [[Heal's]] in London and [[Neiman Marcus]] in [[Dallas]].

Design advocacy included seminars and exhibitions, the education of the designers in the workshops led to the potential for good design to spread out of the Kilkenny Graduate Programmes which refined the skills of young designers. Many of those who partook in programmes ran by KDW went on to establish their own creative enterprises or teach in design departments at second and third level in Ireland. KDW also had participation in and representation on international design organisations including the [[World Crafts Council]], the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)]] and the International Council of Design ([[Ico-D]]), formerly known as International Council of Graphic Design Associations (ICOGRADA). Later KDW itself became an inspiration and a model for design development in other countries, its legacy spread to several countries around the world interested in building up design for industry and using KDW’s example as a template for establishing this approach in their own country.

Although Kilkenny Design Workshops ceased operation in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/5999n9755|title=Kilkenny Design Workshop|last=|first=|date=|website=Digital Depository of Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; their output had transformed the visual culture of Ireland. KDW demonstrated the importance of design for efficient manufacturing processes and well designed marketing material to communicate the quality of products, it also endorsed the creation of beautiful products that could be both functional and visually appealing.

==Legacy==
In 2013, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the KDW, the Design &amp; Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI) held a conference titled "KDW@21C" that sought to investigate the continuing legacy and acknowledge the influence of the KDW on Irish design practice and culture.&lt;ref name=21C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcraftgallery.ie/kdw21C|title=KDW@21C|publisher=National Craft Gallery (Ireland)|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the conference was a "Remembering KDW" event, a reunion for former KDW participants.&lt;ref name=21C/&gt;

In 2015, the DCCoI released an [[iOS]] [[mobile app|app]] titled "Kilkenny Design Workshops" highlighting the work of the KDW.&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish Design 2015 (ID2015)===
2015 marked 50 years since KDW officially opened. To commemorate this event, the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2013 conceived of ID2015, a year-long programme celebrating the history of Irish design. ID2015 was a major government backed initiative that explored, promoted and celebrated Irish design through events and activities on the island of Ireland and in renowned international capitals of design and commerce.

The initiative sought to:
* raise the profile of Irish design, at home and abroad
* increase awareness of the value of design in all aspects of life
* build on the international reputation of Irish design
* encourage links between local and global Irish designers
* showcase the importance of design to success in business and as a driver of economic growth

The all-island initiative was convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and [[Enterprise Ireland]].  President of Ireland [[Michael D. Higgins]] was the Patron of Irish Design 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishdesign2015.ie|title=Irish Design 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of ID2015, [[Dublin]] was designated World Design Hub 2015 by the International Association of Designers, providing Ireland with a platform to promote the skills and talents of Irish designers to a worldwide audience.

The achievements and impact of ID2015 are discussed in ''Irish Design 2015 - Making Design Matter''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1906691509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485027341&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=irish+design+2015+making+design+matter&lt;/ref&gt; a book that offers a comprehensive examination of the year of Irish design. Through a series of essays by key participants in the initiative, spotlight reports on the different projects mounted throughout the year, and group discussions featuring leading Irish and international figures from the sector, ''Making Design Matter'' captures the why and the how of the landmark initiative that was Irish Design 2015 (ID2015). Edited by Professor Alex Milton, ID2015 Programme Director;&lt;ref&gt;https://alexmiltondesign.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Hennessy, CEO of ID2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dccoi.ie/about/our-team/&lt;/ref&gt; and DCCoI and Rachel Donnelly, ID2015 Content Editor, the publication takes a broad view of the design sector in Ireland, reflecting on key moments in its past, engaging with its vibrant present, and speculating about its optimistic future. The publication also presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the year's activities, alongside statistics representing the economic footprint of the design sector in Ireland. ID2015 was pioneering in its target-focused approach to making design matter, with the result that this is the first ever quantitative analysis of the impact of design activity mounted on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishdesign2015.ie/news/single/minister-mitchell-oconnor-officially-launches-report-on-irish-design-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Key outcomes of the initiative were:
* 370 newly registered design companies
* 476 designers supported to attend international design-based trade events
* 50 companies supported to undertake design training
* €24.1 million in design-based exports generated
* 28.5 million people engaged with ID2015 through exhibitions and events
* €20.1 million+ PR value generated
* 3 design accelerators launched

'''Legal Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance or "LGRC"''', refers to the complex set of processes, rules, tools and systems used by corporate legal departments to adopt, implement and monitor an integrated approach to business problems.
While [[Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance]] refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized – but similar – set of [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/ tools]&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R., Mann, G., &amp; Hobbs, V. (2017). ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition''. Paper presented in Valli, C. (Ed.).'' ''The Proceedings of 15th Australian Digital Forensics Conference 5-6 December 2017, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/techexec/2007/0507techexec1.html Musthaler, Linda and Brian. Governance, risk management and compliance and what it means to you. Network World, March 7, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments.

==Legal governance==

'''Legal governance''' refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dciginc.com/2008/01/interview-with-stephen-whetstone-pt1.html Konkle, Joshua L. Legal risk management requires a corporate strategy, mindset and commitment. DCIG,January 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal risk management==

'''Legal risk management''' refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm US Army Corps of Engineers Glossary. August 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132402/http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization’s business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization.

==Legal compliance==

'''Legal compliance''' is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103206/http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law.  Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.
The role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 Bauer, Christopher. An ethics self-exam: ethical compliances is not just an issue for external review; auditors must look inward to ensure their own integrity is not compromised. Bnet, June 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141809/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.

===Legal Consistency===

'''Legal Consistency''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. '''Legal Consistency'''  has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case  &lt;ref&gt;International Law and International Relations: An International  Organization Reader. By Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Contributor Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Edition: illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 
2007. {{ISBN|0-521-86186-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86186-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. The antonym '''Legal Inconsistency'''  is defined as having two rule that contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Legisprudence: A New Theoretical Approach to Legislation : Proceedings of the Fourth Benelux-Scandinavian Symposium on Legal Theory By Luc Wintgens Contributor Luc Wintgens Edition: illustrated Published by Hart Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|1-84113-342-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84113-342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common definitions of consistency refer to “treating  similar cases alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Law and justice in the courts of classical Athens By Adriaan Lanni Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-85759-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the enterprise context, legal consistency  refers to “obedience to the law”.&lt;ref&gt;The Measurement of Moral Judgment By Anne Colby, Lawrence Kohlberg Contributor Lawrence Kohlberg Edition: illustrated Published by CUP Archive, 1987 {{ISBN|0-521-32501-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, " Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions."&lt;ref name="WaelHassan"&gt;Hassan, Waël. PhD Thesis.  University of Ottawa. University of Ottawa Press. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Completeness===

'''Legal Completeness''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise.  In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise.

Enterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;Armour, J. Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a 
Modern Company Law. ESRC Centre for Business Research - Working Papers wp148, ESRC Centre for Business Research. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars make use of a concept of ‘obligational’ completeness such as Ayres and Gertner.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and Gertner, Robert (1992), ‘Strategic Contractual Inefficiency and the Optimal Choice of Legal Rules’, 101 Yale Law Journal 729&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to this usage, a system or a contract is ‘obligationally’ complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‘enforceability’ completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May &amp; Butcher v the King 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Cases and Materials on Contracts By S. M. Waddams, Waddams, S. M., 1942-, Waddams, Trebilcock, mccamus, Neyers, Waldron Edition: 3 Published by Emond  Montgomery Publication, 2005 {{ISBN|1-55239-166-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55239-166-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense.&lt;ref name="WaelHassan" /&gt;

==History==

Lebogang says.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110530070924/http://220.72.21.21/pub/docu/kr/AA/04/AA042007SAF/AA04-2007-SAF-001.PDF Kim, Won-Kyu. The effect of industrial restructuring policy post-financial crisis. September/October 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] act, legal industry [[thought leaders]] saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible.

==Organizations==

===Legal GRC Center for Innovation===

The Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine [[best practices]] for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a [[blog]] and several industry-specific [[white papers]] regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively.

===Institute on Governance===

The [[Institute on Governance]] (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online.
The IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting [[good governance]] into practice.

===Association of Corporate Counsel===

The [[Association of Corporate Counsel]] ("ACC"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association ("ACCA"), is an association of in-house counsel, [[Lawyer|attorneys]] who work for [[corporations]]. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States’ largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1]
The ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations – the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance – and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Sexual assault charges==
A 44-year-old maid at the [[Pierre Hotel]] on New York City's [[Upper East Side]] told authorities that on May 29, 2011, Omar called for room service, asking for a box of tissues to be delivered to his $900-a-night room.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; She said that when she delivered the tissues to his room, Omar locked his door, grabbed her in a bear hug, and began groping her breasts and kissing her on her neck and lips, squeezed her buttocks, and ground his crotch against her leg.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arabnews1"/&gt;  She said that Omar only let her leave after she agreed to give him her phone number, and that she gave him a false one.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Police said the maid reported the incident to her supervisor immediately, but that the supervisor told her to report the incident to a hotel security official the following day, and consequently the police weren't notified until the following day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  A police spokesman said that detectives found the maid to be credible.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hossam El-Kady |url=http://213.158.162.45/~egyptian/index.php?action=news&amp;id=18725&amp;title=Egyptian%20exec%20held%20in%20attack%20on%20NY%20maid |title=Egyptian exec held in attack on NY maid |publisher=The Egyptian Gazette |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelson Mandela International Day''' (or '''Mandela Day''') is an annual international day in honour of [[Nelson Mandela]], celebrated each year on 18 July, Mandela's birthday.&lt;ref name="UN18"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/ |title=Nelson Mandela International Day, July 18, For Freedom, Justice and Democracy |first= |last= |work=un.org |year=|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was officially declared by the [[United Nations]] in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/2009/64.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the first UN Mandela Day held on 18 July 2010. However, other groups began celebrating Mandela Day on 18 July 2009.

On 27 April 2009, the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concerts and the [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson Mandela Foundation]] invited the global community to join them in support of an official Mandela Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/the-nelson-mandela-foundation-and-46664-call-for-the-establishment-of-a-glo|title=The Nelson Mandela Foundation and 46664 call for the establishment of a global ‘Mandela Day’ – Nelson Mandela Foundation|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela Day is not meant as a public holiday, but as a day to honour the legacy of [[Nelson Mandela]], South Africa's former President, and his values, through [[volunteering]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref name=UN18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS138319+27-Apr-2009+PRN20090427 |title=46664 and the Nelson Mandela Foundation Call for Establishment of Global 'Mandela... |publisher=Reuters |date= 27 April 2009|accessdate=31 July 2010

Mandela Day is a global call to action that celebrates the idea that each individual has the power to [[social change|transform the world]], the ability to make an impact.

The Mandela Day campaign message is:

: "Nelson Mandela has fought for [[social justice]] for 67 years. We're asking you to start with 67 minutes."&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandeladay.com/ |title=Mandela Day |publisher=Mandela Day |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"We would be honoured if such a day can serve to bring together people around the world to [[poverty reduction|fight poverty]] and promote [[peace]], [[resolution of disputes|reconciliation]] and [[cultural diversity]]," according to a statement issued on Mandela's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8021275.stm | work=BBC News | title=World urged to mark 'Mandela Day' | date=27 April 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the first global celebration of Mandela Day on 18 July 2009, Mandela's 91st birthday, a series of educational, art exhibit, fund-raising and volunteer events leading up to a concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 18 July were organised by the 46664 concerts and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"/&gt; In November 2009, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] formally declared 18 July to be "Nelson Mandela International Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8353853.stm|title=UN gives backing to 'Mandela Day' |date=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Midtown Manhattan''' is the central portion of the [[boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. Midtown is home to some of the city's most iconic buildings, including the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], as well as the [[Rockefeller Center]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and [[Times Square]].

Midtown Manhattan is the largest [[central business district]] in the world and ranks among the most expensive pieces of real estate; [[Fifth Avenue]] in Midtown Manhattan commands the world's highest [[retail]] rents, with average annual rents at US{{convert|3,000|$/ft2|$/m2}} in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/opinion/a-plea-for-fifth-avenue.html |title=A plea for Fifth Avenue|author=Janette Sadik-Khan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and also a growing financial center.

==Location==
Geographically, the northern bound of Midtown Manhattan is commonly defined to be [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]; its southern boundary is less clear, and variously taken to be [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], or even [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]. Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east-west axis, bounded by the [[East River]] on its east and the [[Hudson River]] to its west. ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Sclar, Elliot. "midtown" in {{cite encnyc}}, p. 839&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differing demarcations of Midtown Manhattan===
The border of Midtown Manhattan is nebulous and further confused by the fact that the term "Midtown Manhattan" can be used to refer either to a district or a group of neighborhoods and districts in Manhattan:
* The area between 14th and [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Streets]] includes roughly the center of Manhattan; however, the term Midtown Manhattan can also apply to the area between 31st Street and 59th Streets, although there are still office buildings south of 31st Street.
* The "Plaza District", a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and 59th Street, from [[Third Avenue]] to [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], about a square kilometer or half a square mile.
* "Midtown South"  can refer to the part of Midtown between [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and around 42nd Street (although its northern boundary is defined differently depending on the source).
* "Midtown West" can refer to the area between 34th and 59th Streets, and between 5th and 12th Avenues.
* "Midtown East" can refer to the area between 42nd and 59th Streets, and between 5th Avenue and the East River.
* In 1982, the City of New York identified the "Manhattan Core" as the area that includes some of the City’s most populous neighborhoods, major institutions, parks and transit hubs, and the City’s primary Central Business District (CBD), defined as Manhattan below 60th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/mn_core/mncore_es.pdf |title=Manhattan core public parking study|work= |accessdate=13 September 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110540/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/mn_core/mncore_es.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Manhattan Core" includes some areas slightly further north of 86th Street in Manhattan, as well as the area below 14th Street; however, this definition is problematic because it ignores the fact that Manhattan has not one but two zones in which people do business within this area separated by a wide swath of low-rise (by New York City standards) residential development — there is Midtown (which is ''in'' Midtown Manhattan), and the Financial District, (also known simply as "Downtown" because of its location in Downtown Manhattan). In other sources these districts are referred to as separate central business districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cushwake.com/cwmbs2q11/PDF/off_us_cbd_2q11.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508231043/http://www.cushwake.com/cwmbs2q11/PDF/off_us_cbd_2q11.pdf |date=May 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Paul van der Eem''' (born 1973; [[Curaçao]]) is a [[Dutch Antillean]] [[entrepreneur]] and convicted [[drug dealer]] known for his part in the undercover television report about [[Joran van der Sloot]] that was produced by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] crime reporter [[Peter R. de Vries]].&lt;ref name="DutchNews-20080624-cocaine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/06/holloway_tapes_van_der_eem_use.php|title=Holloway tapes: Van der Eem used cocaine|publisher=DutchNews|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program set a Dutch television viewing record and renewed attention in the ongoing investigation of the 2005 disappearance of [[People of the United States|American]] student [[Natalee Holloway]] in [[Aruba]].

==Background==
Patrick van der Eem is the son of Leon van der Eem, a former operator of nine [[McDonald's]] franchises. The younger van der Eem was convicted twice on drug charges and has been blocked from entering the [[United States]] because of his criminal record. According to van der Eem in 2008, he had only received traffic tickets since his last drug offense in 1995. In 2003, van der Eem opened a [[Pirtek]] franchise which repairs hydraulic hoses. A company spokesperson stated that van der Eem's 7-person organization is the best operated in the [[Benelux]] region.&lt;ref name="NRC-20080207"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuwsthema/holloway/article1888358.ece/Patrick_van_der_Eem_mag_VS_niet_in|title=Patrick van der Eem mag VS niet in|newspaper=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Eem has a visible scar on his left cheek which he says is a "boca grande" inflicted on him by criminals in retaliation for being an [[informant]]. However, he had told his CEO Martin Melkert that the scar was the result of a car accident.&lt;ref name="RadioNetherlands-20080402-liberty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Van der Eem|first=Patrick|url=http://patrickvandereem.nl/stories/mijn-boca-grande/|title=Mijn Boca Grande|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joran van der Sloot undercover video==
[[Image:Joran van der Sloot Aruba mugshot.jpg|thumb|120px|Police photo of [[Joran van der Sloot]]]]
On February 3, 2008, [[SBS 6]] aired a program produced by de Vries in which one time Dutch suspect Joran van der Sloot discusses his knowledge of the Natalee Holloway case with van der Eem while riding in a [[Range Rover]] that contained [[hidden camera]]s. Van der Sloot is seen in the tape smoking marijuana. Van der Eem later said that he regularly used cocaine in front of van der Sloot over a seven-month period to retain his trust.&lt;ref name="DutchNews-20080624-cocaine" /&gt; The broadcast was watched by 7 million viewers in the Netherlands and was the most popular non-sports program in Dutch television history.&lt;ref name="RadioNetherlands-20080402-liberty" /&gt; Van der Eem was paid [[euro|€]]25,000 for his work on the undercover report.&lt;ref name="RadioNetherlands-20080402-reality"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sennitt|first=Andy|url=http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/features/media/080204-natalee-holloway-tv-redirected|title=When TV gets a bit too close to reality|publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608023236/http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/features/media/080204-natalee-holloway-tv-redirected|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exclusive interview with [[ABC News]], van der Eem said that he first met van der Sloot in a Dutch casino in [[Nijmegen]]. Without introduction, he said, "Hey murderer!" in [[Papiamento]], the language of Aruba, to gain van der Sloot's attention.&lt;ref name="ABC-20080204-meet"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuomo|first=Chris|author2=Francescani, Chris|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/2020/story?id=4236425|title=Meet the Man Who Got Van Der Sloot to Talk About Holloway's Disappearance|publisher=[[ABC News]]|pages=1–4|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Eem said that he was "totally convinced Joran is telling the truth" in the recordings.&lt;ref name="ABC-20080207-exclusive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuomo|first=Chris|author2=McHugh, Rich |author3=Sterns, Olivia |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/exclusive-man-van-der-sloot-tapes/story?id=4255249|title=Exclusive: Man Behind the Van der Sloot Tapes|publisher=[[ABC News]]|pages=1–2|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Eem said that ABC paid [[US Dollar|US$]]830,000 to secure the rights to broadcast the program in the United States.&lt;ref name="DutchNews-20080624-cocaine" /&gt;

Aruban prosecutor [[Hans Mos]] said that he took the "very impressive" taped account "very seriously" and that he would reopen the investigation.&lt;ref name="CNN-20080205-body"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/04/natalee.holloway.suspect/|title=Van der Sloot on video: No sleep lost over Holloway's dumped body|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday-20080204-admissible"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-04-vandersloot_N.htm/|title=Aruba prosecutor: Tape admissible|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence was deemed insufficient to warrant re-arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress van der Eem, who he believed to be a drug dealer.&lt;ref name=DutchNews-20080215-rearrest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/02/van_der_sloot_not_arrested_in.php|title=Van der Sloot not arrested in Natalee case|publisher=DutchNews|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage of van der Eem==
Early in March 2008, van der Eem himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for the Aruban television program Un Dia den Bida (One Day in Life) with John Anthony "Poentje" Castro. Van der Eem continued talking candidly, under the assumption that cameras had been turned off. Van der Eem disclosed that he had been a friend of van der Sloot for years, contradicting his statement on the de Vries program that he had just met van der Sloot in 2007. Van der Eem said that he expected to become a millionaire from his involvement in the Holloway case. He said that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body and that van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand euros to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau, van der Eem, who had signed a book deal, "was furious" after learning of the taping and "threatened" the interviewer, who sought legal advice. Castro was requested by the Aruban Justice Department to refrain from broadcasting any material that could compromise the Holloway case.
Castro himself was assassinated in front of his own home in December 2010. The police have had no success in linking this cold case to van der Eem.

In December 2008, van der Eem was arrested in [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands]] for attacking his girlfriend with a crowbar and driving erratically while evading police.&lt;ref name="DeTelegraaf-20081218"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/2821675/__Van_der_Eem_in_cel_na_mishandelen_vriendin__.html|title=Van der Eem in cel na mishandelen vriendin|newspaper=[[De Telegraaf]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to be under the influence of drugs at the time and was sentenced to 30 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="DutchNews-20090428-crowbar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2009/04/van_de_sloot_mole_beats_wife_w.php|title=Van de Sloot mole beats wife with crowbar|publisher=DutchNews|accessdate=2010-09-10|date=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
In December 2008, van der Eem was briefly arrested after being reported for the abuse of his girlfriend with a crowbar. In August 2009, he was arrested in Aruba for failing to pay his Radisson Hotel bill and threatening the personnel. It was alleged that he had also failed to pay his bill in three other 5-star hotels.  It was also reported that he was in possession of [[cocaine]]&lt;ref&gt;Patrick van der Eem opgepakt, [[SpitsNieuws]], 25 augustus 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In June 2011, van der Eem was arrested during a traffic police check on the A12 highway in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/10083724/__Van_der_Eem_ingerekend__.html Patrick van der Eem ingerekend], [[De Telegraaf]], 24 juni 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 2009 American  television show ‘Border Security USA’ S01E05, van der Eem is featured where he is refused entry into the US because of his criminal past. This episode can be viewed on You Tube.

==2013 Sentencing==
On May 3, 2013 van der Eem was sentenced by the Arnhem District Court to serve twelve months in prison. The reason for his punishment was his co-perpetration in a [[ram-raiding]] in [[Oosterbeek]] stealing ski clothing with a value of approximately 30.000 euro as well as [[handling stolen goods]] by using a stolen Volkswagen Caddy for a covert transport of the clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/detailpage.aspx?ljn=BZ9309 LJN: BZ9309, Rechtbank Arnhem, 05/720002-13], Rechtspraak.nl (3 mei 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/502822-jaar-cel-voor-patrick-van-der-eem.html Jaar cel voor Patrick van der Eem], NOS.nl (3 mei 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pershing Square''' is a small public park in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], California, one square block in size, bounded by 5th Street to the north, 6th Street to the south, Hill Street to the east, and Olive Street to the west. It lies atop a large underground [[Multistorey car park|parking garage]].

==History==
[[Image:Los Angeles, CA 1909 close-up 1.jpg|thumb|right|375px|Pershing Square, looking north, circa 1909]]

=== 19th century ===
In the 1850s, the location was used as a camp by settlers from outside the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]], which lay to the northeast around the [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles|Our Lady Queen of the Angels' church]], the [[Los Angeles Plaza]], and present-day [[Olvera Street]]. Surveyors drew the site as 10 individual plots of land, but in practicality it was a single {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel. [[Canal]]s distributing water from the [[Zanja Madre]] were adjacent. In 1866 the site was dedicated as a [[town square|public square]] by Mayor [[Cristobal Aguilar]]; it was called ''La Plaza Abaja,'' or "The Lower Plaza."&lt;ref name=LAT081807&gt;Cecilia Rasmussen, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-then19aug19,0,3563036.story The (d)evolution of a downtown landmark], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point the owner of a nearby [[Beer garden|''beergarden'']], German immigrant George "Roundhouse" Lehman, planted small native [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] trees, [[fruit tree]]s, and flowering [[shrub]]s in the park and maintained them until his death in 1882.&lt;ref name="LAT081807"/&gt;

In 1867, St. Vincent's College, present-day [[Loyola Marymount University]], was situated across the street, and so the park informally became known as '''St. Vincent's Park'''.  In 1870, it was officially named '''Los Angeles Park'''. In 1886 it was renamed '''6th Street Park''', and it redesigned with an "official park plan" by [[Frederick Eaton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laparks.org/pershingsquare "Pershing Square"]. Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. Retrieved April 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1890s it was renamed '''Central Park'''. During this period a [[bandstand]] [[pavilion]] was added for concerts and [[orator]]s. The plantings became sub-tropically lush, and the park became a shady oasis and an outdoor destination. In 1894 the park was used as the staging area for the annual crowning of the queen of 'La Fiesta de Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="LAT081807"/&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
A monument to California's twenty [[Spanish–American War]] dead was erected in 1900; it is said to be modeled after a Spanish–American War veteran, 7th California Infantry volunteer Charlie Hammond of San Francisco, and it is believed to be the oldest work of [[public art]] in Los Angeles. The [[Los Angeles City Council]] declared it a historic-cultural monument in 1990.&lt;ref name="LAT081807" /&gt;

In 1910 the park was renovated under a design by [[The Parkinsons|John Parkinson]], who later designed [[Los Angeles City Hall]] and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]]. Parkinson's design featured a three-tier fountain sculpted by Johan Caspar Lachne Gruenfeld, braced by four life-size [[concrete]] [[cherub]]s supporting a vase of cascading water.&lt;ref name="LAT081807" /&gt; In November 1918, a week after [[Armistice Day]] ended [[World War I]], the park was renamed Pershing Square, in honor of Gen. [[John J. Pershing]]. A plaque was added in his honor some four decades later.

In the 1920s and 1930s tropical plants were added to the park. In 1924, a life-size bronze of a World War I [[doughboy]], sculpted by Humberton Pedretti, was unveiled, flanked by old cannons. In 1935, a bronze [[cannon]] from the [[USS Constitution]] was added. In 1932, a statue of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was added to honor [[William Andrews Clark, Jr.]], founder of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].

=== Later 20th century ===
The park was in heavy use during [[World War II]] for rallies and recruitment. [[Post-war|After the war]], the park began to decline as commercial [[decentralization]] and [[suburbanization]] took hold in  [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], and [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]] lost importance and intensity of use.

Many of the palm trees that were excavated in the 1950s were sent to be used in the Disneyland ride The Jungle Cruise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findlocal.latimes.com/listings/pershing-square-park-los-angeles|title=Pershing Square Park|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire park was demolished and excavated in 1952 to build a three-level underground [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]]. Atop the garage, concrete was covered by a thin layer of [[soil]] with a broad expanse of [[lawn]]. Entry and exit ramps cut the square off from the sidewalks around it.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hawthorne (March 2, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-broken-la-20130303,0,56377,full.story Los Angeles' major public spaces remain broken works in progress] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Kelly Roth, a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] immigrant who had owned a [[cigar]] store across from the square, donated $30,000 for twin [[reflecting pool]] [[water feature]]s in honor of his late wife and to thank Los Angeles for the opportunities that the city provided him. The Roth fountains were designed by architect [[Stiles O. Clements]].&lt;ref name="LAT081807" /&gt;

The park continued to be neglected for safe uses. Its problems were noted during the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], with nominee and future president [[John F. Kennedy]] headquartered at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] facing the park. By the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] the park had become a serious [[eyesore]], leading the city to spend $1 million for a temporary renovation.&lt;ref name="LAT081807" /&gt;

In 1992, the park was closed for a major $14.5-million redesign and renovation by Mexican architect and landscape architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]] and U.S. [[landscape architect]] [[Laurie Olin]]. The redesigned park opened in 1994 with a 10-story purple [[bell tower|bell tower,]] [[Fountain|fountains]], and a walkway representing an [[earthquake]] [[Fault (geology)|fault line]] (by artist Barbara McCarren), concert stage, and perimeter seating.  Pavement covered almost the entire block, with copses of trees placed in raised planters.&lt;ref name="LAT081807" /&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2000, a monument was installed to honor local veteran [[Eugene A. Obregon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/05/local/me-16107 Veterans Win OK of Statue to Honor Latino War Hero - Los Angeles Times. accessed 7/27/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Pershing Square fountain, LA, CA, jjron 22.03.2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The current Pershing Square designed by [[Ricardo Legorreta]] in 1992, with the fountain and bell tower]]
Pershing Square regularly hosts seasonal events such as a temporary [[Ice rink]] in the winter and live concert performances in the summer.

'''Public relations''' ('''PR''') is the practice of managing the spread of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grunig|first1=James E|last2=Hunt|first2=Todd|title=Managing Public Relations|location=Orlando, FL|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1984|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seitel|first=Fraser P.|title=The Practice of Public Relations. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|year= 2007|edition= 10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates it from [[advertising]] as a form of [[marketing communications]]. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than [[marketing]] or advertising. But now advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306758|title=#10 Important Trends in PR that You Can't Afford to Ignore|last=Singh|first=Honey|date=2017-12-29|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What You Need to Get a Job in Public Relations After College - AfterCollege|url = http://blog.aftercollege.com/2014/need-get-job-public-relations-college/#sthash.m6uq8xLi.dpuf|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its [[leadership]], products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, [[businesses]] and [[companies]], [[government]], and [[official|public officials]] as [[public information officer|PIOs]] and [[nongovernmental organizations]], and [[nonprofit organizations]]. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Career Overview: Public Relations - Wetfeet.com|url = https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|accessdate = 2015-09-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929184702/https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|archive-date = 29 September 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation's target [[audience]], the [[mass media|media]], relevant trade media, and other [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]]. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing [[press release|news releases]] and other content for [[news]], working with the [[News media|press]], arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing [[speech]]es for company leaders, acting as an organisation's [[spokesperson]], preparing clients for [[press conferences]], media interviews and speeches, writing [[website]] and [[social media]] content, managing company reputation ([[crisis management]]), managing [[internal communications]],  and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Rubel|first= Gina F.|title= Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers|location=Doylestown, PA|edition=  1st|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9801719-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Roos, Dave.

== Definitions ==
[[Ivy Lee]], the man who turned around the [[Rockefeller]] name and image, and his friend, [[Edward Bernays|Edward Louis Bernays]], established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows: "a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdhyJ_n1HFkC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=a+management+function,+which+tabulates+public+attitudes,+defines+the+policies,+procedures+and+interests+of+an+organization...+followed+by+executing+a+program+of+action+to+earn+public+understanding+and+acceptance.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tyoaqRfdcA&amp;sig=fyUEmNuDbztwXb891AgOkadYm3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71fbm2fTRAhVDylQKHajTAggQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20management%20function,%20which%20tabulates%20public%20attitudes,%20defines%20the%20policies,%20procedures%20and%20interests%20of%20an%20organization...%20followed%20by%20executing%20a%20program%20of%20action%20to%20earn%20public%20understanding%20and%20acceptance.&amp;f=false|title=PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences|last=Breakenridge|first=Deirdre|date=2008-03-26|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780132703970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the [[United Transit Commission]], he said "I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do."&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be "disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field."&lt;ref name="twoway"&gt;{{cite book

According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "The New Propagandists," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as &lt;blockquote&gt;"the art and [[social science]] of analyzing [[fad|trends]], predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the [[public interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jensen Zhao. Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd. Ed. Retrieved from  [https://archive.is/20120713012953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5209/is_1999/ai_n19125848/ findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Public Relations Society of America]], a professional trade association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-470-14492-3|title=Special Events: The Roots and Wings of Celebration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yxPHPj5CPMC&amp;pg=PA436}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined public relations in 1982 as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145356/http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-04|title=PRSA's Old Definition of Public Relations|first=Keith|last=Trivitt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/public-relations-a-topic-that-is-tricky-to-define.html |author= Stuart Elliot| title=Public Relations Defined, After an Energetic Public Discussion|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing [[communication]] between an organization and its publics.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. Public relations is what you do with what you know and what other think about what you say.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations is to speak out its advocacy  in public, and it builds up a talking platform to achieve its goals and protect the interests of people.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CPRS|title=CPRS {{!}} What is Public Relations?|url=http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|website=www.cprs.ca|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417072546/http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of public relations}}
Public relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. However, academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations, during the settling of the [[New World]] and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the [[United Kingdom]] for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.

Propaganda was used by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars, which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

== Occupational Prospective ==
Public relations specialist is a job with potential as this specific sector is gauged to increase by 9% from 2016 to 2026, especially as social media usage increases and the need to react quickly after crises occur to continue to create and maintain a favorable public image for the organization they represent. Each sector, state, and job is paid and utilized differently which is why the United States Department of Labor broke down national estimates at each level for people to get a better idea of the job outlooks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes273031.htm|title=Public Relations Specialists|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==
Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as "discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing [[rhetorical]] strategies to achieve managerial aims."&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2 September 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific public relations disciplines include:
* Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy
* [[Consumer]]/[[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service
* [[Crisis communication]] – responding in a crisis
* [[Internal communications]] – communicating within the company itself
* [[Government relations]] – engaging government departments to influence public policy
* [[Media relations]] – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.
*Celebrity public relations− promotion of a celebrity to various media publications and outlets 
*In-house public relations – maintaining communication between entertainment networks/production companies and the media
* Food-centric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods, beverages and wine.

Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Phillips|year=2006|title=Towards relationship management: Public relations at the core of organizational development|journal=Journal of Communication Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) [http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/Chapter.aspx?TitleId=36662 Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital]. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.

Within each discipline, typical activities include [[pseudo-event|publicity events]], speaking opportunities, [[press releases]], [[newsletters]], [[blog]]s, [[social media]], press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.

=== Audience targeting ===
A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the [[target audience]] and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Target audience|title=Key concepts in public relations|page=227|first1=Bob|last1=Franklin|first2=Mike|last2=Hogan|first3=Quentin|last3=Langley|first4=Nick|last4=Mosdell|first5=Elliot|last5=Pill|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2318-7|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ronald D. Strategic Planning for Public Relations. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Stakeholder Approach Revisited|first=R Edward|last=Freeman|year=2004|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag|volume=5|issue=3|journal=Zeitschrift für Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the [[charitable organization|charity]] and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Mark. "Climate Change and Public Relations." StarTribune.com: News, Weather, Sports from Minneapolis, St. Paul and Minnesota. Livefyre, 11 Aug. 2014. Web. 25 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Publics in Public Relations ===
The public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:

-'''''Traditional Publics''''': Groups with which you have an on-going and long term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660088137|title=Public relations : a values-driven approach|last=David.|first=Guth,|date=2012|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|others=Marsh, Charles, 1955-|isbn=9780205811809|edition= 5th|location=Boston|oclc=660088137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-'''''Non-Traditional Publics''''': Groups that are typically unfamiliar with your organization and you have not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Latent Publics''''': A group whose values have come into contact with the values of your organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Aware Publics''''': A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.

-'''''Intervening Publics''''': Any public that helps you send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Primary Publics:''''' If a public can directly affect your organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Secondary Publics''''': Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Internal Publics''''': People within your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''External Publics''''': People outside of your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Domestic Publics''''': Those within your country&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''-International Publics''''': Those outside of your country and when communicating with this publics you must be weary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Messaging ===
Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.

=== Social media marketing ===
{{Main|Digital marketing}}
Digital marketing is the use of [[Internet]] tools and technologies such as [[search engines]], Web 2.0 social bookmarking, [[new media]] relations, [[blogging]], and [[social media marketing]]. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.

PR practitioners have always relied on the media  such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that "Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place".&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., &amp; Kelly, K. (2009). New media: A critical introduction. (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
PR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before. For instance, cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another. They are also used for online shopping, dating, learning and getting the most up to date news around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, D. (2009). Grown up digital: How the net generation is changing your world. New York: McGraw hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. 
# ''Engagement'': Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments). 
# ''Impressions'': Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.
# ''Items'': Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.
# ''Mentions'': Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.
# ''Reach'': Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/BusinessCase/MeasurementStandarization/#.VdZtN1WrTmE|title=PR Measurement Standardization: Moving Toward Industry Agreement: PRSA|first=Arthur|last=Yann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other techniques ===
[[Litigation public relations]] is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

== Ethics ==
Public relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"&gt;Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein, " Introduction: Towards a Definitional Framework for Responsible Advocacy," in Ethics in Public Relations, Responsible Advocacy, ed. Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein (USA: Sage Publications, Inc. 2006), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics "advocacy" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"/&gt;

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.&lt;ref name="Marshall2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Tim|title=Ethics – Who needs them?|journal=Journal of Communication Management|volume=7|issue=2|year=2002|pages=107–112|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540310807313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]], the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]]'s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|title = Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?| journal=Journal of Communication Management| volume=9| pages=56–64|year = 2005|last1 = Tobin|first1 = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kermani, Faiz and Alan Needham. Marketing and Public Relations. Marlow: Institute of Clinical Research, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Scott|last=Cutlip|author-link=Scott Cutlip|year=1994|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1464-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Relation Code of Ethics: ===
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

'''''Advocacy''''': Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.

'''''Honesty''''': Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.

'''''Expertise''''': To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research, and education. Meanwhile professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.

'''''Independence''''': Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.

'''''Loyalty''''': Stay devoted to your client while remembering you have a duty to still serve the public interest.

'''''Fairness''''': Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media, and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/|title=Code of Ethics - Public Relations Society of America|work=Public Relations Society of America|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spin ===
{{Main|Spin (public relations)}}
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a "polishing of the truth."&lt;ref name="Safire96"/&gt; Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spin|title=spin|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Safire96"&gt;Safire, William
(1996) [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html?scp=19&amp;sq=spin%20definition&amp;st=cse ''The Spinner Spun'']&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donhalepr.com/?p=163 Spin Doctor a Derogatory Term That Needs to Go, Dilenschneider Says]. Don Hale PR. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.prnewswire.com/2012/02/17/dear-gracie-is-flack-a-four-letter-word/ Dear Gracie: Is ‘Flack’ a Four-Letter Word? | Beyond PR]. Blog.prnewswire.com (2012-02-17). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called "spin doctors."

In Stuart Ewen’s ''PR! A Social History of Spin'', he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.&lt;ref&gt;W. Timothy Coombs and Sherry J. Holladay, "Does Society Need Public Relations? Criticisms of Public Relations" in It’s Not Just PR: Public Relations in Society, (Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ([[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]), the so-called "[[non-denial denial]]," phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, [[euphemism]]s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

=== Negative ===
{{see also|Negative campaigning}}
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing "Black PR", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or [[corporate identity]]. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on [[IT security]], [[industrial espionage]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], and [[competitive intelligence]]. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, Martin P. (22 Aug. 1996). Negative Campaign Advertising: Demobilizer or Mobilizer. eScholarship Repository. UC Irvine, Department of Politics and Society. Retrieved on 29 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bike, William S.

Public relations are frequently just recycled information used by a plethora of sources, thus giving way to minimal perspectives regarding events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uk-engage.org/2013/08/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-a-proportional-representation-pr-electoral-system/|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of A PR Electoral System {{!}} UK Engage|website=www.uk-engage.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04|date=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and civil society ===
In ''Propaganda'' (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/EdwardLBernays-Propaganda Edward Bernays ''Propaganda'' (1928) p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In public relations, [[lobby groups]] are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or [[public opinion]], typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.

In fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a [[front group]].&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, ''Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect'', Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Front groups are a form of [[astroturfing]], because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.

Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies, and even personalities to their best advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Record: Politics, Politicians and Power|first=Laurie|last=Oakes|page=191|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Australia|isbn=978-0-7336-2700-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8597">'''Pyrosequencing''' is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] (determining the order of [[nucleotides]] in DNA) based on the "sequencing by synthesis" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a [[DNA polymerase]]. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when [[pyrophosphate]] is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.

The principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Nyren, Petersson and Uhlen (1993) “Solid Phase DNA Minisequencing by an Enzymatic Luminometric Inorganic Pyrophosphate Detection Assay” Analytical Biochemistry 208 (1), 171-175, https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1993.1024&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A8081&amp;dswid=3295#sthash.08HyBugr.dpbs Bertil Pettersson], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]] by combining the [[solid phase sequencing]] method&lt;ref&gt;Uhlen (1989) ”Magnetic separation of DNA”  Nature 340: 733-4, https://doi.org/10.1038/340733a0&lt;/ref&gt; using [[streptavidin]] coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the [[Luciferase|firefly luciferase]] enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;Nyren and Lundin (1985) “Enzymatic method for continuous monitoring of inorganic pyrophosphate synthesis” Analytiocal Biochemistry 151 (2): 504-509.  https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(85)90211-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixture of three [[enzyme]]s ([[DNA polymerase]], [[Sulfate adenylyltransferase|ATP sulfurylase]] and firefly [[luciferase]]) and a nucleotide ([[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTP]]) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.

A second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Ronaghi, Uhlén and Nyrén (1998) ”A sequenbcing method based on real-time pyrophosphate” Science. 281 (5375): 363. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.363  .&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mostafa Ronaghi]], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]]. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme [[apyrase]] is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the [[DNA polymerase]], the [[luciferase]] and the [[apyrase]] to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.

A third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Marguiles et al (2005) “Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors” Nature 437, 376-380.  https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature03959;&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] and co-workers at the company [[454 Life Sciences]]. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[microarray]]. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in [[genomics]] research, with rapidly falling prices for [[DNA sequencing]] allowing [[whole genome sequencing]] at affordable prices.

==Procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QIAGEN|title=Pyrosequencing Technology and Platform Overview|url=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/technologies/pyrosequencing-resource-center/technology-overview/|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[File:How Pyrosequencing Works.svg|alt=How Pyrosequencing Works|thumb|679x679px|The chart shows how pyrosequencing works.]]
"Sequencing by synthesis" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of [[DNA polymerase]] (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another [[chemiluminescence|chemoluminescent]] [[enzyme]].  Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of [[DNA]] by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step.  The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T [[nucleotides]] are sequentially added and removed from the reaction.  Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template.  The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.

For the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA ([[ssDNA#ssDNA|ssDNA]]) template is hybridized to a sequencing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] and incubated with the enzymes [[DNA polymerase]], [[ATP sulfurylase]], [[luciferase]] and [[apyrase]], and with the substrates [[adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate]] (APS) and [[luciferin]].
# The addition of one of the four [[deoxynucleotide triphosphate]]s ([[dNTP]]s) (dATPαS, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi).
# ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program.
# Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the [[apyrase]], and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.

==Limitations==

Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|chain termination]] methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing).  This can make the process of [[genome assembly]] more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of [[repetitive DNA]]. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.

==Commercialization==

The company '''Pyrosequencing AB''' in [[Uppsala, Sweden]] was founded with [[venture capital]] provided by [[HealthCap]] in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 1999. It was renamed to [http://www.biotage.com Biotage] in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by [[Qiagen]] in 2008.  Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to [[454 Life Sciences]]. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|large-scale DNA sequencing]], including [[genome project|genome sequencing]] and [[metagenomics]].

[[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollmer|first1=Mark|title=Roche to close 454 Life Sciences as it reduces gene sequencing focus |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/roche-to-close-454-life-sciences-as-it-reduces-gene-sequencing-focus|work=Fierce Biotech|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Redick Tower''', operated since 2011 as '''Hotel Deco XV''', is an eleven-story building located at 1504 Harney Street in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  The building is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The building was designed in the [[Art Deco]] style by Omaha architect Joseph G. McArthur.  It was named after the Redick family, who had been among Omaha's pioneer settlers, arriving in 1856, and who had owned the land on which the building was constructed.  As designed, it housed commercial storefront space on the first floor, indoor parking and garage facilities for up to 500 cars on the lower seven floors, and office space in the tower above the parking levels.&lt;ref name=decohistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

The Redick Tower was built for Garrett and Agor, Inc., which managed it until the mid-1930s, when it was purchased by the Redick Tower Corporation.  In 1943, it was bought by Omaha investor Walter Duda, who held it until 1973, when it was acquired by the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]-based Parking Corporation of America.  It was subsequently operated as a [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] "considered among Omaha's best"&lt;ref name=swank/&gt; and then as the [[Best Western]] Redick Plaza Hotel until it closed in 2009.  In 2010, it was purchased by the White Lotus Group, which opened it in the following year as the Hotel Deco XV.&lt;ref name=decohistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=swank/&gt;

In 1984, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name=moresites/&gt;  Its historic significance was attributed to its original multifunctional urban design, combining retail, office, and parking space in a single building; and to its being "one of Nebraska's premier examples" of the Art Deco style.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">'''Rex Wesley Heslop''', (1905 – September 30, 1973) was a [[Canadian]] businessman noted for being a land developer and residential real estate developer.

==Biography==
===Early years===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Heslop was born on a farm in present-day Northern [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]]. The property would have been located North of the 401 and East of Islington Avenue—note that neither road existed in 1905.

He worked with his father in the family construction business before moving to [[Detroit]] to seek opportunity. In Detroit, he drove a cab for a time; then he became a new car salesman.  After his tenure in Detroit, he went to Northern Ontario, working in the mines, until he was injured in a rock slide at which point he moved back to [[Toronto]] to work in construction.

Heslop was married and had two children.

===Early Southern Etobicoke Developments===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Heslop returned to Toronto.  There was a major housing shortage with the veterans coming home from WW2. About 1947-48, he acquired a small piece of land on the southeast corner of Foch and Horner Ave. across from Sir Adam Beck Public School.  On this property, he built three houses using a precast concrete wall system.  They sold immediately.

About 1949, he purchased the west half of a farm on the north side of Horner Ave., west of, but not connected to Brown's Line. It was subdivided into lots approximately 40 feet by 140 feet in size, and in five locations he designed L-shaped the streets. He built a mixture of homes, brick and precast concrete, bungalows and story-and-halfs, two, three and four bedrooms.  It was very rare for the Toronto area at that time to find a subdivision that was not on perfectly straight streets and where all the houses were not identical to each other. Street names were all English locations like Chelsea Dr., Fulham Dr., Norfolk Dr., etc., except for one street called Heslop Dr.

From the major success of that development, Heslop moved on by buying the east half of the same farm, including the old farmhouse (renovated and located on east side of Radlett Ave.).  He repeated the development formula of the first phase, incorporating three more L-shaped streets, but no longer offering the four-bedroom house models.  A couple of streets now connected both subdivisions to Brown's Line.  The longest north-south street is called Delma Dr., his wife's first name.

Land from both subdivisions was incorporated into one large park, bounded by Delma, Mitcham, Fulham and Eltham that Heslop gave to Etobicoke.  Later, the municipality sectioned off the most easterly part of that park and sold it to Alderwood United Church for their new building in the early 1950s.

===Creating Rexdale, Ontario===
In 1955 Heslop purchased farmland again, this time in the northern part of Etobicoke known at the time as Thistletown for a cost of $110,000.  Water mains, streets and sewers were constructed, as well as houses which were listed for sale at either $9,000 or $10,000.  The homes sold well, and soon 330 families were living in the development named "[[Rexdale]]".  In 1956, Heslop opened the Rexdale Shopping Centre (now Rexdale Mall).  By then, 70 industries and 3,600 homes were located in Rexdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Mike Filey | last =Filey | first = Mike | title = Toronto Sketches 9: "The Way We Were" Columns from the Toronto Sunday Sun | publisher = Dundurn | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8PxmBXTDDFsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the Delrex subdivision in Georgetown===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Heslop, the developer of Rexdale in Etobicoke, had purchased several farms on [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]]'s eastern boundary in 1954. By 1958, he and his wife Delma and their two children - Marilyn and Rex Jr. - had moved into their brand new spacious home on Heslop Court.

Heslop then tried a similar venture to Rexdale, but this time in Georgetown by creating another subdivision, this one called Delrex. He ran into political problems and tired of name-calling and in-fighting, sold his interest and retired at the age of 61.

===Legacy===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Rexdale, Ontario and the Delrex subdivision (area south of Highway 7 between Maple Avenue and Mountainview Road South) of Georgetown, Ontario are named after him. Various streets in Delrex named after him and his family (i.e. Rexway Drive, Heslop Court, Delrex Boulevard, Marilyn Crescent), and founded a line of Rex Heslops which currently ends with RCN sailor Rex Heslop III.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13629">'''SME finance'''  is the funding of small and medium-sized enterprises, and represents a major function of the general business finance market – in which capital for different types of firms are supplied, acquired, and costed or priced. Capital is supplied through the business finance market in the form of bank loans and overdrafts; leasing and hire-purchase arrangements; equity/corporate bond issues; venture capital or [[private equity]]; asset-based finance such as factoring and invoice discounting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business Finance Market: A Survey|publisher= Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester UK, 3rd. revised edition 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGFzFMMcd-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=business+finance+market+-+survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and government funding in the form of grants or loans. 

However, not all business finance is external/commercially supplied through the market. Much finance is internally generated by businesses out of their own earnings and/or supplied informally as [[trade credit]], that is, delays in paying for purchases of goods and services.

== Importance ==
The economic and banking importance of the [[small and medium enterprise]] (SME) sector is well recognized in academic and policy literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/indust/sme/foreignt.htm |title=SMEs – Their role in foreign trade |accessdate=2007-06-28 |author=UN/ECE Secretariat |work=www.unece.org |publisher=[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UN/ECE) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/TylersPaperonSMEs.pdf |title=Is small beautiful and worthy of subsidy |accessdate=2008-05-30 |author=Tyler Biggs |work=www.unece.org |publisher=[[World Bank]] (UN/ECE) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also acknowledged that these actors in the economy may be under-served, especially in terms of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/16/37818320.pdf |title=OECD-APEC Keynote Paper on Removing Barriers to SME Access to International Markets |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-28 |work=www.oecd.org |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to significant debate on the best methods to serve this sector.

{{prose|section|date=November 2017}}
Although there have been numerous schemes and programmes in different [[economic]] environments, there are a number of distinctive recurring approaches to SME [[finance]].&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from: {{cite web  |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/3795.html |title=A More Complete Conceptual Framework for SME Finance |first=A. |last=Berger |author2=G. Udell  |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Collateral (finance)|Collateral]] based lending offered by traditional banks and finance companies is usually made up of a combination of [[asset-based lending|asset-based finance]], contribution based finance, and [[factoring (finance)|factoring]] based finance, using reliable debtors or contracts.
* Information based lending usually incorporates financial statement lending, [[credit score|credit scoring]], and relationship lending.
* Viability based financing is especially associated with [[venture capitalists|venture capital]].
* Reliable for all the small ticket loan {{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=this is not an "approach"}}
* The entity type not depending on the valUe of the business.{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=this is not an "approach"}}

== Gap ==
A substantial portion of the SME sector may not have the security required for conventional collateral based bank lending, nor high enough returns to attract formal venture capitalists and other risk investors. In addition, markets may be characterized by deficient information (limiting the effectiveness of financial statement-based lending and credit scoring). This has led to claims of an "SME finance gap" or [[Nano gap]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equicapita.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Equicapita_May_050214.pdf Equicapita - Who Will Buy Boomer SMEs?]&lt;/ref&gt;– particularly in [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/features/view_feature.php?theme=5&amp;fid=69 |title=THE ROLE OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES IN THE FUTURES OF EMERGING ECONOMIES |accessdate=2008-05-19 |last=Newberry |first=Derek |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a workshop hosted by The Network for Governance, Entrepreneurship &amp; Development (GE&amp;D) in Geneva in July 2008, SMEs that fall into this category have been defined as Small Growing Businesses (SGBs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d-geneva.com/governance/governance.htm |title=GE&amp;D |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been at least two distinctive approaches to try to overcome the so-called SME finance gap.

The first has been to broaden the collateral based approach by encouraging bank lenders to finance SMEs with insufficient collateral. This might be done through an external party providing the collateral or guarantees required. Unfortunately, such schemes are counter to basic [[free market]] principles, and they tend to be unsustainable. This sector is increasingly called the [[meso finance|Meso-finance]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/features/view_feature.php?theme=5&amp;fid=69 |title=Meso-Finance |accessdate=2008-05-30 |last=Sanders |first=Thierry |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are no evidence of any significant structural barriers to the supply of bank or private equity finance to suitable SME applicants on mutually satisfactory terms and conditions in Britain. The main obstacles to funding here appear to be on the demand rather than the supply side of the business finance market. This is mainly in the form of:

* Lack of satisfactory business plans, accounting and other information;
* Inadequate assets for use as security; and,
* Insufficiently high levels of profitability, gearing, liquidity, stability, and other business-financial performance criteria on the part of funding applicants.&lt;ref&gt;''The Business Finance Market: A Survey'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, op.cit., page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the second approach has been to broaden the viability based approach. Since the viability based approach is concerned with the business itself, the aim has been to provide better general business development assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enterprise-impact.org.uk/pdf/Kamanyi.pdf |title=Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Development Assistance, Gender and Enterprise Development Impact Assessment: The Case of Uganda |accessdate=2007-06-28 |last=Kamanyi |first=Judy |year=2003 |format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025317/http://www.enterprise-impact.org.uk/pdf/Kamanyi.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce risk and increase returns. This often entails a detailed review and assistance with the [[business plan]].

A common aim or feature of the viability based approach is the provision of appropriate finance that is tailored to the [[cash flow]]s of the SME.

Although the returns generated by this approach in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] may not be attractive to venture capitalists, they can be significantly better than conventional collateral based lending – whilst at the same time being less risky than the typical venture capitalist business. Thus, a new, distinct asset class, offering a new avenue for diversification, is available to investors. With higher profitability than traditional SME finance and lower risk than traditional venture capital, this sector has been named the "growth finance sector".

In the past, a significant obstacle to applying this approach in less developed countries has been getting the information required to assess viability, plus the costs of transferring and providing [[business development]] assistance. However, in the last several years, improved information and communications technology have made the process easier and cheaper. As technology and information sharing continue to improve, the approach could become significantly more cost-effective and attractive to established financiers with viability based approaches, and to consultants providing business development assistance to SMEs in other, more mainstream areas.

Some investors have promoted this approach as a means of achieving wider social benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shellfoundation.org/index.php?menuID=25&amp;smenuID=25&amp;bmenuID=48&amp;newsID=222 |title=Social impact model Enterprise Solutions to Poverty |accessdate=2007-06-28 |last=Hoffman |first=Kurt |author2=Chris West |author3=Karen Westley |author4=Sharna Jarvis  |date=March 2005 |publisher=Shell Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been interested in developing it largely in order to generate better financial-economic returns for shareholders, investors, employees, and clients.

A new organisation, Aspen Network for Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.4204037/k.2587/Aspen_Network_of_Development_Entrepreneurs.htm |title=ANDE |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620133359/http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.4204037/k.2587/Aspen_Network_of_Development_Entrepreneurs.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created to bring the growth finance stakeholders together, with the view to evolve into an association serving the sector, similar to what venture capital or microfinance associations do. They have declared their target audience to be Small Growing Businesses.

In 2008, a group of financial service providers and other stakeholders came together to form the [[Financial Alliance for Sustainable Trade|Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade]] (FAST). FAST is an association of financial service providers explicitly committed to improving [[access to finance]] for sustainable SMEs—defined as SMEs that are compliant with one or more of a host of growing sustainability standards (such as organics, fair trade, forest stewardship council etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2007/trade_price_alt_trade.pdf|format=PDf|last=Potts|first= Jason |year=2007|title= Alternative trade initiatives and income predictability: Theory and evidence from the coffee sector|website=www.iisd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The management of business lending ==

The effective management of lending to SMEs can contribute significantly to the overall growth and profitability of banks. There has been considerable research and analysis into the methods by which banks assess and monitor business loans, manage business financing risks, and price their products – and how these methods might be further developed and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDsx9Omyh0gC&amp;dq=isbn:0906321182|title=The Management of Business Lending: A Survey|first=Industrial Systems|last=Research|date=9 November 2017|publisher=Industrial Systems Research|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There has been particularly intensive scrutiny of the kinds of business financial information that banks use in making lending decisions, and how reliable that information actually is.

Banks have traditionally relied on a combination of documentary sources of information, interviews and visits, and the personal knowledge and expertise of managers in assessing and [[Business Transaction Management|monitoring]] business loans. However, when assessing comparatively small and straightforward business credit applications, banks may largely rely on standardized credit scoring techniques (quantifying such things as the characteristics, assets, and cash flows of businesses/owners). Using such techniques – and also centralizing or rationalizing business-banking operations generally – can significantly reduce processing costs. Standardized computer-based assessment may also be more accurate and fairer than reliance on the personal judgments of local bank managers.  As a result, banks may now be able to offer more loans, faster and in larger amounts, and reduce previously high security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/gfm.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/SMEBankingGuidebook/$FILE/SMEBankingGuide2009.pdf|title="The IFC SME Banking Knowledge Guide, 2009"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, business lending as a whole is substantially more diverse and complex than personal and residential mortgage lending. This, coupled with the large size and inherently risky nature of many business loans, tend to limit the scope and desirability of computerized credit scoring in assessment and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;''The Management of Business Lending: A Survey'', ISR/Google Books, 2002, page 39.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Government make available funding for small and medium sized enterprises in order to help them reduce resource usage (in particular energy) and lessen carbon impacts. The Scottish Government SME Loan Fund is unsecured and interest free (loans for renewable technologies are charged at 5% due to the Renewable Heat Incentive.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Sharon Lechter has co-authored over a dozen different books under the Rich Dad brand with [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and coordinated or edited another 10 with the Rich Dad companies. She is one of three founding partners of the series of companies that fall under the Rich Dad [[brand]] with [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and [[Kim Kiyosaki]]. [[Robert Kiyosaki]] once said of Sharon Lechter that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“Sharon is one of the few natural entrepreneurs I have ever met. In The Rich Dad Company, I am the horn and Sharon is the engine."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookjive.com/wiki/Sharon_Lechter Sharon Lechter - BookJive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She claims to be the co-[[inventor]] of the Cashflow for Kids board game and spearheaded the launch of Rich Dad's interactive Web site for kids. However, the companies' most well-known work is their very first book and the #1 ''New York Times'' bestseller ''[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]''.

In 2012, Robert Kiyosaki is re-releasing all Rich Dad books, removing Sharon Lechter's name as co-author and putting his picture on all covers.

===Rich Dad, Poor Dad===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Richdadpoordad.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
;''Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money—That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! (2000)''
{{Main|Rich Dad, Poor Dad}}

Originally self-published by TechPress, Inc. before being picked up by [[Warner Books]] and becoming a [[bestseller]], the story line follows [[anecdotal]] advice and lessons [[Robert Kiyosaki]] learned from his "two fathers" growing up in [[Hawaii]]. Robert's "rich dad" (his best friend's father) and his "poor dad" (his biological father) offer very different advice on how to live his life and earn a living. The anecdotal comparison of his "rich dad" and "poor dad" provide the basis for the book and later brand. His "poor dad" was the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of the [[Hawaii State Department of Education]] and a well-educated man. However, [[Kiyosaki]] demonstrates that because he followed the traditional path of "get a good education to get a good job" he was constantly in [[debt]] later in life and had very little real [[net worth]]. In opposition to this is his "rich dad" who never even finished the 8th grade but became "the richest man in Hawaii" by investing his smaller [[income]] in a few good money producing investments. ''[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]'' is designed to challenge the way in which most people view money and how to make money work for you, instead of working for your money.

The rest of the Rich Dad books enforce these basic principles and ideas but elaborate on them within specific groups, time frames or opportunities.

===Cashflow for Kids===
Lechter takes credit for adapting Rich Dad's Cashflow 101 [[board game]] for children. Cashflow for Kids, designed for children ages 5 to 9, aims to teach the very basic principles and concepts of [[investing]] and making [[money]].

The game is broken into two stages, the "rat race" and "the fast track." Kids must first raise their [[income]] above their [[expenses]] before they can escape the first stage of the game. In the second stage they must achieve the "dream" goal of $50,000 in monthly [[cash flow]] with the first to reach this goal declared the winner.

Kids learn hands on and by themselves how to invest and the difference between an [[asset]] and a [[liability (accounting)|liability]]. In place of "score cards" there are financial statements. Kids can see first hand what their money is going into.

===Lawsuit===
On October 12, 2007, Sharon Lechter filed suit against ''[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]'' co-author [[Robert Kiyosaki]] in Clark County, NV (Civil Case # 07-A-549886-C). On September 4, 2008 the Lechters and Kiyosakis reached a settlement in their lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/09/04/20080904biz-richdad0904.html The Arizona Republic - 'Rich Dad' partners settle, call it quits]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Rich Dad Philosophy ==

The main goal of [[Kiyosaki]]'s anecdotal lessons in the Rich Dad series of books is to create financially literate and aware persons who can support themselves on their [[investment]]s alone, rather than running the "rat race" and living paycheck to paycheck. To do this they advocate investments such as [[real estate]] and [[small businesses]]. They clearly define the difference between an [[asset]] and a [[liability (accounting)|liability]]. Kiyosaki defines "[[assets]]" as things that generate money, such as rental properties or businesses and "[[liability (accounting)|liabilities]]" as things that cost money, such as house payments, cars and so on. Financial [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] is also a key component towards becoming rich. Lechter advocates learning to take existing [[infrastructure]]s and systems and applying them to your project.

Lechter stresses what she calls "financial literacy" as the means to obtaining wealth. She says that life skills are often best learned through experience and that there are important lessons not taught in school.

Lechter and [[Kiyosaki]] speak often of what they call "The Cashflow Quadrant," a conceptual tool that aims to describe how all the money in the world is earned. Depicted in a diagram, this concept entails four groupings, split with two lines (one vertical and one horizontal). In each of the four groups there is a letter representing a way in which an individual may earn income. The letters are as follows. 
*'''E:''' [[Employee]] &amp;mdash; Working for someone else
*'''S:''' [[Self-employed]] or [[Small Business|Small business owner]] &amp;mdash; Where a person owns his own job and is his own boss.
*'''B:''' [[Business|Business owner]] &amp;mdash; Where a person owns a "system" of making money, rather than a job to make money.
*'''I:''' [[Investor]] &amp;mdash; Spending money in order to receive a larger payout in return.

For those on the left side of the divide ("E" and "S"), Lechter and [[Kiyosaki]] say that they may never obtain true wealth. Conversely, those on the right side of the divide ("B" and "I") are supposedly following the road to true wealth.

Sharon Lechter's true passion is [[financial literacy]], especially for woman in business, children and families. During her time at the Rich Dad companies she worked to advance and develop a variety of media for children and teens including; Rich Dad, Poor Dad for ''Teens'', [http://richkidsmartkid.com/ Rich Kid Smart Kid Web site] and the board game Cashflow for Kids.

In January, 2008, Sharon Lechter was appointed to the President's Council on Financial Literacy&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080122-6.html Personnel Announcement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in a ceremony held in the Roosevelt room at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Lechter and the council, composed of 19 members from the [[business]], [[faith]] and [[non-profit]] communities work to shape the course for a financially literate nation. The council is charged to gather information about financial literacy and its condition in the U.S., recommend improvements to national [[policies]] to the [[President of the United States|President]] and the [[Treasury]] secretary and "assist the American people in understanding and addressing financial matters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080122-1.html Executive Order: Establishing the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“We want people to own assets; we want people to be able to manage their assets,” said President Bush in his remarks. “We want people to understand basic financial concepts, and how credit cards work and how credit scores affect you, how you can benefit from a savings account or a bank account. That's what we want. And this group of citizens has taken the lead, and I thank them.”''&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080122-7.html President Bush Announces President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Members of the council include;

*[[Charles R. Schwab]], of California, and upon appointment, Designate Chair;
*John Bryant, of California, and upon appointment, Designate Vice Chair;
*Theodore Beck, of Colorado;
*Theodore R. Daniels, of Maryland;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36044">'''Stress management''' is a wide spectrum of techniques and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapies]] aimed at controlling a person's level of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], especially [[chronic stress]], usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or [[distress (medicine)|distress]] in the terminology advocated by [[Hans Selye]], rather than what he calls [[eustress]], a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise.

Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | title=Stress Management: What can you do? | publisher=St. Louis Psychologists and Counseling Information and Referral | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | author=Paul Susic MA Licensed Psychologist Candidate | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124092537/http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | archivedate=January 24, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.

Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in [[polygraph]]s.

Many practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by [[health professional]]s and others, for [[self-help]], which may help an individual reduce their levels of stress, provide positive feelings of control over one's life and promote general [[well-being]]. Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important. 

Evaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in [[psychotherapy]], while others with less evidence favoring them are considered [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]].  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.

There are several [[Scientific modelling|model]]s of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

==Historical foundations==
[[Walter Cannon]] and [[Hans Selye]] used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, W. (1939). The Wisdom of the Body, 2nd ed., NY: Norton Pubs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Selye, H| year=1950| title=Stress and the general adaptation syndrome| journal=Br. Med. J.| volume=1| pages=1383–92| pmid=15426759| issue=4667| pmc=2038162| doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4667.1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale]]). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.

==Models==

The generalized models are:
* [[Fight-or-flight response|The emergency response/fight-or-flight response]] by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)
* [[Stress_(biology)#General_adaptation_syndrome|General Adaptation Syndrome]] by Hans Selye (1936)
* Stress Model of Henry
* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)
* [[Conservation of resources theory|Theory of resource conservation]] by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll &amp; Buchwald, 2004)

===Transactional model===
[[File:Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]
[[Richard Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an "imbalance between demands and resources" or as occurring when "pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, Appraisal and Coping. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:
* Conflicts in company
* The way employees are treated by their bosses/supervisors or company
* Lack of job security
* Company policies
* Co-workers who don't do their fair share
* Unclear expectations
* Poor communication
* Not enough control over assignments
* Inadequate pay or benefits
* Urgent deadlines
* Too much work
* Long hours
* Uncomfortable physical conditions
* Relationship conflicts
* Co-workers making careless mistakes
* Dealing with rude customers
* Lack of co-operation
* How the company treats co-workers&lt;ref&gt;Somaz, Wenk Heidi &amp; Tulgan, Bruce (2003). Performance Under Pressure: Managing Stress in the Workplace.Canada. HRD Press Inc.p 7-8. {{ISBN|0-87425-741-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to develop an effective stress management program it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate [[coping skills]], then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of types of stressors.

===Health realization/innate health model===
The health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of [[Well being|well-being]] results from approaching the world with a "quiet mind".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, R.C. (1995). ''Realizing Mental Health: Toward a new Psychology of Resiliency.'' Sulberger &amp; Graham Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-945819-78-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedgeman, J.A. (2005). Health Realization/Innate Health: Can a quiet mind and a positive feeling state be accessible over the lifespan without stress-relief techniques? Med. Sci. Monitor 11(12) HY47-52. {{cite web |url=http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925220423/http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.

==Techniques==
High demand levels load the person with extra effort and work. A new [[time management|time schedule]] is worked up, and until the period of abnormally high, personal demand has passed, the normal frequency and duration of former schedules is limited.

Many techniques [[Coping skill|cope]] with the stresses life brings. Some of the following ways reduce a lower than usual stress level, temporarily, to compensate the [[biological]] issues involved; others face the [[stressor]] at a higher level of abstraction:

===Stress prevention and resilience===
Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring stress===
Levels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of psychological testing: ''The [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]]'' [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the [[DASS (psychology)|DASS]] [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[galvanic skin response]] can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A [[digital thermometer]] can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the [[fight-or-flight response]] drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual.  This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.

===Effectiveness===
Stress management has physiological and immune benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bower, J.

==Types of stress==

===Acute stress===
Acute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide.

Acute stress deals with the pressures of the near future or dealing with the very recent past. This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.&lt;ref name=acute&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGonagle|first=Katherine|author2=Ronald Kessler |title=Chronic Stress, Acute Stress, Depressive Symptoms|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=October 1990|volume=18|issue=5|pages=681–706|doi=10.1007/BF00931237|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44026/1/10464_2004_Article_BF00931237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic stress===
[[Chronic stress]] is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. Chronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can but once males hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increases drastically.&lt;ref name=hormones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Rachel|title=Chronic Stress Effects on Memory: Sex differences in performance|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=January 2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=48–59|doi=10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00022-3|last2=Beck|first2=Kevin D|last3=Luine|first3=Victoria N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace==
Stress in the workplace is a commonality throughout the world in every business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Managing that stress becomes vital in order to keep up [[job performance]] as well as relationship with co-workers and employers.&lt;ref name=Dailybsness.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310012706/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better.

Salary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Cultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|title=Workplace Stress Management Resource - OFAI|author=|date=|website=www.ofai.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327200411/http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|archivedate=2016-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[therapy]], communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|title=Avoiding change-induced stress in the workplace  — Nordic Labour Journal|first=|last=lars|date=|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824145833/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|archivedate=2013-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical environment===

A study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.&lt;ref name=caplan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=R.P|title=Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Hospital Consultants, General Practitioners, and Senior Health Managers|journal=BMJ|date=November 1994|volume=309|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1261|issue=6964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress management programs===
Many businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Anti stress diary with adult coloring pages|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515213919/https://coloringnotebook.com/|archivedate=2017-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress relieving gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|title=20 Gadgets to Help You Fight Stress - Hongkiat Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062941/http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.

[[Employee assistance programs]] can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz&amp;Schultz|first=D|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.

Intervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Sally|title=Occupational Stress: Personal &amp; Professional Approaches|year=1998|publisher=Stanley Thornes ltd.|location=United Kingdom|pages=18–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation industry===
Aviation is a [[Stress in the aviation industry|high-stress industry]], given that it requires a high level of precision at all times.  Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease performance and compromise safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldring|first1=Michael|date=1996-03-15|title=Human Factors Module: Stress|journal=European organisation for the safety of air navigation|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|volume=1|pages=3–16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131033/https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other [[stressor]]s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the [[psychological stress]] experienced by [[aviator]]s, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' [[coping skills|coping]] and stress management skills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehrer |first1=P |last2=Karavidas |first2=M |last3=Lu |first3=SE |last4=Vaschillo |first4=E |last5=Vaschillo |first5=B |last6=Cheng |first6=A |date=May 2010 |title=Cardiac data increase association between self-report and both expert ratings of task load and task performance in flight simulator tasks: An exploratory study |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=80–7 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2010.02.006 |pmid=20172000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To more precisely measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are broken down into "workloads."  This helps to categorise the broad concept of "stress" by specific stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=M|last2=Picardi|first2=A|date=1999|title=Psychological stress and neuroendocrine function in humans: The last two decades of research|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|volume=68|issue=3|pages=114–50|doi=10.1159/000012323|pmid=10224513}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole.  Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.

To evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used.  The major types of measurement tools are:
# Performance-based measures;
# [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and
# [[Physiological]] measures, like measurement of heart rate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Implementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Measurement systems====
The most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily [[rating scale]]-based.  These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry.  Different systems may be utilised in different operational specialties.

* The [[Perceived Stress Scale]] (PSS) – The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langan-Fox |first=J |last2=Sankey |first2=M |last3=Canty |first3=JM |date=October 2009 |title=Human factors measurement for future air traffic control systems |journal=Human Factors |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=595–637 |doi=10.1177/0018720809355278 |pmid=20196289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event.  All 10 questions are summed to obtain a total score from 0 to 40.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  In the aviation industry, for example, it has been used with flight training students to measure how stressed they felt after flight training exercises.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirschner|first1=J|last2=Young|first2=J|last3=Fanjoy|first3=R|date=2014|title=Stress and coping as a function of experience level in collegiate flight students|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|journal=Journal of Aviation Technology and Engineering|volume=3|issue=2|pages=14–19|doi=10.7771/2159-6670.1092|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528192713/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|archivedate=2016-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Coping Skills Inventory – This inventory measures aviators' skills for coping with stress.  This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills:&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; [[Substance abuse]], Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one's thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual's total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.
* The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) – SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals' perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corwin |first=W.H. |date=1992-04-01 |title=In-flight and post flight assessment of pilot workload in commercial transport aircraft using the subjective workload assessment technique |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1?journalCode=hiap20 |journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=77–93 |doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.

====Pilot stress report systems====
Early pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Young, James |date=December 2008 |title=The Effects of Life-Stress on Pilot Performance |url=http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |pages=1–7 |docket= |accessdate= |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152852/http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale.  Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress.  The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Muller, Ronald |editor2=Andreas Wittmer |editor3=Christopher Drax |date=2014 |title=Aviation Risk and Safety Management: Methods and Applications In Aviation Organizations |url= |location= |publisher=Springer International |page= |isbn=978-3-319-02779-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for [[U.S. Naval]] aviators in 1982 to test the [[hypothesis]] that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: "at-fault" with mishap, and "not-at-fault" in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=O'Connor, Paul E. |editor2=Cohn, Joseph V. |date=2010 |title=Human Performance Enhancement in High-Risk Environments: Insights, Developments, and Future Directions from Military Research |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page= |isbn=978-0-313-35983-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the [[British Airline Pilots' Association]] (BALPA).  They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor's questionnaire to collect data on pilots'  perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance.  Being a subjective measure, this study's data was based on pilots' perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress.  Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Beck Depression Inventory]] (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for [[depression (mood)|depressive]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barralabc |first=C |last2=Rodríguez-Cintasb |first2=L |last3=Martínez-Lunaabc |first3=Nieves |last4=Bachillerabc |first4=D |date=2014-11-13 |title=Reliability of the Beck Depression Inventory in opiate-dependent patients |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14659891.2014.980859 |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–6 |doi=10.3109/14659891.2014.980859|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Parsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 [[U.S. Air Force]] [[fighter pilot]]s who had flown combat operations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic.  However, the study revealed some unexpected findings.  The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of [[libido]].  50% of two [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression.  Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.{{why?|date=December 2015}}

'''''The Journal of Commerce''''' is a biweekly magazine published in the United States that focuses on global trade topics. First published in 1827 in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030542/ |title=New York Journal of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal'' has a circulation of approximately 15,000. It provides editorial content to manage day-to-day international logistics and shipping need, covering the areas of [[cargo]] and [[freight]] transportation, [[export]] and [[import]], global transport logistics and [[trade]], international [[supply chain]] management and U.S. custom regulations.

==1800s==
In 1827, [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Samuel Morse]] decided that New York needed another newspaper. The ''Journal of Commerce'' operated two deepwater schooners to intercept incoming vessels and get stories ahead of the competition. Following Morse's invention of the telegraph, the ''JoC'' was a founding member of the [[Associated Press]], now the world's largest news-gathering organization.

Publications in the 19th century took positions on political issues and were rarely concerned with being impartial. The ''JoC'' weighed in on the biggest issue of the day — [[slavery]]. Gerard Hallock and David Hale, partners in the ''JoC'', were opponents of slavery but also critics of the  [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], and they decried the tactics of the war wing of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].
After the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, the [[United States Postmaster General|postmaster general]] suspended the paper's mail privileges, effectively interrupting its publication, on grounds of "disloyalty."  Hallock challenged this decision but failed to have it overturned.  With its evening edition suspended and the morning edition distributed only to non-postal subscribers, editor Gerard Hallock stepped down on August 31, 1861.  David M Stone, head of the commercial news department, and William Cowper, took over his interest in the Journal &lt;ref&gt;p 43, AP The Story of News, by Oliver Gramling&lt;/ref&gt;
Three years later, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ordered the JoC closed after it was among New York papers victimized by a bogus story quoting the president as calling for 400,000 more volunteers.

Following the Civil War, David Stone and [[William Cowper Prime|William C. Prime]], a lawyer who invested part of his fortune in the paper converted the paper from a partnership into a corporation. Prime soon retired to become president of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Though continuing as one of the lead investors, Prime left Stone in sole control. Stone devoted himself to the paper, writing most of the editorials and many of the page one stories.

But he neglected the paper's physical plant, allowing its technology to become outdated. Type was still set by hand in an era when most papers had switched over to [[linotype machine]]s. The paper lost ground to its competitors, including the ''Daily Commercial Bulletin'', founded in 1865 and owned by [[William Dodsworth (editor)|William Dodsworth]], a friend of Stone's. But unlike his friend, Dodsworth believed it was more important to invest earnings in plant and equipment than to pay it out to investors.

In 1893, Prime and Stone agreed to sell the ''JoC'' to Dodsworth and merge it with the ''Commercial Bulletin''. Though Dodsworth was the acquirer, he retained the ''JoC'''s name. The new paper became ''The Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin'', a name that was to be maintained through the 1990s.

The merged paper benefited enormously from the ''Commercial'''s new presses and linotype machines, each of which could replace three or four men setting type by hand, one letter at a time. The papers also had complementary advertising support. The Commercial drew advertising from the grocery and provisions business, from insurance and banking. The JoC's coverage focused on shipping and chemicals, textiles and insurance.

When Dodsworth took over, he immediately laid off most members of both staffs. He didn't want writers who couldn't write on the newfangled typewriting machines or compositors who couldn't run linotypes.

==1900s==
After the 1907 panic, a young editor at ''The Journal of Commerce'', [[H. Parker Willis]], became a leader in the drive to establish a [[Central Bank]]. He teamed up with [[Carter Glass]], the Virginia senator, to write the [[Federal Reserve Act]]. Much of the work was done in the offices of the JoC.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Throughout its history, the JoC maintained a different perspective on the news. Coverage of major events, such as the [[San Francisco earthquake]] of 1906 and the U.S. entry into World War I, emphasized the effect on business. During World War II, the JoC reprinted and indexed the wartime regulations that controlled production and supplies.

The JoC's profits boomed during World War I with a sharp increase in advertising and circulation related to the wartime industrial expansion. The growth continued into the early 1920s. Then in 1921, the Dodsworths sold the paper to [[William C. Reick]], who acquired it with money put up by [[Charles Stoneham|Charles A. Stoneham]], the wealthy owner of racehorses and the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. After Reick died in 1924, Stoneham appointed a new front man, [[Raphael Govin]], who pushed the JoC into more sports coverage.

Willis, who had become editor-in-chief of the ''JoC'' in 1919, watched with alarm as the paper's profits began to dwindle, when everyone else in the Roaring Twenties was making money. After Govin died and the JoC appeared to be on the verge of extinction, the paper was purchased in 1927 by the three Ridder brothers: Bernard H., Joseph E. and Victor F. They were the sons of [[Herman Ridder]], the publisher of the German-language ''[[Staats Zeitung]]'', the ''[[New York Herald]]'' and the ''[[Long Island Press]]''.

The outbreak of World War II dramatically affected financial and commodity markets. The Ridder brothers soon built a newspaper empire of their own. They sold the JoC's AP franchise, which was a valuable asset in a day when access to the AP wires was restricted to franchise-holders. This enabled them to buy the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch]]''. [[Bernard H. Ridder]] became publisher of the ''Pioneer Press-Dispatch'', turning the JoC presidency over to [[Joseph E. Ridder]].

In the postwar years, the ''JoC'' also earned a reputation as a prime source of international trade news. In 1973 the paper scooped the world on perhaps the most significant economic development of the last 30 years. Six days ahead of any other newspaper, the JoC reported that Arab nations were going to embargo oil shipments to the U.S.

On Saturday, October 20, 1973, as the [[Yom Kippur War]] raged, the world learned that Arab nations would be suspending the supply of oil to the United States. The Journal of Commerce had the story of the notorious [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] more than a week earlier. "It was a story that impacted the entire world", said Harold Gold, who was editor of the JoC at the time. Few thought the Arab nations would use oil as a weapon against the U.S. in response to its military support for [[Israel]], which included a $2.2 billion military aid package. There had been threats, and an attempted embargo in 1967 that failed, so most dismissed the idea that it would ever happen.

In the later part of the 20th century, the ''JoC'' intensified its coverage of shipping, earning its nickname as the Bible of the maritime industry. Shipping was transformed forever by the introduction by [[Malcom McLean]] in 1956 of the [[container ship]]. [[Containerization|Containerized shipping]] made traditional [[Break bulk cargo|breakbulk]] ports obsolete and provided the means for Asia's export boom, which changed the world's economic map. The JoC reported in detail on these and other developments in transportation and logistics.

The JoC never missed a day of publication, even on the day in February 1993, when terrorists detonated a bomb in the garage under the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], killing six people. The paper's New York staff managed to find its way down the darkened, smoke-filled fire-escape stairs of the tower to safety below. The staff at the [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]] printing plant put the paper out that day.

The [[shipping industry]], which had flourished through the 1960s and 1970s, began a period of consolidation in the mid-1990s because of plunging freight rates. Separate shipping companies that had run multiple ads in the paper merged and eliminated competing routes. With the rapid growth of the Internet in the 1990s, many shipping companies began to switch their ship schedules onto their Web sites, where shippers around the world could access them.

[[Knight-Ridder]] decided to get out of business information altogether to focus on its daily metropolitan newspapers. In 1995, it sold the ''JoC'' to [[The Economist Group]] of London, publishers of the widely respected, ''[[The Economist]]''. Under The Economist Group the JoC tightened its focus to cover international trade logistics. In 1999, the [[broadsheet]] newspaper was converted to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper format.

==2000s==
It became increasingly apparent that a print newspaper with a worldwide readership faced a struggle in keeping its readers up-to-date on breaking news. By the time the newspaper was delivered, most readers had already gotten their news by fax, telephone or on the Internet. In 2000, the ''JoC'' converted the its daily print publication into a weekly magazine, ''JoC Week'', which provided analysis of trade logistics.

In 2001, ''The Economist'' sold the JoC to Commonwealth Business Media, the New Jersey-based publisher of ''Pacific Shipper'', ''Canadian Sailings'', and a number of railroad and trucking directories. The new owners had long-standing connections with the transportation industry, having previously owned ''Traffic World'', another magazine acquired with its purchase of the JoC Group.

In 2006, [[United Business Media]] acquired Commonwealth Business Media, from its owners: RFE Investment Partners, Bariston Partners, The Economist Group, [[ABRY Partners]] and Commonwealth's management. In 2008, United Business Media reorganized Commonwealth Business Media into two separate market-focused businesses. ''The Journal of Commerce'' became a part of the [[UBM Global Trade]] group, focusing on serving professional communities engaged in commercial sea, rail and road transportation and logistics worldwide.

Effective March 2, 2009, ''Traffic World'' magazine and ''The Journal of Commerce'' merged into one publication under the flagship ''Journal of Commerce'' banner. The JoC introduced a redesigned, comprehensive editorial product that utilizes data from [[PIERS: The Port Import/Export Reporting Service]] to enhance news stories, offer a variety of Web tools that will complement its move to a digital environment with real-time focus, provide more analysis and market-oriented content.

The combined publication integrates the trucking, rail transport, express and domestic-focused logistics coverage of ''Traffic World'' with the international, U.S. Customs, container shipping, intermodal and breakbulk focus of ''The Journal of Commerce'' titles. The new publication is led by Paul Page, Editorial Director, and [[Joe Bonney]], Executive Editor.

UBM sold the majority of its data business to [[Electra Private Equity|Electra Partners]] in 2013, who formed AXIO Data Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/657ded70-6f7a-11e2-956b-00144feab49a.html UBM data service sale disappoints market]&lt;/ref&gt; [[IHS Inc.]] announced in November 2014 that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire JOC Group Inc.&lt;ref&gt;IHS [http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate-financial/ihs-announces-agreement-acquire-joc-group-worlds-leading-supplie-0 "IHS Announces Agreement to Acquire JOC Group, the World's Leading Supplier of U.S. Seaborne Import and Export Trade Data"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rune Torbjörn Evrell''' (March 29, 1920 – April 22, 2008) was a Swedish [[inventor]] and [[businessman]] who made major innovations in folding knife construction, knife designs and knife production methods at [[EKA-knivar| EKA-knivar AB]]  [[Eskilstuna]], Sweden.

==Life and career==

Born 1920 in Stockholm, Lidingö. Between 11 and 12 years of age he lived in [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] Indiana, USA. His father, [[Kaleb Evrell]], developed a patent for an automatic transmission for passenger cars for [[BorgWarner|Warner Gears]]. After the US experience the family moved to [[Eskilstuna]].

Torbjörn Evrell received his degree mechanical engineering in 1945 from the [[Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan|Royal Institute of Technology]]. His first job was at Centrala Torpedverkstaden, CTV (Torpedo factory of the Swedish Defence Industries) in [[Motala]].

In 1946 Torbjörn Evrell took management of  [[Eka-knivar|Eskilstuna Knivfabriks AB]] (EKA) knife making company when the owner [[John Elmquist]] (Evrells father in law) unexpectedly died. Evrell, specialist in submersible motors and pumps, now became President of EKA at the age of 26. He took over a company, which in many respects was using production methods of the late 1800s, with a rather outdated machinery with many processes with belt drive from hydropower. Evrell started modernisation . Production technology was improved and the old knife range cut down and new modern knives had to be developed. Evrell first task was to clean up the knife range. He took out a full sales statistics and noted that many models were marginal to sales or outdated. He considered that he could immediately reduce the number of models from 91 to 37. Moreover, he introduced standard components which could be used in several knives.

Evrell also introduced a new systematic production planning, improved methods and machinery were upgraded. Everything to make better knives cheaper. Evrell started using subcontractors and concentrated construction and production to knives.

He was throughout his career continuously involved in all areas of the company including knife innovation, production and marketing. There are a number of influential knife patents in his name. Out of the one time many dozens of knife making companies of Eskilstuna, his was the only one to survive by constant innovation and adaptions to new conditions.

Evrell was the president of EKA until 1985, when he was succeeded by his daughter [[Karin Ingelson]]. Torbjörn Evrell continued as an advisor to EKA, especially in product development, for ten more years.&lt;ref name=marmer&gt;{{cite book|pages= 63–70| title=Knivar från Eskilstuna: Knives from Eskilstuna |author= Arne Marmér|isbn= 9789163081767 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Knivar_fr%C3%A5n_Eskilstuna.html?id=Jw20tgAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Samtek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions in knife design, construction and production==
Prior to 1970, all knives were riveted. Riveting was done by hand, and all work with assembly and adjustment, requires craftsmanship which is very labor-intensive. It took at least three to four years for a workman to reach the skill and speed required in production. Evrell realized the problems and wanted to find a faster and less labor-intensive method, while at the same time make the world's best folding knife with one blade. An effort started in November 1967 to come up with a new construction to hold a knife together. The final version of the knife was improved by two external consultants to the company: Olle Nordlund and the industrial designer [[Sigvard Bernadotte]] {{US patent|D227071}}. The results were presented in March 1970 when Evrell could launch the first bolted folding knife in the ''Swede series''. The first two models were named Swede 38 (design Sigvard Bernadotte) and Swede 45. The special features of the Swede knives is that the scales are screwed in place. The knife scales can easily be removed, with a screwdriver or coin, for cleaning and lubrication of the blade and inside. The screws are also used to adjust the blade folding mechanism. This new way to manufacture folding knives was completely revolutionary and came to mean a big international breakthrough for EKA. The Swede series started with the EKA Swede 38 knife with plastic scales (offered in several colors) and brass screws with a blade in either carbon steel or stainless steel. The Swede 45 had wooden scales. These first models have been followed by several models with incremental developments.

Another of Evrells inventions is a small folding knife where the whole knife including the folding mechanism is welded together.

With increasing demand EKA-knivar continually made improvements to production methods. The production capacity was increased significantly. In 1971 the company with factory and office in central Eskilstuna was moved to newly built premises at Sättargatan 4 in Vilsta industrial area.

==Marketing==
[[Image:EKA Swede 38 45 knives.jpg|thumb|340px|right|EKA Swede 38 and Swede 45 models]]
Torbjörn Evrell was very aware of the value of marketing a knife. In 1967 he established a dedicated marketing department within his company, which was of great importance to the company's continued expansion. He also took advantage of the marketing value in a knife. All knife models have been available for branding and adaptation as promotional gifts to mark a sign of quality.

'''Visy Industries''' was established in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1948 and has since grown to become one of the world's largest privately owned [[paper]], [[packaging]] and [[recycling]] companies. Today, Visy employs more than 9500 people in Australia and the United States (where it is known as Pratt Industries USA), with total sales exceeding more than $5 billion. Visy was owned by [[Richard Pratt (Australian businessman)|Richard Pratt]] until his death on 28 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/richard-pratt-dies-20090428-alwo.html|title=Richard Pratt dies |author= |date=April 28, 2009 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when his son [[Anthony Pratt (businessman)|Anthony Pratt]] assumed the role of Executive Chairman. He has also presided over a major expansion into the Asian packaging market and moved to position Visy as a key player in food security for the region.

Today, Visy's operational footprint extends from Sydney to Singapore, from Shanghai to San Francisco, with more than 180 facilities worldwide.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy's Corporate Headquarters - also home to the company Tech Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Visy's Corporate HQ is also home to the company Tech Centre]] --&gt;
Visy Industries began in 1948 with a 1000-pound loan from Richard Pratt's aunt, Ida Visbord, for whom the company is named. Originally, there were three partners – Visbord's husband Max Plotka, Richard Pratt's father Leon and engineer Les Feldman. From the day Visy opened for business in a Fitzroy, Melbourne factory there were indications this would be a company devoted to recycling and sustainability – the first corrugator it used was made from spare parts and recycled scrap metal.

After Leon Pratt's death in 1969, his son [[Richard Pratt (Australian businessman)|Richard Pratt]] took over the reins and oversaw a dramatic expansion. Throughout the 1970s, Visy established new plants in New South Wales and Queensland, and by the end of the decade was making more than 100,000 tonnes of boxes a year.&lt;ref name="Visy Report 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy Report 2011|url=http://www.visy.com.au/pdf/sustainability-report-v8-pr2-spreads.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 80s, Visy continued to grow but this time its major expansion was spearheaded by the decision to build 100% recycled paper mills, the first at Warwick Farm, Sydney.  This decision not only signaled a shift in Visy's corporate philosophy but placed the company at the forefront of the recycling movement in Australia, setting the company on the path to record growth and profits. By 1990, Visy's national market share was over 40% with more than 2000 employees.&lt;ref name="Visy - Our History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy - Our History|url=http://www.visy.com.au/about/our-company/our-history/|publisher=Visy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard and Anthony Pratt then set their sights on the huge American market, with the younger Pratt moving to the U.S. to oversee the start-up and development of Pratt Industries USA. Through a combination of acquisition and greenfielding 100% recycled paper mills and state-of-the-art corrugators, [[Pratt Industries USA]] showed remarkable progress in the ensuing two decades, growing from the 46th largest corrugated packaging producer in America to the 5th.&lt;ref name="Fibre Box Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=FibrBox.org|url=http://www.fibrebox.org/|publisher=Fibre Box Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Pratt Industries USA employs more than 4000 people, more Americans than any other Australian company. It is the only major paper company in the US that is 100% recycled.

==2001-2003 - Tumut and Southcorp==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy - Tumut Kraft Mill.jpg|thumb|right|Visy's Tumut Kraft Mill]] --&gt;In 2001, Visy undertook the-then largest development in its history, the construction of a $450 million kraft paper mill in Tumut, New South Wales. This was the first kraft mill built in the world in 20 years.
It was the biggest investment in regional Australia since the Snowy Mountains Scheme (RP Speech), and was hailed by Australia's leading environmentalists for its commitment to sustainability.&lt;ref name="Canberra Times"&gt;{{cite news|title='Greenies' rare approval as Tumut pulp mill opens|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1g1-80252576.html|newspaper=Canberra Times|date=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also boasts an advanced water usage system, with near-zero levels of effluent leaving the site. In fact, the Tumut mill is the most water efficient in the world - requiring just five tonnes of water to produce every tonne of product, compared to the global average of 25 tonnes. And it uses only forest thinnings and off-cuts for fibre.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy paper mill expansion gets go ahead|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-05-02/visy-paper-mill-expansion-gets-go-ahead/2537940|work=ABC.net.au|accessdate=05/02/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was so successful that 10 years later Visy built Stage 2 on the same site – a second kraft paper mill bringing the total investment to Tumut to almost $1 billion. Stage 2, which was opened by NSW Premier Barry O’Farrell, was also hailed by environmentalists, and was a winner of the Australian Business Awards for “Environmental Sustainabilty."&lt;ref name="Sustainability Matters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy recognized with Australian Business Award for Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.sustainabilitymatters.net.au/news/42491-Visy-recognised-with-2-1-Australian-Business-Award-for-Environmental-Sustainability|work=SustainabilityMatters.net.au|publisher=Sustainability Matters|accessdate=08/03/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visy continued to grow by acquisition as well as green-fielding. In 2001, the company effectively doubled in size when it acquired Southcorp Packaging. Visy was now operating at over 100 packaging and recycling sites in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. Moreover, Visy expanded its product mix to include steel and aluminum cans, PET bottles, beverage cartons and plastic packaging. It also continued to be a world leader in recycling and during this period Visy opened Australia's largest Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Smithfield, NSW.&lt;ref name="Australian Financial Review, September 2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Pratt's $3.5bn succession plan|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|date=2005-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The Pratt Foundation was established by Richard and Jeanne Pratt in 1978 to support various charitable causes and initiatives throughout Australia. Since then, it has donated more than $250 million. In addition, Jeanne and Richard Pratt helped raised a further $250 million by opening their home, Raheen, to other charitable fundraisers.
The Foundation is chaired by Anthony Pratt's sister, Heloise Waislitz. Its chief executive is Sam Lipski, a Melbourne-based journalist, and supports areas including medical research, education, the arts and relief of poverty.&lt;ref name="Herald Sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Our heroes philanthropic|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pratt family is also behind VisyCares, a non-profit begun in 1995 which promotes social responsibility at Visy through donations to establish community-based projects such as youth, immigrant and learning centres.&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ali wins hearts with intimate combination|newspaper=The Age|date=09/12/2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission (ACCC) commenced prosecution against Visy for alleged involvement in a cartel in the packaging industry. In 2007, Richard Pratt and the Visy group received a A$36 million fine for price fixing, representing the largest fine in Australian history at the time. That same year it was also learned that Visy was also one of a number of Australian companies that had used a trucking company later proved to be run by a former Hell's Angel.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, March 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amcor, Visy settle $500m cartel claim|url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/amcor_visy_settle_cartel_claim_0qlrm6vysyhvzl7lo0ijhk|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=03/09/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald-Sun&gt;{{cite news|title=Bikies for hire - Cops uncover Hells Angels link to corporate giant|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/visy-uses-bikies-as-debt-collectors/story-e6frf7jx-1226354394609|newspaper=Herald-Sun|date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, upon Anthony Pratt's ascendency to Executive Chairman, Visy appointed former ACCC Chairman Professor Allan Fels to chair its Governance Committee.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, August 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt takes reins as CEO departs|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Pratt also announced former advisor to President Obama and the outgoing US Ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich would join his company's advisory board. Bleich, an ex-clerk for former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was a one-time special counsel to the President before being appointed Ambassador. He joins other advisory board members including Sir Dryden Spring, the former chairman of the Australian New Zealand National Bank, Allan Moss (AO), the former CEO of the Macquarie banking group and Jeanne Pratt (AC).&lt;ref name="The Australian, October 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=US ambassador for Pratt advisory board|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/us-ambassador-for-pratt-advisory-board/story-e6frg8zx-1226737054043|newspaper=The Australian|date=10/11/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[Australian Taxation Office]] revealed that in 2013-14, despite earning more than $2.5 billion in revenue, the holding company Pratt Consolidated Holdings had paid no tax. Further, that Thorney Investments, operated by Richard Pratt's son-in-law Alex Waislitz, which earned $430 million in revenue, had also paid no tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-22/ato-30pc-of-large-private-companies-pay-no-tax/7266454|title=98 private companies earning over $200m pay no tax: ATO|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hells Angels links==
Visy Industries has links with the outlaw motorcycle group, the [[Hells Angels]]. Visy Industries employs a trucking company run by Stephen James Rogers, a convicted drug trafficker and founding chapter boss of the Hells Angels. Rogers was sentenced in 2007 to three years' prison for drug trafficking, and a senior Visy Industries manager gave character evidence for Rogers at his trial and stated the company would stand by him despite his conviction for trafficking amphetamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/visy-linked-to-angels-bikie-boss-20090705-d96y.html |title=Visy linked to Angels bikie boss |author=McKenzie, Nick |date=6 July 2009 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Visy Industries was accused of using the Hells Angels to collect their debts. Police and industry sources state Visy founder Richard Pratt, who died in 2009, personally approved the deal with the Hells Angles. Visy Industries have called the accusations "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/cops-uncover-hells-angels-link-to-corporate-giant-visy/story-fn7x8me2-1226354297970 |title=Cops uncover Hells Angels link to corporate giant Visy |author=Moor, Keith |date=14 May 2012 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post 2009 leadership under Anthony Pratt==
[[File:Anthony Pratt.jpg|thumb|right|Anthony Pratt]]Following Richard Pratt's death in April, 2009, Anthony Pratt returned to Australia to assume the added responsibility of Global Executive Chairman of Visy Industries. This was in addition to him continuing in his long-time position as Chairman of Pratt Industries USA. Just two years after he assumed leadership of the company, Visy jumped from 43rd to 3rd in the AMR Corporate Citizenship Index, part of an annual survey of more than 60,000 Australians.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, April 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=JB Hi-Fi tops but crisis effect not over for DJs|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under Anthony Pratt's leadership the company has also expanded its Asian presence and participation.  Earnings from its Asian operations have increased by $100 million a year.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy bid to double Asia earnings Pratt unveils strategy for regional growth|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/visy-bid-to-double-asia-earnings/story-fn91v9q3-1226594292308|newspaper=The Australian|date=03/11/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved in several ways. Firstly, Visy established Build Run Repair, an engineering services company headquartered in Singapore to design and build sustainable pulp and paper mills and clean energy plants, leveraging the company's experience gained from building its own 15 paper mills and 4 clean energy plants.
 
Its internal team of more than 40 engineers is also charged with maintaining Visy's worldwide portfolio of factories as well as source equipment and products from China, Vietnam, Malaysia other Asian countries. In addition, the Singapore operation houses a trading company. Its mission is to buy hundreds of millions of dollar worth of goods and services for both Visy and external customers.&lt;ref name="The Australian, May 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy expansion rolls on with US35m US Plant|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/visy-expansion-rolls-on-with-35m-us-plant/story-e6frg8zx-1226347254691|newspaper=The Australian|date=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period has also seen the growth of Visy's Thailand operations, which produce plastic products. The Thailand success builds on Visy's strategy of following its multinational customers into Asia.

Visy has also set up warehouse distribution centres outside Shanghai and Beijing, as well as a trading office in Shenzhen which is selling Visy paper into the Chinese market. Visy's growing focus on Asian markets received a major boost in 2013 when Anthony Pratt announced plans to double the company's earnings in the region by building new packaging plants in at least four South-East Asian countries. They will be modeled on the group's existing plastics plants in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"/&gt;

Work on the $260 million project is scheduled to begin in March, and will take 16 months. The 360,000-ton capacity plant will be built on a 50-acre site adjacent to Pratt's box-making plant in Valparaiso, Indiana, the world's largest. The new mill is expected to propel Pratt's USA sales to $2 billion.&lt;ref name="The Australian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/profit-loss/paper-giant-pratt-plans-us-boost/story-fn91vch7-1226724739391|work=The Australian|date=23 September 2013|title=Paper giant Pratt plans US boost|first=Damon|last=Kitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Pratt Industries NYC Paper on a Barge to the Paper Mill.jpg|thumb|right|Discarded paper is barged to Pratt mill in NYC]] --&gt;This follows other mills Pratt built in the US, most notably in New York City. That facility represents the largest manufacturing investment in the city since World War 2. And it is the only paper mill ever built in New York. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg designated September 17, 2013, as “Pratt Industries Day” in the Big Apple, in tribute to the company's commitment to recycling and the environment.&lt;ref name="silive.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/staten_island_papermill_produc.html|title=Staten Island Mill Marks Its 5 Millionth Ton of Recycled Paper|work=SILive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video posted on YouTube, entitled “NYC Mayor Salutes Pratt Industries,” Bloomberg cited a proclamation honoring Pratt's mill for having recycled 5 million tons of discarded paper since start-up in 1997.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Pratt also wants to ramp up Visy's logistics operations to help spearhead a four-fold increase in Australia's food exports to Asia, especially China.&lt;ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Planting seeds for food security|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/planting-the-seeds-for-food-security-20111115-1nh3s.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visy is already the largest exporter of shipping containers from Australian ports at approximately 60,000 per year.&lt;ref name="eThe Australian Financial Review, November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt sees future in food exports|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his return to Australia, Pratt has taken a strong interest in sustainable agriculture and [[food security]].  More than 70 percent of Visy's customers are in the food and beverage industries.

In April 2013, Pratt gave the keynote address at the Global Food Forum, a major international conference on food security he organized in partnership with [[The Australian]] newspaper.

In September 2013, Pratt was elected an executive member of the Australia-Japan Business Cooperation Committee, a group dedicated for more than 50 years to strengthening ties between the two countries. It includes some of the most prominent business leaders in Australia, and is chaired by former British Airways CEO and current News Corporation director Sir Rod Eddington (AO).&lt;ref name="Australia Japan Business Cooperation Committee"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ajbcc.asn.au/uploads/5/6/2/3/5623680/ajbcc_memberslist_aug2013.pdf|title=AJBCC Members List|access-date=2013-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020120920/http://www.ajbcc.asn.au/uploads/5/6/2/3/5623680/ajbcc_memberslist_aug2013.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Pratt's growing business interests in Asia prompted Australia's new Prime Minister Tony Abbott to invite him on an official visit to Indonesia – the first overseas’ trip by the incoming leader.&lt;ref name="The Australian1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/abbotts-focus-on-international-trade-delights-ceos/story-e6frg926-1226731151648|title=

==Sustainability==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy Coolaroo Clean Energy.jpg|thumb|right|Visy Coolaroo Clean Energy]] --&gt;
Pratt has organised the build of a $50 million, 100% recycled plastics plant in Sydney. This plant will enable Visy to make its PET and HDPE bottles out of 100% recycled plastic resin for everything from soft drink bottles to shampoo bottles to milk bottles. At full capacity, this facility will remove some 2 billion plastic bottles from the waste stream and recycle them into new bottles.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"/&gt;

Visy-Pratt Industries USA have continued to build clean energy plants which now include facilities in Tumut, Atlanta, Ga., Melbourne and Queensland. These not only provide coal-free energy – thus reducing the company's carbon footprint – but they allow Visy to expand its recycling capabilities to beyond converting paper and plastics into 100% recycled products. It will also enable the company to convert almost all remaining garbage into clean energy, thus helping close down landfills.&lt;ref name="Plastics News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy flags $306 million clean-energy plan|newspaper=Plastics News|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Visy has won awards including the 2011 Australian Packaging Design Awards where it was named Overall Show Winner at the Packaging Council of Australia annual awards.&lt;ref name=PCA.org&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Southern Cross Packaging Design Awards|url=http://www.pca.org.au/awards2011/sx/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Visy and the Banksia Foundation – a leading Australian non-profit which promotes environmental excellence - teamed up to inaugurate the Richard Pratt-Banksia CEO Award. The award recognizes an individual executive's contributions towards the economic, social and environmental sustainability achievements of the organisation or company he/she leads. The award was named in honour of Pratt, who was seen as one of Australia's leading agents of change in the environmental sector. The 2013 winner was Ravi Naidu, CEO of the Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment. Naidu is a national leader in his field.&lt;ref name=Scinews.com.au&gt;{{cite web|title=Banksia Award for Cleanup Leader|url=http://scinews.com.au/releases/851/view}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vlade Divac''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Владе Дивац}}, {{IPA-sh|ʋlǎːde dǐːʋats|pron}}; born February 3, 1968) is a Serbian professional basketball executive and retired player, currently serving as the vice president of basketball operations and general manager of the [[Sacramento Kings]].&lt;ref name="divac-gm"/&gt;

Divac spent most of his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). At {{nowrap|7 ft 1 in}}, he played [[center (basketball)|center]] and was known for his passing skills. He was among the first group of European basketball players to transfer to the NBA in the late 1980s and was named one of the [[50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/item/24016 |title=Experts decide European Club Basketball's 50 greatest contributors – 50 YEARS – Welcome to EUROLEAGUE BASKETBALL |publisher=Euroleague.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of seven players in NBA history to record 13,000 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 9,000 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 3,000 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]] and 1,500 blocked shots, along with [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Pau Gasol]], and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/divac_retires_051018.html |title=Vlade Divac Announces Retirement; Accepts Position With Lakers &amp;#124|publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;The NBA did not record blocked shots before the 1973–74 season, so earlier players such as [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] probably had similar career achievements.&lt;/ref&gt; Divac was also the first player born and trained outside the United States to play in over 1,000 games in the NBA. On August 20, 2010, he was inducted into the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his play in international competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.fiba.com/pages/eng/hof/news/p/newsid/42798/arti.html |title=FIBA announces 2010 Hall of Fame Class |publisher=[[FIBA]] |date=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019073536/http://www.halloffame.fiba.com/pages/eng/hof/news/p/newsid/42798/arti.html |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being noticed for his basketball abilities, Divac is also known as a humanitarian, helping children in his native country of Serbia, and in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/divac_youcantoo_070922.html |title=Divac Creates New Team With "You Can Too" Campaign |publisher=NBA.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, he was appointed as government adviser in Serbia for humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-divac-serbianadviser&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020220122/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-divac-serbianadviser&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |archivedate=October 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, he was elected President of the [[Serbian Olympic Committee]] for a 4-year term &lt;ref name="blicokserb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/sport.php?id=80659 |title=Divac na čelu OKS naredne četiri godine |language=Serbian |date=2009-02-24 |publisher=Blic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227115052/http://www.blic.rs/sport.php?id=80659 |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-elected in November 2012.&lt;ref name=oks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.blic.rs/Ostali-sportovi/223132/Divac-ponovo-izabran-za-predsednika-Olimpijskog-komiteta-Srbije |title=Vlade Divac ponovo izabran za predsednika Olimpijskog komiteta |language=Serbian |trans-title=Vlade Divac re-elected for the President of the Olympic Committee|publisher=Beta |date= November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Divac received an honor from the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/kings/news/divac_hall_of_fame08.html |title=Kings News Full &amp;#124; The Official Site Of The Sacramento Kings |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club playing career==
Divac began playing basketball in his home town [[Prijepolje]] for the team KK Elan. He began his professional career in Yugoslavia playing for [[KK Sloga|Sloga]] from [[Kraljevo]], and was immediately noted for scoring 27 points against [[KK Crvena zvezda|Crvena zvezda]].&lt;ref name="vreme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=512456 |title=Srbin broj jedan van Srbije |publisher=[[Vreme]] |date=2007-09-20 |author=Slobodan Georgijev |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KK Partizan===
In the summer of 1986, Divac was the top star of the basketball transfer season, and he ended up signing with [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]14,000.&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

In the [[1986–87 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1986–87 Yugoslav First League season]], with players like Divac, [[Aleksandar Đorđević]], [[Žarko Paspalj]], [[Željko Obradović]], and with [[head coach|coach]] [[Duško Vujošević]] at the helm, Partizan had a "dream team", which won the [[Yugoslavian First Federal Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]] title. In the subsequent [[1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup|1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup season]] (now called EuroLeague), the club failed to reach the top of the [[EuroLeague]], after having lost to [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] in [[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|the semifinal in Ghent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.co.rs/partizan/eng/istorijat.php |title=Istorija: Novi "Dream Team" |publisher=[[KK Partizan|Partizan]] official website |accessdate=2007-09-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]], with [[Dino Rađa]] and [[Toni Kukoč]], was a stronger team in the subsequent three years, reigning both in Yugoslavia and in Europe.

Divac had an unusual style compared to most other [[center (basketball)|centers]] of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good control of the ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a [[point guard|play maker]]. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot at the top of the key and flip shots around the rim, while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the [[1989 EuroBasket]], he lifted teammate [[Zoran Radović]] for a [[slam dunk]]. In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after [[Arvydas Sabonis]].&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

===Los Angeles Lakers===
Drafted into the NBA in [[1989 NBA draft|1989]] by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac became one of the first European players to have an impact in the league. Under the mentorship of [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[Magic Johnson]], he improved his play and adapted to the American style of basketball. Though he spoke no English, he quickly became popular among his teammates and the public for his charm and joviality. In the 1989&amp;ndash;90 season, he was selected into the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]].&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

Divac earned a reputation for [[flop (basketball)|flopping]], or deceiving the officials into calling a foul on the other team by purposely falling to the floor upon contact with an opposing player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/columnists/orl-nbainsider2807jan28,0,6686181.column?track=rss |title=Shutting down acting school? |author=Tim Povtak |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=2007-01-28 |accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran NBA forward [[P. J. Brown]] claimed that Divac might have been the best of all time at flopping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0318nbaflop0318.html Flopping keeps cropping up], by Doug Haller, ''The Arizona Republic'', published March 18, 2007, retrieved April 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Divac freely admitted doing so, adding that he usually did it when he felt like the officials had missed some calls and owed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BEST+ACTOR:+DIVAC+IN+%60FLOP+WARS+II'-a086219289 BEST ACTOR: DIVAC IN `FLOP WARS II'], by Kevin Modesti, Los Angeles ''Daily News'', published May 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NBA instituted anti-flopping penalties in 2012, Divac expressed his support for such rules, stating that he felt players after him were "overdo[ing] it" with respect to flopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/kings/2015/03/10/vlade-divac-sacramento-front-office-vivek-ranadive-flopping-lakers-kobe-bryant/24666243/|title=Even Vlade Divac thinks flopping has gotten out of hand|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Thomsen, a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist, grouped Divac with fellow international players [[Anderson Varejão]] and [[Manu Ginóbili]] as the players who "made [flopping] famous", exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to [[diving (football)|diving]] in [[FIFA]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/ian_thomsen/09/28/nba-flopping-david-stern/ | title= NBA's new flopping policy the best response to a difficult problem | date= September 28, 2012 | first= Ian |last= Thomsen |work= [[Sports Illustrated]] | publisher= cnn.com| accessdate=2012-09-28| quote= The ugly trend of faking physical contact began in soccer, a sport in which gamesmanship has given way to players writhing in false agony around the world. Soccer has been unable to fix its problem, but now the NBA will have an opportunity to deter players from trying to simulate violent contact in ways made famous by Vlade Divac, Manu Ginobili and Anderson Varejao.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlotte Hornets===
On July 1, 1996, Divac was traded to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for the draft rights to [[Kobe Bryant]] and played two seasons there until signing with the Sacramento Kings in July 1998.

===Two games with KK Crvena zvezda===
During the [[1998–99 NBA lockout]], in January 1999, Divac played 2 games for Partizan's [[Eternal derby (Serbia)|eternal rival]] [[KK Crvena Zvezda]], in the [[1998–99 FIBA EuroLeague|1998–99 EuroLeague season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.roundID_2570.season_1999.teamID_1490.playerID_2626.html |title=profile |publisher=Fibaeurope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His debut for the ''crveno-beli'' took place mid-season, on [[Orthodox Christmas]], versus a heavily favoured [[BC Žalgiris|Žalgiris]] side led by [[Tyus Edney]], [[Mindaugas Žukauskas]], [[Saulius Štombergas]], and [[George Zidek|Jiří Zídek Jr.]]. Supported by a raucous home crowd and energized by Divac's arrival, as well as his 16 points and 8 rebounds, Crvena zvezda pulled off a 77-69 memorable upset win.&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mondo.rs/a767526/Sport/Kosarka/Zvezda-Zalgiris-secanje-na-debi-Vlade-Divca.html|title=Prošli put protiv Žalgirisa za Zvezdu je igrao...|agency=mondo.rs|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divac's brief stint with Crvena zvezda, for which he reportedly got paid US$250,000 per game,&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt; immediately became a sore point with KK Partizan fans, who unfurled a banner calling him a traitor, at their club's next game.&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt;

The issue of playing for the hated cross-town rival reignited several years later, when Divac returned to KK Partizan as club president. At the time, he stated his decision to play for Crvena zvezda was "a mistake".&lt;ref name="mondo-feb-2015"/&gt;

===Sacramento Kings===
He then signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Sacramento Kings]] where he played for six seasons alongside fellow countryman [[Peja Stojaković]]. Teamed with Stojaković, [[Hedo Türkoğlu]], [[Chris Webber]] and [[Mike Bibby]]; Divac revitalized the [[Sacramento Kings]] franchise. The Kings rose in the NBA ranks, becoming a perennial playoff contender and eventually a championship contender, leading the league in wins in [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2002&amp;group=league&amp;seasontype=2&amp;standType=standings |title=NBA Standings – 2001–2002 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kings, however, could not get past the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who beat them in a  [[2002 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|7-game series in 2002.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/ex-referee-tim-donaghy-blows-whistle-nba-dirty-secrets-article-1.293192|title=Ex-referee Tim Donaghy blows whistle on NBA dirty secrets|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the Lakers===
After the [[2003–04 NBA season]], Divac became a [[free agent]]. He signed a deal to return to the Lakers, part of [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s plan to overhaul Laker basketball. The Lakers, following a defeat in the NBA Finals, had traded away or released most of their players, including [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Gary Payton]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Derek Fisher]], and more; Divac was supposed to help fill that void.

However, Divac suffered back problems and could not play most of the season, and even when he returned, could only play about nine minutes per game, averaging 2.3 points per game and 2.1 rebounds per game in 15 games, he played 8 games early in the season and 7 more in the final month of the season.

On 14 July 2005, 37-year-old Divac announced his retirement, ending his sixteen-year NBA and twenty-two-year professional basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/divac_retires_051018.html|title=Vlade Divac Announces Retirement; Accepts Position With Lakers - THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac accepted a position with the Lakers as a European liaison to help with scouting overseas.

===Retirement===
The Kings retired his No. 21 jersey in a ceremony on March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090401/ap_on_sp_bk_ne/bkn_kings_divac_honored;_ylt=An5HUchghgZmP09wgS_FjaILMxIF Kings retire Divac's No. 21 Jersey]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Yahoo!

==National team==
[[File:Vlade Divac &amp; Drazen Petrovic in Argentina 1990.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Divac with [[Dražen Petrović]] in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] held in Argentina.]]

In summer 1986, at 18, right after signing for KK Partizan, Divac debuted for the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team]] at the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]] in Madrid, on invitation by the head coach [[Krešimir Ćosić]]. However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]]. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a [[double dribble]], the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt;

The next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the FIBA Junior World Championship (since split into separate [[FIBA Under-19 World Championship|under-19]] and [[FIBA Under-21 World Championship|under-21]] events) in [[Bormio]], Italy. That event launched the young generation of Yugoslavian basket ballers, also featuring stars like Rađa and Kukoč, regarded as likely the best in history. Before the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], they would also take the titles at [[EuroBasket 1989]] and the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name="vreme" /&gt; where they were led by [[Dražen Petrović]],&lt;ref name="fiba1989"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_390.compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_1989.roundID_938.html |title=Eurobasket 1989 |publisher=[[FIBA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[EuroBasket 1991]] title, with [[Aleksandar Đorđević]] at [[point guard]].&lt;ref name="fiba1991"&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_390.compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_1991.roundID_2263.html |title=Eurobasket 1991 |publisher=[[FIBA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yugoslavia 1990 basketball.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Divac (fourth from right, at centre) with the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia team]] that won the [[EuroBasket 1989]].]]
When Yugoslavia won the gold in the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]], fans rushed onto the court. One of them was holding a [[Croatia]]n flag, one of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.&lt;ref name=once&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/once-brothers,46215/| title=Once Brothers |publisher=A. V. club |author=Scott Tobias |date=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-vlade-divac-20101012 |title=Television review: Vlade Divac searches for closure in ESPN's 'Once Brothers' |publisher=LA Times |author=John Scheibe |date=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action, along with the [[Yugoslav Wars]], alienated Divac from many of his former Croatian friends, particularly [[Dražen Petrović]], whom he considered his best friend.&lt;ref name=once/&gt; When Yugoslavia won [[EuroBasket 1995]], and [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] won bronze, Croatia, still at [[War in Croatia|war with Serbs from Croatia]], walked off the podium during the medal ceremony. The teams had not faced each other in the tournament.

==Administrative career==
Through the twilight of his playing career and afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.

===KK Partizan president===
In late 2000, following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]] whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s,&lt;ref name="si-may1999-Rick Reilly"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1999/05/24/261148/vlade-divacs-private-war |title=Vlade Divac's Private War |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=1999-05-24 |author=[[Rick Reilly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac and former teammate [[Predrag Danilović]] took over their former club [[KK Partizan]]. They did so on initiative by [[Ivica Dačić]], the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milošević, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from régime change, Dačić saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilović took the vice-president role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Dačića |work=[[Blic]] |date=2008-10-16 |author=Ž. Jevtić}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshly retired from playing, Danilović was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000–01 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Duško Vujošević]] to be the new head coach.

Though the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.

===LA Lakers scout===
In October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the position in 2006.

===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===
In June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatović]], Divac linked up with [[Ramón Calderón]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calderón presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El País]]''|date=5 June 2006|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Calderón closely won the club elections on 2 July 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calderón's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.&lt;ref name="elmundo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El increíble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=4 April 2008|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como "asesor" y con el "gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa"|agency=''[[El País]]''|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': "I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image. I only accepted the job because of Mijatović, who is currently the football director at Real".&lt;ref name="mondo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mondo.rs/a52680/Sport/Kosarka/Divac-Kandidovacu-se-za-predsednika-Srbije.html |title=Divac: Kandidovaću se za predsednika Srbije |publisher=MONDO web portal |language=Serbian |date=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2007, following a financial settlement between the two parties, Divac moved on from the post for which he had been reportedly receiving an annual compensation of [[€]]300,000.&lt;ref name="elmundo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol/vlade-divac-cobro-300000-euros-por-no-hacer-nada-5822564|title=Vlade Divac cobró 300.000 euros por no hacer nada|agency=Sport.es|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's adviser===
In October 2008, Divac's [[political consulting|political advisory]] engagement within the [[Cabinet of Mirko Cvetković|Serbian government]] as the sports, [[diaspora]], and humanitarian advisor to the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[Ivica Dačić]], got announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=J.|first=Ž.|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/divac-dobija-kancelariju-u-vladi/gvxrmfk|title=Divac dobija kancelariju u Vladi|agency=''[[Blic]]''|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2008/10/16/vlade_divac_appointed_adviser_to_serbia.html|title=Vlade Divac appointed adviser to Serbia|agency=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Janis|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2008/10/16/divac-playing-new-role/|title=Divac playing new role|agency=''[[Orange County Register]]''|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic Committee of Serbia president===
Divac was proposed in 2000 as Yugoslavia's candidate for the Sport Commission of the International Olympic Committee in spring 2000. This candidature was withdrawn under pressure from Milošević regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/490/03.html|title=Apel "Vremena" H.A. Samaranu|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Divac ran for presidency of the [[Olympic Committee of Serbia]] against incumbent president [[Ivan Ćurković]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/sports.php?id=3867 |title=Curkovic backs Divac bid |publisher=[[Blic]] |date=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215120515/http://www.blic.rs/sports.php?id=3867 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the race after Ćurković withdrew just before the scheduled voting.&lt;ref name="blicokserb" /&gt; In November 2012, he was re-elected as the sole candidate; the end of his second mandate coincides with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name=oks/&gt;

In December 2014, [[Kosovo]] was accepted as a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Divac and the Serbian Olympic Committee have been criticised, chiefly by the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]], for failing to take any effort to prevent that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/politika/dss-da-li-je-divac-pokusao-da-spreci-ulazak-kosova-u-mok_547452.html |title=DSS: Da li je Divac pokušao da spreči ulazak Kosova u MOK |publisher=Radio Television of Vojvodina |date=2014-12-14 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac stated that he is not happy with the decision of the IOC, but could not have prevented it as it had already been made, and said he would accept it "in the interest of the athletes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/olympics-kosovo-idINKBN0JN10S20141209 |title=Kosovo earns Olympic recognition, Serbia furious |agency=Reuters |date=December 10, 2014 |author=Karolos Grohmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2017, he was succeeded by Serbian former basketball coach [[Božidar Maljković]] on position of the president of [[Olympic Committee of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.blic.rs/ostali-sportovi/bozidar-maljkovic-novi-predsednik-olimpijskog-komiteta-srbije/ws3p3fb Božidar Maljković novi predsednik Olimpijskog komiteta Srbije!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacramento Kings front office===
====Initial advisory role====
In early March 2015, Divac was hired by the [[Sacramento Kings]] as their vice president of basketball and franchise operations.&lt;ref name="divac-kings-march2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/kings/2015/03/03/vlade-divac-sacramento-vice-president-basketball-franchise-operations-george-karl/24326819/ |title=Kings hire Vlade Divac as vice president, adviser |work=USA Today Sports |date=2015-03-03 |author=Adi Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brought into the organization by the principal owner [[Vivek Ranadivé]] towards the end of a turbulent [[2014–15 Sacramento Kings season|season]], Divac's arrival came in the wake of head coach [[Michael Malone (basketball)|Mike Malone]]'s firing and the eventual hiring of [[George Karl]]. Working alongside the team's general manager [[Pete D'Alessandro]], Divac's initial duties with the Kings were reported to be advising the front office and coaches as well as assisting with branding and fan outreach.&lt;ref name="divac-kings-march2015"/&gt; However, such broadly defined job responsibilities immediately led to press speculation about Divac's role within the organization that in addition to general manager D'Alessandro also featured assistant GM [[Mike Bratz]], special assistant to the GM [[Mitch Richmond]], director of player personnel and analytics [[Dean Oliver (statistician)|Dean Oliver]], adviser to the chairman [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]], as well as a head coach, Karl, who has always wanted to be involved in personnel issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/3/20/8263149/vivek-ranadive-kings-front-office-warriors-vlade-divac|title=The Kings are trying hard to be the Warriors and failing miserably|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month of Divac's hiring, [[ESPN]]'s [[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] reported that "despite the Kings not yet announcing their new power structure, Divac is indeed already regarded as the team's top basketball official by owner Ranadivé".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12644960/vlade-divac-emerges-sacramento-kings-lead-voice|title=Vlade Divac emerges as Kings' lead voice|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 2015, two weeks before the NBA draft, general manager D'Alessandro left the Kings by accepting a front-office position with the Denver Nuggets amid reports he did so due to being stripped of his decision-making power after Ranadivé hired Divac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jason|url=http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article23669575.html|title=Kings general manager Pete D’Alessandro takes job with Nuggets|agency=''[[Sacramento Bee]]''|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/6/11/8764711/sacramento-kings-front-office-vlade-divac-vivek-ranadive|title=The Kings front office is even messier than it appears|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only days before the draft, animosity between head coach Karl and the team's star center [[DeMarcus Cousins]] reignited, as Karl reportedly lobbied Divac, as well as multiple players on the Kings' roster, in order to make the case to owner Ranadive that Cousins needs to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Adrian Wojnarowski|Wojnarowski]]|first=[[Adrian Wojnarowski|Adrian]]|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--george-karl-pushing-for-kings-to-trade-demarcus-cousins-051748948.html|title=Sources: George Karl pushing for Kings to trade DeMarcus Cousins|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, against the backdrop of Cousins calling Karl a "snake" on Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zller|first=Tom|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/23/8830539/george-karl-snake-demarcus-cousins-history|title=A brief history of NBA stars calling George Karl a snake|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac reportedly discussed multiple Cousins trade scenarios with various teams, but ultimately no deal got made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings-talking-to-lakers-about-demarcus-cousins-trade--fielding-offers-from-other-teams-030157845.html|title=Sources: Kings talking to Lakers about DeMarcus Cousins trade, fielding offers from other teams|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2015 NBA draft]], with the 6th pick, the Kings selected 21-year-old center [[Willie Cauley-Stein]] out of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. Less than a week following the draft, with the dissolution of the Karl—Cousins relationship on public display, the Kings' ultimately unsuccessful attempt at landing University of Kentucky head coach [[John Calipari]] to replace Karl got reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings--john-calipari--kentucky-195614697.html|title=Sources: Kings probing John Calipari about coaching, front-office jobs|agency=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in early July 2015, in an effort of clearing [[NBA salary cap|salary cap]] space in order to immediately go after [[free agent]]s, they agreed a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers, sending [[Nick Stauskas]], [[Carl Landry]], [[Jason Thompson (basketball)|Jason Thompson]] along with the Kings' future first round draft pick to the Sixers as well as the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017 while receiving the rights to Sixers oversees players [[Artūras Gudaitis]] and [[Luka Mitrović]] in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Dan|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/07/01/76ers-get-nik-stauskas-in-salary-dump-trade-with-kings/|title=76ers get Nik Stauskas, first-rounder in salary-dump trade with Kings|agency=[[NBC Sports]]|date=1 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, they agreed the acquisitions of two free agents: twenty-nine-year-old [[Marco Belinelli]] on a three-year US$19 million contract and twenty-nine-year-old point guard [[Rajon Rondo]] for one year for US$10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbert|first=James|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rajon-rondo-kings-agree-to-1-year-10-million-deal/|title=Rajon Rondo, Kings agree to 1-year, $10 million deal
|agency=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by signing twenty-six-year-old center [[Kosta Koufos]] for four years and US$33 million with his role envisioned as backup for Cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golliver|first=Ben|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/07/kosta-koufos-sacramento-kings-free-agency-grades-demarcus-cousins|title=Grade the deal: Kings cap strange summer by signing Kosta Koufos|agency=[[SI.com]]|date=7 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the free agent signings done, Divac turned his attention to attempting to mend the relations between the team's head coach Karl and its star center Cousins ahead of the 2015-16 season, admitting publicly on 9 July 2015 on [[CBS Sports Radio]]'s ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'' that the relationship between the two "isn't pretty right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13229088/vlade-divac-sacramento-kings-george-karl-demarcus-cousins-union-not-pretty-right-now|title=Vlade Divac working to make Karl-Cousins relationship better|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, on 13 July 2015, during a [[2015 NBA Summer League]] game in [[Las Vegas]], the two shared an awkward on-camera handshake as Karl approached and Cousins reluctantly shook the coach's hand before turning away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kings-coach-george-karl-demarcus-cousins-share-awkward/story?id=32439225|title=Kings coach George Karl, DeMarcus Cousins share awkward handshake|agency=[[Abcnews.go.com]]|date=14 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voisin-april-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Voisin|first=Ailene|url=https://www.sacbee.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/ailene-voisin/article74937347.html|title=George Karl reflective after firing by Kings|agency=''[[Sacramento Bee]]''|date=30 April 2016|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, Divac summoned Cousins and Karl to a private counseling session.&lt;ref name="voisin-april-2016"/&gt;

====Promotion to general manager====
Divac was promoted to the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager on 31 August 2015.&lt;ref name="divac-gm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/kings/new/kings-announce-basketball-operations-update|title=Kings Announce Basketball Operations Update|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|date=August 31, 2015|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their final season in [[Sleep Train Arena]], the team's home since 1988, it was also their first 30 plus win campaign after seven consecutive seasons of fewer than 30 wins.

Early into the team's off-season, in mid April 2016, the Kings organization fired head coach George Karl, a decision made by Divac who had reportedly been pushing for it for months.&lt;ref name="Kings-fire-Karl"/&gt; Within three weeks, during which Divac interviewed head coaching candidates [[Sam Mitchell (basketball)|Sam Mitchell]], [[Vinny Del Negro]], [[Mike Woodson]], [[David Blatt]], [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Nate McMillan]], [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Elston Turner]], and [[Corliss Williamson]],&lt;ref name="Joerger-hired"&gt;{{cite news|author=ESPN.com news services|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15494387/sacramento-kings-dave-joerger-agree-four-year-deal|title=Dave Joerger agrees to four-year deal to coach Kings|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kings hired [[Dave Joerger]] as their new head coach, signing him to a four-year deal worth [[US$]]16 million.&lt;ref name="Joerger-hired"/&gt; At the [[2016 NBA draft]], with the 8th pick, the Kings selected [[Marquese Chriss]] out of the [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|University of Washington]], but traded him to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for rights to [[Bogdan Bogdanović (basketball)|Bogdan Bogdanović]] as well as the Suns' 2016 draft 13th and 28th picks, [[Georgios Papagiannis]] and [[Skal Labissière]], respectively.

At the [[2017 NBA draft]], with the 5th pick, the Kings selected point guard [[De'Aaron Fox]] out of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]].

==Investments==
Divac has been involved in many non-basketball endeavors while still actively playing in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and more so after he retired. He is an active restaurant investor in the [[Sacramento, California]] area. However, his attempts to make major investments in Serbia failed, for a variety of reasons.

The most notable affair was a highly publicized business venture—takeover bid of profitable beverage producer [[Knjaz Miloš]]. Divac's company "Apurna", in a joint venture with French dairy giant [[Danone]], ostensibly proposed the best bid, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56547&amp;n=wh49&amp;c=%23emailcode |title=Knjaz Milos auction descends into chaos |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Chris Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the repeated bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to [[FPP Balkan Ltd.]], a privatization fund from the [[Cayman Islands]]. The entire messy affair caused great friction within the [[Serbian government]], wide speculation about corruption, resignation of the Securities Commission chief, and even a police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56659-danone-pulls-out |title=Danone pulls out of Serbian soft drink bidding race |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=2004-12-08 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Chris Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar, though less spectacular, episode happened with 2005 Divac's attempt to take over the ''[[Večernje novosti]]'', a Serbian high-circulation daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Država preigrala Divca |url=http://www.nuns.org.yu/dosije/18/10.jsp |author=Vera Didanović |publisher=nuns.org |date=2006-01-03 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228181340/http://www.nuns.org.yu/dosije/18/10.jsp |archivedate=2009-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an agreement with small shareholders to take over the company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital. However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move.  While the attempted takeover was a "backdoor" one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already occurred. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily. Even though the [[Supreme Court of Serbia]] eventually ruled in Divac's favor, he withdrew from the contest, citing "friendly advice" by unnamed persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBA ace Vlade Divac slam dunks the Serbian government |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2006/07/06/feature-02 |author=Georgi Mitev-Shantek |publisher=Southeast European Times |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered, he decided to stop his attempts to invest in Serbia: "All of this is ugly and I'm very upset... I realized that there's no place for me in Serbia and my friends can meet me in Madrid from now on... In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnevnik.rs/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12484 |title=Vukčević: Dijaspora će zapamtiti kako je prošao Divac |publisher=[[Dnevnik (Novi Sad)]] |language=Serbian |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |author=Lj. Malešević}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, that turned out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally registered as 100% owner of [[Voda Voda]], a [[bottled water]] brand previously owned by businessman [[Vojin Đorđević]]. That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a [[gentlemen's agreement]] they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the [[Serbian Business Registers Agency]]. The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's [[Si&amp;Si]] company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill his part of the deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.&lt;ref name="politika"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.co.rs/infocus.php?id=947 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416121130/http://www.blic.co.rs/infocus.php?id=947 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title='You are insulting me while you have debts' |date=2007-10-31 |publisher=[[Blic]] |accessdate=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b92voda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=45059 |title=Government to intervene in Voda Voda feud |date=2007-11-02 |publisher=[[B92]] |accessdate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107103443/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=45059 |archivedate=2007-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divac is a humanitarian worker, focusing on aid to children worldwide and refugees in his home country. Along with six Serbian basketball teammates, Divac established the charity called [[Group Seven]], later renamed to "Divac's Children Foundation", and works closely with [[International Orthodox Christian Charities]] (IOCC), helping them to raise around US$500,000 for humanitarian assistance in Serbia since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://divac.com/aboutus.html |title=About us |publisher=Divac's Children Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divac's own foundation, presided by his wife Snežana, provided over $2,500,000 in humanitarian assistance through 1998–2007.&lt;ref name="nba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/news/divac_youcantoo_070922.html |title=Divac Creates New Team With "You Can Too" Campaign |publisher=[[NBA.com]] |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007 Divac founded a humanitarian organization, "You Can Too" ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Можеш и ти/Možeš i ti''), bent on assisting the refugees in Serbia. Serbia has around 500,000 refugees from the 1990s [[Yugoslav wars]], making it the country with the largest refugee problem in Europe.&lt;ref name="nba" /&gt;  Around 7,800 of those people still live in collective centers under poor conditions, so the organization has vouched itself to buy abandoned countryside houses, in an attempt to finally solve their accommodation problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=264626 |title=Divac za 7.850 izbeglica |publisher=[[B92]] |language=Serbian |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 21 to 23, 2007, Divac organized an official farewell from active basketball career in his hometown Prijepolje and Belgrade, simultaneously promoting the "You Can Too" campaign. The spectacle culminated in gathering of Divac and his worldwide friends in front of 10,000 people outside the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_id=264726 |title=Spektakularni oproštaj Divca |publisher=[[B92]] |language=Serbian |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the early 1990s, the song "Vlade Divac" by Belgrade band [[Deca Loših Muzičara]], devoted to his transfer to Lakers, was a big hit; the band finally got to personally meet Divac and perform the song with him on his farewell party in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arhiva.kurir-info.rs/Arhiva/2007/septembar/22/ST-06-22092007.shtml |title=Deca Loših Muzičara pevaju za Divca! |publisher=[[Kurir]] |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with the Lakers, Divac's popularity and marketing potential, in addition to his entertaining and good-natured personality, were picked up on by the American TV industry. As a result, he appeared quite a few times on Los Angeles-based late night programmes such as ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. In 1990, he was featured in a commercial with Laker teammates [[A. C. Green]] and [[Mychal Thompson]] for the [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] brand razors company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTx6K3Irag |title=1990 – Schick – Vlade Divac, A.C. Green, Mychal Thompson |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in American [[sitcom]]s ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', as well as in the short lived ''[[Good Sports]]'' sitcom. On the big screen Divac took part in basketball-based movies ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]'', ''[[Space Jam]]'' and ''[[Juwanna Mann]]''. Later in his career, he appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in 1999 and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' in 2002.

In Serbia, all throughout his playing career, Divac regularly appeared in commercials pitching products ranging from Atlas Beer to [[Société Générale Yugoslav Bank|Société Générale Bank]] mortgage credit plans. He appeared in a national TV commercial in the United States alongside former NBA star [[Darryl Dawkins]] for [[Taco Bell]].

Divac appeared as a special guest on [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|Eurovision 2008]]. He threw a ball into the audience, which marked the beginning of [[televoting]].

Divac features in the [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' documentary ''[[Once Brothers]]'', where he discusses the exploits of the [[Yugoslavia national basketball team]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s and how the Yugoslav Wars tore them apart, especially in context of his broken friendship with Croatian player [[Dražen Petrović]].&lt;ref name=once/&gt;

Divac appears in [[Boris Malagurski]]'s documentary film ''[[The Weight of Chains]]'', in which he talks about the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

==Personal life==
Divac and his wife, Snežana, have two sons, Luka and Matija, and an adopted daughter, Petra, whose biological parents were killed by [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] snipers during the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name="si-may1999-Rick Reilly"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">'''Václav Junek''' (born June 17, 1951) is a Czech businessman.

Junek was a chairman of bankrupt conglomerate Chemapol Group.

Junek's company Chemapol Reality (C.H.R.) purchased from [[Václav Havel]] his 50 percent stake in a legendary dance-hall [[Lucerna Palace]] on [[Wenceslas Square]] for CZK 200 mio.  It sold it two years later to Dagmar Havlová for CZK 145 mio. Later, the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Radio, [http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/72319 Spor o Lucernu nekončí, konkurzní správce však myslí na smír], 2005-11-02 (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commercial register at justice.cz, identification number (IČ) 25056808, C.H.R., a.s., the company was registered on June 10, 1996, bankruptcy declared on January 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Junek publicly admitted Chemapol bribed the politicians of [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] (ČSSD). The ruling ČSSD politicians secretly used gas cards issued to name of Chemapol to get gas for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://carolina.cuni.cz/archive-en/Carolina-E-No-346.txt |title= Social Democrats Accused of Tax Evasion |work= Carolina |author= Ondrej Maly |author2=Zuzana Janeckova  |date=1999-10-08 |issue=346 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2018, Julian Assange stepped down as editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Purpose===
According to the WikiLeaks website, its goal is "to bring important news and information to the public ... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth." Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that journalists and [[whistleblower]]s are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online "drop box" is described by the WikiLeaks website as "an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to [WikiLeaks] journalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epic.org/foia/epic_v_doj_fbi_wikileaks.html |publisher=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] |title=EPIC v.

Some describe WikiLeaks as a media or journalistic organisation. For example, in a 2013 resolution, the [[International Federation of Journalists]], a trade union of journalists, called WikiLeaks a "new breed of media organisation" that "offers important opportunities for media organisations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliance.org.au/global-journalists-union-supports-wikileaks |title=Global journalists' union supports Wikileaks |publisher=Alliance.org.au |date=16 July 2013 |access-date=2 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231025031/http://www.alliance.org.au/global-journalists-union-supports-wikileaks |archivedate=31 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Yochai Benkler]] praised WikiLeaks as a new form of journalistic enterprise,&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau, [https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2013/07/10/harvard-prof-is-star-witness-at-wikileaks-trial Harvard prof is star witness at WikiLeaks trial], Associated Press (13 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; testifying at the court-martial of Chelsea Manning (then Bradley Manning) that "WikiLeaks did serve a particular journalistic function," and that the "range of the journalist's privilege" is "a hard line to draw".&lt;ref&gt;Rainey Reitman, [https://freedom.press/blog/2016/04/transcript-yochai-benkler-testifies-bradley-manning-trial Transcript: Yochai Benkler Testifies at Bradley Manning Trial], Freedom of the Press Foundation (10 July 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Others do not consider WikiLeaks to be journalistic in nature. Media ethicist Kelly McBride of the [[Poynter Institute for Media Studies]] wrote in 2011: "WikiLeaks might grow into a journalist endeavor. But it's not there yet."&lt;ref name="McBridge"&gt;Kelly McBridge, "What Is WikiLeaks? That's the Wrong Question" in ''Page One: Inside the New York Times and the Future of Journalism'' (ed. [[David Folkenflik]]: PublicAffairs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Keller]] of ''The New York Times'' considers WikiLeaks to be a "complicated source" rather than a journalistic partner.&lt;ref name="McBridge" /&gt; Prominent [[First Amendment]] lawyer [[Floyd Abrams]] writes that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic group, but instead "an organization of political activists; ... a source for journalists; and ... a conduit of leaked information to the press and the public".&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;[[Floyd Abrams]], ''Friend of the Court: On the Front Lines with the First Amendment'' (Yale University Press, 2013), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Assange's statements that he and his colleagues read only a small fraction of information before deciding to publish it, Abrams writes: "No journalistic entity I have ever heard of—none—simply releases to the world an elephantine amount of material it has not read."&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;

Furthermore, "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade [[encryption]] to protect sources and other confidential information." Such arrangements have been called "[[bulletproof hosting]]".&lt;ref name="goodwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/25/what-is-wikileaks/?iref=storysearch |title=What is WikiLeaks? |work=This Just In (CNN blog) |date=25 July 2010 |access-date=6 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114095005/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/25/what-is-wikileaks/?iref=storysearch |archivedate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company further explained: "There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of service state that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content ... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.'

WikiLeaks used [[EveryDNS]], but was dropped by the company after distributed denial-of-service ([[DDoS]]) attacks against WikiLeaks hurt the quality of service for its other customers. Supporters of WikiLeaks waged verbal and DDoS attacks on EveryDNS. Because of a typographical error in blogs mistaking EveryDNS for competitor ''[[EasyDNS]]'', the sizeable Internet backlash hit EasyDNS. Despite that, EasyDNS (upon request of a customer who was setting up new WikiLeaks hosting) began providing WikiLeaks with DNS service on "two 'battle hardened' servers" to protect the quality of service for its other customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Canadian firm caught up in Wiki wars |first=Steve |last=Ladurantaye |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |place=Toronto |date=8 December 2010 |access-date=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727052959/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |archivedate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks restructured its process for contributions after its first document leaks did not gain much attention. Assange stated this was part of an attempt to take the voluntary effort typically seen in "Wiki" projects, and "redirect it to ... material that has real potential for change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yGgurMv2Y_EC&amp;pg=PT393&amp;lpg=PT393&amp;dq=why+no+longer+contribute+to+wikileaks#v=onepage&amp;q=why%20no%20longer%20contribute%20to%20wikileaks&amp;f=false |title=A Companion to New Media Dynamics |last=Hartley |first=John |last2=Burgess |first2=Jean |last3=Bruns |first3=Axel |date=9 January 2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118321638 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sympathisers were unhappy{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} when WikiLeaks ended a community-based [[wiki]] format in favour of a more centralised organisation.

However, WikiLeaks established an editorial policy that accepted only documents that were "of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest" (and excluded "material that is already publicly available").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Submissions |title=WikiLeaks' submissions page |publisher=WikiLeaks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419013425/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks%3ASubmissions |archivedate=19 April 2008 |deadurl=yes|access-date=17 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote "automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2007/01/wikileaks_and_untraceable_docu/ |title=Wikileaks and untraceable document disclosure |author=Aftergood, Steven |date=3 January 2007 |work=Secrecy News|access-date=21 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311214041/https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2007/01/wikileaks_and_untraceable_docu.html |archivedate=11 March 2013 |deadurl=no |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original FAQ is no longer in effect, and no one can post or edit documents on WikiLeaks. Now, submissions to WikiLeaks are reviewed by anonymous WikiLeaks reviewers, and documents that do not meet the editorial criteria are rejected.

==Legal status==
{{Further|Reception of WikiLeaks}}The legal status of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange considers WikiLeaks a protection intermediary.

===Use of leaked documents in court===

In a [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] judgement given on 8 February 2018, the court unanimously decided that a document leaked through WikiLeaks "could be admitted into evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/3.html|title=R (on the application of Bancoult No 3) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Respondent)|publisher=United Kingdom Supreme Court|date=2018-02-08|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brickcourt.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brickcourt.co.uk/news/detail/supreme-court-admits-wikileaks-documents-about-chagos-islanders-into-evidence|title=Supreme Court considers important test of Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents|publisher=Brick Court Chambers|date=2018-02-12|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal that led to this ruling centred on a US government cable provided by [[Chelsea Manning]] and published by WikiLeaks. The [[Chagos islanders]] argued that the document showed the UK's motive for setting up a marine park on their territory was improper, but it had been excluded from proceedings earlier in the case.&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/418330-wikileaks-cables-supreme-court-chagos/|title=Leaked US documents can be used as evidence, rules UK Supreme Court|publisher=Russia Today|date=2018-02-09|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an "important test of Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents" The Court ruled that "the cable should have been admitted into evidence before the Administrative Court", addressing the main issue. During this decision, the leaked document was said to not meet the criteria necessary to help the Chagos Refugee Group [[Expulsion of the Chagossians|recover their homeland]].&lt;ref name="brickcourt.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

==Financing==
WikiLeaks is a self-described [[not-for-profit organisation]], funded largely by volunteers, and it is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]] and [[E-commerce payment system|online payment systems]]. According to Assange, WikiLeaks' lawyers often work pro bono. Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the [[Associated Press]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]].&lt;ref name="leakonomy" /&gt; Assange said in 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents.&lt;ref name="leakonomy" /&gt; During September 2011, WikiLeaks began auctioning items on [[eBay]] to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On 24 December 2009, WikiLeaks announced that it was experiencing a shortage of funds{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; and suspended all access to its website except for a form to submit new material.&lt;ref name="digdeep"/&gt; Material that was previously published was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial [[mirror website]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiLeaks&amp;nbsp;– Mirrors |url=http://wikileaks.ch/Mirrors.html |publisher=WikiLeaks |access-date=18 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ulmvdkVL?url=http://wikileaks.ch/mirrors.html |archivedate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks stated on its website that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were paid.&lt;ref name="digdeep"&gt;{{cite news |last=Butselaar |first=Emily |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/29/wikileaks-shut-down |title=Dig deep for WikiLeaks |work=The Guardian |date=29 January 2010 |access-date =30 January 2010 |place=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827012108/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/29/wikileaks-shut-down |archivedate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks saw this as a kind of work stoppage "to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue".&lt;ref name="leakonomy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Leak-o-nomy: The Economy of Wikileaks (Interview with Julian Assange) |author=Mey, Stefan |url=http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/ |access-date=19 December 2010 |work=Medien-Ökonomie-Blog |date=4 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213110334/http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/ |archivedate=13 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the organisation initially planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; it was not until 3 February 2010 that WikiLeaks announced that its minimum fundraising goal had been achieved.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]] helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation stated that WikiLeaks was not receiving any money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth.&lt;ref name="techeye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations |title=Wau Holland Foundation sheds light on WikiLeaks donations&amp;nbsp;– Hardware, ISP, travelling costs |publisher=TechEye.net |date=13 July 2010 |access-date=1 August 2010 |author=Daly, John W. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727011201/http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations#ixzz0td0dXhBx |archivedate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in [[TechEye]] stated: 

{{quote|As a charity accountable under German law, donations for WikiLeaks can be made to the foundation.

The foundation does not pay any sort of salary nor give any renumeration {{sic}} to WikiLeaks' personnel, corroborating the statement of the site's former German representative Daniel Schmitt [real name [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]]]&lt;ref name="bates"/&gt; on national television that all personnel works voluntarily, even its speakers.&lt;ref name=techeye/&gt;}}

However, in December 2010 the [[Wau Holland Foundation]] stated that 4 permanent employees, including Julian Assange, had begun to receive salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20101223-31975.html |work=The Local |place=Berlin |title=Wikileaks donations still flowing, but not to Assange legal fund |access-date=23 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002143644/http://m.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20101223-31975.html |archivedate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Assange said the organisation was registered as a library in Australia, a foundation in France, and a newspaper in Sweden, and that it also used two United States-based non-profit [[501c3]] organisations for funding purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704554104575436231926853198 |title=How WikiLeaks Keeps Its Funding Secret |date=23 August 2015|access-date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2010, the Internet payment intermediary [[PayPal]] suspended WikiLeaks' donation account and froze its assets. WikiLeaks said that this had happened before, and was done for "no obvious reason".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; The account was restored on 25 January 2010.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; On 18 May 2010, WikiLeaks announced that its website and archive were operational again.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

In June 2010, WikiLeaks was a finalist for a grant of more than half a million dollars from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Khatchdourian"/&gt; but did not make the final approval.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Noam |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/knight-foundation-hands-out-grants-to-12-groups-but-not-wikileaks/ |title=Knight Foundation Hands Out Grants to 12 Groups, but Not WikiLeaks |work=Media Decoder Blog |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks commented via Twitter: "WikiLeaks was highest rated project in the Knight challenge, strongly recommended to the board but gets no funding.

Lee]], who has done PR work for WikiLeaks with the press and on social networking websites.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;

During 2010, WikiLeaks received €635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less €30,000 in PayPal fees, and €695,925.46 in bank transfers. €500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments 4 December. €298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cryptome.org/0003/wl-finance-en.pdf |title="Project 04: Enduring freedom of information" Preliminary transparency report 2010 |publisher=Wau-Holland-Stiftung (WHS) ''via'' [[Cryptome]] |date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]], one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than €900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through [[PayPal]] as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account. He also noted that every new WikiLeaks publication brought "a wave of support", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donations Were Never as Strong as Now |work=Spiegel International |place=Hamburg |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,734318,00.html |access-date=15 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205752/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C734318%2C00.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing WikiLeaks |first=Scott |last=Horton |newspaper=Harper's Magazine |place=New York |date=6 August 2010 |url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007485 |access-date=15 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019211817/http://harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007485 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic judiciary decided that [[Valitor]] (a company related to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]]) was violating the law when it prevented donation to the site by credit card.

==Authenticity==
WikiLeaks has contended that it has never released a misattributed document and that documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks "are already well-placed in the mainstream media.

In July 2016, the [[Aspen Institute]]'s Homeland Security Group, a bipartisan counterterrorism organisation, warned that hackers who stole authentic data might "salt the files they release with plausible forgeries."&lt;ref name="Zorn"/&gt; Russian intelligence agencies have frequently used [[disinformation]] tactics, "which means carefully faked emails might be included in the WikiLeaks dumps.

The ''Guardian'' wrote that WikiLeaks, along with individuals and groups on the hard right, had been involved in the "ruthless exploitation of [Rich's] death for political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/07/seth-rich-trump-white-house-fox-news |title=The strange case of Fox News, Trump and the death of young Democrat Seth Rich |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=7 August 2017 |work=The Guardian|access-date=26 October 2017 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive director of the [[Sunlight Foundation]], an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of WikiLeaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the [[murder of Seth Rich]]: "If they feel like they have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it.

===Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton===
WikiLeaks has popularized [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]] about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which suggested Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals (which was later revealed to be false),&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/8/13563750/wikileaks-2016-election-statement |title=WikiLeaks just tried to justify its behavior this year in a bizarre Election Day statement |last=Beauchamp |first=Zack |newspaper=Vox|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.snopes.com/john-podesta-spirit-cooking/ |title=FALSE: Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta Involved in Satanic 'Spirit Cooking' |last=Evon |first=Dan |newspaper=snopes|access-date=8 November 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that the Democratic Party had [[Murder of Seth Rich|Seth Rich]] killed,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews,&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295116-wikileaks-piles-on-to-clinton-earpiece-conspiracy |title=WikiLeaks piles on to Clinton earpiece conspiracy |last=Firozi |first=Paulina |date=8 September 2016 |newspaper=TheHill|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange,&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.snopes.com/julian-assange-drone-strike/ |title=To Silence Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange? |last=LaCapria |first=Kim |newspaper=snopes|access-date=8 November 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health,&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/25/wikileaks-plays-doctor-gives-hillary-clinton-fake-disease.html |title=WikiLeaks Plays Doctor, Gives Hillary Clinton Fake Disease |last=Collins |first=Ben |date=25 August 2016 |website=The Daily Beast|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-conspiracy-theory-hillary-clinton_us_57d6f4b2e4b00642712ebbd0 |title=WikiLeaks Feeds Conspiracy Theories That Hillary Clinton Has Parkinson's Or Head Injury Complications |last=Reporter |first=Dana Liebelson Staff |last2=Post |first2=The Huffington |date=12 September 2016 |website=HuffPost|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump–related Internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper [[Laura Silsby]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/03/wikileaks-latest-find-is-a-conspiracy-theory-from-trump-s-subreddit.html |title=WikiLeaks' Latest 'Find' Is a Conspiracy Theory From Trump's Subreddit |last=Collins |first=Ben |date=4 November 2016 |website=The Daily Beast|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Allegations of anti-Americanism===
Short of simply disclosing information in the public interest, WikiLeaks has been accused of purposely targeting certain states and people, and presenting its disclosures in misleading and conspiratorial ways to harm those people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Writing in 2012, ''Foreign Policy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Joshua Keating noted that "nearly all its major operations have targeted the U.S. government or American corporations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/16/how-wikileaks-blew-it/ |title=How WikiLeaks Blew It |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 speech addressing the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] referred to WikiLeaks as "a non-state hostile intelligence service" and described founder Julian Assange as a narcissist, fraud, and coward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html |title=Director Pompeo Delivers Remarks at CSIS — Central Intelligence Agency |website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias ===
Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: "I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ... &amp;nbsp;she certainly should not become president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2016/06/why-julian-assange-doesnt-want-hillary-clinton-to-be-president/ |title=Why Julian Assange Doesn't Want Hillary Clinton to Be President |work=[[The Observer]] |date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, during an interview by [[Amy Goodman]], Julian Assange said that choosing between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]] is like choosing between [[cholera]] or [[gonorrhea]]. "Personally, I would prefer neither."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/julian-assange-us-election-2016-226281 Assange: 2016 election is like choosing between 'cholera or gonorrhea']". ''[[Politico]].'' 27 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks editor, [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]], has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/how-julian-assange-turned-wikileaks-into-trump-s-best-friend |title=How Julian Assange Turned WikiLeaks Into Trump's Best Friend |newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conversations that were leaked in February 2018, WikiLeaks expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;

Having released information that exposed the inner working of a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/ |title=WikiLeaks Turned Down Leaks on Russian Government During U.S. Presidential Campaign |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]], WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks even rejected the opportunity to publish unrelated leaks, because it dedicated all its resources to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. According to ''The New York Times'', WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html |title=Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic Convention |last=Savage |first=Charlie |date=26 July 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=23 October 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' noted that the leaks came at an important sensitive moment in the Clinton campaign, as she was preparing to announce her vice-presidential pick and unite the party behind her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/22/on-eve-of-democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/ |title=WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations |last=Hamburger |first=Tom |date=22 July 2016 |work=The Washington Post|access-date=23 October 2017 |last2=Tumulty |first2=Karen |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sunlight Foundation]], an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals: "It's become something else. It's not striving for objectivity. It's more careless. When they publish information it appears to be in service of some specific goal, of retribution, at the expense of the individual."&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

WikiLeaks explained its actions in a 2017 statement to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'': "WikiLeaks schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement. During distracting media events such as the Olympics or a high profile election, unrelated publications are sometimes delayed until the distraction passes but never are rejected for this reason."&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; On 7 October 2016, an hour after the media had begun to dedicate wall-to-wall coverage of the revelation that Trump had bragged on video about sexually harassing women, WikiLeaks began to release emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/07/politics/one-year-access-hollywood-russia-podesta-email/index.html |title=Access Hollywood and emails: One year later |last=Cohen |first=Marshall |publisher=CNN|access-date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/ |title=True: Wikileaks dumped Podesta emails hour after Trump video |work=@politifact|access-date=24 October 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN notes that due to extensive coverage of the Trump tapes, the leaks were an "afterthought" in news coverage.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Podesta suggested that the emails were timed to deflect attention from the Trump tapes.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;

In 2010, Donald Trump called WikiLeaks "disgraceful" and suggested that the "death penalty" should be a punishment for WikiLeaks' releases of information.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/politics/kfile-trump-wikileaks/index.html Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks 'disgraceful,' there 'should be like death penalty or something']". CNN.

(Retrieved 7 March 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; Trump made many references to WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign; by one estimate, he referenced disclosures by WikiLeaks over 160 times in speeches during the last 30 days of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/21/jackie-speier/did-trump-really-mention-wikileaks-over-160-times-/ |title=Did Trump mention WikiLeaks over 160 times in October 2016? |work=@politifact|access-date=9 May 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. ====
In November 2017, it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account corresponded with [[Donald Trump Jr.]] during the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/ |title=The Secret Correspondence Between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks |last=Ioffe |first=Julia |work=The Atlantic|access-date=13 November 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a false claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US. After ''The New York Times'' published a fragment of Donald Trump's tax returns for one year, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for one or more of his father's tax returns, explaining that it would be in his father's best interest because it would "dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality" and not come "through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC)."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to leak his own e-mails to them days after ''The New York Times'' broke a story about e-mail correspondence between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-affiliated lawyer; WikiLeaks said that it would be "beautifully confounding" for them to publish the e-mails and that it would deprive other news outlets from putting a negative spin on the correspondence.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

=== Allegations of Russian influence ===
In August 2016, after WikiLeaks published thousands of DNC emails, it was claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks. At the time, DNC officials made such claims, along with a number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-25/cybersecurity-experts-say-russia-hacked-the-democrats |title=Cyber-Experts Say Russia Hacked the Democratic National Committee |last=Lake |first=Eli |date=25 July 2016 |newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/heres-know-russia-dnc-hack/ |title=Here's What We Know About Russia and the DNC Hack |last=Glaser |first=April |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, the US intelligence community announced that it was "confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The US intelligence agencies said that the hacks were consistent with the methods of Russian-directed efforts, and that people high up within the Kremlin were likely involved.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On 14 October 2016, [[CNN]] reported that "there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]]."&lt;ref name="ufge"&gt;Jim Sciutto, Nicole Gaouette and Ryan Browne (14 October 2016).

In September 2016, the German weekly magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' reported that according to a confidential German government dossier, WikiLeaks had long since been infiltrated by Russian agents aiming to discredit [[NATO]] governments. The magazine added that French and British intelligence services had come to the same conclusion and said Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] receive details about what WikiLeaks publishes before publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/merkel-vorgefuehrt-russischer-geheimdienst-nutzt-wikileaks-fuer-kampagnen_id_5977879.html Russischer Geheimdienst nutzt WikiLeaks für Kampagnen] ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' 23 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Focus'' report followed a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' story that suggested that WikiLeaks may be a laundering machine for compromising material about Western countries gathered by Russian spies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West's Secrets] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 31 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2016, several news outlets, including ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', reported that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] concluded that Russia intelligence operatives provided materials to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Donald Trump's election bid. ''The Washington Post'' article stated: "The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html |title=Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House |date=9 December 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' article reported, "individuals linked to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of confidential emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report |title=CIA concludes Russia interfered to help Trump win election, say reports |date=10 December 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks has frequently been criticised for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; ''The Guardian'' notes that journalists are killed frequently in Russia, and notes that ''Freedom House'' has ranked Russian press freedom as "not free ... The main national news agenda is firmly controlled by the Kremlin. The government sets editorial policy at state-owned television stations, which dominate the media landscape and generate propagandistic content.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview |title=Julian Assange gives guarded praise of Trump and blasts Clinton in interview |last=Jacobs |first=Ben |date=24 December 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=25 December 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted criticism of the [[Panama Papers]], which had among other things revealed Russian businesses and individuals linked with [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] ties (Vladimir Putin's associates had as much as $2&amp;nbsp;billion in offshore accounts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/associates-of-russias-putin-had-2-billion-in-offshore-accounts-report-says/2016/04/03/25437e1e-f839-11e5-8b23-538270a1ca31_story.html |title=Putin associates had $2&amp;nbsp;billion in offshore accounts, report says |website=The Washington Post|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted, "#PanamaPapers Putin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia &amp; former USSR and was funded by USAID and [George] Soros".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Putin would later go on to dismiss the Panama Papers by citing WikiLeaks: "WikiLeaks has showed us that official people and official organs of the U.S. are behind this."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', both Assange claims are substance-free: "there is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russian-hack-report.html |title=What Intelligence Agencies Concluded About the Russian Attack on the U.S. Election |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=7 January 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange also falsely asserted that the Panama Papers gave Western figures a free pass, when the leaks in fact reported on a number of high-profile Western politicians, including UK Prime Minister David Cameron.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;

In 2012 when WikiLeaks began to run out of funds, Assange began to host a television show on Russia Today, Russia's state-owned news network.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html |title=How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West's Secrets |last=Erlanger |first=Jo Becker, Steven |date=31 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=6 January 2017 |last2=Schmitt |first2=Eric |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange has never disclosed how much he or WikiLeaks were paid for his tv-show.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

After President Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn resigned in February 2017 due to reports over his communications with Russian officials and subsequent lies over the content and nature of those communications, WikiLeaks tweeted that Flynn resigned "after destabilization campaign by U.S. spies, Democrats, press."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.771716 |title=Wikileaks: Flynn Resigned Due to 'Destabilization Campaign by U.S. Spies, Democrats, Press ' |last=Haaretz |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=14 February 2017 |last2=Press |first2=The Associated |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/319386-wikileaks-flynn-leaving-due-to-destabilization-campaign-by-dems-media |title=WikiLeaks: Flynn leaving due to 'destabilization campaign' by Dems, media |last=Shelbourne |first=Mallory |date=14 February 2017 |newspaper=TheHill|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]], which international human rights organisations and governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel attributed to the Syrian government, was a [[false flag]] attack.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/06/trump-loves-a-conspiracy-theory-now-his-allies-in-the-media-say-hes-falling-for-one-in-syria/ |title=Analysis {{!}} Trump loves a conspiracy theory.

In May 2017, cybersecurity experts stated that they believed that groups affiliated with the Russian government were involved in the hacking and leaking of e-mails associated with the Emmanuel Macron campaign; these e-mails were published on [[Pastebin]] but heavily promoted by WikiLeaks social media channels.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

In April 2017, CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] stated: "It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia." Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia's "primary propaganda outlet," [[RT (TV network)|RT]] had "actively collaborated" with WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-calls-wikileaks-a-non-state-hostile-intelligence-service/ |title=CIA director calls WikiLeaks Russia-aided "non-state hostile intelligence service" |author=Kathryn Watson |date=13 April 2017 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, ''Foreign Policy'' reported that WikiLeaks had in the summer of 2016 turned down a large cache of documents containing information damaging to the Russian government.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/347007-wikileaks-rejected-documents-on-russia-during-2016-election |title=WikiLeaks rejected documents on Russia during 2016 election: report |last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=17 August 2017 |work=TheHill|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks justified this by saying "As far as we recall these are already public ...

In October 2017, it was revealed that [[Cambridge Analytica]], a company working on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign, had contacted WikiLeaks about missing Hillary Clinton e-mails and the possibility of creating a searchable database for the campaign to use.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/25/politics/cambridge-analytica-julian-assange-wikileaks-clinton-emails/index.html |title=Trump campaign analytics company contacted WikiLeaks about Clinton emails |last=CNN |first=Kara Scannell, Dana Bash and Marshall Cohen, |publisher=CNN|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/020bfc7fb4d5438f9cd7c8c1695cf099/The-Latest:-Wikileaks-confirms-approach-from-Trump-campaign |title=The Latest: Trump_ It's disgrace Democrats paid for dossier |work=AP News|access-date=26 October 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this was reported, Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks had been approached by Cambridge Analytica but had rejected the approach.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; WikiLeaks did not disclose what the subject of Cambridge Analytica's approach was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wikileaks-assange-says-he-rejected-overture-from-trump-linked-group-1508961298 |title=Wikileaks' Assange Says He Rejected Overture From Trump-Linked Group |last=Ballhaus |first=Rebecca |date=25 October 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=26 October 2017 |issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of anti-semitism  ===
WikiLeaks has been accused of anti-semitism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/british-magazine-assange-says-jewish-conspiracy-trying-to-discredit-wikileaks-1.346686 |title=British magazine: Assange says Jewish conspiracy trying to discredit WikiLeaks |website=Haaretz|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/25/what_wikileaks_might_have_meant_by_that_anti_semitic_tweet.html |title=Here's What WikiLeaks Might Have Meant by That Anti-Semitic Tweet It Deleted |last=Stahl |first=Jeremy |date=25 July 2016 |newspaper=Slate|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://forward.com/news/national/347546/why-does-wikileaks-have-a-reputation-for-anti-semitism/ |title=Why Does Wikileaks Have a Reputation for Anti-Semitism? |newspaper=The Forward|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/wikileaks-officially-lost-moral-high-ground/ |title=WikiLeaks Has Officially Lost the Moral High Ground |last=Ellis |first=Emma Grey |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted anti-semitic jibes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The organisation has called out Jewish "lobbies" and claimed that a "Jewish conspiracy" is attempting to discredit the organisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments |title=Julian Assange 'Jewish conspiracy' comments spark row |last=Quinn |first=Ben |date=1 March 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, WikiLeaks suggested that [[triple parentheses]], or (((echoes))) – a tool used by neo-Nazis to identify Jews on Twitter, appropriated by Jews across the Twittersphere – had been used as a way for "establishment climbers" to identify one another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Assange denied making claims of a Jewish conspiracy, stating, "'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In leaked internal conversations, WikiLeaks described a journalist as a "rat" and noted that "he's Jewish".&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; WikiLeaks also noted that the journalist had been "engaged" in the contesting anti-Semitic jibes on Twitter, and encouraged others to troll the journalist.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;

===  Exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks ===
WikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/the-truth-about-the-wikileaks-cia-cache.html |title=The Truth About the WikiLeaks C.I.A. Cache |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |date=9 March 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=10 March 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/wikileaks-cia-hack-signal-encrypted-chat-apps/ |title=The CIA Can't Crack Signal and WhatsApp Encryption, No Matter What You've Heard |last=Barrett |first=Brian |work=WIRED|access-date=10 March 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets have also been criticised for reporting on WikiLeaks' claims about the CIA leak, which were later retracted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

According to [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] Professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]], this is part of a pattern of behaviour. After the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]]. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the [[2016–present purges in Turkey|Turkish government's crackdown]] on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt.&lt;ref name="ThReut_WikiLeaks"/&gt; When these e-mails were released, however, it "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to Tufekci, there are three steps to WikiLeaks' "disinformation campaigns": "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Inadequate curation and violations of personal privacy ===
WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for violating the personal privacy of a multitude of individuals and inadequately curating its content. These critics include transparency advocates, such as [[Edward Snowden]], the [[Sunlight Foundation]] and the [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

WikiLeaks has published individuals' [[Social Security number]]s, medical information, and credit card numbers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published "the personal information of hundreds of people – including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some of WikiLeaks' cables "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables – including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' reveal of their Social Security and credit card information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/hacked-private-emails/ |title=Publishing Hacked Private Emails Can Be a Slippery Slope |website=Fortune|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zeyneptufekci/dear-france-you-just-got-hacked-dont-make-the-same-mistakes |title=Dear France: You Just Got Hacked.

WikiLeaks' publishing of Sony's hacked e-mails drew criticism for violating the privacy of Sony's employees and for failing to be in the public interest.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/04/24/wikileaks-and-media-shrinking-our-zone-privacy/6emuRl1zP4Iyl2frKo46uK/story.html |title=Wikileaks has done far more damage to privacy than the NSA |author=Michael A.

Cohen, a fellow at the Century Foundation, argues that "data dumps like these represent a threat to our already shrinking zone of privacy."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; He noted that the willingness of WikiLeaks to publish information of this type encourages hacking and cybertheft: "With ready and willing amplifiers, what's to deter the next cyberthief from stealing a company's database of information and threatening to send it to Wikileaks if a list of demands aren't met?"&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The [[Sunlight Foundation]], a nonprofit that advocates for open government, has criticised WikiLeaks for inadequate curation of its content and for "weaponised transparency," writing that with the DNC leaks, "Wikileaks again failed the due diligence review we expect of putatively journalistic entities when it published the personal information of ordinary citizens, including passport and Social Security numbers contained in the hacked emails of Democratic National Committee staff. We are not alone in raising ethical questions about Wikileaks' shift from whistleblower to platform for weaponised transparency. Any organisation that 'doxxes' a public is harming privacy."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/07/28/on-weaponized-transparency/ |title=On weaponized transparency |authors=Alex Howard &amp; John Wonderlich |date=28 July 2016 |publisher=Sunlight Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which WikiLeaks publishes content can have the effect of censoring political enemies: "Wikileaks' indiscriminate disclosure in this case is perhaps the closest we've seen in reality to the bogeyman projected by enemies to reform — that transparency is just a Trojan Horse for chilling speech and silencing political enemies."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In July 2016, [[Edward Snowden]] criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the ''Washington Post'', the ''Guardian'' and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; WikiLeaks, on the other hand, makes little effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

University of North Carolina Professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]] has criticised WikiLeaks for exposing sensitive personal information: "WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its millions of followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide ... Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens' emails and personal information in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues these data dumps which violate personal privacy without being in the public interest "threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In January 2017, the WikiLeaks Task Force, a Twitter account associated with WikiLeaks,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/01/06/wikileaks-threatens-publish-twitter-users-personal-info/96254138/ |title=WikiLeaks threatens to publish Twitter users' personal info |author=Jessica Guynn |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the creation of a database to track verified Twitter users, including sensitive personal information on individuals' homes, families and finances.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-wikileaks-tracking-verified-twitter-20170106-story.html |title=WikiLeaks proposes tracking verified Twitter users' homes, families and finances |last=Fung |first=Brian |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/313071-wikileaks-floats-creating-database-of-twitter-users-personal-data |title=WikiLeaks floats creating database of Twitter users' personal data |last=Mali |first=Meghashyam |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=The Hill|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Chicago Tribune'', "the proposal faced a sharp and swift backlash as technologists, journalists and security researchers slammed the idea as a 'sinister' and dangerous abuse of power and privacy."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Twitter furthermore bans the use of Twitter data for "surveillance purposes," stating "Posting another person's private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules."&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Internal conflicts and lack of transparency ===
Within WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson [[Julian Assange]] and [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], the website's former German representative who was suspended by Assange. Domscheit-Berg announced on 28 September 2010 that he was leaving the organisation due to internal conflicts over management of the website.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |title=WikiLeaks' Woes Grow as Spokesman Quits Site |author=Bates, Theunis |date=28 September 2010 |work=AOL News|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209122932/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |title=WikiLeaks chief lashes out at media during debate |last=Satter |first=Raphael G. |date=30 September 2010 |publisher=PhysOrg.com|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020041136/http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |archivedate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=no |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/09/28/businessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |title=WikiLeaks Spokesman Quits, Blasts Founder Julian Assange As Paranoid Control Freak, Admits To Using Fake Name |last=Blodget |first=Henry |date=28 September 2010 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=12 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306180126/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fg%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F28%2Fbusinessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |archivedate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=no |authorlink=Henry Blodget |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working for WikiLeaks are reportedly required to sign sweeping [[non-disclosure agreement]]s covering all conversations, conduct, and material, with Assange having sole power over disclosure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/heres-what-i-learned-about-julian-assange |title=Here's What I Learned About Julian Assange While Working Alongside Him |newspaper=BuzzFeed|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty for non-compliance in one such agreement was reportedly £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; WikiLeaks has been challenged for this practice, as it seen to be hypocritical for an organisation dedicated to transparency to limit the transparency of its inner workings and limit the accountability of powerful individuals in the organisation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/05/nda-wikileaks/ |title=WikiLeaks Threatens Its Own Leakers With $20 Million Penalty |last=Poulsen |first=Kevin |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/wikileaks-confidentiality-agreement-julian-assange |title=WikiLeaks, get out of the gagging game |date=12 May 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April 2017, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] stated that arresting Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was a priority: "We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious.

In 2011, hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] published a secret proposal presented by a [[Palantir Technologies]] employee to [[Hunton &amp; Williams]], a Washington, D.C. law firm, to attempt to discredit WikiLeaks and supporters such as [[Glenn Greenwald]] with [[disinformation]] and [[cyberattack]]s.&lt;ref name="unlock"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/unlocking-secrets-if-not-its-own-value.html?nytmobile=0 |title=Unlocking Secrets, if Not Its Own Value |last=Hardy |first=Quentin |date=31 May 2014 |website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other private security firms, [[Berico Technologies]] and [[HBGary]], were also involved in the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/15/anonymous-us-security-firms-wikileaks |title=Anonymous: US security firms 'planned to attack WikiLeaks' |last=Halliday |first=Josh |date=15 February 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |issn=0261-3077|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS121866071120110217 |title=Palantir's third black eye: i2 lawsuit settled |last=Owen |first=Thomas |date=16 February 2011 |agency=[[Reuters]]|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/11/palantir-apologizes-for-wikileaks-attack-proposal-cuts-ties-with-hbgary/ |title=Palantir Apologizes For WikiLeaks Attack Proposal, Cuts Ties With HBGary |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |date=11 February 2011 |newspaper=[[Forbes]]|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/02/15/palantir/ |title=More facts emerge about the leaked smear campaigns |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |date=15 February 2011 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palantir temporarily suspended the employee, its CEO [[Alex Karp]] apologised to Greenwald, and a spokesperson said the company would have collapsed if it had carried out the proposal.&lt;ref name="unlock"/&gt;

'''Yves Leopold Germain Gaston''' was the [[patriarch]] of a large family with roots in the [[Silay City|City of Silay]], in the province of [[Negros Occidental]], [[Philippines]].

==Origin in France==
The real and legal surname of Yves Leopold was in fact Germain. He was born in [[Lisieux]], [[France]], the twenty one of the month of Brumaire, Year twelve of the French Republic at six o’clock evening.&lt;ref&gt;Page 173 Registre naissances de Lisieux 1802-1804. Archives du Calvados&lt;/ref&gt; (November 13, 1803 in Gregorian calendar). Son of Pierre Germain, National Gendarme professional, and Marie Anne Logre married. Later on, he adopted the very French-sounding name of Gaston, certainly because for a Frenchman, the surname Germain created too many problems and confusion. The Name Gaston was retained by the following generations as their surname.

==Settlement in Philippines==
He settled in the Philippines, where he is credited as the first to commercially produce [[cane sugar]],&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite book | title=Philippines | publisher=Lonely Planet | author=Bloom, Greg | year=2009 | pages=484 | isbn=1-74104-721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary product of the province.

Gaston first moved to [[Calatagan]], [[Batangas]] in 1837 to help Domingo Roxas, a prominent businessman, set up his sugar business. It was there that Gaston met Prudencia Fernandez, who later became his wife. When his partner's business did not prosper, the Frenchman decided to try his prospects first in [[Iloilo]] and from there, he ventured to [[Negros Island|Negros]]. He arrived  at the port city of Silay in 1840,&lt;ref name=Karnow&gt;{{cite book | title=[[In our image: America's empire in the Philippines]] | publisher=Random House | author=Karnow, Stanley | authorlink=Stanley Karnow | year=1990 | pages=536 | isbn=0-345-32816-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he found the soil conducive to planting [[sugarcane]]. He brought in an iron mill or "horno economico", which at that time was virtually unheard of.
[[File:Balay Negrense, Silay City, Negros Occidental.jpg|right|thumb|''Balay Negrense'' on [[Negros Revolution|Cinco de Noviembre]] Street, [[Silay City]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Philippines]]]]

The iron mill allowed him to begin commercial production of export-quality sugar. The [[Spain|Spaniards]] endorsed his residence in the Philippines due of the impact of his technology on  the economy. He had become a sugar baron and was exporting the product alongside [[Nicholas Loney]], the first [[United Kingdom|British]] vice-consul in the country who, because of his efforts to promote sugar, became known as the "Father of the Sugar Industry." Gaston later decided to bring his family to back to France. However, on the way, he fell ill and eventually died. His wife and three children, not knowing a word of [[French language|French]], returned to Silay and permanently settled there, continuing the family business. The sugar industry soon peaked, and sugarcane became the staple crop throughout Negros Occidental.

==House of Gaston==
The house of Gaston's eldest son is now a [[museum]] open to the public and is fondly called the ''[[Balay Negrense]]'' ([[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], "The Negrense House").
[[File:HaciendaRosaliaNegrosOccidental.jpg|thumb|Hacienda Rosalia, setting for the 1981 film Oro, Plata, Mata.]]

José Gaston, grandson of Yves Leopold Germain Gaston, built another house called the ''[[Hacienda Rosalia]]'' in Manapla, Negros Occidental, also open to the public.
