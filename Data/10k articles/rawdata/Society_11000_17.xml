==Operations==
===Polysilicon production===
Activ Solar produced high-purity [[polysilicon]] at its subsidiary ''PJSC Semiconductor Plant'', located in [[Zaporizhia]], Ukraine.&lt;ref name=wirtschaftsblatt050511/&gt;  The production of semiconductor materials at the original Zaporizhia Titan and Magnesium Plant dates back to 1935. The facility formed the foundation of PJSC Semiconductor Plant, which began production of semiconductor-grade polysilicon in 1964.&lt;ref name=wirtschaftsblatt050511/&gt;  It was separated from the Zaporizhia Titan and Magnesium Plant in 2002.&lt;ref name=urp030209&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was historically also the only manufacturer of high-purity [[trichlorosilane]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. After comprehensive refurbishment and modernization, PJSC Semiconductor Plant reached an annual capacity of 2,500&amp;nbsp;metric tons of polysilicon and  27,000&amp;nbsp;metric tons of [[trichlorosilane]] (HCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si). The facility produces ~20&amp;nbsp;metric tons per annum of [[monocrystalline silicon]] using legacy equipment with a plan to expand to ~400&amp;nbsp;metric tons per annum. The factory also produces silicon [[tetrachloride]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name=ua-energy&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Anti-Albanian sentiment''' or '''Albanophobia''' is discrimination or prejudice towards [[Albanians]] as an ethnic group, described in countries with large Albanian population as immigrants, especially [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] though in Greece the sentiment has existed mainly in the post-communist Albania era where many criminals escaped to Greece.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;By Russell King, Nicola Mai, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nNHCqrp1IP4C&amp;pg=PA114 Out of Albania: from crisis migration to social inclusion in Italy]'', pp 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgios Karyotis, [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/2nd_Symposium/Georgios_Karyotis_paper.pdf ''Irregular Migration in Greece''], pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By Russell King, Nicola Mai, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nNHCqrp1IP4C&amp;pg=PA114 Out of Albania: from crisis migration to social inclusion in Italy]'', pp 21&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar term used with the same denotation is ''anti-albanianism''&lt;ref&gt;By Michael Mandelbaum, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qoHQ3OgU8bMC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=anti-albanianism#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-albanianism&amp;f=false The new European diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe]'', 234&lt;/ref&gt; used in many sources similarly with ''albanophobia'', although its similarities and/or differences are not defined.

Its opposite is Albanophilia.

The term "Albanophobia" was coined by [[Anna Triandafyllidou]] on a report analysis called ''Racism and Cultural Diversity in the Mass Media'' published in 2002.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Although, the first recorded usage of the term comes from 1982 in ''The South Slav journal, Volume 8'' by Albanian author [[Arshi Pipa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=axoWAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Albanophobia&amp;dq=Albanophobia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YQDBT5aLHJPZ4QT6obiiAQ&amp;redir_esc=y The South Slav journal, Volume 8] page 21, [[Arshi Pipa]] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The report by Triandafyllidou represented Albanian migrants in Greece&lt;ref&gt;By Anna Triandafyllidou, ''[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/MR-CH4-4-Greece.pdf Racism and Cultural Diversity In the Mass Media]'', Robert Schuman Centre, European University Institute,  pp. 149&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by other researchers like Karyotis in Greece and Mai in Italy. The hyphenated form "Albano-phobia" is used on some references (including Triandafyllidou), apparently with the same meaning.

Albanian stereotypes that formed amid the creation of an independent Albanian state, and stereotypes that formed as a result of massive immigrations from Albania and Kosovo during the 1980s and '90s, although they may differ from each other, are still both considered Albanophobic and anti-Albanian by many authors such as Triandafyllidou, Banac, Karyotis.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Albanophobia signifies a wider range of concepts that could be roughly grouped in two main categories:{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* '''Albanophobia as xenophobic''' - referring to stereotypes in countries with a considerable number of Albanian immigrants like Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France and United States.
* '''Albanophobia as nationalistic''' - referring to stereotypes in countries with active disputes with Albanian ethnicity in the region, most commonly [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|ex-Yugoslav countries]] (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro). The second is more likely to be associated with the term ''anti-albanianism''.{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

== Greece ==
The stereotype by some in [[Greece]] of Albanians as criminal and degenerate in Greece has been subject of a 2001 study by the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR) and by the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC).&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/403dd1f50.html|title=Refworld - Greece: Treatment of ethnic Albanians|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUMC Nov. 2001, 25, 38 n. 85"&gt;(EUMC Nov. 2001, 25, 38 n. 85)&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered that prejudices and mistreatment of Albanians to be still present in Greece.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; According to a 2002 statement of the IHFUR, the Albanians are the most likely ethnic group in Greece to be killed by Greek law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; In addition, the EUMC singles out ethnic Albanians as principal targets of racism. Furthermore, the EUMC found that undocumented Albanian migrants "experience serious discrimination in employment, particularly with respect to the payment of wages and social security contributions".&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EUMC Nov. 2001, 25, 38 n. 85"/&gt; Albanians are often pejoratively named and or called by Greeks as "Turks", represented in the expression ''"[[Turco-Albanians|Turkalvanoi]]"''.&lt;ref name = Millas&gt;Millas, Iraklis (2006). "Tourkokratia: History and the image of Turks in Greek literature." South European Society &amp; Politics. '''11'''. (1):  50. “The ‘timeless’ existence of the Other (and the interrelation of the Self with this Other) is secured by the name used to define him or her. Greeks often name as ‘Turks’ various states and groups—such as the Seljuks, the Ottomans, even the Albanians (''Turkalvanoi'')”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Megalommatis&gt;Megalommatis, M. Cosmas (1994). ''Turkish-Greek Relations and the Balkans: A Historian's Evaluation of Today's Problems''. Cyprus Foundation. p. 28. “Muslim Albanians have been called “''Turkalvanoi''” in Greek, and this is pejorative.”&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians in Greece are also classified in terms as "savage", while the Greeks view themselves as "civilised".&lt;ref&gt;Nitsiakos, Vassilis (2010). ''On the border: Transborder mobility, ethnic groups and boundaries along the Albanian-Greek frontier''. LIT Verlag. p. 65. "The few exchanges also bear the imprint of the above structural asymmetry and reflect the level of development of the two countries. While mainly agricultural and dairy products (drugs and weapons are a separate chapter) flow in from Albania, mostly uncontrollably, from Greece to Albania we have, in addition to money, a flow of a great gamut of material goods and products, from simple items of everyday use and consumption, to electrical equipment and cars. One may say that, whereas Albanian products represent “nature”, Greek ones represent “civilization”, a dichotomy that characterises the differences of the two groups from the point of view of the Greeks: Albanians are classified as “savage”, while Greeks as “civilized”, a fact that expresses, of course, the general racist attitude of the Greeks."&lt;/ref&gt;

Prejudicial representations of Albanians and Albanian criminality (see [[Albanian mafia]]) by the Greek media is largely responsible for the social construction of negative stereotypes, in contrast to the commonly held belief that Greek society is neither [[xenophobic]] nor racist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/AR00_p2_EN.pdf Diversity and equality for Europe Annual Report 2000]. European Monitoring Centre of Racism and Xenophobia, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, during an official military parade in [[Athens]], [[Greek people|Greek]] soldiers chanted "They are Skopians, they are Albanians, we will make new clothes out of their skins". The Civil Protection Ministry of Greece reacted to this by suspending the coast guard officer who was in charge of the parade unit, and pledged to take tough action against the unit's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/index.php?aType=haber&amp;ArticleID=56122|title=Greek soldiers chant anti-Turkish-Albanian slogans at military parade  - Balkans -  Worldbulletin News|work=World Bulletin|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanophobia in [[Italy]] is primarily related to the Albanian immigrants mainly young adults who are stereotypically seen as criminals, drug dealers and rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Italophilia meets Albanophobia: Paradoxes of asymmetric assimilation and identity processes among Albanian immigrants in Italy|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=32|pages=117–138|doi=10.1080/01419870802245034|year = 2009|last1 = King|first1 = Russell|last2=Mai|first2=Nicola|url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/13201|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/articles/complete_articles.php?id_art=262 |title=Breaking the Albanian stereotype |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728145805/http://www.wantedinrome.com/articles/complete_articles.php?id_art=262 |archive-date=28 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian media provide a lot of space and attention to crimes committed by ethnic Albanians, even those just presumed.&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNHCqrp1IP4C&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=Albanophobia+-forum#v=onepage&amp;q=Albanophobia%20-forum&amp;f=false|title=Out of Albania|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015|isbn=9781845455446|last1=King|first1=Russell|last2=Mai|first2=Nicola|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic tensions have simmered in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] since the end of an [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|armed conflict in 2001]], where the ethnic Albanian [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] attacked the security forces of Macedonia with the goal of securing greater rights and autonomy for the ethnic Albanian minority.

The [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Macedonian Academy for Science and Art]] was accused of Albanophobia in 2009 after it published its first encyclopedia in which was claimed that the Albanian [[endonym]], [[Shqiptar#Use in South Slavic languages|Shqiptar]], means "highlander" and is primarily used by other Balkan peoples to describe Albanians, if used in South Slavic languages the endonym is considered derogatory by the Albanian community. The encyclopaedia also claimed that the Albanians settled the region in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=62079 |title=B92 - News - Macedonian encyclopedia pulled from shelves |work=B92 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213040201/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=62079 |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Alb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/albanian/regionalnews/2009/09/090921_nayi_enciklopedia.shtml | title=Dënohet Enciklopedia maqedonase | publisher=BBC | accessdate=28 November 2012 | author=Rashidi, Nazim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Macedonian_Encyclopedia_Sparks_Balkan_Ethnic_Row/1830215.html|title=Macedonian Encyclopedia Sparks Balkan Ethnic Row|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution of the encyclopedia was ceased after a series of public protests.

On 12 April 2012, five [[ethnic Macedonian]] civilians were shot dead allegedly by [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|ethnic Albanian]] in an  attack known as the [[Železarsko lake killings]]. On 16 April 2012, in the wake of the attack, an anti-Albanian protest was held in Skopje by ethnic Macedonians in which the participants were recorded chanting “a good [[Shqiptar]] is a dead Shqiptar” and “gas chambers for Shqiptars”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF2LprmkK4M&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Përleshje mes policisë dhe protestuesve në Shkup|date=16 April 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2013 in [[Skopje]], a mob of ethnic Macedonians protested against the decision to appoint [[Talat Xhaferi]], an ethnic Albanian politician, as [[Minister of Defence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://puls24.mk/makedonija/vesti/-privedeni-nekolkumina-ucesnici-vo-incidentot-pred-vlada | title=Приведени неколкумина учесници во инцидентот пред Влада | publisher=Puls 24 | accessdate=2 March 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302102850/http://puls24.mk/makedonija/vesti/-privedeni-nekolkumina-ucesnici-vo-incidentot-pred-vlada | archive-date=2 March 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest turned violent when the mob started hurling stones and also attacking Albanian bystanders and police officers alike. The police reports 3 injured civilians, five injured police officers and much damage to private property. Although the city hospital reported treating five heavily injured Albanian men, two of which are on [[Intensive-care unit]]. During this protest part of the mob burned the Albanian flag.

On the 108th anniversary of the [[Congress of Manastir]] the museum of the Albanian alphabet in [[Bitola]] was vandalized, the windows and doors were broken. A poster with the words "Death to Albanians" and with the drawing of a lion cutting the heads of the Albanian double-headed eagle was placed on the front doors of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tv21.tv/mk/?p=109732 | title=ХУЛИГАНИ ГО ДЕМОЛИРАА  МУЗЕЈОТ НА АЛБАНСКАТА АЗБУКА | publisher=21TV | accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after this incident, on the day of the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] graffiti with the same messages, as those of the previous week, were placed on the directorate of [[Pelister National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tv21.tv/web/?p=109822 | title=KËRCËNIM NË FESTËN E FLAMURIT 'VDEKJE SHQIPTARËVE' | publisher=TV-21 | accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of anti-Albanian propaganda in Serbia started by the end of 19th century and the reason for this was the claims made by Serbian state on territories that were about to be controlled by Albanians after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Banac"&gt;By [[Ivo Banac]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=ivo+banac&amp;ei=OcjwSoXOCaCMygTNxNibAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=anti-albanian&amp;f=false The national question in Yugoslavia - origins, history, politics], page 293&lt;/ref&gt; By the late nineteenth century, Albanians were being characterized by Serbian government officials as a “wild tribe” with “cruel instincts”.&lt;ref name = Stefanović/&gt; Others from Serbia's intelligentsia such as the geographer [[Jovan Cvijić]] referred to Albanians as being “the most barbarous tribes of Europe”.&lt;ref name = Stefanović&gt;Stefanović, Djordje (2005). "Seeing the Albanians through Serbian eyes: The Inventors of the Tradition of Intolerance and their Critics, 1804-1939." ''European History Quarterly''. '''35'''. (3): 472. “Officials of the Serbian Ministry of Foreign affairs described Albanians as a ‘wild tribe’ with ‘cruel instincts’…. A number of Serbian intellectuals and journalists added to the angry hate propaganda that seemed to culminate during the preparations for the Balkan Wars. Cvijić argued that ‘there is a general consensus that the Albanians are the most barbarous tribes of Europe’. Another intellectual described the Albanians as ‘European Indians’ and ‘lazy savages’.”&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas politician [[Vladan Đorđević]] described Albanians as “modern [[Caveman|Troglodytes]]” and “prehumans, who slept in the trees” with still having “tails” in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter (1993). ''The Cultivation of Hatred: The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud (The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud''). WW Norton &amp; Company. p. 82. “In 1913, Dr. Vladan Djordjević, a Serbian politician and expert in public health, characterized Albanians as bloodthirsty, stunted, animal—like, so invincibly ignorant that they could not tell sugar from snow. These “modern Troglodytes” reminded him of “prehumans, who slept in the trees, to which they were fastened by their tails.” True, through the millennia, the human rail had withered away, but “among the Albanians there seem to have been humans with tails as late as the nineteenth century.””&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the [[First Balkan War]] 1912, Serbian media had implemented a strong anti-Albanian campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrije Tucović, ''Srbija i Arbanija'' (in ''Izabrani spisi'', book II, pp. 56) Prosveta, Beograd, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts]], and more specifically the noted Serb scholar and political figure [[Vaso Čubrilović]] (1897-1990) wrote a [[memorandum]] entitled  "[[The Expulsion of the Albanians]]" which dealt with the methods that should be used to expel Albanians including: creating a "psychosis" by bribing clergymen to encourage the Albanians to leave the country, enforcing the law to the letter, secretly razing Albanian inhabited villages, ruthless application of all police regulations, ruthless collection of taxes and the payment of all private and public debts, the requisitioning of all public and municipal pasture land, the cancellation of concessions, the withdrawal of permits to exercise an occupation, dismissal from government, the demolition of Albanian cemeteries and many other methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ćubrilović, Vaso, [http://www.trepca.net/english/2006/the_expulsion_of_the_albanians_by_vaso_cubrilovic_memorandum_in_1937.html The Expulsion of the Albanians: Memorandum] 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

During the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, on some occasions activities undertaken by Serbian officials in Kosovo have been marked as ''albanophobic''.&lt;ref&gt;By Nebojša Popov, Drinka Gojković, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=albanophobia#v=onepage&amp;q=albanophobia&amp;f=false The road to war in Serbia: trauma and catharsis], pp. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Role of the media in the Yugoslav Wars#Milošević's reign and control of media in Serbia|Serbian media during Milošević's era]] was known to espouse [[Serbian nationalism|Serb nationalism]] while promoting [[xenophobia]] toward the other ethnicities in [[Yugoslavia]]. Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterized in the media as anti-Yugoslav counter-revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation.&lt;ref&gt;International Centre Against Censorship. "Forging War: The Media in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina". ''International Centre Against Censorship, Article 19''. Avon, United Kingdom: Bath Press, May 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14682">'''Ngatikaura Ngati''' was a [[New Zealand]]-[[Tongan people|Tongan]] toddler who died of [[child abuse]] in January 2006. The deliberate judicial release of official [[autopsy]] photographs after the trial of his killers, for the subsequent distribution of those images on the Internet and for the subsequent debate about the images among government figures, including three successive [[Children's Commissioner Act 2003|Children's Commissioner]]s caused controversy that was the result of the tension between the desire for privacy and respect for victims of [[family violence]] and the need for publicity to motivate changes in public attitudes to family violence.

==Life and death==
Ngati had been fostered to a cousin of his [[birth mother]] and was being raised in a [[Tongan language]] environment until shortly after his third birthday when he was returned to his birth mother, at her request. Maine Annabella Ngati, her partner, Teusila Fa'asisila, and their other children only spoke English. Within three months, Ngati was dead. Photos taken during the autopsy showed bruises from repeated beatings and weeping sores, one of which was "the size of a man's hand on his bottom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10439204 |title=From happiness to hell  |work=nzherald.co.nz |date=May 12, 2007 |accessdate=5 October 2012 |last=Binning |first=Elizabeth |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngati and Fa'asisila were found [[Acquittal|not guilty]] of [[murder]], but guilty of [[manslaughter]], failing to provide a child with the necessities of life (medical care), and willful ill treatment of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10445880 |title=Ex-carer tells boy's killers to hang themselves |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |work=nzherald.co.nz |date=15 June 2007|last=Vass |first=Beck |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June, 2007, each was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison, with a minimum [[non-parole period]] of four years and eight months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10446071 |title=Toddler's killers get 8 1/2 years |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |work=nzherald.co.nz |date=16 June 2007 |last=Vass |first=Beck |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngati gave birth to another child while in custody – which was placed with either foster or adoptive parents&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10772405 |title=Child killer gives birth in jail |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |last=Carroll |first=Joanne |work=nzherald.co.nz |date=11 December 2011 |quote='She has a lot of children and we believe she has even given birth to another child while on this prison sentence.

After trial, in an unusual and controversial move, Auckland [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] Judge Graham Lang allowed the release of the autopsy photos into the public realm, and allowed New Zealand's [[TV One (New Zealand)]] (TVNZ) to film the autopsy photographs "so that they may give pause to those people who choose to ignore that their family members are being hurt".&lt;ref name=bsa/&gt;  Since then, the images have been distributed through television, email and web, fueling controversy and debate along the way.

TVNZ broadcast the images during a television news programme at 6pm on 6 August 2007.  During that segment, Children's Commissioner Cindy Kiro is shown commenting that the public did not need to see these "graphic images to show them how badly damaged this child was."&lt;ref name="bsa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvnz 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call to stand up against abuse|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411425/1273282|publisher=[[TV One (New Zealand)]]|accessdate=16 October 2012|date=6 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the broadcast, she lodged a complaint with the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] (BSA), arguing that "[''One News''] had displayed a disregard for the rights of the young victim and exploitation of him by showing these photos". Calling the broadcast a "further abuse in death" of the child, Kiro said that it was "... questionable whether publication of autopsy photographs of a young child beaten to death could ever be in the public interest."  Her complaint alleged violations of several of the BSA's standards, including "good taste and decency", "privacy", "fairness", "children's interests" and "violence".

The complaint was investigated, but was "not upheld" on all counts.&lt;ref name=DP-complaint-rejected/&gt;  With respect to "good taste and decency" the BSA acknowledged that "the autopsy images would have been distressing to some viewers. However, they conveyed the grim reality of child abuse in the context of [a news] item...."&lt;ref name=bsa/&gt;  They ruled that their privacy and fairness standards did not apply to deceased individuals – they did point out, however, that TVNZ complied with the judge's stipulations against showing the boy's face and genitals, and, "in this respect, the Authority finds that TVNZ exercised care and discretion in order to preserve the child's dignity."&lt;ref name=bsa/&gt;&lt;ref name=DP-complaint-rejected&gt;{{cite news|title=Complaint about autopsy photos rejected|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/archive/national-news/340740/Complaint-about-autopsy-photos-rejected|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=The Dominion Post|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding violence, the Authority quoted from their guidelines, which "recognises that news programmes will often contain 'violent, disturbing or alarming material', and that broadcasters 'should not falsify by omission, a world in which much violence and brutality occurs'".&lt;ref name=bsa&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/2971 |title= Kiro and Television New Zealand Ltd - 2007-111; Complaint under section 8(1)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 1989 |work=bsa.govt.nz |date=26 March 2008 |publisher=[[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That TVNZ provided advance warning to viewers and didn't display the images until two minutes into the story played a role in the BSA's decision-making,&lt;ref name=DP-complaint-rejected/&gt; especially with respect to children's interests.  Although the complaints were not upheld, two of the Authority's members went on record to note that "it is unusual to see autopsy photographs in the 6pm news, particularly involving children", and that "the warning could have made a specific reference to autopsy photographs of a child in order to leave viewers in no doubt as to the content of the report."&lt;ref name=bsa/&gt;

===Email petition===
The images were also circulated in an email sent by a protest group calling for tougher jail terms for child abusers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biggie.co.nz/discussion/the_real_face_of_child_abuse_in_nz_size9warning_tear |title=The real face of child abuse in NZ |work=biggie.co.nz |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225155059/http://www.biggie.co.nz/discussion/the_real_face_of_child_abuse_in_nz_size9warning_tear |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kiro calling their use "abhorrent".&lt;ref name="email-slammed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/14389/Photos-sent-in-emails-of-dead-boy-slammed |title=Photos sent in emails of dead boy slammed |work=stuff.co.nz |date=5 August 2007|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grisly"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/46753/Grisly-photos-in-email-petition |title=Grisly photos in email petition  |work=stuff.co.nz |date=6 August 2007 |quote=|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngati's name (but not images) were used by [[Family First New Zealand|Family First]] to advocate tougher sentences for child abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0802/S00330.htm |title=Sentence for Beating Partner to Death slammed |publisher=Family First |work=Press Release |date=28 February 2008 |quote=His entire body was covered in bruises and his blood was found in every inch of the house.

Preceding Commissioner Roger McClay said, that use of the photos would serve to raise awareness of the child abuse "epidemic", which was not well known amongst New Zealanders. He added, "The more the public of New Zealand is aware of the problem, the more chance something will be done."&lt;ref name="email"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/archive/national-news/10681/E-mailer-backs-abuse-photos |publisher=Dominion Post |title=E-mailer backs abuse photos  |work=stuff.co.nz |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Richard Middleton, who was involved in the original police case, said, "The case was very disturbing in view of the amount of violence used against a defenceless three-year-old. Anything that raises awareness and prevents it happening again is great."&lt;ref name="email-slammed"/&gt;

===Shock web sites===
Some time later the photos appeared on Internet [[shock sites]], which some have characterized as [[pornographic websites|pornographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dead child's pictures posted on pornographic website|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/181383/dead-childs-pictures-posted-pornographic-website|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, months after taking office as [[Children's Commissioner (New Zealand)|Children’s Commissioner]], Russell Wills said he was "appalled" at their use.&lt;ref name="nzherald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10757456 |title=Disgust over dead boy's pictures on porn site |publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]] |work=nzherald.co.nz |date=8 October 2011 |quote=Ngatikaura Ngati died after horrific abuse by his parents.

The '''Awin–Pa''' or '''Awin–Pare''' languages – or, more precisely, '''Awin–Pa–Kamula''' – are a small [[language family|family]] of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] (TNG)

The languages are just three, [[Aekyowm language|Aekyowm]] (Awin), [[Pa language|Pare]]&lt;!--"Pare" is better known as a Bantu language, so "Pa" is the name of the WP article--&gt; (Pa) and [[Kamula language|Kamula]]. They are not obviously related to each other, but Aekyowm and Pare are closer to each other than to Kamula.&lt;ref name="Suter-Usher"&gt;Edgar Suter &amp; Timothy Usher, 2017, 'The Kamula–Elevala Language Family', ''Language &amp; Linguistics in Melanesia'', vol. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Kamula language|Kamula]]
*Awin–Pa AKA Elevala River 
**[[Aekyowm language|Aekyowm]] (Awin)
**[[Pa language|Pare]] (Pa)

The pronouns appear to have been 1sg *nɔ, 2sg *ɡo, 3sg *yɔ. Awin and Pare share 2du *gi.

Stephen Wurm (1975) added Awin and Pa to an expanded [[Central and South New Guinea languages|Central and South New Guinea]] branch of TNG, a position reversed by Ross (2005). The connection to Kamula was established by Usher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10788">A '''benevolent dictatorship''' refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a [[dictator]]. A benevolent dictator may allow for some [[economic liberalization]] or [[democracy|democratic decision-making]] to exist, such as through public [[referendum|referenda]] or [[elect]]ed [[Representative democracy|representative]]s with limited power, and often makes preparations for a [[Democratization|transition to genuine democracy]] during or after their term. It might be seen as a [[republic]]an form of [[enlightened despotism]].

The label has been applied to leaders such as [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] of [[Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benevolent Dictator? Thinking About MK Atatürk |url=http://turkeyfile.blogspot.com/2009/10/benevolent-dictator.html |work=Turkey File |date=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josip Broz Tito]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],&lt;ref name="shapiro"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Susan |last2=Shapiro |first2=Ronald |title=The Curtain Rises: Oral Histories of the Fall of Communism in Eastern Europe |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=0-7864-1672-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCqWFQ1WKlkC&amp;pg=PA180 |ref=Shapiro_2004}}&lt;br /&gt;"...All Yugoslavs had educational opportunities, jobs, food, and housing regardless of nationality. Tito, seen by most as a benevolent dictator, brought peaceful co-existence to the Balkan region, a region historically synonymous with factionalism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What Singapore can teach us |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-singapore-can-teach-us/2012/05/02/gIQAlQEGwT_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2012-05-02|access-date = 2015-11-25 |issn=0190-8286 |first=Matt |last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[France-Albert René]] of [[Seychelles]].

== Characteristics ==
The idea of benevolent dictatorship has a long history, dating back to various positively-perceived{{who|date=July 2018}} rulers during ancient times,{{when|date=July 2018}} where authoritarian leadership was the norm.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Modern usage of the term in a world society where the norm leans much more toward democracy can be traced back to [[John Stuart Mill]] in his classic ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1869). Although he argued in favor of democratic rights for individuals, he did make an exception for what he called today's developing countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://williameasterly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/benevolent-autocrats-easterly-2nd-draft.pdf |title=Benevolent Autocrats |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. Despotism is [...] legitimate [...] in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement [...]. Liberty [...] has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Benevolent dictator was also a popular rhetoric in the early 20th century as a support for colonial rulings. A British colonial official called Lord Hailey said in 1940s "A new conception of our relationship...may emerge as part of the movement for the betterment of the backward peoples of the world." Hailey conceived economic development as a justification for colonial power.

In the Spanish language, the pun word ''[[dictablanda]]'' is sometimes used for a dictatorship conserving some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The pun is that, in Spanish, ''dictadura'' is "dictatorship", ''dura'' is "hard" and ''blanda'' is "soft". Analogously, the same pun is made in Portuguese as ''ditabranda'' or ''ditamole''. In February 2009, the Brazilian newspaper ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' ran an editorial classifying the [[military dictatorship in Brazil]] (1964–1985) as a "ditabranda", creating controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/colunistas/colunas/2009/02/25/imprensa374.shtml |title=A "ditabranda" da ''Folha'' |publisher=Portal Imprensa |first=Igor |last=Ribeiro |date=February 25, 2009 |language=pt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201152634/http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/colunistas/colunas/2009/02/25/imprensa374.shtml |archivedate=2012-02-01 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mancur Olson]] characterized benevolent dictators as "not like the wolf that preys on the elk, but more like the rancher who makes sure his cattle are protected and are given water".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Olson |first=Mancur |date=1993-01-01 |title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development |jstor=2938736 |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=567–576 |doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy helps explain the seemingly contradictory motivations for benevolence. What seems altruistic on behalf of the dictator is actually acting in [[rational self interest]]. The provision of public goods allows for a [[Pareto improvement]] in society, from which the dictator can extract taxes to enrich himself or the state.

== Modern examples ==
=== Josip Broz Tito ===
Although [[Josip Broz Tito]] led the former republic of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) from 1944 until his death in 1980 under what many criticized as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule,&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book |title=Group Psychotherapy and Political Reality: A Two-Way Mirror |last1=Cohen |first1=Bertram D. |last2=Ettin |first2=Mark F. |last3=Fidler |first3=Jay W. |year=2002 |publisher=International Universities Press |isbn=0-8236-2228-2 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andjelic&gt;{{cite book |last=Andjelic |first=Neven |title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy |publisher=Frank Cass |year=2003 |page=36 |isbn=0-7146-5485-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;{{cite book |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law |last=Tierney |first=Stephen |year=2000 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-1400-9 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naming Street After Tito Unconstitutional. Slovenia Times, 5 October 2011 http://www.sloveniatimes.com/naming-street-after-tito-unconstitutional&lt;/ref&gt;
he was widely popular and was "seen by most as a benevolent dictator".&lt;ref name="shapiro" /&gt; This perception has changed significantly in [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] circles following the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] and the examination of various crimes committed by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in the aftermath of the World War II and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] during its rule, namely the [[Bleiburg repatriations]], the [[Foibe massacres]], [[Tezno massacre]], [[Macelj massacre]], [[Kočevski Rog massacre]], [[Barbara Pit massacre]] and the [[communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45]].

=== Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ===
During his leadership of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] from 1919 to 1922 and his presidency from 1923 to 1938, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] is credited with removing foreign influence from former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territory, and is looked fondly upon as the founder of modern Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepolicywire.com/lee-kuan-yew-the-curious-legacies-of-benevolent-dictators/ |title=Lee Kuan Yew &amp; The Curious Legacies of "Benevolent Dictators" |date=March 27, 2015 |author=Eric Watson |work=The Policy Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presided over a [[Atatürk's Reforms|series of reforms]] such as allowing women to vote, agrarian land reform, removal of Islam as the state religion and the establishment of [[Secularism in Turkey|secularism]], and the adoption of a Western-based criminal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sss31/Turkiye/ata/hayati.html |title=Mustafa Kemal Atatürk |work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lee Kuan Yew ===
Since its independence in 1959, Singapore has transformed from a relatively underdeveloped and impoverished agrarian society into one of Asia's wealthiest nations, a center of international banking, business and shipping. Singapore has thus been dubbed as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]]. [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and his administration wielded absolute reign over Singaporean politics until 1990, while his [[People's Action Party]] has remained in power ever since, controlling Singapore as a [[dominant-party state]]. Yew is therefore often called a 'benevolent dictator.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/obituary-lee-kuan-yew-the-benevolent-dictator |title=Obituary: Lee Kuan Yew, the benevolent dictator |author=BOO SU-LYN |work=Malay Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a leader who was in power for thirty-one years from 1959 until 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/lee-kuan-yews-legacy-of-authoritarian-pragmatism-will-serve-singapore-well |title=Lee Kuan Yew leaves a legacy of authoritarian pragmatism |author=Carlton Tan |date=March 23, 2015 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; he implemented some laws that were deemed to be autocratic, and attempted to dismantle political opposition. Despite this, he is reportedly often looked upon favorably by [[Singaporeans]] for his transformation of Singapore. Peter Popham of [[The Independent]] called Yew "one of the most successful political pragmatists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/lee-kuan-yew-an-entirely-exceptional-leader-who-balanced-authoritarianism-with-pragmatism-10128277.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew: An entirely exceptional leader who balanced authoritarianism with pragmatism |author=Peter Popham |date=March 23, 2015 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France-Albert René ===
Although [[France-Albert René]] seized power in a coup, his one-party rule in [[Seychelles]] rapdily developed the country since its independence. His administration established various administrative, public institutions and educational institutions, created a universal health care system, and brought the national literacy rate to 90%.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Statistics Poland''' (formerly known in English as the '''Central Statistical Office''' ({{lang-pl|'''Główny Urząd Statystyczny'''}}, popularly called '''GUS''')) is [[Government of Poland|Poland]]'s chief government [[executive agency]] charged with collecting and publishing statistics related to the country's economy, population, and society, at the national and local levels. The president of Statistics Poland (currently [[Dominik Rozkrut]]) reports directly to the [[Prime Minister of Poland]] and is considered the equivalent of a Polish government minister.

[[File:Ludwik krzywicki 1882.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Ludwik Krzywicki]]]]

The agency was established in 1918 by [[Ludwik Krzywicki]], one of the most notable sociologists of his time.

Inactive during [[World War II]], GUS was reorganized in 1945.

The office is divided into several separate branches, each responsible for a different set of data. The branches include the Divisions of Coordination of Statistical Surveys, Analyses and Regional Statistics, Dissemination, National Accounts and Finance, Business Statistics and Registers, Social Statistics, Services Statistics, Agriculture and Environment Statistics, International Cooperation, Budgetary, and Personnel.

Notable GUS publications include ''Rocznik Statystyczny'' (Statistical Yearbook), ''Mały Rocznik Statystyczny'' (Concise Statistical Yearbook), and ''Wiadomości Statystyczne'' (Statistical News).

'''[[Christmas]] in [[Russia]]''' ({{lang-ru|Рождество Христово}} ''Rozhdestvo Khristovo'', in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] called Е́же по пло́ти Рождество Господа Бога и Спа́са нашего Иисуса Христа) is celebrated on December 25 (Julian calendar) which falls on 7 January (Gregorian calendar) and commemorates the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Christmas is considered as a high holiday by the Russian Orthodox Church, one of the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|12 Great Feasts]], and of only 4 Feasts preceded by a period of fasting. On [[Christmas Eve]] (6 January), there are several long services, including the [[Royal Hours]] and [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve "[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Holy Supper]]", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honour each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the "всенощная" [[All Night Vigil]]. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the "заутренняя" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a [[Public holidays in Russia|national holiday in Russia]], as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.

==History==
In Russia, the Christmas holiday has become the official celebration with the [[baptism of Rus']] ordered by [[Prince Vladimir]] in the late 10th century. However, given the early Christian community [[Kievan Rus']], celebration may have a longer history.

During the early-mid Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the official state policy of atheism until 1936, but despite this, Christmas was marked by the Soviet regime on December 25. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, many Christmas traditions were re-adopted as part of a new secular [[New Year's Eve#Russia|New Year]] celebration.  These include the decoration of a tree, or "ёлка" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving "Ded Moroz" (Дед Мороз "[[Grandfather Frost]]") and his granddaughter, "Snegurochka" (Снегурочка "[[Snegurochka|The Snowmaiden]]").

==Traditional Russian cuisine==
Principal dishes on the Christmas table in old Russia included a variety of pork (roasted pig), stuffed pig's head, roasted meat chunks, jelly ([[Kholodets (dish)|kholodets]]), and aspic. Christmas dinner also included many other meats: goose with apples, sour cream hare, venison, lamb, whole fish, etc.. The abundance of lumpy fried and baked meats, whole baked chicken, and fish on the festive table was associated with features of the [[Russian oven]], which allowed successful preparation of large portions.&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия обрядов и обычаев, — СПб.: Респекс, 1996, С. 11-55, 80-88 {{ISBN|5-7345-0063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finely sliced meat and pork was cooked in pots with semi-traditional porridge. Pies were indispensable dishes for Christmas, as well as other holidays, and included both closed and open style [[pirog]]i ([[pirozhki]], [[vatrushka]]s, [[coulibiac]]s, kurnik, boats, saechki, shangi), [[Kalach (food)|kalach]]i, cooked casseroles, and [[blini]]. Fillings of every flavor were included (herbal, vegetable, fruit, mushrooms, meat, fish, cheese, mixed).&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия обрядов и обычаев, — СПб.: Респекс, 1996, С. 11-55, 80-88 {{ISBN|5-7345-0063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweet dishes served on the Russian Christmas table included berries, fruit, candy, cakes, [[angel wings]], biscuits, honey. Beverages included drinking broths ([[kompot]] and sweet soups, [[sbiten]]), [[kissel]], and, from the beginning of the 18th century, Chinese tea.&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия обрядов и обычаев, — СПб.: Респекс, 1996, С. 11-55, 80-88 {{ISBN|5-7345-0063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaints to the Russian Constitutional Court==
In 1999, atheist MV Agbunov requested that the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]] tested the constitutionality of decrees on the recognition of 7 January as a federal holiday. This request was denied by the court based on the argument that "the specified statutory provisions apply to the law on public holidays days&amp;nbsp;..., and do not contain provisions indicating the violation of constitutional rights and freedoms referred to by the applicant. (Articles 14, 19, 28 and 29 (part 2) of the Constitution of Russia)".

In 2008, a [[Slavic neopaganism|neo-pagan]] group filed a similar complaint. The group argued that the fact that Orthodox Christmas is an official holiday is contrary to the [[Constitution of Russia]], according to which "no religion can be established as state and obligatory". After having considered the complaint, the court rejected it on the grounds that decisions about public holidays are within the competence of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian Parliament]] and are not a constitutional matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.ru/content/200812/25/112.sud.html В суд на Рождество]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinta Larga''' (or '''Cinturão Largo''') are a people [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] to the western [[Amazon Rainforest]] of [[Brazil]], numbering around 1300. Their name means "broad belt" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], referring to large bark sashes the tribe once wore. The tribe is famous for shadowing [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition]], making no contact.

==Language==
The [[Cinta Larga language]] is a [[Mondé language]], belonging to the [[Tupi language]] family. It is written in the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==History==
Since the 1920s, the tribe has often come into violent conflict with prospectors entering the region to harvest [[rubber]], [[timber]], [[gold]] or [[diamond]]s. In the 1960s, this culminated in the "Massacre at Parallel 11" in which rubber prospectors killed many of the Cinta Larga by throwing dynamite into their village from a plane, and then finishing off the survivors, including killing women and children with particular cruelty. Only two members of the Cinta Larga community survived the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3104-why-do-they-hide%3E|title=Why do they hide?|first=Survival|last=International|website=www.survivalinternational.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/9191|title='Lost' report exposes Brazilian Indian genocide|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diamond mine controversy==
In 2004 the tribe was responsible for the murders of 29 miners illegally unearthing [[diamonds]] in the area. In exchange for an $810,000 community grant from the Brazilian government, the tribe agreed to shut down the mine and refrain from killing intruders. The grant expired in 2007, and the tribe has implied it may reopen the mine.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/world/americas/29diamonds.html|title=Diamonds’ Glitter Fades for a Brazilian Tribe|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=29 December 2006|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8396">'''Courtship disorder''' is a theoretical construct in [[sexology]] in which a certain set of [[paraphilias]] are seen as specific instances of anomalous [[courtship]] instincts in men.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anil |last=Aggrawal |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |location=Boca Raton |year=2009 |isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific paraphilias are [[biastophilia]] (paraphilic [[rape]]), [[exhibitionism]], [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatologia]], and [[voyeurism]]. According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund, K. |author2=Kolářský, A. |date=1965|title=Grundzüge eines einfachen bezugsystems für die analyse sexueller deviationen ['Basic features of a reference system for considering anomalous erotic preferences']|work=Psychiatrie, Neurologie, and Medizinische Psychologie|volume= 17|pages= 221–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courtship disorder hypothesis ==
According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K. (1976). "Diagnosis and treatment of forensically significant anomalous erotic preferences." ''Canadian Journal of Criminology and Corrections'', 18, 181–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Blanchard, R. (1986). "The concept of courtship disorder." ''Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy'', 12, 79–92.&lt;/ref&gt; These phases are: "(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse."&lt;ref name=Cantor2009&gt;Cantor, J. M., Blanchard, R., &amp; Barbaree, H. E. (2009). Sexual disorders. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 527–548). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The associations between these phases and these paraphilias were first outlined by [[Kurt Freund]],&lt;ref name=Freund1988&gt;Freund, K. (1988). "Courtship disorder: Is the hypothesis valid?" ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 528, 172–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983&gt;Freund, K., Scher, H., &amp; Hucker, S. (1983). The courtship disorders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 12, 369–379.&lt;/ref&gt; the originator of the theory: A disturbance of the search phase of courtship manifests as [[voyeurism]], a disturbance of the pretactile interaction phase manifests as [[exhibitionism]] or [[telephone scatologia]], a disturbance of the tactile interaction phase manifests as toucheurism or [[frotteurism]], and the absence of the courtship behavior phases manifests as paraphilic [[rape]] (i.e., [[biastophilia]]). According to Freund, these paraphilias "can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or [[erotic fantasy]] in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way."&lt;ref name=Freund1990&gt;Freund, K. (1990). "Courtship disorder." In W. L. Marshall, D. R. Laws, &amp; H. E. Barbaree (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexual Assault: Issues, Theories, and Treatment of the Offender'' (pp. 195–207). NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freund noted that ''[[troilism]]'' (a paraphilia for observing one’s sexual/romantic partner sexually interacting with a third party, usually unbeknownst to the third party)&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, M. (1938). ''Sexual Anomalies and Perversions: Physical and Psychological Development, Diagnosis and Treatment'' (new and revised ed.). London: Encyclopaedic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; might also be a courtship disorder,&lt;ref name=Freund1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Watson, R. (1990). "Mapping the boundaries of courtship disorder." ''The Journal of Sex Research'', 27, 589–606.&lt;/ref&gt; troilism being a variant of voyeurism.

Appropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as [[public nudity]] or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like [[Carnival]] or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras#Nudity and Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered.&lt;ref&gt;Maharajh, H. D., &amp; Konings, M. (2007). [https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083029681 Dancing frotteurism and courtship disorder in Trinidad and Tobago.] ''Journal of Chinese Clinical Medicine'', 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and acceptance of the theory ==
Paraphilias within the Courtship Disorder spectrum co-occur with each other more frequently than with paraphilias outside the courtship disorder spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., &amp; Osborn, C. (1992). "The paraphilias: The extent and nature of sexually deviant and criminal behavior." ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America'', 15, 675–689.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., Becker, J. V., Cunningham-Rathner, J., Mittelman, M., &amp; Rouleau, J.-L. (1988). "Multiple paraphilic diagnoses among sex offenders." ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 16, 153–168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Templeman, T. L., &amp; Stinnet, R. D. (1991). "Patterns of sexual arousal and history in a "normal' sample of young men." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 20, 137–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fedora, O., Reddon, J. R., Morrison, J. W., Fedora, S. K., Pascoe, H., Yeudall, L. T. (1992). Sadism and other paraphilias in normal controls and nonaggressive sex offenders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 21, 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these paraphilias in men to explain this co-occurrence.&lt;ref name=Freund1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983/&gt;

Courtship disorder is widely cited by [[sexology|sexologists]] and forensic scientists as one of the predominant models of the paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;Maea, M., &amp; Coccaro, E. F. (1998). ''Neurobiology and clinical views on aggression and impulsivity'' (Clinical &amp; neurobiological advances in psychiatry series). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, N. (1993).

'''Culle''' (''Cullí, Kulyi''), also known as '''Ilinga''' (''Linga''), is a poorly attested extinct language of northern [[Peru]].  It is the original language of the regions of [[La Libertad Region|La Libertad]], [[Cajabamba Province|Cajabamba]], and [[Pallasca Province|Pallasca]].  It is known through various word lists collected while the language was still spoken and through vocabulary loaned into the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Israeli Driving License side 1.jpg|thumb|Israeli Driving License (2018, front side).]]
[[File:Israeli Driving License side 2.jpg|thumb|Israeli Driving License (2018, back side).]]
'''Driving licences in Israel''' come in twelve types, similar to the [[European driving licence]] (although small differences exist). In order to receive a licence, each applicant must pass a medical and eye checkup, and a theoretical test, before taking a number of practical lessons culminating in the [[Driving test|practical test]].

==Types of licence==

Israel has the following types of driving licences:
* A2, A1 and A licences – for two-wheeled vehicles, with [[horse power]] limits set at:
A2 - 14.6 HP,
A1 - 47.46 HP,
A - no limit

* B – for passenger vehicles up to 3.5 [[metric ton|ton]]s and up to 8 passengers (not including driver)
* C1, C – trucks,
C1 for private minibus up to 8 passengers.
C – for trucks up to 12 tons and no tonnage limit

* D3, D2, D1, D – for large passenger vehicles. 
D3 for a private [[minibus]] up to 5 tons, 
D2 for a public minibus with the same tonnage limit, 
D1 for a public transport vehicle with up to 16 passengers, and 
D for buses.

* C+E – for commercial motor vehicles, up to 3.5 tons (including attachments)
* 1 – for tractors (not included in EU standards)

==Passenger car licence==
Anyone aged at least 16 years and 9 months may receive a Type B [[driver's licence]]. After receiving both a medical and [[Eye examination|eye checkup]], an applicant can take a 30 question multiple-choice test, of which they must answer at least 26 correctly. Before taking the actual [[driving test]], they must receive at least 28 lessons at a certified [[Driver's education|driving school]]. After passing the internal driving school test, the instructor will arrange the road test, which will be taken in the driving school's vehicle. If someone fails either the written or driving test, one must wait one day before retaking the written test, however the current wait time is to take a second driving test is uncertain, ranging between three to six months. Once the driving test has been passed, the licensing authority will issue a temporary licence together with a payment voucher. Once the fee has been paid, the actual licence will be sent in the mail.

For the first three months, the new licensee must be accompanied by someone aged over 24, who has had a licence for at least 5 years, or someone over 30, who has had a licence for over 3 years. For the next three months the new driver must be accompanied by someone (with the same specifications as before) in the night, meaning from 9 P.M. until 6 A.M.. after those three months the new driver's accompanied people need to sign on his temporary licence so he could get the permanent one. In addition, during the first two years, the new driver must hang a sign reading "New Driver" ({{lang-he|נהג חדש}}, ''Nahag Hadash'') in black letters on a yellow background. Anyone failing to comply with these requirements is subject to be fined and tried in [[traffic court]] for driving without a licence. If a new driver violates a traffic law, one may be required to retake the written and driving test.

==Foreign driving licence==
New immigrants, tourists, temporary residents, and citizens returning after residing overseas for at least a year may drive in Israel on a foreign licence&lt;!--spelling as in source cited--&gt; for one year from entry into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mot.gov.il/faqs/9-renewingyourdrivinglicence/46-israel-fdl State of Israel, Ministry of Transport and Road Safety, Driving in Israel using a foreign driving licence?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licence conversion==
Anyone possessing a foreign driving licence residing in Israel for more than 12 months must convert their driving licence. As of August 13, 2017, any immigrant that held a driving licence 5 years prior to his/her immigration can convert his/her licence Without taking any tests[http://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/government-services/drivers-license-cars/converting-foreign-drivers-license/] The applicant is required to undergo both a medical checkup and eye checkup.  After applying at the local licence authority office for an exemption from the written test and the requirement for 28 lessons, one is required to pay for a test at the local post office, and the instructor will arrange for an abbreviated driving test.  Prior to May 13, 2014 if the applicant failed two such tests, he or she had to pass the written test before retaking a thorough driving test. Legislation passed by the Knesset on that date, however, allows a licensed foreign driver to re-take the test indefinitely within the first three years following aliyah.

'''Ellen Valentik Leonida''' (born 1970 in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]], formerly Kishinev, USSR) is an American [[criminal defense]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] best known for defending [[Scott Dyleski]], a young high school student accused of murdering the wife of prominent attorney [[Daniel Horowitz]].  She served as a Deputy [[Public Defender]] for almost ten years at the [[Contra Costa County]], [[California]] Public Defender's Office.  After leaving Contra Costa, she was a partner at the [[San Francisco]] firm Badami, Hartsough &amp; Leonida.  She is now with the Office of the Federal Public Defender in Oakland.

==Education==
Leonida attended [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], as an undergraduate majoring in American Studies. In 1993, she received a bachelor's degree  with College Honors and Highest Honors in the major and was admitted to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

She attended law school at [[UC Berkeley]]'s [[Boalt Hall School of Law]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. In law school she was director of the Homeless Outreach Project and a founding member of the Boalt Hall Chapter of the [[National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]] as well as a volunteer at the California Asylum Representation Clinic.  Ms. Leonida received her [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in 1996.  On December 3, 1996, she was admitted to California State Bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=184194 State Bar of CA :: Ellen V. Leonida], ''The State Bar of California'', September 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In 1997, Leonida joined the Contra Costa County Public Defender's Office, initially working as a law clerk after she graduated from law school.  Prior to joining the office she interned at the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights and the Youth Law Center.  Since 1997, she has had experience doing both [[misdemeanor]] and [[felony]] cases.  Before leaving, Leonida handled a felony caseload in the [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] branch of the Public Defender's Office.

==Scott Dyleski==
{{main article|Scott Dyleski}}
Her most famous client from her state public defender days is [[Scott Dyleski]].  In the fall of 2005, Dyleski, then 16, was accused of beating the wife, Pamela Vitale, of prominent criminal defense attorney [[Daniel Horowitz]] to death in their [[Lafayette, California]] home.  She became his attorney after the Dyleski family fired their attorney, Thomas McKenna due to a conflict of interest.  McKenna had defended the driver of a car that killed Dyleski's sister and another passenger in 2002. Dyleski was later convicted of the charges and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

The '''Equator Prize''', organized by the Equator Initiative within the [[United Nations Development Programme]],&lt;ref name="content.undp.org"&gt;[http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2010/september/25-equator-prize-winners-for-the-environment-and-poverty-reduction.en "25 Equator prize winners honoured for saving the environment and reducing poverty"], UNDP Newsroom, September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is awarded biennially to recognize community efforts to reduce poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equatorinitiative.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=412&amp;Itemid=537&amp;lang=en "Equator Prize"] Equator Initiative official website&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 2015 awards ==

The Equator Prize 2015 was awarded on 7 December to 21 local and indigenous community initiatives&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.equatorinitiative.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=889&amp;Itemid=1093&amp;lang=en |title=The Equator Prize 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each winning initiative received US$10,000 was supported to participate in a series of special events at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, France in December 2015.

== Criteria ==

Equator Prize winners are selected based on the following criteria:

* '''Impact''': Initiatives that reduce poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, or through equitable benefit sharing from the use of genetic resources.
* '''Partnerships''': Initiatives that adopt a partnership approach by linking activities with non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, the private sector, governments, research and/or academic institutions, and public or private foundations.
* '''Sustainability''': Initiatives that demonstrate at least three years of successful and lasting changes in local socio-economic conditions and have positive impacts on biodiversity.
* '''Innovation and Transferability''': Initiatives that demonstrate new and adaptable approaches that overcome prevailing constraints and offer knowledge, experience and lessons of relevance to other communities.
* '''Leadership and Community Empowerment''': Initiatives that demonstrate leadership that inspires action and change consistent with the vision of the Equator Initiative, including policy and/or institutional change and the empowerment of local people, especially marginalized groups.
* '''Gender Equality and Social Inclusion''': Initiatives that incorporate social and cultural diversity and promote gender equality.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Nominations and eligibility ==

Equator Prize nominations are accepted from three regions of eligibility within the equatorial belt (23.5 degrees north and south of the equator): Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) selects the twenty-five Equator Prize winners, a pool that is further narrowed to five special recognition communities by a jury of conservation and development professionals.  Representatives of winning communities are sometimes sponsored to participate in Equator Initiative “dialogue spaces” and an award ceremony.

In addition to recognition for their work, a monetary award, and an opportunity to shape national and global policy, all nominees are invited to join the Community Knowledge Service (CKS) and are profiled in the Equator Knowledge Zone (EKZ) database of practice.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">'''Frank Parsons''' (November 14, 1854 – September 26, 1908) was an American professor, social reformer, and public intellectual. Although he was educated as an engineer at [[Cornell University]], he passed the [[Massachusetts]] state bar examination and became a lawyer in 1881. Parsons was for more than a decade a lecturer at [[Boston University School of Law]] and taught at Kansas State Agricultural College from 1897 to 1899. As a leading social commentator of the [[Progressive Era]], Parsons authored a dozen books and more than 125 magazine and journal articles on a wide range of reform topics, including currency reform, regulation of monopolies, municipal ownership, establishment of direct democracy, and other matters. Parsons is also widely regarded as the father of the vocational guidance movement.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Frank Parsons was born on November 14, 1854, in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]], the son of an Anglo-Saxon family with American antecedents dating back to the time of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Mann472&gt;Arthur Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' vol. 37, no. 3 (Dec. 1950), pg. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; The family was highly intellectual in proclivity, with a number of physicians, lawyers, and teachers dotting the family tree, particularly on Frank's mother's side.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

Intellectually talented from an early age, Frank was enrolled in [[Cornell University]] at the age of 15 and graduated after just three years with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

===Career===

Parsons took a job as a civil engineer for a railroad located in Western Massachusetts upon graduation but he lost this position when the firm collapsed amidst the [[Panic of 1873]].&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

After relatively brief stints as a common laborer and a public school teacher, Parsons decided to go into the legal profession, preparing for the Massachusetts bar examination for one year before taking and passing the exam in 1881.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt;

Unfortunately, Parsons experienced a health failure shortly after passing the bar exam and found himself compelled to move the  [[New Mexico Territory]] in search of recovery.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt; Parsons would remain in that state for three years.&lt;ref name=Mann472 /&gt; Parsons established a legal practice in New Mexico but soon tired of the profession.&lt;ref name=Mann473&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Parsons was employed by the publishing firm of [[Little, Brown and Company]] as a writer of law textbooks.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt; Several volumes were produced during the course of this association.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt;

With textbook publications came academic recognition, and in 1892 Parsons was added to the staff as a lecturer at [[Boston University School of Law]].&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt; He would remain in that position for the greater part of the rest of his life, leaving only in 1905 on account of competing research interests.&lt;ref name=Mann473 /&gt;

Parson's position at Boston University only occupied part of the academic year, leaving him free to work on other projects and in other capacities for much of the year.&lt;ref name=Mann475&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the staff of [[Kansas State University|Kansas State Agricultural College]] in 1897, in the wake of a recent [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] electoral victory in that state and the advent of a new liberal administration at that school.&lt;ref name=Mann475 /&gt;

===Social reformer===

Parsons became interested in the ideas of economic rationalization during the [[Progressive Era]] of the 1890s. It was a time of great disparity between wealthy plutocrats, often exercising monopoly power over the economy through organized associations called [[trust (monopoly)|trusts]], and a frequently impoverished working class, racked by periodic depressions such as the 1873 event which had cost Parsons his first job.

With his characteristic energy, Parsons threw himself into the systematic study of many of the topics espoused by [[muckraker|muckraking journalists]] and intellectuals of the day.&lt;ref name=Mann474&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of books followed, including tomes on monetary reform ''(Rational Money,'' 1898), market dysfunction in the communications industry ''(The Telegraph Monopoly,'' 1899), public ownership of monopoly industries ''(The City for the People,'' 1899), substitution of democracy for [[oligarchy]] ''(Direct Legislation,'' 1900), and the abuses of the railroad industry ''(The Trusts, the Railroads, and the People,'' 1906).&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt;

In [[Boston mayoral election, 1895|December 1895]], Parsons ran for [[Mayor of Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston-sub/doc/498288084.html |title=NAMED FOR MAYOR |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=6 |date=November 16, 1895 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |url-access=limited |via=pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the candidate for the Municipal Reform Party—"a fusion of [[Prohibition Party|prohibitionists]], labor, populists, and socialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18519043/josiah_quincy_elected/ |title=Josiah Quincy Elected |newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] |page=1 |date=December 11, 1895 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished third in a field of three, with 0.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1895bo#page/56/mode/2up |title=Annual Report of the Board of Election Commissioners |date=1895 |page=57 |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |via=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his steady stream of books and pamphlets, Parsons wrote extensively for the periodical press, contributing more than 125 articles to [[B. O. Flower|B.O. Flower's]] progressive monthly, ''[[The Arena (magazine)|The Arena]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt; In addition to his prolific work for ''The Arena,'' Parsons was named a contributing editor to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] monthly ''The American Fabian'' in 1896.&lt;ref name=Mann474 /&gt;

In addition to his writing activities, Parsons also emerged as a prominent public speaker, serving as a lecturer for the [[National Direct Legislation League]], as head of the lecture department of the [[Social Reform Union]], and as President of the [[National League for Promoting Public Ownership of Monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Herringshaw (ed.), ''Herringshaw's National Library of American Biography.'' In Five Volumes. Chicago: American Publishers' Association, 1914; vol. 4, pg. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his activity, Parsons came to be recognized as a national expert on public ownership of utilities. In 1906, he was commissioned by the [[National Civic Federation]] to travel to Great Britain to study the incidence of municipal ownership and its outcomes in that country.&lt;ref name=Mann475 /&gt;

Parsons also served as dean of the extension division of [[Ruskin Colleges|Ruskin College]] in [[Trenton, Missouri]].

===Death and legacy===

Frank Parsons died Sept. 26, 1908, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 53 years old at the time of his death.

A memorial service in Parsons' honor was held October 25, 1908, at the People's Church in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Service&gt;B.O. Flower, "Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in the Nation's Capital," ''The Arena,'' vol. 40, whole no. 228 (Dec. 1908), pp. 636-638.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eulogy by Rev. Alexander Kent, Parson's was remembered as a consistent analyst striving to advance the general weal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There were few men whose ability was so completely devoted to the public good.... The problem of human betterment was always uppermost in his thought. He was continually at work tracing the evils from which men suffer to their source, and showing how they might be avoided or at least greatly lessened. He was a consistent opponent of that individualism which pits men against each other in the struggle for existence, and an earnest advocate of that individuality that fits men for useful membership in the social body, and so draws them together in mutual fellowship and service."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kent, quoted in B.O. Flower, "Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in the Nation's Capital," pg. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parsons' papers are housed at [[Yale University Library]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, "Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader," pg. 472, fn. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The posthumous publication in 1911 of Parson's manuscript, ''Choosing a Vocation,'' and its so-called "talent-matching approach" proved to be massively influential with a generation of educationalists. Parson's book remains regarded as a classic in the field and Parsons is still in the 21st Century remembered as "the founder of the vocational guidance movement."&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: "Career Theory Models: Parson's Theory," CareersNZ, http://www.careers.govt.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Jakob Polotsky''' ({{lang-he|הנס יעקב פולוצקי}}; also '''Hans Jacob Polotsky''', '''Hans Jakob Polotzky'''; September 13, 1905 – August 10, 1991) was an Israeli orientalist, linguist, and professor of [[Semitic languages]] and [[Egyptology]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

== Biography ==
Polotsky was born in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], as the son of a [[Russian Jew]]ish couple. He grew up in [[Berlin]] and studied Egyptology and Semitics at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. From 1926 to 1931 he was a co-worker of the ''Septuaginta-Unternehmen'' of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen. In 1929 he received his Ph.D. degree for the dissertation ''Zu den Inschriften der 11. Dynastie''. He worked in Berlin editing [[coptic language|Coptic]] [[Manichaean]] texts from 1933 till 1934, with the Church historian [[Carl Schmidt (Coptologist)|Carl Schmidt]]. He left Germany in 1935 and settled in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], where he taught and researched at the Hebrew University in [[Jerusalem]], becoming professor in 1948. He died in Jerusalem.

His main achievement was the ''Études de syntaxe copte'' published in 1944 which fundamentally changed the scientific view of the syntax of the Coptic and earlier ancient Egyptian languages. Polotsky's theory of the Egyptian verb (a particularly delicate argument, since Egyptians distinguished their different verb forms mainly by the vocalizations, and vowels were not written) had so much success that it has been called [[Standard Theory (Egyptology)|the Standard Theory]].

In Berlin, Polotsky had been a student of the famous egyptologist [[Kurt Heinrich Sethe]]; in Jerusalem, one of his students was [[Miriam Lichtheim]], known for her extensive translations of ancient Egyptian texts.

== Awards ==
* In 1962, Polotsky received the Rothschild Prize
* In 1966, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in the humanities.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1966 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashkav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hispanic  Belizean''' or '''Belizean Mestizo''' is a Belizean of [[Hispanic people|Hispanic]] and [[mestizo]] origin. Currently, they comprise around 52.9% of [[Belize]]'s population.

Most Hispanic Belizeans are self-identified [[mestizos]]. Most mestizos speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]], and [[English language|English]] fluently. The mestizo should not be confused with the Yucatec Maya who are also known as "Maya-Mestizos" in Belize.&lt;ref name="mybelizeadventure.com"&gt;{{cite news | title=Mestizo location in Belize; Location | url =http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php | accessdate =14 February 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080214181257/http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php| archivedate= 14 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Belize (1506-1862)}}

=== First occupations and Spanish expeditions in Belize ===
In 1494 the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed, claiming the entire western [[New World]] for Spain, including what is now Belize. Then in the mid-16th century Spanish [[conquistadors]] explored this territory, declaring it a Spanish colony &lt;ref Name="Johnson2003"&gt;Johnson, Melissa A. (October 2003). "The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras". Environmental History 8 (4): 598-617.&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated into the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] on December 27, 1527, when it was founded. &lt;ref Name="CUÑA BRITÁNICA"/&gt; In the second half of that century it was integrated into the government of [[Yucatan]] in [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. &lt;ref Name="Minasexcoo"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:F7Gqx81Ww6YJ:www.maec.es/SiteCollectionDocuments/Monografias/Belice.pdf+&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjjFkguQxuuXT4Wbm4cHRSVHloWa8Y50GVw80enUScaZ4MUUrxRsMQt7HNrNousyrmPrCm-QnqgOwYEiL4TUv8scx83pesBnp8xfMRiE3mUJyDRU14IlhxrtW7Z3EHTYbX0ZyST&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzgf8WWqeCkJtoUKVbzsKH9dJDkA BELICE - Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y de Cooperación]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1530 the conqueror [[Francisco de Montejo]] attacked the Nachankan Maya and Belize but failed to subdue the Maya to Spanish rule,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moon.com/destinations/belize/background/history/colonialism-Colonialism History | Your Guide to Belize Travel | Moon Travel]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1544 we have the first written documents about an established Spanish presence in Belize, in the Mayan city of [[Lamanai]]. There a Spanish colonial church was built in 1570. This city reflects considerable European influences. &lt;ref Name="cosasdelcaribe"&gt;[http://www.cosasdelcaribe.es/historia-belice/ Historia de Belice] (in spanish: Belize´s history). Consultado el 28 de noviembre de 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish missionaries arriving in 1550 evangelized the area's population of [[Ch'ol people]] (a language group belonging to ethnic group [[Q'eqchi' people]]), reaching the [[Amatique Bay]] (present Province Verapaz, in the southern half of the current Belize). &lt;ref Name="CUÑA BRITÁNICA"&gt;[http://diplomaticosescritores.org/revistas/29_4.htm III. Belice, otra cuña británica en iberoamérica (in Spanish: BELIZE, another british wedge Iberian America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611062649/http://www.diplomaticosescritores.org/revistas/29_4.htm |date=2013-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, few Spanish settled in the area because of the lack of the gold they'd come seeking and the strong resistance of the [[Maya people]]. &lt;ref Name="Johnson2003"/&gt; The Spanish colonists living in Belize often fought against the Maya, who were affected by slavery and disease carried by the Spanish.&lt;ref name = "cosasdelcaribe"/&gt;

In 1618 there is evidence of evangelization in Pucté, northern Belize, and in 1621 at Tipúes with the Mopanes, in the central part of the territory. &lt;ref Name="CUÑA BRITÁNICA"/&gt; After the mid-16th century, there is little evidence of Spanish evangelization. An exception is the journey undertaken by a Dominican priest Father Jose Delgado in 1677. Delgado traveled to Belize from [[Bacalar, Quintana Roo]]. He was captured and stripped by some English near Rio de Texoc - probably the present Mullins River. &lt;ref Name=northernbelize&gt;{{cite news | title=Northern Belize Caste War History; Location | url =http://www.northernbelize.com/hist_caste.html| accessdate =14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1638 and 1695, the Mayans residing in [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]] enjoyed autonomy from Spanish rule. But in 1696, Spanish soldiers used Tipu as a base from which to pacify the area, with the support of missionary activities. In 1697 the Spanish conquered the [[Itzá]], and in 1707 forcibly resettled the inhabitants of Tipu in the area of [[Lake Petén Itzá]]. &lt;ref Name=cs&gt;Bolland, Nigel. "Belize: Historical Setting". In [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bztoc.html'' A Country Study: Belize''] (In English: A Country Study: Belize. Tim Merrill, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 1992). '' This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The struggle between Spain and Britain over control of Belize ===
In 1717, after the British settlement in Belize between the sixteenth and the seventeenth, the Spanish army led by Marshal Antonio Silva Figueroa and Lazo, governor of the Yucatan Peninsula, expelled the English from the [[Belize River]] delta area. &lt;ref Name="CUÑA BRITÁNICA"/&gt; &lt;ref Name="legion"/&gt; But the British returned, prompting a series of Spanish incursions to expel them.

On 20 January 1783, shortly after the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]], Britain and Spain signed a peace treaty in which Spain ceded to Britain a small part of Belize, about 1.482&amp;nbsp;km square&lt;ref Name="legion"/&gt;located between the [[Rio Hondo (Belize)|Hondo]] and Belize rivers. &lt;ref Name="CUÑA BRITÁNICA"/&gt; British settlers obtained a further concession. By the [[Convention of London (1786)|London Convention of 1786]] Spain ceded Belize another 1.883&amp;nbsp;km square (reaching the Sibun River or Manate Laguna, south of the Belize River).

Then, sometime between 1786 and 1796, a Spanish official visiting Yucatan reported that the English Baymen from Belize Town were expanding to cut logwood also in [[Campeche]], near a town of Spanish population. Spain therefore issued orders for the immediate and effective removal of the settlers who occupied Belize. There ensued a confrontation between Britain and Spain on the coast of Belize in September 1798. This [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] ended with the Spanish defeat. The British were able to continue their harvesting of logwood in Belizean territory, even in areas that remained officially Spanish. &lt;ref Name="legion"&gt;[http://www.burnpit.legion.org/2012/09/battle-saint-georges-caye-english-settlers-foil-spanish-invasion-belize Battle of Saint George's Caye: English Settlers and Spanish Invasion in Belizean Foil]. Retrieved on December 1, 2012, at 18:22 pm&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

Around the 1840s, thousands of [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] and [[mestizos]] were driven from the area of Bacalar during the [[Caste War]] (1847-1901), &lt;ref Name=northernbelize/&gt; &lt;ref name="mybelizeadventure. com"&gt;[http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php. My Belize adventure: People of Belize]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in the [[Corozal District|Corozal]], [[Orange Walk Town]], and [[Cayo District]], as well as in the city of [[San Pedro, Belize|San Pedro]] in [[Ambergris Caye]].&lt;ref name="2000 Belize Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celade.cepal.org/cgibin/RpWebEngine.exe/PortalAction?&amp;MODE=MAIN&amp;BASE=CPVBLZ2000&amp;MAIN=WebServerMain.inl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220091841/http://celade.cepal.org/cgibin/RpWebEngine.exe/PortalAction?&amp;MODE=MAIN&amp;BASE=CPVBLZ2000&amp;MAIN=WebServerMain.inl |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 December 2008 |title=Belize 2000 Housing and Population Census |accessdate=9 September 2008 |year=2000 |publisher=Belize Central Statistical Office }}
&lt;/ref&gt; About 7000 Mexican mestizos immigrated during these years.&lt;ref name = "prolades"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:I1PvdcTwIXAJ:www.prolades.com/cra/regions/cam/spanish/rel_belice09spn.pdf+&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShUwkVlybZomMw8JiD66jQZPfoy7tQlN4v9lUsUviESG6dcrXg0PXkjXRxn8WxmP1YvbMAwUvka98aIGOm6UaxRvcs5mNiEH_c-l4ieTlDITenoi2o136CoKgovnyOIiMYCCfyo&amp;sig=AHIEtbQz9LYbjyVePrrBdbHcW7FZFKHH4g belice - Prolades.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  
In the 1870s-1880s, the [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekchi]] emigrated from [[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]], Guatemala, where their lands had been seized for coffee plantations and many of them enslaved. They settled villages in the [[Toledo District]], living mainly by maize farming and fishing the streams. The [[Mopan people|Mopan]] originated in Belize but most were driven to [[Guatemala]] after the British assumed control of Belize in the late 18th century, after the Battle of St. George's Caye.  They returned to Belize around 1886, fleeing enslavement and taxation in [[Petén (department)|Petén]].

After 1958, [[Mennonite]] groups in [[Mexico]] emigrated to Belize, settling in the north and west of Belize ([[Mennonites in Mexico|Mexican Mennonites]] may have intermarried with native-born mestizos and Mexican mestizos).&lt;ref name="Icex"&gt;Belice - Icex www.icex.es/staticFiles/Belice_6779_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Then between 1980 and 1990 thousands of undocumented migrants moved to the central and western parts of the country. Approximately 40,000 Salvadorans (including [[Mennonites in El Salvador|Salvadoran Mennonites]]), Guatemalans, Hondurans and Nicaraguans immigrated to Belize in this decade of strife in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hispanoteca.eu/Landeskunde-LA/Pa%C3%ADses/Belize.htm BELIZE]. Retrieved April 03, 2013, to 2:56 pm.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 25,000 were from [[El Salvador]] and Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Icex"/&gt; This, along with a high fertility rate, dramatically increased the number of Hispanics in Belize, causing concern over the rapid growth of the Spanish language in a country where the official language is English.&lt;ref name="espbe"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:_Q6nsyCH0bEJ:cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_06-07/pdf/paises_42.pdf+&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgxV5zpEeRNy0hvNTXjPOeaCWbf6xh9C9mYeOmSqxDBCzPH8_KeiljWGKKyhcwJxfT8I1oEeDGqw1p7yw-X8XkEu41JgwMtv41a0-7tSOc-_lsBmhwv0w85eC8yUexRzWXZHmVD&amp;sig=AHIEtbTUCF8yPBiucHYda8UwZxL3CjYeCQ El Español en Belice] (in Spanish: The Spanish in Belize).

== Demography ==
{{See also|Demographics of Belize}}
According to a 2000 survey, 52.1% of the Belizean population is Hispanic. According to the 2000 census, Belize has 106, 795 Hispanic people. In this figure can be added another 21,848 people who can speak Spanish as second language. In total, there are 128,243 people who speak Spanish in Belize. Although English is the official language, Spanish is spoken by the majority of Belize's population.&lt;ref name="Icex"/&gt; Also, according to the 2000 census, about 50% of the Belizean population declared themselves Catholics.&lt;ref name = "prolades"/&gt;

They are mainly concentrated in areas bordering Mexico and Guatemala. That is, [[Corozal District|Corozal]], [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]], and much of the [[Cayo District]], as well as [[San Pedro, Belize|San Pedro]] town in [[Ambergris Caye]].&lt;ref name="espbe"/&gt; Both the people of Corozal, as people from Orange Walk, descended from the Yucatans who found refuge in Belizean soil fleeing the Caste War in the 1840s, while people of Cayo, descends from Guatemalans and Salvadorans people, mostly. The remaining districts also have Spanish-speaking population, although to a lesser extent. So, in Belize City, the most populated urban area in the country, it is common to use the Spanish language, next to [[Belizean Creole]] and in San Pedro, part of the [[Belize District]], has a predominantly Spanish-speaking population. In addition, the Mopan indigenous live now in the Cayo district and [[San Antonio, Toledo|San Antonio (Toledo district)]].  Some of the Kekchi and Mopan have mixed. However, this groups are not strictly Hispanic because they speak their own [[Maya languages|Maya dialects]], but they do come from Hispanic countries.&lt;ref name="Icex"/&gt; On the other hand, bilingualism in Spanish is encouraged, as the nation is surrounded by Spanish speaking countries.&lt;ref name="espbe"/&gt;

According to the 2000 Population Census, the people from Guatemala make up the largest group (42.9%) of the immigrant population in Belize, followed by nationals of El Salvador and Honduras.&lt;ref name="imprasc"/&gt;

'''Homeovestism''' is a concept identified by [[George Zavitzianos]] and further developed by [[Louise Kaplan]], to refer to the arousal of a person by wearing [[clothing]] appropriate to their [[gender]], in comparison with the more widely recognized practices of [[transvestic fetishism]], in which one is aroused by wearing clothing of a different gender.

According to Kaplan's book ''Female Perversions'' (Doubleday, 1991), homeovestism is "an impersonation of the idealized [[Phallic#In psychoanalysis|phallic]] parent of the same sex" in order "to overcome shameful and frightening cross-gender identifications" (p. 546, footnote to p. 250).

[[File:Fra Carnevale - The Ideal City - Walters 37677.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Ideal City'' by [[Fra Carnevale]], c. between 1480-1484.]]
An '''ideal city''' is the concept of a [[City planning|plan]] for a [[city]] that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.

==Concept==
The "ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the [[moral]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[juridical]] qualities of [[citizenship]] as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc.  The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town planning) or other geometrical patterns.  The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy [[Utopian]] ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as [[St Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].

==History==
[[File:Formerly_Piero_della_Francesca_-_Ideal_City_-_Galleria_Nazionale_delle_Marche_Urbino_2.jpg|thumb|350px|The ideal city attributed to [[Luciano Laurana]] or [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the [[Renaissance]], and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of [[Plato]], whose ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'.   The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilisation]], sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.

==Examples==
[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan of [[Sforzinda]], Filarete, c. 1465]]
[[Image:Palmanova1600.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Palmanova]] in 1593. The town is encircled by massive [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Venetian Defensive Systems]] that are a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Examples of the ideal cities include [[Filarete]]'s "[[Sforzinda]]", a description of which was included in his ''Trattato di Architettura'' (c. 1465).  The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular [[moat]].  Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called "Urbino" and "Baltimore" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show [[Classical architecture|Classically]] influenced architecture disposed in logically planned [[piazza]]s. The cities of [[Palmanova]] and [[Nicosia]], whose [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Ventian Fortess]] were built in the 1590s by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable example of the concept is [[Zamość]] in eastern [[Poland]] founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect [[Bernardo Morando]].

[[James Oglethorpe]] synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the [[Province of Carolina]]. The physical design component of the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]] remains preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the [[Garden city movement]] of Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]], realised at [[Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in England.  [[Poundbury]], [[Prince Charles]]' architectural vision established in [[Dorset]], is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.

'''Irish Canadians''' ({{lang-ga|Gaedheal-Cheanadaigh}}) are [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens who have full or partial [[Irish people|Irish]] heritage including descendants who trace their ancestry to immigrants who originated in [[Ireland]]. 1.2 million Irish immigrants arrived from 1825 to 1970, and at least half of those in the period from 1831–1850. By 1867, they were the second largest ethnic group (after the French), and comprised 24% of Canada's population.  The 1931 national census counted 1,230,000 Canadians of Irish descent, half of whom lived in Ontario. About one-third were Catholic in 1931 and two-thirds Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Wilson, ''Irish nationalism in Canada'' (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=63VVlvuNIqcC&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish immigrants were majority Protestant before the famine years of the late 1840s, when far more Catholics than Protestants arrived. Even larger numbers of Catholics headed to the United States; others went to Great Britain and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (1999) pp 764-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 census by [[Statistics Canada]], Canada's Official Statistical office, revealed that the [[Irish people|Irish]] were the 4th largest ethnic group, with 4,354,000 Canadians with full or partial Irish descent or 15% of the country's total population.&lt;ref name="statcan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000 |title=Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada - Data table |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a large and significant increase of 531,495 since the 2001 census, which counted 3,823,000 respondents quoting Irish ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/ETO/Table1.cfm?Lang=E&amp;T=501&amp;GV=1&amp;GID=0 |title=Ethno-Cultural Portrait of Canada, Table 1 |publisher=2.statcan.ca |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Household Survey 2011, the population of Irish ancestry has increased since 2006 to 4,544,870.&lt;ref name="C4Wauto-4530515"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=Ethnic%20origin&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1 |title=National Household Survey (NHS) Profile, Canada, 2011 |work=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=National Household Survey |date=April 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402102812/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=Ethnic%20origin&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1 |archivedate=April 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish in Canada==
[[Image:StPatQueens.jpg|right|thumb| [[Saint Patrick's Day]] Parade in [[Montreal]]]]
The first recorded Irish presence in the area of present-day Canada dates from 1536, when Irish fishermen from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] traveled to Newfoundland.

After the permanent settlement in Newfoundland by Irish in the late 18th and early 19th century, overwhelmingly from [[County Waterford|Waterford]], increased immigration of the Irish elsewhere in Canada began in the decades following the [[War of 1812]] and formed a significant part of [[The Great Migration of Canada]]. Between 1825 and 1845, 60% of all immigrants to Canada were Irish; in 1831 alone, some 34,000 arrived in Montreal.

Between 1830 and 1850, 624,000 Irish arrived; in contextual terms, at the end of this period, the population of the provinces of Canada was 2.4 million. Besides [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario), [[Lower Canada]] Quebec, the Maritime colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[New Brunswick]], especially [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], were arrival points. Not all remained, many out-migrated to the United States or to Western Canada in the decades that followed. Seldom few ever returned to Ireland.

During the Great Famine, Canada received the most destitute Irish Catholics, who left Ireland in grave circumstances. Land estate owners in Ireland would either evict landholder tenants to board on returning empty lumber ships, or in some cases pay their fares. Others left on ships from the overcrowded docks in Liverpool and Cork.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Power, ed., ''The Irish in Atlantic Canada, 1780-1900'' (Fredericton, NB: New Ireland Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Irish immigrants who came to Canada and the United States in the nineteenth century and before were [[Irish language|Irish speakers]], with many knowing no other language on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;O’Driscoll &amp; Reynolds (1988), p. 711.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival===
The great majority of Irish Catholics arrived in [[Grosse Isle, Quebec|Grosse Isle]], an island in [[Quebec]] in the [[St. Lawrence River]], which housed the immigration reception station. Thousands died or arrived sick and were treated in the hospital (equipped for less than one hundred patients) in the summer of 1847; in fact, many ships that reached Grosse-Île had lost the bulk of their passengers and crew, and much more died in [[quarantine]] on or near the island. From Grosse-Ile, most survivors were sent to Quebec City and Montreal, where the existing Irish community mushroomed. The orphaned children were adopted into Quebec families and accordingly became [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], both linguistically and culturally. At the same time, ships with the starving also docked at Partridge Island, New Brunswick in similarly desperate circumstances. 
 
A large number of the families that survived continued on to settle in [[Canada West]] (now Ontario) and provided a cheap labor pool and colonization of land in a rapidly expanding economy in the decades after their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1935-36/Gallagher.html |title=J.A. Gallagher, "The Irish Immigration of 1847" |publisher=Umanitoba.ca |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|thumb|[[Father of Confederation]] [[D'Arcy McGee]]]]
In comparison with the Irish who went to the United States or Britain, many Irish arrivals in Canada settled in rural areas, in addition to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Harman Akenson, ''Irish in Ontario: A Study in Rural History'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Irish and Protestant (Orange) Irish were often in conflict from the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Scott W. See, ''Riots in New Brunswick: Orange Nativism and Social Violence in the 1840s'' (Univ of Toronto Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, the Irish fought with the French for control of the Catholic Church, with the Irish successful. In that instance, the Irish sided with the Protestants to oppose the demand for French language Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francess G. Halpenny, ed.|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-wicQs5ZB0C&amp;pg=PA332|year=1990|publisher=Springer|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]], an Irish-Montreal journalist, became a [[Father of Confederation]] in 1867. An Irish Republican in his early years, he would moderate his view in later years and become a passionate advocate of [[Confederation]]. He was instrumental in enshrining educational rights for Catholics as a minority group in the [[Canadian Constitution]]. In 1868, he was assassinated in Ottawa. Historians are not sure who the murderer was, or what his motivations were. One theory is that a Fenian, Gaylord O'Neiel Whelan, was the assassin, attacking McGee for his recent anti-Raid statements. Others argue that Whelan was used as a scapegoat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David A. Wilson|title=Thomas D'Arcy McGee: The Extreme Moderate, 1857-1868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt0zuDgLQwcC&amp;pg=PA381|year=2011|publisher=MQUP|pages=381–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Confederation, Irish Catholics faced more hostility, especially from Protestant Irish in Ontario, which was under the political sway of the already entrenched anti-Catholic [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. The anthem "[[The Maple Leaf Forever]]," written and composed by Scottish immigrant and Orangeman [[Alexander Muir]], reflects the pro-British [[Ulster loyalism]] outlook typical of the time with its disdainful view of [[Irish Republicanism]]. This only amplified with [[Fenian Raids]] of the time. As the Irish became more prosperous and newer groups arrived on Canada's shores, tensions subsided through the remainder the latter part of the 19th century.

In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845-1852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed "Black 47," one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]], the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour. From 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winder|first1=Gordon M.|title=Trouble in the North End: The Geography of Social Violence in Saint John 1840-1860|journal=Acadiensis|date=2000|volume= XXIX|issue= 2 Spring|page=27|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10782/11551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph excludes those who have only some Irish ancestry. Historian and journalist Louis-Guy Lemieux claims that about 40% of Quebecers have Irish ancestry on at least one side of their family tree. Shunned by Protestant English-speakers, it was not uncommon for Catholic Irish to settle among and intermarry with the Catholic French-speakers. Considering that many other Canadians throughout Canada likewise have Irish roots, in addition to those who may simply identify as Canadian, the total number of Canadians with some Irish ancestry extrapolated would include a significant proportion of the Canadian population.

==Irish in Quebec==
{{main|Irish Quebecers}}
[[Image:Victoria Bridge under construction.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]] under construction in [[Montreal]], as photographed by [[William Notman]]]]

Irish established communities in both urban and rural Quebec. Irish immigrants arrived in large numbers in [[Montreal]] during the 1840s and were hired as labourers to build the [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]], living in a tent city at the foot of the bridge. Here, workers unearthed a mass grave of 6,000 Irish immigrants who had died at nearby [[Goose Village, Montreal#History|Windmill Point]] in the [[typhus]] outbreak of 1847-48. The Irish Commemorative Stone or "Black Rock," as it is commonly known, was erected by bridge workers to commemorate the tragedy.

The Irish would go on to settle permanently in the close-knit working-class neighbourhoods of [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]], [[Griffintown]] and [[Goose Village, Montreal]]. With the help of Quebec's Catholic Church, they would establish their own churches, schools, and hospitals. [[St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal|St. Patrick's Basilica]] was founded in 1847 and served [[English-speaking Quebecer|Montreal's English-speaking Catholics]] for over a century. [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College]] was founded by the [[Jesuits]] to serve Montreal's mostly Irish English-speaking Catholic community in 1896. Saint Mary's Hospital was founded in the 1920s and continues to serve Montreal's present-day [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking population]].

The [[St. Patrick's Day]] Parade in Montreal is one of the oldest in North America, dating back to 1824. It annually attracts crowds of over 600,000 people.

[[Image:Montreal Shamrocks Club 1899.png|thumb|right|190px|[[Montreal Shamrocks]] with 1899 [[Stanley Cup]]]]
The Irish would also settle in large numbers in Quebec City and establish communities in rural Quebec, particularly in [[Pontiac, Quebec|Pontiac]], [[Gatineau, Quebec|Gatineau]] and [[Papineau, Quebec|Papineau]] where there was an active timber industry. However, most would move on to larger North American cities.

Today, many [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] have some Irish ancestry. Examples from political leaders include [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Laurence Cannon]], [[Daniel Johnson, Jr.|Daniel Johnson]], [[Claude Ryan]], the former Premier [[Jean Charest]], [[Georges Dor]] (born Georges-Henri Dore) and former Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]]. The Irish constitute the second largest ethnic group in the province after [[French Canadians]].

==Irish in Ontario==
From the times of early European settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irish had been coming to Ontario, in small numbers and in the service of [[New France]], as missionaries, soldiers, geographers and fur trappers.  After the creation of [[British North America]] in 1763, Protestant Irish, both Irish Anglicans and Ulster-Scottish Presbyterians, had been migrating over the decades to [[Upper Canada]], some as [[United Empire Loyalists]] or directly from [[Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;Akenson, ''Irish in Ontario: A Study in Rural History'' (1984)  ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the [[War of 1812]], increasing numbers of Irish, a growing proportion of them Catholic, were venturing to Canada to obtain work on projects such as canals, roads, early railroads and in the lumber industry. The labourers were known as ‘navvies’ and built much of the early infrastructure in the province. Settlement schemes offering cheap (or free) land brought over farming families, with many being from Munster (particularly [[county Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[Cork County|Cork]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/i8/8 |title=Migration, Arrival, and Settlement before the Great Famine &amp;#124; Multicultural Canada |publisher=Multiculturalcanada.ca |accessdate=2011-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231124556/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/i8/8 |archivedate=2010-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Robinson (1785–1838)|Peter Robinson]] organized land settlements of Catholic tenant farmers in the 1820s to areas of rural Eastern Ontario, which helped establish [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] as a regional centre.

The Irish were instrumental in the building of the [[Rideau Canal]] and subsequent settlement along its route. Alongside French-Canadians, thousands of Irish laboured in difficult conditions and terrain. Hundreds, if not thousands, died from [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Ken|title=Rideau Canal Waterway - Memorials|url=http://www.rideau-info.com/canal/history/memorials.html|work=Rideau Canal Waterway - Memorials|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famine in Ireland===
The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Hunger 1845–1849]], had a large impact on Ontario. At its peak in the summer of 1847, boatloads of sick migrants arrived in desperate circumstances on steamers from Quebec to [[Bytown]] (soon to be Ottawa), and to ports of call on Lake Ontario, chief amongst them [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Toronto]], in addition to many other smaller communities across southern Ontario. Quarantine facilities were hastily constructed to accommodate them. Nurses, doctors, priests, nuns, compatriots, some politicians and ordinary citizens aided them. Thousands died in Ontario that summer alone, mostly from [[typhus]].

How permanent a settlement was depended on circumstances. A case in point is Irish immigration to [[Hastings County|North Hastings County]], Canada West, which happened after 1846. Most of the immigrants were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle's Corner, and O'Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, most of whom were farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Ryan, "A Study of Irish Immigration to North Hastings County," ''Ontario History'' 1991 83(1): 23-37&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s the major challenge for the Catholic Church was keeping the loyalty of the very poor Catholic arrivals during marches. The fear was that Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelicalization. In response the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet the need and keep people inside the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Nicholson, "The Growth of Roman Catholic Institutions in the Archdiocese of Toronto, 1841-90," in Terrence Murphy and Gerald Stortz, eds, ''Creed and Culture: The Place of English-Speaking Catholics in Canadian Society, 1750 – 1930'' (1993) pp 152-170&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic church was less successful in dealing with tensions between its French and the Irish clergy; eventually the Irish took control.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Maurutto, ''Governing Charities: Church and State in Toronto: Catholic Archdiocese, 1850-1950'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark G. McGowan, ''Michael Power: The Struggle to Build the Catholic Church on the Canadian Frontier'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectarian tensions===
Toronto had similar numbers of both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics. Riots or conflicts repeatedly broke out from 1858–1878, such as during the annual [[St.Patrick's Day]] parade or during various religious processions, which culminated in the Jubilee Riots of 1875.&lt;ref name="Galvin_1959"/&gt; These tensions had increased following the organized but failed [[Fenian Raids]] at points along the American border, which arose suspicions by Protestant's of Catholic's sympathies toward the Fenian cause. The Irish population essentially defined the Catholic population in Toronto until 1890, when German and French Catholics were welcomed to the city by the Irish, but the Irish were still 90% of the Catholic population. However, various powerful initiatives such as the foundation of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] in 1852 (where [[Marshall McLuhan]] held the chair of English until his death in 1980), three hospitals, and the most significant charitable organizations in the city (the [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]]) and House of Providence created by Irish Catholic groups strengthened the Irish identity, transforming the Irish presence in the city into one of influence and power.

From 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. Orange Order parades ended in rioting with Catholics, many Irish-speaking, fighting against increased marginalization trapped in Irish ghettos at York Point and North End areas such as Portland Point. Nativist Protestants had secured their dominance over the city's political systems at the peak of the famine, which saw the New Brunswick city's demographics completely changed with waves of immigration. In three years alone, 1844 to 1847, 30,000 Irish came to [[Partridge Island (Saint John County)|Partridge Island]], a quarantine station in the city's harbour.

===Economic mobility and integration===
An economic boom and growth in the years after their arrival allowed many Irish men to obtain steady employment on the rapidly expanding railroad network, settlements developed or expanded along or close to the [[Grand Trunk Railroad]] corridor often in rural areas, allowing many to farm the relatively cheap, arable land of southern Ontario. Employment opportunities in the cities, in Toronto but elsewhere, occupations included construction, liquor processing (see [[Distillery District]]), Great Lakes shipping, and manufacturing. Women generally entered into domestic service. In more remote areas, employment centred around the [[Ottawa Valley timber trade]] which eventually extending into Northern Ontario along with railroad building and mining. There was a strong Irish rural presence in Ontario in comparison to their brethren in the northern US, but they were also numerous in the towns and cities. Later generations of these poorer immigrants were among those who rose to prominence in unions, business, judiciary, the arts and politics.

Redclift (2003) concluded that many of the one million migrants, mainly of British and Irish origin, who arrived in Canada in the mid-19th century benefited from the availability of land and absence of social barriers to mobility. This enabled them to think and feel like citizens of the new country in a way denied them back in the old country.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Redclift, "Community and the Establishment of Social Order on the Canadian Frontier in the 1840s and 1850s: An English Immigrant's Account," ''Family and Community History'' 2003 6(2): 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Akenson (1984) argued that the Canadian experience of Irish immigrants is not comparable to the [[Irish American|American one]]. He contended that the numerical dominance of Protestants within the national group and the rural basis of the Irish community negated the formation of urban ghettos and allowed for a relative ease in social mobility. In comparison, the American Irish in the Northeast and Midwest were dominantly Catholic, urban dwelling, and ghettoized. There was however, the existence of Irish-centric ghettos in Toronto ([[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[Trinity Niagara]], [[The Ward, Toronto|the Ward]]) at the fringes of urban development, at least for the first few decades after the famine and in the case of [[Trefann Court]], a holdout against public housing and urban renewal, up to the 1970s. This was also the case in other Canadian cities with significant Irish Catholic populations such as Montreal, Ottawa and Saint John.&lt;ref&gt;Akenson, ''Irish in Ontario: A Study in Rural History'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise the new labour historians believe that the rise of the [[Knights of Labor]] caused the Orange and Catholic Irish in Toronto to resolve their generational hatred and set about to form a common [[working-class culture]]. This theory presumes that Irish-Catholic culture was of little value, to be rejected with such ease. Nicolson (1985) argues that neither theory is valid. He says that in the ghettos of Toronto the fusion of an Irish peasant culture with traditional Catholism produced a new, urban, ethno-religious vehicle - Irish Tridentine Catholism. This culture spread from the city to the hinterland and, by means of metropolitan linkage, throughout Ontario. Privatism created a closed Irish society, and, while Irish Catholics cooperated in labour organizations for the sake of their families' future, they never shared in the development of a new working-class culture with their old Orange enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Murray W. Nicolson, "The Irish Experience in Ontario: Rural or Urban?" ''Urban History Review / Revue d'histoire Urbaine'' 1985 14(1): 37-45&lt;/ref&gt;

McGowan argues that between 1890 and 1920, the city's Catholics experienced major social, ideological, and economic changes that allowed them to integrate into Toronto society and shake off their second-class status. The Irish Catholics (in contrast to the French) strongly supported Canada's role in the First World War. They broke out of the ghetto and lived in all of Toronto's neighbourhoods. Starting as unskilled labourers, they used high levels of education to move up and were well represented among the lower middle class. Most dramatically, they intermarried with Protestants at an unprecedented rate.&lt;ref&gt;Mark G. McGowan, ''The Waning of the Green: Catholics, the Irish, and Identity in Toronto, 1887-1922'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederation===
With [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, Catholics were granted a separate school board. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, Irish immigration to Ontario continued but a slower pace, much of it family reunification. Out-migration of Irish in Ontario (along with others) occurred during this period following economic downturns, available new land and mining booms in the US or the Canadian West. The reverse is true of those with Irish descent who migrated to Ontario from the Maritimes and Newfoundland seeking work, mostly since World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Magocsi, ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples''(University of Toronto Press, 1999) pp 745-47, 764-67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, a breakthrough in Irish Canadian Protestant-Catholic relations occurred in [[London, Ontario]]. This was the founding of the [[Irish Benevolent Society of London, Ontario|Irish Benevolent Society]], a brotherhood of Irishmen and women of both Catholic and Protestant faiths. The society promoted Irish Canadian culture, but it was forbidden for members to speak of Irish politics when meeting. Today, the Society is still operating.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Bremner, ''City of London, Ontario, Canada: The Pioneer Period and the London of To-day'' (1900) p 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have assumed that the Irish in 19th-century North America were impoverished. DiMatteo (1992), using evidence from probate records in 1892, shows this is untrue. Irish-born and Canadian-born Irish accumulated wealth in a similar way, and that being Irish was not an economic disadvantage by the 1890s. Immigrants from earlier decades may well have experienced greater economic difficulties, but in general the Irish in Ontario in the 1890s enjoyed levels of wealth commensurate with the rest of the populace.&lt;ref&gt;Livio Dimatteo, "The Wealth of the Irish in Nineteenth-Century Ontario," ''Social Science History'' 1996 20(2): 209-234&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1901 Ontario Irish Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians were among the most likely to own homes, while Anglicans did only moderately well, despite their traditional association with Canada's elite. French-speaking Catholics in Ontario achieved wealth and status less readily than Protestants and Irish Catholics. Although differences in attainment existed between people of different religious denominations, the difference between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants in urban Canada was relatively insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Baskerville, "Did Religion Matter? Religion and Wealth in Urban Canada at the Turn of the Twentieth Century: An Exploratory Study," ''Histoire Sociale: Social History'' 2001 34(67): 61-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Ciani (2008) concludes that support of World War I fostered an identity among Irish Catholics as loyal citizens and helped integrate them into the social fabric of the nation. Rev. Michael Fallon, the Catholic bishop of London, sided with the Protestants against the French Catholics. His primary motive was to advance the cause of Irish Catholics in Canada and abroad; he had significant support from the Vatican. He opposed the French Canadian Catholics, especially by opposing bilingual education. French Canadians did not participate in Fallon's efforts to support the war effort and became more marginalized in Ontario politics and society.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Ciani,  "'An Imperialist Irishman': Bishop Michael Fallon, the Diocese of London and the Great War," ''CCHA Study Sessions'' (Canadian Catholic Historical Association) 2008 74: 73-94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
Today, the impact of the heavy 19th-century Irish immigration to Ontario is evident as those who report Irish extraction in the province number close to 2 million people or almost half the total Canadians who claim Irish ancestry. In 2004, March 17 was proclaimed "Irish Heritage Day" by the [[Ontario Legislature]] in recognition of the immense Irish contribution to the development of the Province.

Ontario sustains a network of Irish language enthusiasts, many of whom see the language as part of their ethnic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Giles, Jonathan|title=The Call of the Wild Geese: An Ethnography of Diasporic Irish Language Revitalization in Southern and Eastern Ontario|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2973&amp;context=etd|website=Ir.lib.uwo.ca|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario is also home to [[Gaeltacht Bhuan Mheiriceá Thuaidh]] (the Permanent North American [[Gaeltacht]]), an area which hosts cultural activities for Irish speakers and learners and has been recognized by the Irish government.&lt;ref name="Irish Emigrant"&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/article.asp?iCategoryID=69&amp;iArticleID=63093 "Canada to have first Gaeltacht."

With the downturn of Ireland's economy in 2010, Irish people are again coming to Canada looking for work. Some come on work and travel visas.

There are many communities in Ontario that are named after places and last names of Ireland, including [[Ballinafad, Ontario|Ballinafad]], [[Ballyduff, Ontario|Ballyduff]], [[Ballymote, Ontario|Ballymote]], [[Cavan, Ontario|Cavan]], [[Connaught, Ontario (disambiguation)|Connaught]], [[Connellys, Ontario|Connellys]], [[Dalton Township, Ontario|Dalton]], [[Donnybrook, Ontario|Donnybrook]], [[Dublin, Ontario|Dublin]], [[Dundalk, Ontario|Dundalk]], [[Dunnville]], [[Enniskillen, Ontario|Enniskillen]], [[Erinsville, Ontario|Erinsville]], [[Galway-Cavendish and Harvey, Ontario|Galway]], [[Hagarty, Ontario|Hagarty]], [[Irish Lake, Ontario|Irish Lake]], [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]], [[Keenansville, Ontario|Keenansville]], [[Kennedys, Ontario|Kennedys]], [[Killaloe, Ontario|Killaloe]], [[Killarney, Ontario|Killarney]], [[Limerick, Ontario|Limerick]], [[Listowel, Ontario|Listowel]], [[Lucan, Ontario|Lucan]], [[Maguire, Ontario|Maguire]], [[Malone, Ontario|Malone]], [[McGarry, Ontario|McGarry]], [[Moffat, Ontario|Moffat]], [[Mullifarry, Ontario|Mullifarry]], [[Munster, Ontario|Munster]], [[Navan, Ontario|Navan]], [[New Dublin, Ontario|New Dublin]], [[O'Connell, Ontario|O'Connell]], [[Oranmore, Ontario|Oranmore]], [[Quinn Settlement, Ontario|Quinn Settlement]], [[Ripley, Ontario|Ripley]], [[Shamrock, Ontario|Shamrock]], [[Tara, Ontario|Tara]], [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|South Monaghan]], [[Norfolk County, Ontario#Waterford|Waterford]] and [[Westport, Ontario|Westport]].

==Irish in New Brunswick==

[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] has often been called "Canada's Irish City". In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845-1852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed "Black 47," one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]], the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.

After the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 New Brunswick was originally named New Ireland with the capital to be in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lib.unb.ca/winslow/partition.html|title=Winslow Papers: The Partition of Nova Scotia|website=lib.unb.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1850, the Irish Catholic community constituted Saint John's largest ethnic group. In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 55 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born fathers. However, the city was split with tensions between Irish Catholics and Unionist Protestants. From the 1840s onward, Sectarian riots were rampant in the city with many poor, Irish-speaking immigrants clustered at York Point.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winder|first1=Gordon M.|title=Trouble in the North End: The Geography of Social Violence in Saint John 1840-1860|journal=Acadiensis|date=2000|volume= XXIX|issue= 2 Spring|page=27|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10782/11551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, at Reed's Point at the foot of Prince William Street, St. Patrick's Square was created to honour citizens of Irish heritage. The square overlooks Partridge Island, and a replica of the island's Celtic Cross stands in the square. Then in 1997 the park was refurbished by the city with a memorial marked by the city's St. Patrick's Society and Famine 150 which was unveiled by Hon. Mary Robinson, president of Ireland. The St. Patrick's Society of Saint John, founded in 1819, is still active today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint John St. Patrick's Society clings to men-only tradition|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/men-only-st-patrick-s-dinner-saint-john-1.3495040|website=CBC New Brunswick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miramichi River valley]], received a significant Irish immigration in the years before the potato famine. These settlers tended to be better off and better educated than the later arrivals, who came out of desperation. Though coming after the Scottish and the French Acadians, they made their way in this new land, intermarrying with the Catholic Highland Scots, and to a lesser extent, with the Acadians. Some, like [[Martin Cranney]], held elective office and became the natural leaders of their augmented Irish community after the arrival of the famine immigrants. The early Irish came to the Miramichi because it was easy to get to with lumber ships stopping in Ireland before returning to Chatham and Newcastle, and because it provided economic opportunities, especially in the lumber industry. They were commonly Irish speakers, and in the eighteen thirties and eighteen forties there were many Irish-speaking communities along the New Brunswick and Maine frontier.&lt;ref&gt;O’Driscoll &amp; Reynolds (1988), p. 712.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long a timber-exporting colony, [[New Brunswick]] became the destination of thousands of Irish immigrants in the form of refugees fleeing the potato famines during the mid-19th century as the timber cargo vessels provided cheap passage when returning empty to the colony. Quarantine hospitals were located on islands at the mouth of the colony's two major ports, [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] ([[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]]) and [[Chatham, New Brunswick|Chatham]]-[[Newcastle, New Brunswick|Newcastle]] ([[Middle Island (Miramichi)|Middle Island]]), where many would ultimately die. Those who survived settled on marginal agricultural lands in the [[Miramichi River valley]] and in the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] and [[Kennebecasis River]] valleys. The difficulty of farming these regions, however, saw many Irish immigrant families moving to the colony's major cities within a generation or to [[Portland, Maine]] or [[Boston]].

Saint John and [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] saw large numbers of Irish migrants, changing the nature and character of both municipalities. Today, all of the amalgamated city of [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] continues to host a large annual Irish festival. Indeed, Miramichi is one of the most Irish communities in North America, second possibly only to Saint John or Boston.

As in [[Newfoundland Irish|Newfoundland]], the Irish language survived as a community language in New Brunswick into the twentieth century. The 1901 census specifically enquired as to the mother tongue of the respondents, defining it as a language commonly spoken in the home. There were several individuals and a scattering of families in the census who described Irish as their first language and as being spoken at home. In other respects the respondents had less in common, some being Catholic and some Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newirelandnb.ca/Culture/The-Irish-Language-in-New-Brunswick.html|title=Culture - The Irish Language in New Brunswick - ICCANB|website=Newirelandnb.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish in Prince Edward Island==
For years, [[Prince Edward Island]] had been divided between Irish Catholics and British Protestants (which included Ulster Scots from Northern Ireland). In the latter half of the 20th century, this sectarianism diminished and was ultimately destroyed recently after two events occurred. First, the Catholic and Protestant school boards were merged into one secular institution; second, the practice of electing two MLAs for each provincial riding (one Catholic and one Protestant) was ended.

===History===
According to professor ''emeritus'', Brendan O'Grady, a history professor at the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] for fifty years, before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exiles and Islanders: The Irish Settlers of Prince Edward Island |first=Brendan |last=O’Grady |series=Studies in Ethnic History |date=August 17, 2004 |access-date=September 7, 2018|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|pages=360 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztq9 |isbn=0773527680}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} of 1845–1852, in which a million Irish died and another million emigrated,&lt;ref name="Ross_2002"&gt;{{citation|title=Ireland: History of a Nation|first=David|last=Ross|year=2002|publisher=New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset|isbn=1-84205-164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|226}} the majority of Irish immigrants had already arrived on Prince Edward Island.&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"/&gt;{{rp|4}} One [[coffin ship]] landed on the Island in 1847.&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The first waves of Irish immigrants took place between 1763 and 1880. when ten thousand Irish immigrants arrived on the Island. From 1800 to 1850, "10,000 immigrants from every county in Ireland" had settled in Prince Edward Island and represented 25% of the Island population by 1850.&lt;ref name="Campbell_Wyatt"&gt;{{cite web |series= |title=Early Immigration – Prince Edward Island |first=Marlene |last=Campbell  |work=Wyatt Heritage Properties |url=http://culturesummerside.com/assets/Program%20-%20Early%20Immigration-%20Prince%20Edward%20Island.pdf |date=nd |access-date=September 7, 2018|location=Summerside, PEI}} With some funding from the Community Museums Association of Prince Edward Island’s Museum Development Grant.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British divided St John's Island, following 1763, was divided into dozens of lots that were granted to "influential individuals in Britain" with conditions for land ownership including the settlement of each lot by 1787 by British Protestants.&lt;ref name="DCB_Baglole_1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exiles and Islanders: The Irish Settlers of Prince Edward Island |first=Brendan |last=O’Grady |series=Studies in Ethnic History |date=August 17, 2004 |access-date=September 7, 2018|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|pages=360 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztq9 |isbn=0773527680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1767 through 1810&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"/&gt;{{rp|4}} English speaking Irish Protestants were brought to the colony as colonial pioneers to establish the British system of government with its institutions and laws.&lt;ref name="Campbell_Wyatt"&gt;{{cite web |series= |title=Early Immigration – Prince Edward Island |first=Marlene |last=Campbell  |work=Wyatt Heritage Properties |url=http://culturesummerside.com/assets/Program%20-%20Early%20Immigration-%20Prince%20Edward%20Island.pdf |date=nd |access-date=September 7, 2018|location=Summerside, PEI}} With some funding from the Community Museums Association of Prince Edward Island’s Museum Development Grant.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish-born Captain [[Walter Patterson (governor)|Walter Patterson]] was the first Governor of St John's Island from 1769 until he was removed from office by Whitehall in 1787. According to the ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]]'', what became known as the century-long "land question", originated with Patterson's failure as administrator of a colony whose lands were owned by a monopoly of British absentee proprietors who demanded rent from their Island tenants.&lt;ref name="DCB_Baglole_1979"&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Harry |last=Baglole |title=Patterson, Walter |volume=4 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/patterson_walter_4E.html |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=University of Toronto and Université Laval |date=1979 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1830 the first ship of families from [[County Monaghan]], in the province of [[Ulster]], Ireland accompanied by Father John MacDonald who had recruited them, arrived on the Island to settle in [[Fort Augustus]], on the lots inherited by Father John MacDonald from his father Captain John MacDonald.&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"/&gt;{{rp|142}} From the 1830s through 1848, 3,000 people emigrated from County Monaghan to PEI in what became known as the Monaghan settlements, forming the largest group of Irish to arrive on the Island in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="O’Grady_2004_PEI"/&gt;{{rp|142}}

==Irish in Newfoundland==

The large Irish Catholic element in Newfoundland in the 19th century played a major role in Newfoundland history, and developed a strong local culture of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Johanne Devlin Trew, "The Forgotten Irish? Contested sites and narratives of nation in Newfoundland." ''Ethnologies'' 27#2 (2005): 43-77.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were in repeated political conflict—sometimes violent—with the Protestant Scots-Irish "Orange" element.&lt;ref&gt;John Edward FitzGerald, ''Conflict and culture in Irish-Newfoundland Roman Catholicism, 1829-1850'' (University of Ottawa, 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, The [[Benevolent Irish Society]] (BIS) was founded as a philanthropic organization in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] for locals of Irish birth or ancestry, regardless of religious persuasion. The BIS was founded as a charitable, fraternal, middle-class social organization, on the principles of "benevolence and philanthropy", and had as its original objective to provide the necessary skills which would enable the poor to better themselves. Today the society is still active in Newfoundland and is the oldest philanthropic organization in North America.

Newfoundland Irish Catholics, mainly from the southeast of Ireland, settled in the cities (mainly [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and parts of the surrounding [[Avalon Peninsula]]), while British Protestants, mainly from the West Country, settled in small fishing communities. Over time, the Irish Catholics became wealthier than their Protestant neighbours, which gave incentive for Protestant Newfoundlanders to join the Orange Order. In 1903, Sir William Coaker founded the [[Fisherman's Protective Union]] in an Orange Hall in Herring Neck. Furthermore, during the term of Commission of Government (1934–1949), the Orange Lodge was one of only a handful of "democratic" organizations that existed in the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]]. In 1948, a [[referendum]] was held in Newfoundland as to its political future; the Irish Catholics mainly supported a return to independence for Newfoundland as it existed before 1934, while the Protestants mainly supported joining the [[Canadian Confederation]]. Newfoundland then joined Canada by a 52-48% margin, and with an influx of Protestants into St. John's after the closure of the east coast cod fishery in the 1990s, the main issues have become one of Rural vs. Urban interests rather than anything ethnic or religious.

To Newfoundland, the Irish gave the still-familiar family names of southeast Ireland: Walsh, Power, Murphy, Ryan, Whelan, Phelan, O'Brien, Kelly, Hanlon, Neville, Bambrick, Halley, Houlihan, Hogan, Dillon, Byrne, Quigley, Burke, and FitzGerald. Irish place names are less common, many of the island's more prominent landmarks having already been named by early French and English explorers. Nevertheless, Newfoundland's Ballyhack, Cappahayden, Kilbride, St. Bride's, Port Kirwan, Waterford Valley, Windgap and Skibereen all point to Irish antecedents.

Along with traditional names, the Irish brought their native tongue. Newfoundland is the only place outside Europe with its own distinctive name in the Irish language, ''Talamh an Éisc'', "the land of fish". Eastern Newfoundland was one of the few places outside Ireland where the [[Irish language]] was spoken by a majority of the population as their primary language. [[Newfoundland Irish]] was of Munster derivation and was still in use by older people into the first half of the twentieth century. It has influenced [[Newfoundland English]] both lexically (in words like 'angishore' and 'sleveen') and grammatically (the 'after' past-tense construction, for instance).

The family names, the features and colouring, the predominant [[Catholic]] religion, the prevalence of Irish music – even the dialect and accent of the people – are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author [[Tim Pat Coogan]] has described Newfoundland as ''"the most Irish place in the world outside of Ireland"''.&lt;ref name="Wherever Green Is Worn"&gt;[[Tim Pat Coogan]], "Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora", Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Irish Uprising]] occurred during April 1800,  in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] where up to 400 [[Irish people|Irishmen]] had taken the secret oath of the [[Society of the United Irishmen]].  The [[Colony of Newfoundland]] [[rebellion]] was the only one to occur which the British administration linked directly to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. The uprising in St. John's was significant in that it was the first occasion on which the [[Irish people|Irish]] in Newfoundland deliberately challenged the authority of the state, and because the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] feared that it might not be the last. It earned for Newfoundland a reputation as a ''Transatlantic [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]''&amp;ndash;a far-flung but semi-Irish colony with the potential for political chaos.  Seven Irishman were hung by the crown because of the uprising.

According to the 2001 Canadian census, the largest ethnic group in Newfoundland and Labrador is English (39.4%), followed by Irish (39.7%), Scottish (6.0%), French (5.5%), and First Nations (3.2%). While half of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as "Canadian," 38% report their ethnicity as "Newfoundlander" in a 2003 Statistics Canada Ethnic Diversity Survey.

Accordingly, the largest single religious denomination by number of adherents according to the 2001 census was the Roman Catholic Church, at 36.9% of the province's population (187,405 members). The major Protestant denominations make up 59.7% of the population, with the largest group being the Anglican Church of Canada at 26.1% of the total population (132,680 members), the United Church of Canada at 17.0% (86,420 members), and the Salvation Army at 7.9% (39,955 members), with other Protestant denominations in much smaller numbers. The Pentecostal Church made up 6.7% of the population with 33,840 members. Non-Christians made up only 2.7% of the total population, with the majority of those respondents indicating "no religion" (2.5% of the total population).

According to the Statistics Canada 2006 census, 21.5% of Newfoundlanders claim Irish ancestry (other major groups in the province include 43.2% English, 7% Scottish, and 6.1% French).  In 2006, Statistics Canada have listed the following ethnic origins in Newfoundland; 216,340 English, 107,390 Irish, 34,920 Scottish, 30,545 French, 23,940 North American Indian etc.&lt;ref name=STATCAN2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, - Newfoundland and Labrador|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=10&amp;Data=Count&amp;Table=2&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
    			
It should be noted that most of the Irish migration to Newfoundland was pre-famine (late 18th century and early 19th century), and two centuries of isolation have led many of Irish descent in Newfoundland to consider their ethnic identity as "Newfoundlander," and not "Irish," although they are aware of the cultural links between the two.

==Irish in Nova Scotia==
About one Nova Scotian in four is of Irish descent, and there are good tracing facilities for genealogists and family historians.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence M. Punch, "Finding Our Irish," ''Nova Scotia Historical Review'' 1986 6(1): 41-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Nova Scotians who claim Irish ancestry are of [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster-Scottish]] descent.  William Sommerville (1800–1878) was ordained in the Irish Reformed Presbyterian Church and in 1831 was sent as a missionary to New Brunswick. There, with missionary Alexander Clarke, he formed the Reformed Presbytery of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1832 before becoming minister of the West Cornwallis congregation in Grafton, Nova Scotia, in 1833. Although a strict Covenanter, Sommerville initially ministered to Presbyterians generally over a very extensive district.&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Hay, "Cornwallis Covenanter: The Reverend William Sommerville," ''Journal of the Canadian Church Historical Society'' 1995 37(2): 99–116&lt;/ref&gt; Presbyterian centres included [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia]].

Catholic Irish settlement in Nova Scotia was traditionally restricted to the urban [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]] area.  Halifax, founded in 1749, was estimated to be about 16% Irish Catholic in 1767 and about 9% by the end of the 18th century. Although the harsh laws enacted against them were generally not enforced, Irish Catholics had no legal rights in the early history of the city. Catholic membership in the legislature was nonexistent until near the end of the century. In 1829 Lawrence O'Connor Doyle, of Irish parentage, became the first of his faith to become a lawyer and helped to overcome opposition to the Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence M. Punch, "The Irish Catholic, Halifax's First Minority Group," ''Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly'' 1980 10(1): 23-39&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also rural [[Irish people|Irish]] village settlements throughout most of [[Guysborough County]], such as the Erinville (meaning Irishville) /Salmon River Lake/Ogden/Bantry district (Bantry being named after [[Bantry Bay]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]] but abandoned since the 19th century for better farmland in places like Erinville/Salmon River Lake). In this area Irish last names are prevalent and an Irish influence is apparent in the accent, the traditional music of the area, food, religion ([[Roman Catholic]]) and lingering traces of the [[Irish language]]. In [[Antigonish County]] there are other villages of Irish provenance, and still others can be found on [[Cape Breton Island]], in places such as New Waterford, Rocky Bay and Glace Bay.

Murdoch (1998) notes that the popular image of Cape Breton Island as a last bastion of Scottish Highland and specifically Gaelic culture distorts the complex history of the island since the 16th century. The original [[Mi'kmaq people|Micmac]] inhabitants, Acadian French, Lowland Scots, Irish, Loyalists from New England, and English have all contributed to a history which has included cultural, religious, and political conflict as well as cooperation and synthesis. The Highland Scots became the largest community in the early 19th century, and their heritage has survived in diminished form.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Murdoch, "Cape Breton: Canada's 'Highland' Island?" ''Northern Scotland'' 1998 18: 31-42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish in the Prairies==
While some influential Canadian politicians anticipated that the assisted migrations of Irish settlers would lead to the establishment of a 'New Ireland' on Canada's prairies, or at least raise the profile of the country's potential as a suitable destination for immigrants, neither happened. Sheppard (1990) looks at the efforts in the 1880s of Quaker philanthropist James Hack Tuke as well as those of Thomas Connolly, the Irish emigration agent for the Canadian government. The Irish press continued to warn potential emigrants of the dangers and hardships of life in Canada and encouraged would-be emigrants to settle instead in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;George Sheppard, "Starvation, Moral Ruin and a Frozen Grave: An Irish View of Victorian Canada," ''Beaver'' 1990 70(5): 6–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish migration to the [[Prairie Provinces]] had two distinct components: those who came via eastern Canada or the United States, and those who came directly from Ireland. Many of the Irish-Canadians who came west were fairly well assimilated, in that they spoke English and understood British customs and law, and tended to be regarded as a part of [[English Canada]]. However, this picture was complicated by the religious division. Many of the original "English" Canadian [[settlers]] in the [[Red River Colony]] were fervent Irish Loyalist Protestants, and members of the Orange Order. They clashed with Catholic [[Métis (Canada)|Metis]] leader [[Louis Riel]]'s provisional government during the [[Red River Rebellion]], and as a result [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]] was executed, inflaming sectarian tensions in the east. At this time and during the course of the following decades, many of the Catholic Irish were fighting for separate Catholic schools in the west, but sometimes clashed with the Francophone element of the Catholic community during the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. After World War I and the ''[[de facto]]'' resolution of the religious schools issue, any eastern Irish-Canadians moving west blended in totally with the majority society. The small group of Irish-born who arrived in the second half of the 20th century tended to be urban professionals, a stark contrast to the agrarian pioneers who had come before.

About 10% of the population of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both individually and collectively, the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity - the Catholic Church and the Orange Order - served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share their vision of how the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cottrell,  "The Irish in Saskatchewan, 1850–1930: A Study Of Intergenerational Ethnicity," ''Prairie Forum''; 1999 24(2): 185-209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant and Catholic tension==
Tensions between the Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics were widespread in Canada in the 19th century, with many episodes of violence and anger, especially in Atlantic Canada and Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Scott W. See, "'An Unprecedented Influx': Nativism and Irish Famine Immigration To Canada," ''American Review Of Canadian Studies'' 2000 30(4): 429-453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willeen G. Keogh, "Contested Terrains: Ethnic and Gendered Spaces in the Harbour Grace Affray," ''[[Canadian Historical Review]]'' 2009 90(1): 29-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Brunswick, from 1840 to the 1860s sectarian violence was rampant in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. The city was shaped by Irish ghettos at York Point, and suppression of poor, Irish-speaking peoples rights lead to decades of turmoil. The division would continue to shape Saint John in years to come.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[Orange Order]], with its two main tenets, anti-Catholicism and loyalty to Britain, flourished in Ontario. Largely coincident with Protestant Irish settlement, its role pervaded the political, social and community as well as religious lives of its followers. Spatially, Orange lodges were founded as Irish Protestant settlement spread north and west from its original focus on the Lake Ontario plain. Although the number of active members, and thus their influence, may have been overestimated, the Orange influence was considerable and comparable to the Catholic influence in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Houston and William J. Smyth, "The Orange Order and the Expansion of the Frontier in Ontario, 1830–1900," ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 1978 4(3): 251-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In Montreal in 1853, the Orange Order organized speeches by the fiercely anti-Catholic and anti-Irish former priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], resulting in a violent confrontation between the Irish and the Scots. St. Patrick's Day processions in Toronto were often disrupted by tensions, that boiled over to the extent that the parade was cancelled permanently by the mayor in 1878 and not re-instituted until 110 years later in 1988. The Jubilee Riots of 1875 jarred Toronto in a time when sectarian tensions ran at their highest.&lt;ref name="Galvin_1959"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1959/Galvin.pdf|format=PDF|journal=CCHA Report |volume= 26|date=1959|pages=93–107|title=The Jubilee Riots in Toronto, 1875|first=Martin A. |last=Galvin |access-date=September 8, 2018 |location=Hamilton, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholics in Toronto were an embattled minority among a Protestant population that included a large Irish Protestant contingent strongly committed to the Orange Order.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalyn Trigger, "Irish Politics on Parade: The Clergy, National Societies, and St. Patrick's Day Processions in Nineteenth-Century Montreal and Toronto," ''Histoire Sociale: Social History'' 2004 37(74): 159–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Braithwaite,''' the younger (19 March 1797 – 25 September 1870) was an English engineer who invented the first steam [[fire engine]]. He also co-designed the first locomotive to cover a mile in less than a minute.

==Early life==
Braithwaite was third son of [[John Braithwaite the elder]]. He was born at 1 Bath Place, New Road, London, on 19 March 1797, and, after being educated at Mr. Lord's school at Tooting in Surrey, attended in his father's manufactory, where he made himself master of practical engineering, and became a skilled draughtsman. In June 1818 his father died, leaving the business to his sons Francis and John. Francis died in 1823, and John Braithwaite carried on the business alone. He added to the business the making of high-pressure steam-engines. In 1817 he reported before the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] upon the Norwich steamboat explosion, and in 1820 he ventilated the [[House of Lords]] by means of air-pumps. In 1822 he made the [[donkey engine]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, and in 1823 cast the statue of the Duke of Kent by sculptor Sebastian Gahagan that was erected in Portland Place, London.

He was introduced to [[George Stephenson|George]] and [[Robert Stephenson]] in 1827, and about the same time became acquainted with Captain [[John Ericsson]], who then had many schemes in view. In 1829 Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for the [[Rainhill Trials|Rainhill experiments]] the locomotive engine, ''[[Novelty (locomotive)|The Novelty]]''. This engine was the first that ever ran a mile within a minute (fifty-six seconds).{{sfn|Boase|1888|p=201}}

W. Skempton}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was ultimately destroyed by a London mob. It had, however, previously done good service at the burning of the English Opera House in 1830, at the destruction of the [[Argyll Rooms|Argyle Rooms]] 1830, and at the conflagration of the [[Houses of Parliament]] in 1834. It threw two tons of water per minute, burnt coke, and got up steam in about twenty minutes; but it was looked upon with so much jealousy by the fire brigade of the day that the inventor had to give it up. He, however, soon constructed four others of larger dimensions, two of which, in Berlin and Liverpool respectively, gave great satisfaction. In 1833 he built the caloric engine in conjunction with Captain Ericsson.{{sfn|Boase|1888|p=202}}

==Civil engineer==
In 1834, Braithwaite stopped playing an active role in the management of the engine works at New Road, and began to practise as a civil engineer for public works. He largely consulted on projects , both at home and abroad, particularly related to the capabilities of, and improvements to, locomotives. 1834 also saw Braithwaite plan and lay out the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] (ECR) in conjunction with [[Charles Blacker Vignoles]]. The railway was formally incorporated in 1836, and Braithwaite was soon after appointed engineer-in-chief of its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ5AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14| title=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|volume= 1| publisher= William Laxton| year= 1838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Braithwaite's recommendation, the ECR's [[track gauge|gauge]] was set at {{track gauge|5ft}}, and the line was constructed as far as Colchester to this gauge. The [[trackbed]], however, being made wide enough for the track to be widened to {{track gauge|7ft}} gauge. On the recommendation of [[Robert Stephenson]] the railways was re-gauged to the emerging "standard gauge" of {{track gauge|uksg}}; in later years Braithwaite was an advocate of still narrower gauges. Whilst engineer to the ECR he introduced an American excavating machine and an American steam pile-driving machine. He left the ECR on 28 May 1843. 

Braithwaite was joint founder of the ''Railway Times,'' which he started with [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] as editor in 1837, and he continued sole proprietor till 1845. He undertook the preparation of plans for the direct [[Exeter]] railway, but the [[railway mania]] of the period, and his connection with some commercial speculations, necessitated the winding up of his affairs in 1845.{{sfn|Boase|1888|p=202}}

==Consulting engineer==
Braithwaite had, in 1844, a share in a patent for extracting oil from [[bituminous shale]], and works were erected near [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] which, but for his difficulties, might have been successful. Some years before, 1836–8, Captain Ericsson and he had fitted up an ordinary canal boat with a screw propeller, which started from London along the canals to Manchester on 28 June 1838, returning by the way of Oxford and the Thames to London, being the first and last [[steamboat]] that has navigated the whole distance on those waters. The experiment was abandoned on account of the deficiency of water in the [[canal]]s and the completion of the railway system, which diverted the paying traffic. In 1844, and again in 1846, he was much on the continent surveying lines of railway in France, and on his return he was employed to survey [[Langstone Harbour]] in 1850, and to build the [[Brentford]] brewery in 1851. From that year he was principally engaged in chamber practice, and acted as consulting engineer, advising on most of the important mechanical questions of the day for patents and other purposes.{{sfn|Boase|1888|p=202}}

==Honours==
Braithwaite was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1819, a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] on 13 February 1838, and at the time of his death he was one of the oldest members of the [[Society of Arts]], having been elected into that body in the year 1819; he was also a life governor of seventeen charitable institutions.{{sfn|Boase|1888|p=202}}

==Family==
John Braithwaite married Caroline or possibly Caroline Amelia (1803 - 1878) and together they had at least 10 children (6 sons and 4 daughters):

Eliza Emma (b. 1824); John (b. 1825); George (b.1826); Clara Ellen Sophia (b. 1828) Frank (b. 1829); Harriet Frances (b. 1831); Richard Charles (b. 1832); Frederick John (b. 1835); Caroline Anne (b. 1836) and Edward Henry (b. 1838).

John died suddenly at 8 Clifton Gardens, Paddington, on 25 September 1870, and his remains were interred in Kensal Green cemetery.&lt;ref name="skempton" /&gt; His wife died in 1878.

The '''Jumping Frenchmen of Maine''' were a group of 19th-century [[lumberjack]]s who exhibited a rare disorder of unknown origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6803/jumping-frenchmen-of-maine|title=Jumping Frenchmen of Maine             {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome entails an exaggerated [[startle response|startle reflex]]&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard R, Ford R |title=From the jumping Frenchmen of Maine to post-traumatic stress disorder: the startle response in neuropsychiatry |journal=Psychol Med |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=695–707 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1410093 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700038137}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be described as an uncontrollable "jump"; individuals with this condition can exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. Jumping Frenchmen syndrome shares some symptoms with other startle disorders.

Individuals with this condition were first found in the [[Moosehead Lake]] region of [[Maine]],&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens H |title="Jumping Frenchmen of Maine." Myriachit |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=12 |issue= |pages=311–4 |date=March 1965 |pmid=14247390 |doi=10.1001/archneur.1965.00460270087011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were first described by [[George Miller Beard]] in 1878.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[George Miller Beard]] recorded individuals who would obey any command given suddenly, even if it meant striking a loved one; the Jumping Frenchmen seemed to react abnormally to sudden stimuli.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; The more common and less intense symptoms consisted of jumping, yelling, and hitting. These individuals exhibited outrageous bursts, and many described themselves as ticklish and shy. Other cases involved [[echolalia]] (repeating vocalizations made by another person) and  [[echopraxia]] (repeating movements made by another person).&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saint-Hilaire MH, Saint-Hilaire JM |title=Jumping Frenchmen of Maine |journal=Mov.

Intern.

==Causes==
The cause of Jumping Frenchmen syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Jumping%20Frenchmen%20of%20Maine NORD]&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory is that it is a genetic condition.&lt;ref name="lanska"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ |title=Classic articles of 19th-century American neurologists: a critical review |journal=J Hist Neurosci |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=156–73 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12122807 |doi=10.1076/jhin.11.2.156.15196 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation of 50 cases found the disorder to be remotely located and concentrated in the northern regions of Maine. Fourteen of these cases were found in four families.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; Another set of cases were found in a single family where the father, his two sons, and his two grandchildren exhibited "jumping" behavior.&lt;ref name="kunkle"/&gt;

It may also be a [[culture-bound syndrome]] or a formed habit. These French "jumpers" lived in a very remote region and most were lumberjacks. This type of small community would allow for a majority to adapt to this sort of reaction. Also, instances of many being shy may imply that the "jumper" was positively reinforced by the sudden attention as the entertainment for a group.&lt;ref name="video"/&gt;

In 1885, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]] included Jumping Frenchmen syndrome in the typology of "convulsive tic illness";&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt; studies of the condition in the 1980s cast doubt on whether the phenomenon was in fact a physical condition similar to [[Tourette syndrome]]. Documentation of direct observation of "Jumping Frenchmen" has been scarce, and while videotape evidence was recorded by several researchers that showed the condition to be real, MH and JM Saint-Hilaire concluded from studying eight affected people that it was brought on by conditions at their lumber camps and was psychological, not neurological.&lt;ref name="saint"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saint-Hilaire M, Saint-Hilaire J, Granger L | title = Jumping Frenchmen of Maine | journal = Neurology | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 1269–71 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3528919 | doi=10.1212/wnl.36.9.1269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==
Jumping Frenchmen of Maine syndrome must be distinguished from other conditions involving the startle reflex or [[tic]]s.

[[Tourette syndrome]] is characterized by multiple physical (motor) [[tics]] and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. There are many overlaps when compared clinically, but the abnormal "jumping" response is always provoked, unlike the involuntary tics in Tourette syndrome.&lt;ref name="lanska"/&gt;

[[Latah]] from Southeast Asia is a disorder where one's startle response is similar to a state of [[trance]] with repetitive speech or movements. Miryachit is a disorder found in Siberia that also displays an action similar to "jumping". [[Neurasthenia]] is a disorder with a startle response during periods of great fatigue.

[[Hyperekplexia]] is an extremely rare autosomal dominant neurological disease.  The symptoms start in infancy with [[hypertonia]], an abnormal muscle tension that decreases flexibility, and an exaggerated startle in all ages of life.&lt;ref name="lanska"/&gt;

==History==
Beard had a unique interest in unusual disorders and took the opportunity to observe the endemic in Maine.&lt;ref name="lanska"/&gt; He recorded "startle, jumping, and tic-like behaviors"&lt;ref name=Kushner22&gt;Kushner (2000), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; among the [[French Canadians]] and lumberjacks who lived near [[Moosehead Lake]] in northern Maine.&lt;ref name="lanska"/&gt; He published his descriptions of the Jumping Frenchmen in 1880, and he believed the condition was hereditary.&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt; History of Medicine professor Howard I. Kushner calls Beard's description "the most influential and detailed study" of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt;

According to Kushner, the French physician [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] chose his resident, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], to investigate the "relationship between [[tic disorder]]s and jumping and startle behaviors reported in Malaysia, Siberia, and Maine";&lt;ref name=Kushner21&gt;Kushner (2000), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard's descriptions and published them one year after Beard's papers.&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt;  In 1885, Tourette published "Study of a Nervous Affliction" where he included the startle disorders in the typology of what he called "convulsive tic illness", that included what later came to be known as Tourette syndrome.&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt;&lt;ref name="saint"/&gt;  Kushner argues that none of the patients studied by Tourette supported this assertion,&lt;ref name=Kushner22/&gt; and says that "many of his contemporaries refuted Gilles de la Tourette's typology".&lt;ref name=Kushner25&gt;Kushner (2000), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The humorist [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E.C. Bentley]] wrote a [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]] on the subject:{{cn|date=November 2017}}
:The Jumping Frenchmen of Maine
:Were often considered insane:
:Whatever you'd say
:They would leap to obey,
:Those excitable Frenchmen of Maine.

In the first episode, season 2 of ''Trial and Error''{{what|date=July 2018}} Anne Flatch has this, among her numerous neuroses.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The '''Kryts''' (self-designated '''хърыцӏаь''') or '''Gryz''' ({{lang-az|qrızlar}}) are a people of [[Azerbaijan]] reside in several villages in the Quba, Khachmaz, Ismayilli and Gabala regions, as well as in the cities of [[Baku]] and [[Sumgait]]. 

In 2005, the number of Kryts was between 10,000 and 15,000. They speak the [[Kryts language]], which belongs to the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic branch]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Nakh-Dagestan language family]]. In addition, all speak the [[Azerbaijani language]].

== Number and culture ==
The number Kryts according to H. Seidlitz, extracted from family lists in 1886, was 7,767 people. In "The Sociolinguistic Situation of the Kryts in Azerbaijan" it was reported that the number of Kryts was between 10,000 and 15,000.

Their main occupation is raising [[livestock]]; [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] are of secondary importance. In the development of crafts, they manufacture of carpets, rugs and woollen patterned socks.

The Kryts are predominantly [[Sunni Muslims]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">'''Maguzawa''' are a subgroup of the [[Hausa people]] who still adhere to some of the tenets of the pre-Islamic traditional religions of [[Kano]] and [[Katsina]], cities in northern [[Nigeria]]. Most of the citizens are found in the rural areas close to Kano and Katsina. They are known to have facial [[scarification]] similar to early rulers of Kano and Katsina under the [[Kutumbawa]] lineage. In terms of culture, there are only two major differences between Muslim Hausas and the Maguzawa: religion and social organization.

==Society==
[[Farming]] was the leading occupation of Maguzawas, while cattle herding was left to the [[Fulani]]. During the dry season, when farming activity is low, the men engage in [[dyeing]], iron working and [[basketry]]. The female Maguzawa were known to show an independent streak in economic activity in contrast to an imported [[harem]] culture in many other households. Many wives and female [[slaves]] engaged in trading and use their profit to buy clothes for themselves and their offsprings. In terms of a socio-political organization, most Maguzawa communities are made up of scattered compounds and like their Hausa counterparts are led by a Sarki. However, predominant Maguzawa [[communities]] have three patrilineal cultural leaders. The Sarki'n Noma, who is the head of farming, the Sarki'n Arna, known as the head of the [[Paganism|Pagans]] and the Sarki'n Dawa, the headman of the bush. The latter two heads or Sarkis share equal power. The Sarki'n Arna is usually given to the best beer drinker in the community while the defunct Sarki'n Dawa is the best hunter in the community.

Maguzawa according to the tradition are Hausa speaking people in fact the original Hausa speaking people found in northern Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Chad and some other countries of the world such as Saudi Arabia etc. this is as a result of their economic activity which is trading. Others include hunting, fishing, blacksmithing and farming.
 
There is no distinct difference between Hausawa or Hausa and Maguzawa. The name Maguzawa was named to some group of Hausa people after the jihad of Shehu Usman Fodio of Sokoto who spread Islamic religion in some northern part of the country, these group of Hausa were named Maguzawa by their fellow Hausa because they resisted accepting the Islamic faith from Shehu Usman Fodio and continue with the general Hausa or the known Hausa tradition which includes their way of worshiping the Gods with the help of idols. Maguzawa means "those that run away from Islam". All Hausa were known to worship the Gods before the arrival of Islam.

==Religion==
{{main|Hausa animism}}
Maguzawa religion revolves around an infinite number of [[spirit]]s or iskoki (singular - iska) in Hausa. This literally translates into 'WINDS' There are about 3,000 iskoki in the religion. However, the dominance of [[Islam]] in the region has diluted the original meaning of the Gods/spirits with the imposed Islamic canon, and they are also referred to today as Al-Jannu  (singular Jinn) also known as the westernised 'Genie'. The Isoki are divided into two main categories : The Gona or "Farm spirits" who are tame and easier to manipulate, and the Daji or "Bush Spirits" who are untamed and much difficult to contact.

==Controversies==
Miss Earth [[Russia]], Natalia Pereverzeva, has been heavily criticized for posing topless and for being the cover girl of the Russian Playboy’s May 2011 issue (about six months before when she was crowned new Miss Earth Russia 2012). The 24 year old model and former finance specialist, then sporting a blonde hair, appeared to have her hands covering her private parts and did a double breast exposure. Pereverzeva kept mum about the topless photos when asked by media.

She stated, "I don’t think that’s a good question for [[Miss Earth]]. Real beauty should be not only natural beauty but the beauty should come from the inside". Her fellow candidates have mixed reactions regarding the issue.

However, the organizers of the [[Miss Earth]] contest came to the defense of the Russian beauty, saying Pereverzeva did not violate moral standards.

They also said Pereverzeva’s Playboy pictorial was not as daring as the [[Playboy]] spread of another European contest who was not allowed to participate in the pageant.

"We cannot enforce our own cultural standards on candidates from other countries. Since Miss Earth is a global endeavor, Miss Russia was chosen through a legitimate official process in her country," [[Lorraine Schuck]], Miss Earth executive vice president, said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/11/12/12/miss-russias-topless-playboy-photos-spark-debate&lt;/ref&gt;

Barely after a week, Miss Russia made the international headlines once again by provoking an outrage in her motherland by calling it "a beggar" and "my poor long-suffering country, mercilessly torn to pieces by greedy, dishonest, unbelieving people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9687920/Russias-Miss-Earth-contestant-in-extraordinary-rant-against-country.html |title=Russia's Miss Earth contestant in extraordinary rant against country |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the outrage came from a response to a standard question about what made her proud of her country and what she could promote about it, asked of all contestants of Miss Earth which has been stated in the pageant's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missearth.tv/delegates_russia.php |title=MISS RUSSIA : Natalia Pereverzeva |publisher=Missearth.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereverzeva began by praising her country, saying it was, "a kind cow with very big eyes, funny horns and always chewing its mouth; oh, what sweet milk she gives!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegloss.com/2012/11/20/beauty/miss-earth-russia-natalia-pereverzeva-424/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/natalia-pereverzeva-miss-earth-rant-2012-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="world peace beggar russia"&gt;http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/what-about-world-peace-miss-earth-hopeful-natalia-pereverzeva-wages-war-on-beggar-russia/story-e6frfmqi-1226520351550&lt;/ref&gt;

But, veering off message, she added: "My Russia is a beggar. My Russia cannot help her elderly and orphans. From it, bleeding, like from a sinking ship, engineers, doctors, teachers are fleeing, because they have nothing to live on.

The Min peoples, though multiple distinct peoples, shared a ritual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telefol people|Telefol]] were acknowledged by the Min as being at the highest level of sacred knowledge, and groups such as the [[Baktaman people|Baktaman]] were at the lowest level. In this ranking the [[Urapmin people|Urapmin]] were either at the top or at least very close to the Telefol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the caste system used by the Ancient Indians, specific of the Vedic Society.

== Background ==
The National Supervisory Commission was formed as part of a series of reforms to China's anti-corruption system during the first term of [[Xi Jinping]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party. While the Communist Party had institutionalized internal mechanisms for combating corruption in some form since its early days, it was apparent that it was largely ineffective at curbing systemic corruption, and otherwise had no legal basis, as the main organ tasked with combating corruption and malfeasance, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], was a party organ, not a state one.&lt;ref name="dengj"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Jinting|title=The National Supervision Commission: A New Anti-corruption Model in China|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|date=March 2018|volume=52|page=58-73|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756061617300848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Xi's anti-corruption campaign, offenses were often prosecuted at the direction of local party authorities through their control of local Commissions for Discipline Inspection (CDIs) and procuratorial organs. While these authorities theoretically reported to their superior commissions at the next higher level of administration (i.e. the municipal organ would report to the provincial one, the provincial organ would report into the CCDI), in addition to answering to the local party leadership, in reality the local CDIs only answered to local party leaders, as they controlled the budgets, personnel, and resources of these organizations. This often led to arbitrary exercise of power and political selectiveness in the targets of corruption efforts.&lt;ref name="dengj"/&gt;

In late 2016, Supervisory Commissions (SCs) began pilot initiatives in [[Shanxi]], [[Beijing]] and [[Zhejiang]]. Provincial level chiefs of Discipline Inspection began serving concurrently as heads of the local Supervisory Commissions.&lt;ref name="dengj"/&gt; 

The formation of the National Supervisory Commission centralized control of anti-corruption resources to the central authorities and was aimed at curbing local interference in anti-corruption efforts. The former National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Office Against Dereliction of Duty, and the anti-corruption department of the Procuratorate were all folded into a single agency.&lt;ref name="dengj" /&gt;

In February 2018, an amendment to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] was proposed to make national and local supervision commissions official state organs. Local commissions will be appointed by local peoples' congresses at county and higher level and will be accountable to them and to the supervision commission at the higher level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/25/c_136999323.htm |title=CPC proposes listing supervisory commissions as state organs in Constitution|last=|first=|date=2018-02-25|website=www.xinhuanet.com|publisher=Xinhua|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pakistanis in Bahrain''' comprise [[Pakistani people]] living as expatriates or immigrants in [[Bahrain]] and their locally born descendants. The Overseas Pakistanis Foundation estimates that the population of Pakistanis in Bahrain is between 50,000 and 60,000. The Pakistani community maintains two schools, the Pakistan School, Bahrain (managed by parents elected board, Patron in chief- Ambassador of Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and [[Pakistan Urdu School, Bahrain|Pakistan Urdu School]] (private school under Asgharali perfume company) which educates community youth.

For the welfare of the Pakistani community in Bahrain, the Pakistan Club has been established in [[Manama]], which holds numerous events such as Iftar Nights and National Day celebrations.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Club celebrates National Day"&gt;[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?srch=1&amp;storyid=203038], Pakistan Club Celebrates National Day.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pakistan Club iftar for Women"&gt;[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?srch=1&amp;storyid=227885], Pakistan Club Iftar for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profession and integration==

Pakistanis have been in Bahrain since 1920. The first group to arrive to Bahrain were the people who came with the army of Al-Khalifa who were majority Balochs. The British Army also sent its most reliable force from Punjab and India to Bahrain. The presence of Pakistanis in Bahrain dates back to 1950. Bahrain is the first Arab country to grant citizenship to people who had served its country. A Pakistani can be granted citizenship after working for the government for 25 years. Up to 30,000 Pakistanis are thought to have obtained Bahraini citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abna24.com/english/service/bahrain/archive/2014/12/17/658827/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in Bahrain==
Majority of Pakistanis work in public protection and the army to help provide security for Bahrain. The young educated people tend to put there effort in helping Bahrain's economy, which has been hit severely by the ongoing protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/05/07/148147.html&lt;/ref&gt; The protests have seen many Pakistanis injured by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/127573/several-hurt-as-sunnis-shiites-clash-in-bahrain/ ET]&lt;/ref&gt; Up to two Pakistani policemen and two Pakistani civilians have been killed by angry Shia protesters.&lt;ref name="pak_bah2"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/22/pakistanis-in-bahrain.html Pakistanis in Bahrain, From the Editorial, ''Dawns Newspaper'', 22 Mar 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistan army affiliated [[Fauji Foundation]] and Pakistan navy affiliated Bahria Foundation&lt;ref name="pak_bah2"/&gt; have also been recruiting Pakistani military personnel as for the Bahrain National Guard (a paramilitary body). Following the [[2011 Bahraini protests]], advertisements for additional 800&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/144961/bahrain-national-guard-recruit-former.html Bahrain National Guard to recruit former soldiers from Pak, Deccan Herald, Islamabad, 11 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;-1,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/24/bahrain-spillover-to-spread-to-pakistan.html Bahrain spillover to spread to Pakistan?

This is in addition to at least (conservative estimate) 2,000 Pakistanis already serving in Bahrain security forces (military and police force).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/131455/ex-servicemen-export-mercenaries-to-the-middle-east/ Ex-servicemen ‘export’ mercenaries to the Middle East, By [[Saba Imtiaz]], Published: 12 March 2011, ''Express Tribune'']&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an estimate by the ''Wall Street Journal'', Pakistanis contribute at least up to 7,000 of the 25,000 strong Bahrain police force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703784004576220762563363574 Bahrain's Foreign Police Add to Tensions, by ALEX DELMAR-MORGAN and TOM WRIGHT, MARCH 25, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In total, almost 10,000 Pakistanis contribute to various Bahrain security forces.&lt;ref name="stat"/&gt; The Pakistan army and Bahrain National Guard are also known to maintain strong ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-press_release&amp;id=317 ISPR Press release, No PR27/2008-ISPR, Dated: 2 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7033">'''Prostopinije''' (meaning Plain Chant in [[Rusin language|Rusyn]]) is a type of [[monody|monodic]] church [[chant]], closely related to [[Znamenny Chant]]. Prostopinije is used in the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church]] and among the [[ACROD|Carpatho-Russian Orthodox]].

The tradition of Prostopinije chant is used in the lands of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Volhyn]] and [[Ruthenia]].&lt;ref name=drill&gt;[http://www.patronagechurch.com/HTML/full_congregational_participatio.htm David Drillock. "LITURGICAL SONG IN THE WORSHIP OF THE CHURCH"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221115557/http://www.patronagechurch.com/HTML/full_congregational_participatio.htm |date=2011-02-21 }} in ISSN 0036-3227 VOLUME 41 NUMBERS 2-3, 1997 ST. VLADIMIR’S THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY pages 204-205]&lt;/ref&gt; The Prostopinije traces its roots to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] traditions of [[Old Kievan chant]] and [[Bulgarian chant]], both stemming from the ancient [[Byzantine chant]] tradition; however, it was also affected by the local folk [[Carpathian music]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.patronagechurch.com/HTML/Prostopinije.23.HTM Article about Prostopinije] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812054134/http://www.patronagechurch.com/HTML/Prostopinije.23.HTM |date=2011-08-12 }} at patronagechurch.com. Published in the Byzantine Leaflet Series No. 23, November 1981, Byzantine Seminary Press, Pittsburgh, PA 15214&lt;/ref&gt; The Prostopinije chant is purely [[monody|monodic]], lacking [[ison (music)|ison]] or any other support, as well as folk choral [[polyphony]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Melodically, Prostopinije resembles [[Znamenny Chant]], and is closely related to it historically,&lt;ref name=mci&gt;[http://www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org/prostopinije/Prostopinije.html Prostopinije] at the page of Metropolitan Cantor Institute (www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org)&lt;/ref&gt; but is considerably richer with [[chromatic]] movements, reflecting its relative closeness to the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] branch of the [[Byzantine chant|Byzantine]] tradition.

==History==
By the end of the 18th century, the first attempt to systematize and write down the body of Prostopinije melodies was undertaken by the cantor [[John Juhasevich]] (1741–1814). In 1793, a ''Preparatory School for Cantors and Teachers'' was established in [[Uzhorod]] by Bishop [[Andrew Bachinskyj]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

In the 19th century and earlier, in liturgical practice, the chanting was performed by the trained [[Hazzan|cantor]] soloist; however, by the end of the 19th century, through the efforts of Father [[Andrew Popovich]] (1809–1898,[[Velika Kopanya]], [[Ugocha]] district), the tradition was changed drastically,&lt;ref name=a/&gt; and the whole congregation present in the church started to participate in the singing. This strong participation of lay people in the church singing was and still remains a relatively unique phenomenon among the similar chanting traditions.&lt;ref name=drill/&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, some efforts to unify the Subcarpathian chanting traditions were also undertaken under supervision of Bishop [[Julius Firczak]] of [[Mukačevo]] by father [[John Bokšai]] (or Bokshai, 1874–1940) and cantor [[Joseph Malinič]], resulting in a publication of first manual&lt;ref name=bokshai&gt;[http://www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org/books/Bokshai/index.html The Cerkovnoje Prostopinije (Church Plainchant) of Father John Bokšai and Cantor Joseph Malinič]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Carpathian Plain Chant,&lt;ref name=a/&gt; which was published in [[Užhorod]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=bokshai/&gt;

In many Orthodox parishes both in [[Eastern Europe]] and in the United States, the Prostopinije tradition was replaced by the [[polyphonic]] [[Russian Orthodox Church]] style of singing. Following the union of some of the [[Rusyns|Rusin]] parishes with the [[Orthodox Church in America]], inspired by father [[Alexis Toth]], the Prostopinije was discriminated against, and was in some cases replaced by the [[Obikhod]]. A gradual return to this traditional singing is happening now, however, quite similar to processes of re-introduction of ancient chants in other churches and denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byzcath.org/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/191467/Prostopinije Discussion on Prostopinije] at the Byzantine Forum at byzcath.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
Unlike with some other chanting traditions, Prostopinije remained a primarily aural, unwritten tradition for the major part of its history.&lt;ref name=mci/&gt; There were ongoing attempts to notate this chant, however, primarily as a means to systematize and unify it: first in [[Znamenny chant]] [[neumes]], then (as of about year 1600) in "square and diamond" notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://puluka.com/home/LiturgicalChant/Prostopinije/ProstopinijeHistory.html History of] Prostopinije at puluka.com&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these systems became really widespread, however.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; In the contemporary practice the chant is written in standard Western staff notation.&lt;ref name=scores&gt;[http://www.patronagechurch.com/chant/chant_table.htm Scores to download] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140604/http://patronagechurch.com/chant/chant_table.htm |date=2011-07-16 }} patronagechurch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local Variations==
Due to the predominantly oral nature of the Prostopinije tradition, the majority of melodies do exist in various local variants, sometimes being different even in villages located nearby. Two biggest branches of the tradition may be named, however: those originating from the [[cathedral]] towns of [[Mukačevo]] and [[Prešov]]. Due to the geography of the region, the former of these 2 traditions become the main tradition of the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic Church]]es (through the [[Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh]]), while the latter is relatively more used in the [[American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org/prostopinije/Melodies.html Prostopinije Melodies] at the metropolitancantorinstitute.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prostopinije chant was traditionally performed either in [[Church Slavonic]], or in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (with the Hungarian-language parishes adhering musically to the tradition of [[Mukačevo]]).&lt;ref name=bokshai/&gt; In the modern practice in the United States this chant is performed in English as well.&lt;ref name=scores/&gt;

University '''Rag''' societies are student-run charitable fundraising organisations that are widespread in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Most universities in the UK and Ireland, as well as some in South Africa and the [[Netherlands]] have a Rag. In some universities Rags are known as Charities Campaigns, Charity Appeals, Charity Committees, or Karnivals, but they all share many attributes.

In the UK, the '''National Student Fundraising Association (NaSFA)''', set up in December 2011, exists as a support and resource sharing organisation run by those managing rags for others managing RAGs.

==Origins==
[[File:University of Pretoria RAG.jpg|thumb|right|200px| &lt;center&gt; [[University of Pretoria]] welcoming of first years in Pretoria's Church Square in 1910 &lt;/center&gt;]]
	
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the origin of the word "Rag" is from "An act of ragging; esp. an extensive display of noisy disorderly conduct, carried on in defiance of authority or discipline", and provides a citation from 1864, noting that the word was known in Oxford before this date.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, ''rag'', University slang&lt;/ref&gt; Early Rag collectors may have ''ragged'' passers-by until they made a donation.

Alternatively, it is thought to be{{By whom|date=November 2013}} from the [[Victorian era]] when students took time out of their studies to collect rags to clothe the poor.

Much more recently, [[backronym]]s have been invented for ''RAG'' to stand for "Raise and Give", "Raise A Grand" or "Raising and Giving"; these were, purportedly, coined to convince a manager in a large charity of the value of working with student fundraisers.

The first Rag in South Africa was started at the [[University of Pretoria]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-174603121.html Retrieved April 1, 2010]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students took to the streets in parade that still exists today and is known as the Procession. During this parade, where they build [[Float (parade)|floats]], they carry cans and ask the spectating public to make donations. Today RAGs held at [[Afrikaans]] universities is called JOOL.  The acronym (Jou Onbaatsugtige Opoffering vir Liefdadigheid) is translated from Afrikaans as "Your selfless sacrifice for charity".  The annual JOOL/RAG week is held at the start of every academic year and serves also as a kind of welcoming party to students of the university.

==Fundraising==

===Rag Week===
[[File:MidKent College Rag Day 1951.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Students take part in the [[MidKent College|Medway Technical College]] annual Rag Day parade (1951)&lt;/center&gt;]]
Traditionally fundraising activities have centred on an annual '''Rag Week''', with events each day for the week. While some Rags are only active for this week, others use "Rag Week" as their flagship week to encourage participation for the whole year.

===Rag Mag===
A ''''Rag mag'''' is a small booklet traditionally filled with [[politically incorrect]] humour which was originally sold to the local community during Rag Week. Some university Rags with a strong local tradition still sell their Rag Mags, however the majority of others use theirs more as information-tools for new students wanting to know more about Rag.

A number of Rags claim to have published the first ever Rag mags:

Sheffield University Rag's [[Twikker]] was first produced in 1925.{{fact|date=May 2017}}  Manchester University published a Rag mag in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb133-sua|title=Archive of the University of Manchester Students Union - Archives Hub|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An issue of a Rag mag dating from 1923, called "Goblio", is in the archives of the University of Southampton.{{fact|date=May 2017}} However, Queen's University Belfast holds the most complete set of Rag magazines in its archives, holding 81 different copies of PTQ (''Pro Tanto Quid'' – taken from the city's motto "[[Belfast#Coat of arms and motto|Pro tanto quid retribuamus]]") from 1927 onwards.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

===Sponsored challenges and fundraising events===

Many Rags raise the majority of their money for charity through sponsored challenges and fundraising events. While these vary from University to University, typical examples of each include:

====Sponsored challenges====
* "Jailbreaks," competitions to get as far from the start and back again within a set period of time, without spending any money on transport.
* Sponsored [[skydive]]s
* Running events including [[marathon]]s, half marathons and 'Tough Guy' challenges
* Climbing expeditions
* Sponsored hitch-hikes
* other sponsored game of sports

[[Image:UCL-KCL Varsity Rugby 2014.jpg|thumb|[[King's College London]] and [[University College London]], the founding and rival colleges of the [[University of London]], hold their annual varsity rugby rag]]

====Fundraising events====
* [[Pub crawl]]s
* [[International Men's Day]] parties
* [[World record]] attempts
* Bed-runs racing teams with hospital beds.
* Pub Quizzes
* [[Duck race]]s

Manchester RAG also run one of the longest running sponsored events in the North West, known as [[The Bogle Stroll]], which celebrated its semicentennial anniversary in 2011.

Exeter RAG hold the Biggest World AIDS Day event in the UK, called the Safer Sex Ball, Seeing Thousands of students attending to raise money for Charity, £20,000 of which is annually set aside for local AIDS charity the Eddistone Trust.

===Rag Raids===

'''Street Collections:''' Currently known as 'Raids', volunteer collectors go out into the streets (often in costume) to collect for a specific charity on any given day with buckets rather than the clipboards.
 
Many Rags also organise week-long 'Tours' over the university holidays in which they will travel from town to town, collecting in each one, and raising thousands of pounds for the beneficiary charity.

'''Megaraids:''' A Megaraid is defined as a Raid where more than one Rag is present and in recent years these have been organised on a massive scale by charities with some events taking place consistently for over a decade. Charities which have a developed student fundraising events include [[Barnardo's]], [[Cancer Research UK]], [[Help the Aged]], [[Hope for Children (HOPE)|Hope for Children]], [[Kidscan]], [[Meningitis UK]], [[Meningitis Research Foundation]], [[Meningitis Trust]] and [[Worldwide Cancer Research (WWCR)|Worldwide Cancer Research]]. All Megaraids tend to include a social aspect and often attract former students who still take part.

==National Student Fundraising Association (NaSFA)==
'''NaSFA''' is an association of UK student fundraising organisations. It stands for National Student Fundraising Association and was born out of a meeting of 15 heads of UK RAG organisations at the national Rag conference in Durham 2011. These presidents identified a real potential for dramatic increases in efficiency by sharing knowledge and resources. They lay down some fundamental principles, realised a need for a constant and impartial 3rd party facilitator and duly chose the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]] from a selection of applications to support the project.

The underlying aims of '''NaSFA''', to foster sharing of resources, knowledge and support for and between student fundraising organisations have contributed to the 30 Rags involved.
In December 2011 the original '''NaSFA''' founders invited interested parties to an open meeting at the [[Union of Brunel Students]], to ask for approval on what they had been working on and to give Ed Marsh, the Vice-President of the NUS, a mandate to drive NUS support forwards through the organisation's structure.

==Rag Conference (UK)==
An annual conference for RAG societies and Charities is held in the UK. The conference is an opportunity for RAGs, student fundraising organisations, charities and associated partners to come together to network, learn and socialise over three action-packed days. In 2012 the RAG conference was held at Loughborough University, and in 2013, the RAG conference was hosted by The University of Birmingham from the 2 to 5 September.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6222">'''Services for mental disorders''' offer [[treatment of mental disorders|treatments]], [[support group|support]] or [[advocacy]] to people judged to have [[mental disorders]] (mental illnesses).

==Medical services==
[[Family practice]] ([[general practice]]) centers in communities are commonly the first line for assessment of mental health conditions, and may prescribe [[psychiatric drugs]] and sometimes provide basic [[counseling]] or [[therapy]] for "common mental disorders". Secondary medical services may include [[psychiatric hospitals]], although since [[deinstitutionalization]] these have been restricted in favor of [[hospital#Departments|wards]] within general [[hospitals]], and [[community mental health services]] based more locally. 

Such services may be provided on an [[inpatient]] or, more commonly, [[outpatient]] basis. They may offer a range of treatments, usually centered around psychiatric drugs, and be provided by a range of [[mental health professionals]], notably [[psychiatrists]] and [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric and mental health nurses]]. Non-medical professionals may also be involved, such as [[clinical psychologists]], [[social workers]] and various kinds of [[therapists]] or [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]]. Usually headed by psychiatrists and therefore based on a medical model, multidisiplinary teams may be involved in [[assertive community treatment]] and [[early intervention in psychosis|early intervention]], and may be coordinated via a [[case management (mental health)|case management]] system (sometimes referred to as "service coordination").

==Individual therapy services==
Numerous services exist exclusively for the therapy of mental disorders and distress. They may offer [[integrative psychotherapy]] (an eclectic tailored mix of approaches) or a particular approach, such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].

==Social care services==
Community services often include [[supported housing]] with full or partial supervision, including [[halfway house]]s. Social workers and [[support workers]] provide support and advocacy.

==Consumer, survivor and ex-patient services==
Many [[Psychiatric survivors movement|Consumer/survivor/ex-patient]] organizations provide services for those [[labeling theory|labeled]] as having a mental disorder. A number of charities providing services are "consumer-led". There are [[self-help groups for mental health|self-help/mutual support groups]] and day centers or [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|clubhouses]].&lt;ref&gt;McLean, A. (2003). [http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_8/Recovering1-McLean.html Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part I: Legitimization of the Consumer Movement and Obstacles to It.] International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation. 8, 47-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLean, A. (2003) [http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_8/Recovering1-McLean.html Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System  in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part II: Impact of Managed Care and Continuing Challenges] International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation. 8, 58-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Staff with a lived experience are now being employed as [[peer support specialist]]s within mental health teams.

==Traditional healing centers==
[[Traditional healer|Traditional healing centers]] provide a popular and accessible service across the African continent and other areas of the world, and often deal with mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Ngoma MC, Prince M, Mann A (2003) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/183/4/349 Common mental disorders among those attending primary health clinics and traditional healers in urban Tanzania.] Br J Psychiatry. 2003 Oct;183:349-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for Advocacy in Mental Health [http://www.camhindia.org/hhwm_project.html Role of Traditional Healing Centers (THCs) in Mental Health Service Delivery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal services==
Legal services exist to regulate and supervise the [[involuntary commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]] of those judged to have mental disorders and to be a danger to themselves or others. Some legal organizations provide specialized services for those diagnosed with mental disorders who may be challenging [[discrimination]] or involuntary commitment. [[Mental health courts]] are specialized court dockets that exist in some places to provide community treatment and supervision in lieu of incarceration for criminal offenders with mental illness.

==Global situation==
A Global Mental Health Group in coordination with the [[World Health Organization]] has called for an urgent scaling up of the funding, staffing and coverage of services for mental disorders in all countries, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lancet Global Mental Health Group, Chisholm D, Flisher AJ, Lund C, Patel V, Saxena S, Thornicroft G, Tomlinson M. (2007) [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673607612422 Scale up services for mental disorders: a call for action] Lancet. Oct 6;370(9594):1241-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr45/en/index.html WHO urges more investments, services for mental health] WHO website, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Recovery model]], services must always support an individual's personal journey of recovery and independence, and a person may or may not need services at any particular time, or at all.

The UK is moving towards paying mental health providers by the outcome results that their services achieve.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-payment-by-results-arrangements-for-2013-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitycare.co.uk/articles/16/04/2013/119098/a-quick-guide-to-mental-health-payment-by-results-and-its-impact-on-social-work.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taiwanese Hakka''' is a group of [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka dialects]] spoken in [[Taiwan]], and mainly used by [[Hakka people|people of Hakka ancestry]]. Taiwanese Hakka is divided into five main dialects: [[Sixian dialect|Sixian]] ({{zh|t=四縣腔|labels=no}}), Hailu ({{zh|t=海陸腔|labels=no}}), Dabu ({{zh|t=大埔腔|labels=no}}), [[Raoping dialect|Raoping]] ({{zh|t=饒平腔|labels=no}}), and Zhao'an ({{zh|t=詔安腔|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hakka.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=110321&amp;ctNode=2828&amp;mp=2210&amp;ps=|title=Amazing Hakka|date=2010-12-29|work=Hakka Affairs Council|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely spoken of the five Hakka dialects in Taiwan are Sixian and Hailu.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2010 |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02People&amp;Language.pdf |chapter=Chapter 2: People and Language |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805173731/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02People%26Language.pdf |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |isbn=9789860252781 |page=42 |archivedate=2011-08-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, possessing 6 tones, originates from [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]], and is mainly spoken in [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]], [[Pingtung County|Pingtung]] and [[Kaohsiung]], while the latter, possessing 7 tones, originates from [[Haifeng County|Haifeng]] and [[Lufeng, Guangdong|Lufeng]], [[Guangdong]], and is concentrated around [[Hsinchu County|Hsinchu]].&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yearbook"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2153">'''Uruguayan Chileans''' are people born in [[Uruguay]] who live in [[Chile]], or Chilean-born people of Uruguayan descent. 
==Overview==
There are lots of Uruguayan-born persons living in Chile, for a number of reasons. Both countries share the [[Spanish language]]; the historical origins of both nations is common (part of the [[Spanish Empire]] until the early 19th century); Chile has a bigger, more diverse economy, which attracted Uruguayans in search of opportunities; the relative geographical vicinity ([[Southern Cone]]) also helps.

Modern estimates put the figure of Uruguayans in Chile at over 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/donde-fueron-parar-los-uruguayos-n1106248|title=Where did Uruguayans go?|date=13 August 2017|publisher=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguayan residents in Chile have their own institutions, for instance, the Consultative Council in Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |title=List of Consultative Councils of Uruguayans abroad |accessdate=1 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809011138/http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |archive-date=9 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Violence against women in Guatemala''' reached severe levels during the long-running [[Guatemalan Civil War]] (1960-1996), and the continuing impact of that conflict has contributed to the present high levels of [[violence against women]] in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Villareal|first=Ryan|title=Half The Sky Is Falling: Systemic Violence Against Women In Guatemala Ripples From Brutal Civil War|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/half-sky-falling-systemic-violence-against-women-guatemala-ripples-brutal-civil-war-1024178#|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=International Business Times|date=January 18, 2013 &lt;!-- 5:58 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the armed conflict, [[rape]] was used as a [[Wartime sexual violence|weapon of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21053075|title=Guatemala shock as two murdered girls found on street|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Femicide==
[[Femicide]] in [[Guatemala]] is an extremely serious problem. According to a 2012 report by the [[Small Arms Survey]], Guatemala has the third highest rate of femicide in the world, behind only [[El Salvador]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/slideshow/?id=59ccc3c0-c719-467e-bf0b-622739b34ef4|title=Struggling with femicide and impunity for crimes against women in Central America|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to official figures, 560 women were murdered in the country in 2012, 631 in 2011 and 695 in 2010, though the exact number is not known.

Murders rarely result in any conviction and often are not properly investigated; less than 4 percent of all homicide cases result in conviction for the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/time-end-inaction-over-killings-women-guatemala-2013-01-17|title=Time to end the inaction over killings of women in Guatemala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/guatemala-s-war-women-2013-01-21|title=Guatemala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators are confident they will get away with murder, in part because of the "[[machismo]]" culture in Latin America. This culture allows women to be treated as objects rather than humans; equality and basic rights granted to men are not even in question for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Femicide' on the rise in Central America|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/femicide-rise-central-america-article-1.1552233|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape culture]] and [[victim blaming]] are the tactics that go along with machismo, and both men and women largely agree with the misogynistic tendencies that have survived for so long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on women activists==
Women who work as public activists, such as human rights defenders, including activists working to protect land and natural resources, face violence, threats, reprisal, and illegal arrests. Such acts are often committed by government authorities and security forces.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Report_AmericasDelgation-2012.pdf|title=From Survivors to Defenders: Women Confronting Violence in Mexico, Honduras &amp; Guatemala|publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Guatemala, women activists experience at least one attack each day on average, and an estimated eighty-three percent of these activists are land and natural resource defenders.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Factors such as foreign investments, typically in mining, have created conflict with native communities fighting to defend their land rights and natural resources. As a result, indigenous women are primary victims of threats and violence.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Findings from 2012 to 2014 showed that among female human rights defenders in Central America and Mexico, women defending land from mining operations were the most susceptible to gender violence, including risk of assassination. Guatemala is considered one of the ten most dangerous countries for environmental activists in the world, but accountability for such crimes remains a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mining-in-Guatemala-Abuses-Womens-Rights-Activists-Say-20151210-0046.html|title=Mining in Guatemala Abuses Women's Rights, Activists Say|last=hg-TP-gp|first=teleSUR /|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence==
Sexual violence is widespread in Guatemala. There are about 10,000 cases of reported rape per year, but the total number is likely much higher because of under-reporting due to social stigma. According to ''[[Doctors without Borders]]'', "Survivors [of sexual violence] are stigmatized and they cannot easily find treatment in Guatemala yet. There are no resources and too little comprehension of patients’ needs by the doctors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/guatemala-treating-sexual-violence-breaking-cycle-fear|title=Guatemala: Treating Sexual Violence, Breaking the Cycle of Fear|work=MSF USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's health care institutions are ill-equipped and unwilling to provide adequate care for the thousands of women victimized by sexual violence each year.&lt;ref name="doctorswithoutborders.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/guatemala-treating-sexual-violence-breaking-cycle-fear|title=Guatemala: Treating Sexual Violence, Breaking the Cycle of Fear|date=2009-07-20|newspaper=MSF USA|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Sexual violence against adolescent girls ===
Many survivors are adolescent girls, leading to Guatemala having the highest [[teen pregnancy]] and [[preteen pregnancy]] rates in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guatemala has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Latin America, and it’s getting worse -|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2014/06/16/guatemala-has-the-highest-teenage-pregnancy-rate-in-latin-america-and-its-getting-worse|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls as young as 10 years old are impregnated by rape, and they usually carry these pregnancies to birth. Most of these instances of sexual violence are perpetrated by the girl's father or other close male relative (89%). These men do not suffer consequences largely because of the lack of education, poverty, and lack of social respect for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Fathers rape with impunity, fuelling Guatemala's teen pregnancies: rights group|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/02/us-guatemala-teenage-pregnancy-idUSKCN0RW22D20151002|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-10-02|access-date = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to photo activist Linda Forsell,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Raped, Pregnant Girls Are The Focus Of This Searing Photo Project|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicalima/raped-pregnant-girls-are-the-focus-of-this-searing-photo-pro#.bcL0ZqXAE|website = BuzzFeed|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; most young girls face expulsion from school if they are visibly pregnant.

=== Sexual Violence as a War Tactic ===
Sexual violence is often used as a tactic in war, and many women, particularly women from indigenous tribes, often become sex slaves to soldiers and are subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="unwomen.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2016/3/guatemala-victory-against-sexual-violence-in-armed-conflict|title=Landmark ruling in Guatemala a victory against sexual violence in armed conflict|newspaper=UN Women|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a community is occupied or destroyed, an entire community of women may be subjected to rape and sexual or domestic slavery, affecting the prosperity and health of the community after a conflict’s end.&lt;ref name="unwomen.org"/&gt;

In February 2016, the Sepur Zarco trial convicted two ex-soldiers of crimes against humanity for their sexual abuse of 11 indigenous [[Q'eqchi' people|Q’eqchi’]] women, the forced disappearance of the women’s husbands, and the murder of a woman and her two daughters.&lt;ref name="unwomen.org"/&gt; Expert witnesses called by the prosecution included Brazilian feminist academic [[Rita Segato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ijmonitor.org/2016/02/former-military-commissioner-accuses-reyes-giron-of-ordering-gang-rape/|title=Former Military Commissioner Accuses Reyes Girón of Ordering Gang Rape|date=25 February 2016|author=Jo-Marie Burt|website=International Justice Monitor|access-date=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women of the Q’eqchi” community received substantial reparations for the damage done by the convicted soldiers. This is the first time a case of sexual slavery during armed conflict has been considered in court. In Guatemala, it was the first time any form of sexual violence during a conflict had been settled in court.&lt;ref name="unwomen.org"/&gt;

=== Long-Term Health Problems ===
Common health problems that victims of sexual assault in Guatemala often suffer include HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, Hepatitis B, syphilis, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhoea. Because health care is not readily accessible and education about sexual violence not prevalent, avoidable and treatable health problems often go untreated.&lt;ref name="doctorswithoutborders.org"/&gt;

The emotional and psychological impact of sexual violence often requires professional health care to treat, but the stigma surrounding sexual violence makes it difficult for people to discuss.

=== International Organizations. ===
International organizations like Doctors Without Borders try to fill the gap in Guatemala's health care and provide assistance to victims of sexual violence. In 2007, Doctors Without Borders opened a clinic in Guatemala City that provides comprehensive care for such victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/guatemala-treating-sexual-violence-breaking-cycle-fear|title=Guatemala: Treating Sexual Violence, Breaking the Cycle of Fear|last=Baldini|first=Frederic|date=2008|website=Doctors Without Borders|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is also implementing educational programs in Guatemala City that aim to end the prevalence of sexual violence there.

The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies investigates and reports on sexual violence in Guatemala, working with human rights advocates, government groups, and community groups based in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicide's and Gender-based Violence|last=|first=|date=|website=The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies|publisher=|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have published papers on the ineffectiveness of Guatemala’s Law Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women, passed in 2008. They also provide resources for attorney representing female victims of sexual violence, and help advocates in Guatemala implement laws that prevent sexual violence. They also educate countries around the world about the prevalence of sexual violence in Guatemala, so that international pressure can be put on the country to prevent sexual violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Gender and Refugee Studies|publisher=|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of militarization==
The increased militarization of Guatemala has resulted in abuse and mistreatment of the people of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Militarism spreads a perception of brutality and makes it easier to access weapons, which makes the rates of domestic violence against women go up.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Guatemala’s military has a hefty history of human rights violations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rethinking the Drug War in Central America and Mexico|url=http://www.cipamericas.org/archives/11315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murders, torture, and missing people became a daily reality for people in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archibald|first1=Jennifer|title=Human Rights in Guatemala|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/latinamerica/guatemala.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings show that in communities where there is an army present tend to have more violence against women.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Guatemalan military is also correlated with corruption. Recent records state that the government and military are often associated with criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=musalo|first1=Karen|title=Crime without Punishment|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/sites/default/files/Musalo_Bookey_CrimesWithoutPunishment_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased military presence to combat the War on Drugs ===
Militarization came to Guatemala in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In Guatemala, as well as in other parts of Latin America, there is an intense "war on drugs", that is a conflict between state forces and drug cartels, which has taken a violent turn. As a result of the war on drugs, there is a widespread presence of the military throughout the country thanks to three military bases in known drug trafficking areas.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gagne|first1=David|title=UN Chastises Guatemala on Militarization of Security|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/un-chastises-guatemala-on-militarization-of-security}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jody Williams]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, said, "The war on drugs and increased militarization in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala is becoming a war on women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nobel Peace Laureates call for concerted action to protect frontlines human rights defenders|url=http://www.friendshipamericas.org/nobel-peace-laureates-call-concerted-action-protect-frontlines-human-rights-defenders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The military's role in public safety initiatives ===
From 2006 to 2011, the budget the military was allotted went from sixty-three million United States dollars to one hundred and seventy-five million dollars.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Otto Pérez Molina]] became the first military official to be elected as president.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Shortly after being elected president in 2012, Pérez increased the role of the military in fighting crime.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Soldiers now are assigned public safety duties that would normally be reserved for police forces.

As of 2013 there were twenty-one thousand troops deployed to assist in public safety duties.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Violence against indigenous women==
Amerindian (indigenous) women in Guatemala face high levels of violence by the military, and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://upsidedownworld.org/main/guatemala-archives-33/5113-indigenous-women-in-guatemala-demand-end-to-state-of-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Indigenous-Women-Fight-Racism-and-Sexism-in-Guatemalan-Congress-20160411-0022.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/our-issues/violence-indigenous-women-guatemala-trial&lt;/ref&gt; It is very difficult for indigenous women to obtain justice. Many of them have not received school education, and live in extreme poverty. Girls in indigenous communities do not attend school because of the distance from their homes to school.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous population is estimated at 39.8% of Gatemala's population (in 2012).&lt;ref name=INE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.gob.gt/sistema/uploads/2014/02/26/5eTCcFlHErnaNVeUmm3iabXHaKgXtw0C.pdf |title=Caracterización estadística República de Guatemala 2012|accessdate=2014-11-02 |publisher=INE | archiveurl=http://www.ine.gob.gt/ | archivedate= November 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; High illiteracy rates and the fact that they do not speak Spanish makes the justice system limited for them.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

During the civil war, many indigenous women were forced into [[sexual slavery]] by the military. In 2016, a court in Guatemala ordered two former military officers to pay over $1m (£710,000) to 11 indigenous women whom they held as sex slaves during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/guatemala-sex-slaves-mayan-women-win-1m-compensation-civil-war-military-atrocities-1547319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child marriage and pregnancy==
Early marriage for girls is common in Guatemala; the country has one of the highest rates of [[child marriage]] in Latin America.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guatemala - Child Marriage Around The World. Girls Not Brides|url=http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/guatemala/|website=Girls Not Brides|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, men and women must be at least 18 years of age to marry; sometimes exceptions can be made by judges for girls to be married at 16. Previously, girls could be married at 14 and boys could be married at 16. The age was increased and made the same regardless of gender in hopes to hold both men and women to the same standard.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"/&gt; It is estimated that 7% of girls are married before 15 years of age and 30% by 18 years of age.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"/&gt; Rates are even higher in rural areas where 53% of females are married before they are 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Edie|title=Guatemala raises legal marriage age to 18 {{!}} Too Young Too Wed|url=http://tooyoungtowed.org/blog/guatemala-raises-legal-marriage-age-to-18/|website=tooyoungtowed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reasons for early marriage is poverty, rigid gender norms, access to education, and tradition. Older men also provide more financial support to these girls. After marriage, girls are expected to start a family and face a lot of pressure to get pregnant.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"/&gt; Teen mothers account for a quarter of births in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moloney|first1=Anastasia|title=Guatemala bans child marriage, big change for rural areas|url=http://news.trust.org//item/20151111184347-bhe0h/?source=jtOtherNews3|website=news.trust.org|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Complications in pregnancy and childbirth are the second highest cause of death for 15- to 19-year-old girls globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/guatemala-bans-child-marriage|title=Guatemala bans child marriage but 'cultural shift' required, advocates say|last=Reuters|date=2015-11-11|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mob violence==
Guatemala is ranked the 25th most violent country in the world and Guatemalan police have a reputation for being non-responsive to the high crime rates.&lt;ref name="panampost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://panampost.com/pep-balcarcel/2015/06/08/beaten-exiled-or-burned-alive-mob-justice-in-guatemala/|title=Beaten, Exiled, or Burned Alive: Mob Justice in Guatemala|date=2015-06-08|newspaper=PanAm Post|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of security within the government is what encouraged the start of mobs turning to vigilante justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/27/americas/guatemala-girl-burned-mob/index.html|title=Video of mob burning teen in Guatemala spurs outrage|last=CNN|first=Annie Rose Ramos, Catherine E. Shoichet and Richard Beltran|website=CNN|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, a lot of the crime associated with these mobs is just as bad as the crime they claim they are attempting to prevent. Most of the locals keep quiet for fear of being targeted by these groups themselves, and many of the people participating in the violence are forced to do so.&lt;ref name="panampost.com"/&gt;

As in other countries where the population does not trust the authorities, people in Guatemala often enforce informal 'justice' by subjecting to violence and even murdering individuals whom they believe have violated moral standards. For example, in 2015, a 16-year-old girl was beaten and burned alive by a Guatemalan lynch mob after reportedly being accused of being part of a group that killed a taxi driver.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/world/girl-16-burnt-alive-by-guatemalan-lynch-mob-20150525-gh8xyk.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/27/americas/guatemala-girl-burned-mob/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems within the justice system==
After years of violence, dictatorship, and conflict, Guatemala's public institutions are ineffective, including its justice system. Lack of funding has made the law-enforcement departments ineffective and, seeing how unlikely it is to be charged, criminals are encouraged to continue normalizing this widespread, unchecked violence. Based on the numbers of incidents actually reported and taken to court, only 3% result in any sort of court resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Gender and Refugee Studies|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities do not always conduct proper investigations. A minority of the reported crimes against women go to trial, and even fewer result in a conviction. According to [[Nobel Women's Initiative]], in the 1980s, 200,000 people were murdered, and thousands of women were raped. Many cases similar to these have not gone to trial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Of the complaints about violence against women that were registered in 2010 by the Judicial Department, only one percent of them resulted in sentencing.

Law enforcement often fails to investigate in a timely manner and blame the victims of the case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musalo|first1=Karen|title=Crimes Without Punishment|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/sites/default/files/Musalo_Bookey_CrimesWithoutPunishment_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women abandon their cases because the stress and hardship put onto them.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Without proper trials, investigations, and sentencing, the violence towards women will progressively increase.

Women are often murdered or subjected to violence by family members such as fathers, brothers, stepfathers and husbands,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34978330&lt;/ref&gt; but when they try to report a crime that was done by family members, the women themselves are often treated as criminals for complaining.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Discrimination in the justice system is one of the many problems women face in Guatemala. The justice system discriminates against others' race, class, sex, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Discrimination is worst for women who are poor, migrant, young, lesbian, and those that demand justice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

There is a lack of female representation in the political system.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=Sarah|title=Violence Against Women in Guatemala|url=http://www.borgenmagazine.com/violence-women-guatemala/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, only 13.9% of members of Parliament were women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The justice system is limited for people who do not speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This means that the women must be educated in order to protect their rights. The 2008 law against femicide and other forms of violence against women has enforced people to treat women equally. The 2008 law addressed the private and public crimes in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Women in Guatemala are often uninformed of their rights and do not have the courage to report the crimes committed against them.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==Legislation==
Guatemala is a country that has one of the most prevalent rates of violence against women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://lap.sagepub.com/content/41/1/124.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of gendered violence in Guatemala include domestic violence, sexual violence, human trafficking, incest, and femicide (the deliberate killing of women). In response to violence against women, the government has passed laws and created agencies in order to stunt the high rates of gendered violence in Guatemala in the 1990s: in 1996 it enacted ''Ley para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia intrafamiliar'' (Law on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Domestic Violence).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/guatemala.dv.96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it enacted ''Ley contra el Femicidio y otras Formas de Violencia Contra la Mujer '' (Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/guatemala.violence.08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it enacted  ''Ley contra la violencia sexual, explotación y trata de personas'' (Law against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/GUATEMALA-SPANISH.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procurador de los Derechos Humanos ===
In 2008, the [[:es:Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]] (Human Rights Ombudsman) was created, which is an agency that operates with the intention of enforcing citizens' cooperation with human rights laws. Despite these efforts made by Guatemala's government, the number of women who experience gendered violence persists. The ineffectiveness of Procurador de los Derechos Humanos is a result of a multitude of factors including the weakness of the justice system, a lack of clarity surrounding laws made regarding gendered violence, and the absence of free institutions that would aid victims.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1629401033/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intentions of enacting Procurador de los Derechos Humanos, the full potential of its efficiency has not yet been reached.

=== Legal age of marriage ===
More recently, social groups advocating for gender equality in Guatemala helped reform the age at which a girl is able to legally be married. The Angélica Fuentes Foundation and Girl Up (a United Nations youth foundation) together put forth an initiative to change the legal age of marriage in Guatemala from 14 to 18. These advocates had integral roles in the passing of the legislation in January 2016. The leaders of both The Angélica Fuentes Foundation and Girl Up stated that their main goal of pushing for a higher marriage age was to aid the children in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Get it @ ASU"&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gender-equality-update---angelica-fuentes-and-un-girl-up-push-legislation-in-guatemala-to-change-legal-age-of-marriage-from-14-to-18-years-old-2016-10-03-121603825&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls often would be forced to give up their education and be constricted to a life devoted to marriage, however with the marriage age raised young women would be free to pursue other interests. The leader of The Angélica Fuentes Foundation states that it is her hope that this initiative promotes gender equality and an increase in opportunity for young girls in Guatemala, as well as in other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="Get it @ ASU"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10000">'''William Wallace "Bill" Norton, Jr.''' (September 24, 1925 – October 1, 2010) was an American [[screenwriter]] particularly notable for his collaborations with [[Burt Reynolds]]&lt;ref&gt;Ayres Jr., B. Drummond. [https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/01/archives/good-ole-boy-stars-in-dixie-filmmaking-boom.html "'Good Ole Boy' Stars in Dixie Film-Making Boom"], ''[[The New York Times]]'',  November 1, 1975. Accessed September 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, he was convicted of [[arms trafficking|gun running]] in [[France]] when he tried to send arms from the United States to the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. After being released from prison, he moved to [[Nicaragua]], where he shot and killed an intruder in his [[Managua]] home. He later spent a year living in [[Cuba]] but became disillusioned with [[Communism]] and was reportedly smuggled from [[Mexico]] into the U.S. by his ex-wife.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{citation |author=Weber, Bruce |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/movies/09norton.html |title=William Norton, Writer Wilder Than His Movies, Is Dead at 85 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 8, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATObit&gt;{{citation |author=Woo, Elaine |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/10/local/la-me-william-norton-20101010 |title=William W.

==Early life==
Norton was born to Andrena "Rena" (''née'' Callahan; March 20, 1902 – October 16, 1989&lt;ref&gt;California Death Index. - California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information. - SS#: 571-20-8989.&lt;br&gt;{{Find a Grave|19316681|Andrena "Rena" Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and William Wallace Norton (February 14, 1900 – July 18, 1973&lt;ref&gt;NOTE: The California Death Index (CDI) lists the date of birth for W. W. Norton, Sr. as February 12, 1901, while the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) shows February 14, 1900. - SS#: 564-07-0696.&lt;br&gt;{{Find a Grave|19404418|W. W. Norton, Sr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Ogden, Utah]], where his parents owned a ranch which they lost at  the start of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;  His family moved to [[Berkeley, California]], and then later to [[El Monte, California|El Monte]].  He attended [[El Monte High School]], where he was class president.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Norton enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served in Europe as an infantry officer with [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th Infantry]], [[71st Infantry Division (United States)|71st Infantry Division]] with Patton's Third Army.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeffcramer.blogspot.com.au/2010/01/very-candid-conversation-with-william.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing, using his life experience of growing up poor and serving in the military, and some of his plays were produced by local theater companies. He joined the [[Communist Party]] in his youth and in 1958 was called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], though he did not name anyone.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

==Hollywood==
He wrote for the television series ''[[The Big Valley]]'', which was broadcast from 1965 to 1968.&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt;  His big screen breakthrough came with his script for the 1968 film ''[[The Scalphunters]]'', set in the antebellum West, with the movie starring [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[Shelley Winters]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

Other screenplays that Norton wrote included the Angie Dickinson vehicle ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'', produced by [[Roger Corman]], and the [[John Wayne]] detective film ''[[Brannigan (film)|Brannigan]]'' (1975).  He wrote the [[Burt Reynolds]] vehicles ''[[Sam Whiskey]]'', ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', ''[[White Lightning (1973 film)|White Lightning]]'' and ''[[Gator (film)|Gator]]''. When asked by a nurse the day before he died if she would know any of Norton's films, he replied "I don't think your I.Q. is low enough".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Ireland==
After moving to Ireland in the mid-1980s, Norton was angered by attacks staged against Roman Catholic residents of [[Northern Ireland]].  He flew back to the U.S. and purchased a number of guns to bring back to supply the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA).&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;  Norton also purchased a camping van and had a hidden compartment made. The van was shipped aboard a Panamanian ship inside a container, from Los Angeles to the port at [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name=UPI-HC-1986-06-12&gt;{{cite news |page=15 |title=Irish rifles found in van from U.S. |publisher=[[United Press International]] {UPI} |accessdate=2011-11-24 |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 12, 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The van, still inside the container, was then put on a truck and hauled from Rotterdam, through Belgium, to the port of [[Le Havre]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=UPI-HC-1986-06-12/&gt; Authorities were watching the van, which had two submachine guns, 12 rifles, 23 revolvers and 2,200 rounds of ammunition in the hidden compartment.  Norton and his wife, Eleanor, were arrested on June 11, 1986, trying to retrieve the vehicle and were both convicted.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;  Also arrested with them were two INLA members, James MacLaughin and Sean Hughes, and also Hughes' girlfriend Susan May.&lt;ref name=UPI-HC-1986-06-12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edward Mickolus|Mickolus, Edward F]].; and Susan L. Simmons |title=The Terrorist List |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-37471-5 |pages=132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susan May's two children, who were with her, were taken to a children's home.&lt;ref name=UPI-HC-1986-06-12/&gt;

===Prison===
In August 1987, William Norton, Hughes and MacLaughin were each sentenced to four years in prison, while Eleanor Norton was sentenced to three years with two of those suspended.&lt;ref name=LAT-1987-08-05&gt;{{citation |title=France Convicts L.A. Couple of Illegal Importing of Arms |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 5, 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the group was forbidden to return to France for five years, and they were fined a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]81,700.&lt;ref name=LAT-1987-08-05/&gt;  Susan May was not convicted.

Norton was released after 19 months while his wife served five months before her release on medical grounds.&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt;  The couple were subject to a U.S. warrant on the gun smuggling charges and were granted asylum in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

==Central America and Cuba==

After bandits broke into his house in [[Managua]], he was able to find a gun and shot and killed one of the robbers.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He relocated to Cuba in the 1990s, but rapidly became disenchanted with life under Communism. He moved, this time to Mexico, and sought the help of his daughter and his first wife to bring him back into the United States. He met his family members in [[Tijuana]], and they smuggled him back across the U.S. border.  He settled in [[Santa Barbara, California]], where he reportedly spent years worrying that the FBI would arrest him until a lawyer convinced him that he had nothing to worry about.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;  He wrote a script, ''Exiled in America'', based on his experiences, which was produced by Paul Leder.&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt;

==Death==
Norton died in Santa Barbara of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], aged 85, on October 1, 2010.  He was survived by his second wife, Eleanor, as well as by two daughters and  a son, writer-director [[Bill L. Norton]].&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt;  His first marriage, to the former Betty Conklin, had ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''Women in Haiti''' have equal [[constitution of Haiti|constitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haiti.org/constitu/constabl.htm Constitution of the Republic of Haiti], Title III: 
"Art. 17: All Haitians, regardless of sex or marital status, who have attained twenty-one years of age may exercise their political and civil rights if they meet the other conditions prescribed by the Constitution and by the law.
Art. 18: Haitians shall be equal before the law, subject to the special advantages conferred on native-born Haitians who have never renounced their nationality."&lt;/ref&gt; rights as men in the [[economy of Haiti|economic]], [[Politics of Haiti|political]], [[Culture of Haiti|cultural]] and social fields, as well as in the family.

However, the reality in Haiti is quite far from the law: "political, economic and social features of Haiti negatively affect most Haitians, but Haitian women experience additional barriers to the full enjoyment of their basic rights due to predominant social beliefs that they are inferior to men and a historical pattern of discrimination and violence against them based on their sex. Discrimination against women is a structural feature in Haitian society and culture that has subsisted throughout its history, both in times of peace and unrest."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)on "The Right of Women in Haiti to be Free from Violence and Discrimination." OEA/Ser.L/V/II, Doc. 64, 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women and society==
Some Haitian scholars argue that Haitian peasant women are often less restricted socially than women in Western societies or even in comparison to more westernized elite Haitian women.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellegarde-Smith|first1=Patrick|title=Haiti: The Breached Citadel|date=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|location=Ontario|isbn=1-55130-268-3|page=38|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attribute this fact to the influence of African matriarcal systems and of the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion which places women at the center of society contrary to purely Judeo-Christian systems.&lt;ref &lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel 2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bellegarde-Smith|first1=Patrick|title=Haiti: The Breached Citadel|date=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|location=Ontario|isbn=1-55130-268-3|page=37|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women priests (named [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]s) play equal roles to male priests or [[Houngan]]  in Haitian vodou.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"/&gt;

[[File:Michèle Pierre-Louis-2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Michele Pierre-Louis]], former Prime Minister has proven a fervent promoter of women's rights in [[Haiti]] ]]

The Haitian government contains a Ministry of Women's Affairs, but it also lacks the resources to address issues such as violence against women and harassment in the workplace. A number of political figures such as [[Michele Pierre-Louis]], Haiti's second female Prime Minister, have adopted a determined agenda in order to fight inequalities and persecutions against women. Her position in office as Prime Minister has had positive effect on female political leadership in a country where the percentage of women in government at ministerial level was 25% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_HTI.html UNDP 2007/2008 Human Development Report, Haiti Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Haitian women's movement ==

A [[women's movement]] emerged in Haiti in the 1930s during an economic crisis which is thought to have forced some middle-class Haitian women to work outside the home for the first time unlike peasant women who had always done so.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"/&gt; This was also a time at which more elite women began to pursue post-secondary education and when [[L'Université D'Etat d'Haiti]] opened its doors to women.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"/&gt; The first Haitian woman to receive a secondary education graduated during this period in 1933.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"/&gt;

One of the first established feminist organizations in Haiti was called the Ligue Féminine d'Action Sociale ([[Feminine League for Social Action]]) and was created in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellegarde-Smith|first1=Patrick|title=Haiti: The Breached Citadel|date=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|location=Ontario|isbn=1-55130-268-3|pages=38–39|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mostly elite initial members included: [[Madeleine Sylvain]], [[Alice Garoute]], [[Fernande Bellegarde]], [[Thérèse Hudicourt]], [[Alice Mathon]], [[Marie-Thérèse Colimon]], [[Marie-Thérèse Poitevien]].&lt;ref name="Breached Citadel 39"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellegarde-Smith|first1=Patrick|title=Haiti: The Breached Citadel|date=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars Press|location=Ontario|isbn=1-55130-268-3|page=39|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ligue was banned by the government two months after its founding.&lt;ref name="Breached Citadel 39"/&gt; The league was reestablished when it agreed to study its goals instead of immediately implementing them.&lt;ref name="Breached Citadel 39"/&gt; The league is credited for the granting of voting rights for women in 1957.&lt;ref name="Breached Citadel 39"/&gt;

In 1950, writer and feminist [[Paulette Poujol-Oriol]] joined the league. She later served as President of the League from 1997 until her death on March 11, 2011. She was also a founding member of [[L'Alliance des Femmes Haitiennes]], an umbrella organization for more than 50 women's groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulysse|first1=Gina Athéna|title=The Legacy of Haitian Feminist Paulette Poujol-Oriol|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2011/03/29/the-legacy-of-haitian-feminist-paulette-poujol-oriol/|website=Ms. Magazine Blog|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women were appointed to government leadership positions under François Duvalier: [[Rosalie Adolphe]] (aka [[Madame Max Adolphe]]) was appointed head of the secret police ([[Volontaires de La Sécurité Nationale]] or [[VSN]]) while [[Lydia O. Jeanty]] was named Under-Secretary of Labor in 1957 and [[Lucienne Heurtelou]], the widow of former President [[Dumarsais Estimé]], was Haiti's first female ambassador.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Marie-Denise Duvalier]] nearly succeeded her father in 1971.&lt;ref name="Haiti: The Breached Citadel"/&gt;

== Sexual violence ==
{{main article|Sexual violence in Haiti}}
Women in Haiti may suffer threats to their security and well-being because of rape, kid-napping and human trafficking. Women suffer the most from Haiti's chronic political instability.

Documented cases of politically motivated rape, massacres, forced disappearance, and violent assaults on entire neighborhoods increased greatly at the end of 1993 under the military dictatorship of [[Raoul Cédras]]. Reports from women's rights groups in Haiti revealed that women were targeted for abuse in ways and for reasons that men were not. Uniformed military personnel and their civilian allies threatened and attacked women's organizations for their work in defense of women's rights and subjected women to sex-specific abuse ranging from bludgeoning women's breasts to rape.&lt;ref&gt;Rape in Haiti: A Weapon of Terror, Human Rights Watch (HRW), 1 July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The troubles before the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|2004 coup]] were seen by most of the nationwide women's group as a reminder of the 1991–94 coup d'etat tactics with the use of rape, kidnapping and murders as forms of intimidation. If most of the feminist activists in Haiti campaigned for the election of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] before his first term (1991–1995), many of them, especially intellectuals like [[Myriam Merlet]] or [[Magalie Marcelin]], condemned how the first democraticly elected president of Haiti ruled the country during his second term (2000–2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Myriam Merlet|url=http://www.papda.org/article.php3?id_article=48 |title=Forces vives d'Haiti décrétent le Gouvernement Lavalas hors la loi|publisher=ENFOFANM|date=2 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers, more favorable of the Fanmi Lavalas party, were more incline to criticised the period after the coup as a "rewind" back to the same dictatorship tactics, "a terror campaign employing rape, murder and disappearance as tactics, and rapidly increasing insecurity undermining all economic activity of the informal sector."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijdh.org/pdf/HaitiWomensDelJan05REPORT.pdf "Rewinding History: The Rights of Haitian Women" 2005 Report of the Let Haiti Live Women's Rights Delegation sponsored by the Ecumenical Program on Central America and the Caribbean (EPICA), January 2005. Obtained June 3rd 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, Haiti is "gripped by shocking levels of sexual violence against girls"; of particular concern is the number of cases of sexual violence reported in the run-up to or during Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20081201001 Amnesty International, Press Release, Embargoed Until Noon, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2008. Obtained June 3, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International launched a grass-roots campaign to [https://www.amnesty.org.hk/html/node/10234 send postcards to the Prime Minister of Haiti] to remind her of her duty to protect Haitian women. The text of the letter was such:

"Dear Prime Minister:

I am writing to you to express my deep concern at the levels of sexual violence perpetrated against girls in Haiti, particularly during the carnival period. While the true extent of sexual violence against girls is not known, every year, in Port-au-Prince alone, dozens of girls report being raped at gunpoint by groups of young men.

I therefore urge you and your government to implement all necessary measures to prevent rape and protect girls' right to live free from violence, to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice and that the victims receive adequate support and reparation.

Yours respectfully,"&lt;/ref&gt; and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) on "The Right of Women in Haiti to be Free from Violence and Discrimination." OEA/Ser.L/V/II, Doc. 64, 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  have laid particular pressure on the duty of the state to act in due diligience necessary to prevent and eradicate violence and discrimination against women.

Though the [[MINUSTAH]] has come with a peace-keeping mandate, a number of cases have arisen where the UN soldiers were found to have abused women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/02/news/UN-GEN-UN-Haiti-Sexual-Exploitation.php|title=

==Education==
{{Further information|Education in Haiti}}

Women in Haiti do not benefit from an equal access to education. The rural-urban difference is also considerable as nearly 25% of the women in urban areas have finished secondary school, compared with less than 2 percent in rural areas. Though most Latin American countries have achieved universal or near universal [[primary education]] for all children, for Haiti primary education, the enrollment rate of boys was still somewhat higher than that of girls in 1987, but it is narrowing as the average growth enrollment has been significantly greater for girls than for boys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ht/books?id=DL8uSGzj8YIC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=women+education+haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S10CtoKMJ0&amp;sig=0hfDEe1FG_iXgM9DctF8QWTOf3Q&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=59cmSvW-GqCk8gTLurmBDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPA184,M1 Women's Education in Developing Countries: Barriers, Benefits, and Policies, pp.183–184.

'''World Elephant Day''' is an international annual event on August 12, dedicated to the preservation and protection of the world's [[elephants]]. Conceived in 2011 by Canadian filmmakers Patricia Sims and Michael Clark of Canazwest Pictures, and Sivaporn Dardarananda, Secretary-General of the [[Elephant Reintroduction Foundation]] in [[Thailand]], it was officially founded, supported and launched by Patricia Sims and the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation on August 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldelephantday.org/about/elephant-reintroduction-foundation "Elephant Reintroduction Foundation"], ''World Elephant Day website''&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Patricia Sims continues to lead and direct World Elephant Day, which is now supported by over 65 wildlife organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldelephantday.org/associates "Associates"], ''World Elephant Day website''&lt;/ref&gt; and many individuals in countries across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/803503.shtml "World Elephant Day brings attention to elephants' plight"], ''The Global Times'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mansbridge, [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/philip-mansbridge/elephants-world-elephant-day_b_3739095.html "Is This Year's World Elephant Day the Last Chance for Elephants?"], ''The Huffington Post'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raj Phukan, [http://www.assamtimes.org/node/8743 "World Elephant Day celebrated at Nagaon"], ''Assam Times'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Viegas, [http://news.discovery.com/animals/endangered-species/elephants-get-help-from-unlikely-sources-is-it-enough-130812.htm "Elephants Get Unlikely Help -- But Is It Enough?"], ''Discovery News'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiangraitimes.com/world-elephant-day-thailand-must-shut-down-ivory-trade.html "World Elephant Day - Thailand Must Shut Down Ivory Trade"], ''Chiangrai Times'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2013/08/12/12-years-until-elephants-are-all-wiped-out-as-one-dies-every-15-minutes-3919927/ "12 years until elephants are all wiped out as one dies every 15 minutes"], ''Metro'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Bell, [http://africageographic.com/blog/world-elephant-day-time-to-take-stock/ "World Elephant Day - time to take stock"], ''Africa Geographic'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bettina Wassener, [http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/mourning-the-elephants/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp; "Mourning the Elephants"], ''The New York Times'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fidelis E.

== Mission ==

The goal of International Elephant Day is to create awareness of the urgent plight of [[African elephant|African]] and [[Asian elephant|Asian]] elephants, and to share knowledge and positive solutions for the better care and management of captive and wild elephants. African elephants are listed as "Vulnerable" and Asian elephants as "Endangered" on the [[IUCN Red List]] of threatened species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0 "Loxodonta Africana (African elephant)"], ''IUCN''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/summary/7140/0 "Elephas maximus (Asian elephant, Indian elephant)"], ''IUCN''&lt;/ref&gt; One conservationist has stated that both African and Asian elephants face extinction within twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;John Ingham, [http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/421411/Elephants-extinct-within-12-years "Elephants 'extinct within 12 years'"], ''Express'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The current population estimates are about 400,000 for African elephants and 40,000 for Asian elephants, although it has been argued that these numbers are much too high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/61/E61-44-02-A1.pdf "Status of Elephant Populations, Levels of Illegal Killing and the Trade in Ivory: A Report to the Standing Committee of CITES"], ''CITES''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poaching ===

The demand for [[ivory]], which is highest in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;Damian Grammaticas, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26167893 "Uncovering China's illegal ivory trade"], ''BBC News'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendon Hong, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/30/china-s-blood-ivory-bazaar.html "China's Blood Ivory Bazaar"], ''The Daily Beast'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per Liljas, [http://world.time.com/2013/11/01/the-ivory-trade-is-out-of-control-and-china-needs-to-do-more-to-stop-it/ "The Ivory Trade Is Out of Control, and China Needs to Do More to Stop It"], ''Time Magazine'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therakyatpost.com/life/2014/06/14/ivory-demand-china-thailand-led-killing-20000-african-elephants-last-year/ "Ivory demand in China, Thailand led to killing of 20,000 African elephants last year"], ''The Rakyat Post'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula Kahumbu, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/china-message-consumers-ivory-trade "China must send a clear message to consumers on ivory trade"], ''The Guardian'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt; leads to the illegal poaching of both African and Asian elephants. For example, one of the world's largest elephants, [[Satao (elephant)|Satao]], was recently killed for his iconic tusks.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Dell'Amore, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-elephants-tusker-satao-poachers-killed-animals-africa-science/ "Beloved African Elephant Killed for Ivory -- "Monumental" Loss"], ''National Geographic'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mfonobong Nsehe, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/15/world-famous-elephant-satao-killed-by-poachers-in-kenya/ "World Famous Elephant 'Satao' Killed By Poachers In Kenya"], ''Forbes'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Another iconic Kenyan elephant, Mountain Bull, was also killed by poachers, and with the street value for ivory now exceeding that of gold,&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Flood, [http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/06/15/satao-one-of-africas-largest-elephants-killed-by-poachers-for-ivory-tusks-weighing-more-than-45-kg/ "Satao, one of Africa's largest elephants, killed by poachers for ivory tusks weighing more than 45 kg"], ''National Post'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed Mazza, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/15/satao-the-elephant-killed_n_5497799.html "Satao The Elephant Killed By Poachers In Kenya"], ''The Huffington Post'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; African elephants face a poaching epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jackman, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/safariandwildlifeholidays/10927089/Poaching-in-Africa-Selous-Game-Reserve-warning-highlights-scale-of-epidemic.html "Poaching in Africa: Selous Game Reserve warning highlights scale of epidemic"], ''Telegraph'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Hellmann, [http://time.com/2953056/african-elephant-poaching-soars-as-ivory-prices-triple-in-china/ "African-Elephant Poaching Soars as Ivory Prices Triple in China"], ''Time Magazine'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants are also poached for meat, leather, and body parts, with the illegal wildlife trade putting elephants increasingly in danger, because it is perceived to be a low risk and high profit endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traffic.org/home/2012/12/12/illegal-wildlife-trade-threatens-national-security-says-wwf.html/ "Illegal wildlife trade threatens national security, says WWF report"], ''TRAFFIC'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Hellmann, [http://time.com/2953056/african-elephant-poaching-soars-as-ivory-prices-triple-in-china/ "African-Elephant Poaching Soars as Ivory Prices Triple in China"], ''Time Magazine'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Hofford, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/-sp-endangered-species-on-sale-along-burmachina-border "Illegal wildlife trade along the Burma-China border - in pictures"], ''The Guardian'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat loss ===

The loss of habitat due to [[deforestation]], increases in mining, and agricultural activities has become problematic, especially for Asian elephants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/bio/documentaries/wild-at-heart-the-plight-of-elephants-in-thailand/asian-elephants-threats-and-solutions "Asian Elephants: Threats and Solutions"], ''American Museum of Natural History''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Armstrong, [http://www.earthtimes.org/nature/forest-loss-accelerates/2630/ "Forest loss accelerates"], ''The Earth Times'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentation of habitat also creates isolation - this makes breeding more difficult, and allows poachers to find the elephants and set traps more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Heath, [http://wildlifenews.co.uk/2014/united-nations-launches-emergency-appeal-for-sumatran-elephants/ "United Nations launches emergency appeal for Sumatran elephants"], ''Wildlife News'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human-elephant conflict ===

Human-elephant conflict is a significant concern, as human populations increase and forest cover decreases, forcing elephants into close proximity with human settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Gubbi, M.H. Swaminath, H.C. Poornesha, Rashmi Bhat, and R. Raghunath, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0621-x "An elephantine challenge: human-elephant conflict distribution in the largest Asian elephant population, southern India"], ''Biodiversity and Conservation'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents include crop damage and economic losses, as well as both elephant and human casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Rabi Ahmed, Kushalappa, C.G., Ramesh, M.N., Sathish, B.N. and Nanaya Konerira, [http://www.scienceandnature.org/IJSN_Vol5%281%29M2014/IJSN-VOL5%281%2914-15.pdf "Human-elephant Conflict in Asian Context with Specific Reference to Crop Damage"], ''International Journal of Science and Nature'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/5-jumbos-damage-crops-run-amuck-near-Soolagiri/articleshow/37109619.cms "5 jumbos damage crops, run amuck near Soolagiri"], ''The Times of India'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mistreatment in captivity ===
