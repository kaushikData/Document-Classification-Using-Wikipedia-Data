In [[geography]], the word '''bank''' generally refers to the land alongside a body of water. Different structures are referred to as ''banks'' in different fields of geography, as follows.

In [[limnology]] (the study of inland waters), a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the [[Stream bed|bed]] of a [[river]], creek, or [[stream]].&lt;ref name=Leopold1995&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-486-68588-5 |author1=Luna B. Leopold |author2=M. Gordon Wolman |author3=John P. Miller |year=1995 |publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|title=Fluvial processes in geomorphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank consists of the sides of the [[channel (geography)|channel]], between which the [[streamflow|flow]] is confined.&lt;ref name=Leopold1995/&gt; Stream banks are of particular interest in [[fluvial]] geography, which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] and [[landform]]s created by them. Bankfull discharge is a [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]  great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5144/pdf/sir2009-5144_mulvihil_bankfull_2revised508.pdf|title=2 Bankfull Discharge and Channel Characteristics of Streams in New York State|last=Mulvihill|first=Christiane|date=|website=United States Geological Survey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descriptive terms ''left bank'' and ''right bank'' are relative to an observer looking [[current (stream)|downstream]], in which the right bank is to the observer's right; a famous example is the naming of the two sides of the [[Seine]] in [[Paris]]. The [[shore]]line of [[pond]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]], [[reservoir]]s, or [[lake]]s are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks. The [[grade (slope)|grade]] of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope.

In [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater ecology]], banks are of interest as the location of riparian [[habitat]]s. [[Riparian zone]]s occur along [[upland and lowland]] river and stream beds. The ecology around and depending on a [[marsh]], [[swamp]], [[slough (hydrology)|slough]], or [[estuary]], sometimes called a bank, is likewise studied in freshwater ecology.

Banks are also of interest in [[navigation]], where the term can refer either to a [[barrier island]] or a submerged [[plateau]],&lt;ref name="Bucksch1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Bucksch|title=Dictionary Geotechnical Engineering: English German|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te9FMHjOR4oC|year=1997|publisher=Springer DE|isbn=978-3-540-58164-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=te9FMHjOR4oC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an [[ocean bank]]. A barrier island is a long narrow island composed of sand and forming a barrier between an island [[lagoon]] or [[sound (geography)|sound]] and the ocean. A submerged plateau is a relatively flat topped elevation of the sea floor at shallow depth (generally less than 200 m), typically on the [[continental shelf]] or near an [[island]].

[[File:Standing Stone leaning at Dinas Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1803573.jpg|thumb|250px|A Standing Stone or [[Menhir]] used a Cattle Rubbing Stone]]
'''Cattle Rubbing Stones''', known as '''Clawin Posts''' in [[Scots language|Scots]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/clawin_post Dictionary of the Scots Language]&lt;/ref&gt; were once a common sight in pastures and were provided to allow cattle to rub their skin without causing damage to field infrastructure such as fences and straining posts or natural features such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been removed to accommodate the needs of modern farming practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/130296/east-cannahars-cattle-rubbing-stone Cannahars rubbing stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle are featured on Pictish stones such as the Fowlis Wester stone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/crieff/fowliswester/ Undiscovered Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; however the requirement for rubbing stones mainly relates to the enclosure of fields in the late 18th century that held cattle within a confined area.&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Drybridge Menhir from the north.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Drybridge]] [[Menhir|standing stone]] that is not made from a suitable stone to have been installed as a rubbing stone.]]
Cattle rubbing stones need to be well dug into the ground and/or packed with stones and have also to be made of hard stone types that can withstand the considerable weight and strength of cattle. They can often be distinguished from [[Megalith|megaliths]] such as [[Menhir|standing stones]] by having angular edges showing that they have been cleaved during quarrying&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/18510/garlogie-cattle-rubbing-stone Garlogie Cattle Rubbing Stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than be [[Glacial erratic|glacial erratics]] or from other natural sources. Some stones may show drill marks from the quarrying process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/18510/garlogie-cattle-rubbing-stone Garlogie Cattle Rubbing Stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt; The shape is based on the need for appropriate height and strength without occupying too much space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWX0_good-king-macbeth?guid=6c057fdd-252e-4070-b981-2d0547fe2d3f The Altyre Stone]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Ordnance Survey]] maps from different years may show that the stones were installed by farmers and they may marked as 'Rubbing stones'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/129162/meanecht-cattle-rubbing-stones Meanecht rubbing stones on Camore.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/125311/drimmies-cattle-rubbing-stone Drimmies rubbing stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
[[File:Hole Stone. - geograph.org.uk - 513016.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A holed stone probably damaged by cattle using it as a rubbing stone. The polishing action caused by cattle rubbing is clealry visible.]]
[[File:Standing Stone at Rockfield - geograph.org.uk - 213239.jpg|250px|thumb|Rubbing stone showing churned up soil and lack of vegetation caused by the cattle. The polishing effect is also obvious.]]
In Scotland the word 'yokey' was generally used for cattle that had itchy skin.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle rubbing stones were often made from harder stone such as [[whinstone]] or [[granite]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/129162/meanecht-cattle-rubbing-stones Meanecht rubbing stones on Camore.]&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the geology of the area concerned. An indicator that a stone is used by cattle for alleviating skin irritation is the polished appearance of the areas that have been used by many generations of cattle over the years. The ground around rubbing stones is often churned up and devoid of vegetation. Stones may also have areas of staining caused by the transfer of oil from the hide of the cattle during the rubbing process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/18510/garlogie-cattle-rubbing-stone Garlogie Cattle Rubbing Stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Menhir|standing stones]] owe their survival partly due to their practical functionality as cattle rubbing stones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/tag/canmore/ Peat Hill stone on Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monymusk.com/?page=6 Monymusk Estate]&lt;/ref&gt; although some [[Megalith|megalithic sites]] have had to be protected from the damage that cattle can and do cause as indicated by the attached photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-14490346 Tregeseal Stone Circle]&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity to known [[Megalith|megalithic]] sites is also a clue as to the actual origins of rubbing stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=32655 The Megalithic Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stones with ancient carvings on them such as [[Cup and ring mark|cup and rings]], [[Petrosomatoglyph|petrosomatoglyphs]], [[Pictish stone|Pictish]], early Christian, [[Ogham inscription|Ogham]], etc. indicate their origins even if they have a rubbing stone function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfordimages.com/picture/number501.asp Alford Images of the Tertowie Stone]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
A 'Claw-scrunt' in [[Scots language|Scots]] is a tree or tree stump used by cattle to rub themselves against.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/clawscrunt Dictionary of the Scots Language.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Darvel|Dagon Stone]] at Darvel in East Ayrshire was once used as a cattle rubbing stone.

== History ==
In 1954 Pakistan and India signed a treaty over the Dahagram–Angarpota and Berubari enclave, Dahagram–Angarpota, according to the treaty, was meant to go to Pakistan while Berubari was to be divided between India and Pakistan. North Berubari going to India and South Berubari to Pakistan. The treaty was not ratified as it faced legal challenges in India. On 1971 Bangladesh became Independent from Pakistan. Bangladesh and India had to sign a new treaty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cl2C2v7-nQC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Dahagram%E2%80%93Angarpota+enclaves&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W9Rn0cqjsv&amp;sig=-KKR2QLbSflIFeVjLLBNFGQe3SM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg4cWrxZzTAhXH7YMKHb2ACg8Q6AEIhgEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahagram%E2%80%93Angarpota%20enclaves&amp;f=false|title=Borderlines and Borderlands: Political Oddities at the Edge of the Nation-State|last=Diener|first=Alexander C.|date=2010-01-16|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=9780742556355|location=|pages=23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1974 Indira-Mujib pact]] was signed which protected the status of Dahagram–Angarpota and in return Bangladesh gave India the whole of [[Birubari|Berubari.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyo.in/politics/foreign-policy-narendra-modi-sheikh-hasina-land-boundary-agreement-counter-enclaves-india-bangladesh-life-in-the-islands-on-land/story/1/4033.html|title=India-Bangladesh enclaves: Life in the islands on land|website=www.dailyo.in|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged in Bangladeshi courts but it was resolved quickly and the treaty ratified in 1974.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The treaty provided Bangladesh with the [[Tin Bigha Corridor]] that connected the enclave with mainland Bangladesh. The corridor was started functioning on 1992, it was open for a few hours every day. Since 2011 the corridor has been open for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The corridor is closed for one hour every day so that the [[Border Security Force]] of India can raise the [[Flag of India|Indian flag]] in the corridor.

'''El Palmar National Park''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Parque Nacional El Palmar'') is one of [[Argentina]]'s [[national park]]s, located on the center-east of the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], midway between the cities of [[Colón, Entre Ríos|Colón]] (54&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Concordia, Entre Ríos|Concordia]] (60&amp;nbsp;km). It has an area of about 85&amp;nbsp;km² and was created in 1966 for the preservation of its characteristic yatay [[palm tree]]s (''[[Butia yatay]]'', formerly ''Syagrus yatay'').

The park has a temperate-humid [[savanna]] [[ecosystem]], typical of the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Argentine Mesopotamia]]. The terrain features patches of palm trees of several species, grassland, small woods and forest, interrupted by streams flowing east into the [[Uruguay River]]. The local [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] includes [[woodpecker]]s, [[ñandú]]s, [[fox]]es, [[viscacha]]s, and [[capybara]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">[[Image:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|Students in Environmental Engineering Science typically combine scientific studies of the biosphere with mathematical, analytical and design tools found in the engineering fields]]
'''Environmental engineering science''' ('''EES''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] field of [[engineering science]] that combines the [[biological]], [[chemical]] and physical sciences with the field of engineering.  This major traditionally requires the student to take basic engineering classes in fields such as [[thermodynamics]], advanced [[math]], computer modeling and [[simulation]] and technical classes in subjects such as [[statics]], [[mechanics]], [[hydrology]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. As the student progresses, the upper division elective classes define a specific field of study for the student with a choice in a [[Environmental Engineering Science#Electives|range]] of science, technology and engineering related classes.&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Difference with related fields==
[[Image:CalifAcadSciRoof 0820.JPG|thumb|right|Graduates of Environmental Engineering Science can go on to work on the technical aspects of designing a [[Green roof|Living Roof]] like the one pictured here at the [[California Academy of Science|California Academy of the Sciences]]]]
As a recently created program, environmental engineering science has not yet been incorporated into the terminology found among [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] focused professionals.  In the few engineering colleges that offer this major, the curriculum shares more classes in common with [[environmental engineering]] than it does with [[environmental science]].  Typically, EES students follow a similar course curriculum with environmental engineers until their fields diverge during the last year of college.  The majority of the environmental engineering students must take classes designed to connect their knowledge of the environment to modern [[building materials]] and [[construction]] methods.  This is meant to direct the environmental engineer into a field where they will more than likely assist in building [[wastewater treatment|treatment facilities]], preparing [[environmental impact assessment]]s or helping to mitigate [[air pollution]] from specific point sources.

Meanwhile, the environmental engineering science student will choose a direction for their [[career]].  From the range of electives they have to choose from, these students can move into a fields such as the design of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear storage facilities]], bacterial [[bioreactors]] or [[environmental policies]]. These students combine the practical design background of an engineer with the detailed theory found in many of the [[biology|biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

==Description at universities==
===Stanford University===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University provides the following description for their program in Environmental Engineering and Science:
The Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) program focuses on the chemical and biological processes involved in water quality engineering, water and air pollution, remediation and hazardous substance control, human exposure to pollutants, environmental biotechnology, and environmental protection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===UC Berkeley===
The College of Engineering at [[UC Berkeley]] defines Environmental Engineering Science, including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|pages=27–28 |title=Engineering Announcement 2008-2009 |url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203005457/http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a multidisciplinary field requiring an integration of physical, chemical and biological principles with engineering analysis for environmental protection and restoration. The program incorporates courses from many departments on campus to create a discipline that is rigorously based in science and engineering, while addressing a wide variety of environmental issues. Although an environmental engineering option exists within the civil engineering major, the engineering science curriculum provides a more broadly based foundation in the sciences than is possible in civil engineering
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===

At [[MIT]], the major is described in their curriculum, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT Course Catalog: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. |url=http://web.mit.edu/catalogue/degre.engin.civil.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering Science emphasizes the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes necessary for understanding the interactions between man and the environment. Issues considered include the provision of clean and reliable water supplies, flood forecasting and protection, development of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, causes and implications of climate change, and the impact of human activities on natural cycles
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wet labs are required as part of the lower division curriculum]]

==Lower division coursework==

Lower division coursework in this field requires the student to take several laboratory-based classes in calculus-based physics, chemistry, biology, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and [[analysis]].  This is intended to give the student background information in order to introduce them to the engineering fields and to prepare them for more technical information in their upper division coursework.

==Upper division coursework==
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|left|thumb|Students learn to integrate their math and statistics with software to perform analysis of physical [[systems]] like the [[Finite Element Analysis]] shown above]]
The upper division classes in Environmental Engineering Science prepares the student for work in the fields of engineering and science with coursework in subjects including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Mechanics]] of materials
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Environmental engineering]]
*Advanced math and [[statistics]]
*[[Geology]]
*[[Physical Chemistry|Physical]], [[Organic Chemistry|organic]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]]
*[[Biochemistry]]
*[[Microbiology]]
*[[Ecology]]

==Post graduation work==

The multidisciplinary approach in Environmental Engineering Science gives the student expertise in technical fields related to their own personal interest.  While some graduates choose to use this major to go to graduate school,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; students who choose to work often go into the fields of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]], [[biotechnology]], and research.  However, the less technical math, programming and writing background gives the students opportunities to pursue [[information technology|IT]] work and [[technical writing]].

'''Fort Victoria''', near present-day [[Smoky Lake, Alberta]], was established by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[1864 in Canada|1864]] on the [[North Saskatchewan River]] as a [[trading post]] with the local [[Cree]] First Nations. Today, it is a historical museum known as '''Victoria Settlement'''.

== Location and setting ==

Victoria was located on the banks of the [[North Saskatchewan River]], downstream from [[Edmonton House]] on the way to [[Fort Pitt (Saskatchewan)|Fort Pitt]], and also along the overland route between the two, part of the [[Carlton Trail]] system.  The fur trading post at Victoria was minor compared to Edmonton but soon attracted a small agricultural settlement around itself much like that at other H.B.C. posts at this time.  Here land was divided in the customary [[French river lot system]] and a mixed community of First Nations, Métis, and Europeans developed.  For several miles on each side of the present-day museum the river lot system is still in use, the farm here predating the large, square tracts of the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' which surround them.

== Victoria Park Cemetery ==
[[File:July 19 2015 at 1124PM.jpeg|thumb|left|Plaque at Victoria Cemetery, near Smoky Lake, Alberta.]]
The Victoria Park Cemetery was established circa 1896 by the Methodist church and is located on a hill overlooking the river, it contains approximately 100 recognizable graves from both Native and Settler communities.  It was restored and rededicated in 1999.

==History==

In 1864 [[George Flett]] was given the job of opening a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in Fort Victoria.&lt;ref name=Block1999&gt;{{cite journal
 |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/37/flett_g.shtml
 |title=George Flett, Presbyterian Missionary to the Ojibwa at Okanase
 |first=Alvina |last=Block
 |location=Winnipeg
 |journal=Manitoba History |volume=37 |date=Spring–Summer 1999
 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flett and John Norris led the first brigade of Red River ox-carts from Winnipeg to Edmonton, taking three and a half months on the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRtWO4osCYYC&amp;pg=PA58
 |page=58
 |title=Edmonton in Our Own Words
 |first1=Linda |last1=Goyette |first2=Carolina Jakeway |last2=Roemmich
 |publisher=University of Alberta |year=2005
 |ISBN=0-88864-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As clerk in charge of the post, Flett was responsible for arranging for construction of the buildings and for opening up trade with the local Indians.
Flett was successful in quickly obtaining a supply of good-quality furs, which Flett and his assistants took by horse and dog train to [[Fort Edmonton]].&lt;ref name=Block1999/&gt;
The oldest building in Alberta still on its original foundations is the clerk's quarters at Fort Victoria, which dates from [[1865 in Canada|1865]].

Later the site of the Fort became a hub for the early settlement of East-[[Central Alberta]].  It came to be called the '''Victoria Settlement''' and later, '''Pakan'''.   It also became home for the McDougall [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]] missionary family.  Still later, the settlement served as a base for [[Methodist Church of Canada|Methodist]] missionaries to the [[Ukrainian Canadians]].

The post was also a vital stop on the [[Carlton Trail|trail from Winnipeg to Edmonton]].  The section of the trail currently within the eastern part of the city of Edmonton is a now a paved road called Victoria Trail in honour of the fort.

The Fort lies with the [[Kalyna Country]] ecomuseum.  It has been designated a [[List of national historic sites of Canada|national historic site of Canada]] and a [[List of provincial historic sites of Alberta|provincial historic site of Alberta]].  The museum that is there today is operated by the provincial government.

The '''''Garden of Cosmic Speculation''''' is a 30 [[acre]] (12 [[hectare]]) [[sculpture garden]] created by [[landscape architect]] and theorist [[Charles Jencks]] at his home, Portrack House, near [[Dumfries]] in South West [[Scotland]]. Like much of Jencks' work, the garden is inspired by modern [[cosmology]].

==History==

===Features===
[[File:Blackhole6.JPG|thumb|''Black Hole'']]
The garden is inspired by science and mathematics, with sculptures and landscaping on these themes, such as [[black holes]] and [[fractals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite |url=https://onedio.com/haber/simetri-kaos-tabiat-ve-bilimin-bir-araya-geldigi-kozmik-spekulasyon-bahcesinden-20-fotograf-470535 |title=Symmetry, Chaos, Nature and Science in the 'Cosmic Speculation' Garden 20 Photos (from Turkish: Simetri, Kaos, Tabiat ve Bilimin Bir Araya Geldiği 'Kozmik Spekülasyon' Bahçesinden 20 Fotoğraf) |publisher=Onedio |date=14 March 2015 |accessdate=Nov 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden is not abundant with plants, but sets mathematical formulae and scientific phenomena in a setting which elegantly combines natural features and artificial symmetry and curves. It is probably unique among gardens, drawing comparisons with a similarly abstract garden in Scotland, [[Little Sparta]].

===Access===
The garden is private but usually opens for only five hours on one day each year for 1500 ticket holders through the [[Scotland's Gardens]] programme and raises money for [[Maggie's Centres]], a cancer care charity named for [[Maggie Keswick Jencks]], the late wife of Charles Jencks.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/curious-fact-of-the-week-garden-of-cosmic-speculation |title=Curious Fact of the Week: Garden of Cosmic Speculation |publisher=Atlas Obscura |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=Nov 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depiction in music===
The garden is the subject of an orchestral composition by American composer, [[Michael Gandolfi]], which he composed for a joint commission from the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Tanglewood Music Center]]. The piece was subsequently recorded by the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Robert Spano]], and nominated for "Best Contemporary Classical Composition" at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]].

===In literature===
[[Louise Penny]] uses ''The Garden of Cosmic Speculation'' as an important plot device in her tenth [[Chief Inspector Armand Gamache|Inspector Gamache]] [[mystery fiction|mystery]], ''The Long Way Home'' (St. Martin Press, 2014).&lt;ref name= "returns"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oldenburg |first=Dan |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/08/25/the-long-way-home-a-chief-inspector-gamache-novel/14563301/ |title=Inspector Gamache returns in Penny's ''The Long Way Home'' |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron Jace makes creative use of ''The Garden of Cosmic Speculation'' in his fictional novel titled ''Circus'', which is the third installment of his ''Insanity'' series. 
In the book, Jace uses many true facts when referring to 'public' knowledge of the garden (per character conversation), but changed the name of the designer to better fit into the story's plot line.

[[File:Northbrookisland fj.jpg|thumb|right|Northbrook Island]]
The '''Geography of [[Franz Josef Land]]''' refers to an island group belonging to [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]. It is situated in the [[Barents Sea]] of the [[Arctic]], north of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and east of [[Svalbard]]. At latitudes between [[80th parallel north|80.0°]] and 81.9° north, it is the most northerly group of islands associated with [[Eurasia]]. The extreme northernmost point is [[Cape Fligely]] on [[Rudolf Island]]. The archipelago consists of 191 ice-covered [[island]]s with a total area of {{convert|16134|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is currently uninhabited. The archipelago is only {{convert|900|to|1110|km|mi|abbr=in}} from the North Pole, and the northernmost islands are closer to the Pole than any other land except for Canada's [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]]. The largest island is [[Zemlya Georga]] (George Land) which measures {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} from end to end. The highest point in the archipelago is on Ostrov Viner-Neyshtadt ([[Wiener Neustadt Island]]) which reaches {{convert|620|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The central cluster of large islands in the midst of the archipelago forms a compact whole, known as [[Zichy Land]], where islands are separated from each other by very narrow sounds that are frozen most of the year.

During the period 1926 and 1932 Franz Josef Land also known in Russian as ''Zemlya Franca Josepha'' became a part of the Soviet Union and is included under the [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]. In 1994, it was declared the [[Sakasnik Nature Reserve]] covering an area of {{Convert|42000|km2}} including area of the sea surrounding the land but with restricted entry only on special permit which is not given easily; out of this area, {{Convert|50|km2}} area around the military base of [[Nagurskoye]] on the [[Alexandra Land]] is totally out of bounds.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=206}}

The group of islands of the archipelago is located at the nearest about {{Convert|900|km}} from the [[North Pole]], much beyond the [[Polar Circle]]. The group’s 191 islands measure {{Convert|16135|km2}}. They extend over a length of {{Convert|234|km}} in the north-south direction and {{convert|350|km}} in the east-west direction.{{sfn|Lück|2008|p=182}} There are flat mountains in the range of {{Convert|400|-|490|m}} above sea level. The general lie of the land is in the elevation range between {{Convert|300|m}}  in the north and {{Convert|600|m}}  in the south with [[Wilczek Land]] forming the highest land mass at an elevation of {{Convert|670|m}}.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|pp=191-93}}  The islands are covered with glaciers to the extent of 85%, with no land breaks, and the land area of all the islands is only about 20%, with a coastline measuring {{Convert|4425|km}}.{{sfn|Lück|2008|p=182}} There are multiple [[icebergs]], with limited length of less than {{Convert|400|m}} and some of them are similar to the Antarctic [[tabular iceberg]]. Air borne radar measurements have recorded an ice layer of {{Convert|400|m}} in Graham Bell and Hall Islands; the thick ice cover on the islands is a phenomenon of the last 1000 years and as result the [[reindeer]] population has not survived in these islands. Moving down to the coastal region, where the ice disappears, many lakes and ponds are seen. But as this area is very limited only small streams are noted and the largest one is only {{Convert|19|km}} on the George Prince Island.{{sfn|Lück|2008|p=182}}&lt;ref name=National&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/2011/08/franz-josef-land-national-geographic-explorer-makes-history/ |title=Franz Josef Land: National Geographic Explorer Makes History: Field Notes |date=10 April 2011 |publisher=National Geographic Expeditions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184849/http://blog.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/2011/08/franz-josef-land-national-geographic-explorer-makes-history/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Josef Land consists of 191 ice-covered [[island]]s with a total area of about {{convert|16134|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}; the area varying with the fluctuation of glaciers during rising or receding stages. Its two largest islands are Alexander and Prince George.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=191}} The main geographic subgroups in Franz Joseph Land (also called Land of the Kaiser Franz Joseph) are the northernmost archipelago of [[Eurasia]] and comprise [[Zichy Land|Zemlya Zichy]] (Zichy Land), a large and compact glaciarized island cluster located in the middle of the archipelago containing ten large islands and [[Belaya Zemlya]], a group of three islands in the northeast named Hvidtenland ("White Land") by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], and many of them located on the located on both sides of the wide strait, which is called the [[Payer Austrian channel]].&lt;ref name=Expedition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivki.ru/kapustin/journal/markin22.htm|title= Archipelago ledyanыh kupolov (Zemlya Franz-Joseph)|language=Russian|publisher= Arctic Antarctic Philately}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolph Island is the nearest to the North Pole.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=191}} The largest island, [[Zemlya Georga]] (George Land) measures {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} from end to end. The highest point in the archipelago is on Ostrov Viner-Neyshtadt ([[Wiener Neustadt Island]]) which reaches {{convert|620|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

=== Western islands ===
[[File:Map of Western Franz Josef Land-en.svg|thumb|Western Franz Josef Land]]
The western islands are separated from the other islands by the British channel and De Bruyne sound to the east. They include the large Alexandra and Prince George lands and the smaller Arthur, Bruce, Mabel, Bell Isabel and Northbrook islands.

====Alexandra Land====
[[Alexandra Land]] is the westernmost island in the archipelago.  It has an area of approximately {{convert|1051|km²|sqmi|sp=us}}. The sounds [[Cambridge Sound]] to the east and [[Arkhangelsky Sound]] off the northeast coast separate it from [[Zemlya Georga]] (also known as Prince George Land) to the east.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;{{citation|title=US military map of Franz Josef Land, sheet NU 38-39-40-41|year=1964
|publisher=Army Map Service (LU), [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest point is {{convert|382|m}} in the centre of the island, and there is also a {{convert|31|m}} peak near the northern coast.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; [[Cape Nimrod]] lies on its western coast, and [[Cape George Thomas]] on its northeastern coast on Arkhangelsky Sound. There is a base named [[Nagurskoye]] near its northern coast,&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; named after [[Jan Nagórski]], which served as one of the most important meteorological stations in the archipelago during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Mills|2003|p=9}} The northernmost Russian Air Force base is in the Alexander Island (though in a poor condition)  with a small unit of security force is existing since 1955. Prior to this, the manned base station in the extreme north was in the Rudolph island which is defunct since 1955.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=4}} It has a {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} snow runway. An Antonov [[An-72]] cargo aircraft crashed while landing at Nagurskoye on 23 December 1996.

====Zemlya Georga====
[[Zemlya Georga]], or Prince George Land, to the east of Alexandra Island is the largest island of Franz Josef Land which measures {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} from end to end. It has an area of {{convert|2820.8|km2}} and lies within latitude 80.50° N and longitude 49.50° E. Its mapped shore length is {{convert|635.9|km}}.&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=644&amp;L=5|title= (Prince) George Land - Franz-Josef-Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point is {{convert|416|m}} in the northern-central part of the island. Jackson named the island after Queen Victoria's grandson as "Prince George Land".{{sfn|Mills|2003|p=255}}&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt; There are also peaks of {{convert|362|m}} on its western side and {{convert|364|m}} near the southwestern coast, northwest of [[Gray Bay]].&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; To the southeast of this is [[Nightingale Sound]], which separates the island from the small islands of Bell island, Mabel Island and Bruce Island. To the north of this and off the east coast of Zemlya  Georga is the [[British Channel]], which has [[Hooker Island]] to the far southeast. Zemlya Georga has several capes on its northern end, including [[Cape Murray]] on the northeastern peninsula, [[Cape Bruce]] on the north-northeastern peninsula, and [[Cape Battenberg]] on the northern peninsula, marking the northernmost point of the island.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Several streams during the summer season flow into the sea in the northwestern side, and [[Geographer Bay]] divides the northeastern and north-north eastern peninsulas. Off the north coast, [[Leigh Smith Sound]] separates Zemlya George from the small [[Arthur Island]], which has a peak of {{convert|275|m}} and the [[Cape Ice Reconnaissance]] on its northern coast.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;

===South central group===
[[File:Map of Southeastern Franz Josef Land-en.svg|thumb|300px|South-central islands including Hooker, McClintock, Hall and Salm]]
The south central group is separated from the other islands by the British Channel, Markham Sound and Austrian Strait.
They include the larger Hooker, McClintock, Hall and Salm islands, and many smaller islands.

====Hooker Island====
[[Hooker Island]], named after British naturalist Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], lies to the southeast of Zemlya Georga, across the British Channel. It has an area of {{Convert|459.8|km2}}  and lies within latitude 80.25° N and longitude 53.00° E. The highest point on the island is at elevation {{Convert|576|m}} and its mapped shore length is {{Convert|117.5|km}}.&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt; A graveyard and two modern buildings exist. On Hooker Island's western side there is a bay in an un-glaciated area, [[Hooker Island|Tikhaya Bay]] {{Coord|80|20|N|52|47|E|}}). A large [[seabird colony]] exists near Tikhaya Bay at Skala Rubini {{Coord|80|18|N|52|50|E|}}), a spectacular rock formation on Hooker Island's shore. Tikhaya Bay was the site of a major base for [[Arctic exploration|polar expeditions]], and the location of a [[meteorological station]] from 1929 to 1963. There is another bay in the south of the island called Zaliv Makarova and another in the east known as Ledn.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; To the southwest, [[De Bruyne Sound]] separates the island from [[Northbrook Island]]. To the north, [[Young Sound]] separates the island from the islands of Koettlitz and Namsen, Pritchet, and several others.&lt;ref name=Hook&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=650&amp;L=5|title= Hooker (Gukera) Island, Rubini Rock, Tikhaya Station - Franz Josef Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of islands surrounding Hooker Island. Scott-Keltie Island, with a highest point of {{convert|64|m}}, is an island off the northwest coast, and is named in honor of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geographer Sir [[John Scott Keltie]] (1840-1927). {{Convert|10|km}} beyond this, lying to the west of Scott-Keltie Island in the British Channel, is Eaton Island, a small, {{convert|3|km}} long island. This island, which appears as Ostrov Itol in many Russian maps, was named after British scientist Rev. [[Alfred Edvin Eaton]] (1844-1929). May Island is a small island lying {{convert|5|km}} off the south coast; to the southwest of this [[Etheridge Island]], and to the southeast is [[Newton Island (Franz Josef Land)|Newton Island]], {{convert|11|km}} offshore, named in honor of [[Alfred Newton]]. Leigh-Smith Island lies east of Hooker island, separated from it by a {{convert|6|km}} wide sound called Proliv Smitsona.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; It is {{convert|14|km}} long and has a maximum width of {{convert|6.5|km}}. The island's highest point is {{convert|309|m}} and its surface is wholly glacierized except for a small area at its northern point and another around Mys Bitterburga', its southernmost cape.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; This island is named after British yachtsman and explorer [[Benjamin Leigh Smith]]. West of Leigh-Smith Island's northern end, off Hooker island's northeastern shore, there is a smaller island known as Royal Society Island, named after the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. It is {{convert|6|km}} long and has a maximum width of {{convert|2.5|km}}.&lt;ref name=Hook/&gt;

====MacKlintok Island====
[[MacKlintok Island]] or McClintock Island, named after [[Irish people|Irish]] explorer of the Arctic [[Francis Leopold McClintock]],&lt;ref name=Franz/&gt; lies to the east of [[Brady Island]], which lies to the east of Leigh-Smith Island and Hooker Island. This island, located within latitude 80.20° N and longitude 54.80° E, is roughly square-shaped. Its maximum length is {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} and its mapped shore length is {{convert|120.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Its area is {{convert|611.5|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, It is largely glaciated. The island's highest point is {{convert|521|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the eastern-central part of the island,&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt;&lt;ref name=Franz&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=655&amp;L=5|title= McClintock Island - Franz-Josef-Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a {{convert|481|m}} peak near the northeastern coast. The island is located very close to the west of [[Gallya|Hall Island]], separated from it by a narrow sound, Proliv Negri.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; The island's northernmost point is Mys Grili (Greely Cape) and the southeastern is Mys Oppoltsera (Cape Oppholtzer).&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

[[Alger Island, Russia|Alger Island]] and the smaller Mathilda Island lies off MacKlintok Island's northern shore, separated from Alger by a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} narrow sound. Its highest point is near the centre at {{convert|429|m}}. Brady Island off the west coast is a relatively large island and is mostly glaciated. It is located west of MacKlintok Island's northwestern tip, separated from it by the {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Aberdare Sound]] (Proliv Abyerder). The highest point on Brady Island is {{convert|381|m|ft|0|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; it was named after the English scientist [[George Brady (geologist)|George Brady]]. Mys Vize, Brady Island's northernmost cape,&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; is named after Russian Arctic expert [[Vladimir Wiese]]. There are also several islands off the southern shore including the Ostrova Borisika islets and [[Aagaard Island]], {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the southern coast, named in honor of [[Bjarne Aagaard]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]] expert on Antarctic whaling and exploration.&lt;ref name=Franz/&gt;

====Alger Island====
Alger Island, (Russian: Ostrov Altzer), is a small island at latitude 80° 23′ N and longitude 56.00° E. It divides the south central islands and the north central group, and is located to the south of [[Markham Strait]].&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; [[McClintock Island]] lies to its south. Discovered in August 1899 by the Waltter Welmann expedition, it was named after [[Russell A. Alger]], [[US Secretary of War]]. The coast line is fairly ice free. In 1901, Evilyn Baldwin established a camp here and named it [[Camp Zeigler]], after [[William Ziegler]] who had sponsored the expedition.{{sfn|Mills|2003|p=10}}

====Hall Island====
[[File:Kap tegethoff gross.jpg|thumb|right|View of Cape Tegethoff]]
[[Hall Island (Arctic)|Hall Island]] (Ostrov Gallya) is an almost completely glacierized large island of {{convert|1049|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} immediately to the east of MacKlintok Island. It lies within latitude 80.30° N and longitude 56.00° E. The highest point on the island is {{convert|502|m|abbr=on}} and its mapped shore length is {{convert|174.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt;&lt;ref name=Austro&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=648&amp;L=5|title=Hall (Gallya) Insel, Cape Tegetthoff - Franz-Josef-Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after American Arctic explorer [[Charles Francis Hall]]. The only relatively large areas free of permanent ice are located in its southern end, where there are two headlands, Cape Tegethoff, and Cape Ozernyy, on the Littov Peninsula. Cape Tegethoff has a range of hill peaks.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; The airborne surveys revealed {{convert|400|m}} thick mantles of ice and also in Graham Bell Island’s ice capes.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=188}} There is also a very small unglacierized area around its eastern cape, Cape Frankfurt, and another in its northwestern point, Cape Wiggins. Its highest point is {{convert|502|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} near its southwestern side, and there is also a peak of {{convert|421|m}} in the northcentral part of the island. There is a wide bay on the southeastern side of Hall Island known as Hydrographer Bay and a smaller one west of the Littov Peninsula, known as Bukhta Surovaya.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; To the southeast, there is a wider strait separating Hall Island from [[Salm Island]], known as Proliv Lavroka. The strait to the east is known as Avstriskiy Proliv.&lt;ref name=Austro/&gt;

Just off the northern shore of Hall Island lie three small islets known as the Brown Islands, named in honor of George Brown of the [[Royal Navy]], who participated in the 1850-1854 expedition in search of [[Sir John Franklin]] on the ''Investigator''.{{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} West off Hall island's northwestern cape lies oval-shaped {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Newcomb Island, with a highest point of {{convert|67|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This island was named after {{Interlanguage link multi|Raymond Lee Newcomb|fr}}, the naval officer in charge of the ill-fated [[George W. DeLong|DeLong]] expedition on the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|''Jeannette'']]. {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the northeastern side of Hall Island's eastern bay lies the small but steep Berghaus Island, reaching a height of {{convert|372|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Unglacierized, this island was named after cartographer [[Heinrich Berghaus]] (1797-1884).&lt;ref name=Austro/&gt;

Sal'm Island, located on the wide strait of the Payer Austrian channel,&lt;ref name=Expedition/&gt; encompasses an area of {{convert|343.7|km2}} with an altitude or {{convert|343|m}} and the shore length is {{convert|76.9|km}}.&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt;

===North central group===
[[File:Map of central Franz Josef Land-en.svg|thumb|Central islands]]
The north central group lies to the north of the Markham sound and Austrian Strait. It includes Rudolf island to the north, the [[Zichy Land]] cluster of islands, and Heiss and Komsomol islands to the southeast.

====Rudolf Island====
[[File:VNIIOarctic.jpg|thumb|left|Rudolf Island]]
[[Cape Fligely]] on [[Rudolf Island]] at 81°52' N is the extreme northernmost point of Franz Josef Land.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=206}} Lieutenant [[Julius von Payer]], an officer of the Austro-Hungarian army, cartographer, and mountaineer, placed an Austrian flag and primitive shelter at Cape Fligely during an expedition in 1874.{{Sfn|Mills|2003|p=508}} The [[Baldwin Xiegler expedition]] arrived in 1902 and established a depot, and the [[Fiala-Ziegeler expedition]] set up camp here for two seasons.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=206}} A meteorological station was set up in 1932 in coordination with [[International Polar Year]] (1932-3) but was evacuated in 1941.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=206}} A later station functioned until 1995. Several pre-World War II Soviet stations existed in [[Teplitz Bay]] but little has remained according to the observations of the ''[[Kapitan Dranitsyn]]'' expedition in 2004.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=206}}

====Zichy Land====
[[File:S7300884.JPG|thumb|[[Wiener Neustadt Island]]]]
The islands of the Zemlya Zichy archipelago are separated from each other by very narrow sounds that are frozen most of the year, forming a compact whole.
From north to south the main islands are [[Karl-Alexander Island]], [[Rainer Island]], [[Jackson Island]], [[Payer Island]], [[Greely Island]], [[Ziegler Island]], [[Salisbury Island (Russia)|Salisbury Island]], [[Wiener Neustadt Island]], [[Luigi Island]] and [[Champ Island]].

Karl-Alexander Island covers an area of {{convert|329.2|km2}} with an elevation of {{convert|365|m}} and its shoreline measures {{convert|87.7|km}}.&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt;

===Eastern islands===
[[File:Map of Graham Bell Island and Wilczek Land-en.svg|thumb|Eastern islands, including Wilczek Land and Graham Bell island]]

====Wilczek Land====
Wilczek Land is barren and basaltic rock cliffs are exposed.{{sfn|Umbreit|2009|p=206}}&lt;ref name=Wilzeck&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=640&amp;L=5|title= Wilczek Island, grave Otto Krisch - Franz-Joseph-Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies to the northeast of Hall Island across the Austrian Strait.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; It is the second largest island of the Franz Josef Archipelago and is almost completely glaciarized except for two narrow areas along its western shores. The highest point on the island is {{convert|606|m}}, in the western central part.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; This large island is named after [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek]], involved in the [[Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition]]. This island should not be confused with small [[Wilczek Island]], located southwest of Salm Island and named after the same person. Mys Ganza is Wilczek Land's westernmost cape. [[Cape Geller]] was the wintering site for two members of the 1899 Welle Expedition waiting for their team's return from the pole.&lt;ref name=Wilzeck/&gt;

Off Wilczek Land's southern bay lies the small Klagenfurt Island, about {{convert|9|km}} away from the shore, named after [[Klagenfurt]], the capital of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. [[McNult Island]] lies just off the southeastern cape, with several other islets. Just off the eastern coast of Wilczek Land lie two small islets called Ostrova Gorbunova,&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; named after Russian naturalist [[Gregory Petrovich Gorbunov]]. The northern side of Wilczek is separated from [[La Ronciere Island]] by a straight known as Wanderbilt. The small island of Geddes lies off the northwestern point. To the east, Wilczek Land is separated from [[Graham Bell Sound]] by the Morgan Straight.&lt;ref name=Wilzeck/&gt;

====Graham Bell Island====
[[Graham Bell Island]], the easternmost island of Franz Josef Land, is immediately to the northeast of Wilczek Land across the Morgan Strait and is one of the larger islands in the archipelago, with an area of {{convert|1557|km2}}. Partially glaciated, its highest point is {{convert|509 |m}} near the southern centre. [[Cape Kohlsaat]], the easternmost point of the archipelago at 81°14′N, 65°10′E, lies on Graham Bell Island's eastern shore.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Cape Kohlsaat marks the northwesternmost corner of the [[Kara Sea]], therefore it is a significant geographical landmark. Cape Leiter lies on the south point of the island.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; This island was named after inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Graham Bell Island should not be confused with the smaller Bell Island which is also part of the Franz Josef Archipelago and which was also named after the same person. Graham Bell Island is home to a Cold War outpost (shut down in 1994) and an airfield Green Bell with a runway {{convert|2100|m}} long.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=654&amp;L=5|title= Graham Bell (Greem Bell) Island, Severnaja - Franz-Josef-Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small island is mostly ice free and has a lagoon in the backdrop of a bell shaped mountain. The log cabin built by [[Benjamin Leigh Smith]] in 1881 is a well preserved cabin even now and is the oldest house on the land though unoccupied.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=208}}

Graham Bell Island's northern shore is fringed by clusters of very small islets.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Three-ray Island lies off the western coast. Ostrov Perlamutrovyy (Pyerlamutrov Island) lies off the southeastern shore of Graham Bell Island, the {{convert|2|km}} long Ostrov Trëkhluchevoy lies off its western shore, and Ostrov Udachnyy is part of a cluster of islets located along the northwestern shore.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

====Eva-Liv Island====
[[Eva-Liv Island]], also Yeva-Liv or Jeva Liv, is the northeastern extremity of Franz Josef Land at {{coord|81.62|62.96}}. It covers an area of {{convert|287.6|km}}. It has an altitude of {{convert|381|m}} and a mapped shore length of {{convert|75.2|km}}.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Islands/&gt; The island was discovered by Nansen and Johansen on 24 July 1895. Nansen thought there were two islands, and named them after his wife and daughter. In 1905 it was found that "Eva" and "Liv" were in fact one island.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=208}}

==Waterways==
Markham Sound is a [[waterway]] between Zichy Land and the islands of McClintock and Hall.{{sfn|Heilprin|Heilprin|1990|p=1122}} West of the British Channel is Prince George Land.{{sfn|Heilprin|Heilprin|1990|p=1494}} Alexandra Land contains Weyprecht Bay.{{sfn|Heilprin|Heilprin|1990|p=1993}} West of Austria Sound is Zichy Land.{{sfn|Heilprin|Heilprin|1990|p=2049}} Immediately north of Franz Josef Land is the Queen Victoria Sea.{{sfn|Heilprin|Heilprin|1990|p=1510}}

==Climate==
Climatic conditions here are very severe with lowest temperature touching minus (-)25&amp;nbsp;°C to (-) 30&amp;nbsp;°C during winter; even in summers the temperature does not rise above {{Convert|0|C|F}}. The polar nights lasts for 125 days while the polar days are 140.&lt;ref name=National/&gt; Climatically none of the Gulf Streams touch  the 75 islands of the Franz Josef Land. While [[Polynias]] are the wind and sea currents that prevail in the northern and southern part of the land mass, which are the causative factors for the large ice free zone in the sea, the eastern and northern winds cause very cold breeze. The rainfall in the land varies between {{Convert|100|mm}} and {{Convert|300|mm}} but mostly in the form of snow.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|pp=192-93}}

==Geology==
Two distinct geological formations identified are of the [[Late Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] sedimentary process which are recorded to a depth of {{Convert|200|m}} at [[Cape Flora]] and it recedes gradually towards the  coast line of the sea in the north. Fossilized tree trunks here attest to this assessment. Above the Jurassic sedimentary layer of {{Convert|500|m}}  thickness, which is [[basalt]]ic, cretaceous period intrusions of [[dolerite]] caused by volcanic eruptions are recorded. Also seen are many fault zones which have contributed to the removal of volcanic layers and exposing plateau tops and rock walls. Another feature noted here is of the shore line which appears to have receded, as a result of island formations (the rise of the islands above the icy sea is reported to be {{Convert|2|-|3|mm}}  per year).{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=191}} Though most of the land is covered by [[glacial ice]], it does have outcrops covered with [[moss]]. The northeastern part of the archipelago is locked in [[pack ice]] most of the year round; however the ice sometimes retreats north past the islands in summer (September).

:''See also [[Atolls of the Maldives]] for an in-depth description of the atolls''.

[[Maldives]] is a country of [[South Asia]], situated in the [[Indian Ocean]], south-southwest of [[India]]. It consists of approximately 1,190 coral [[island]]s grouped in a double chain of 26 [[atoll]]s, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers, making this one of the most disparate countries in the world. Composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, the atolls are situated atop a [[submarine ridge]] 960 kilometers long that rises abruptly from the depths of the [[Indian Ocean]] and runs from north to south. Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes the Maldives government organized these atolls into nineteen [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, ''Divehiraajjege Jōgrafīge Vanavaru''. G.Sōsanī. Malé 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest island of Maldives is [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan A. Maniku, ''The Islands of Maldives''. Novelty. Male 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Addu Atoll]] the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef and the total length of the road is 14&amp;nbsp;km.

== Physical geography ==
{{See also|List of islands of the Maldives}}
[[File:CoralReef.svg|thumb|left|300px|Cross section of a coral reef in the Maldives]]

Most [[atolls of the Maldives]] consist of a large, ring-shaped [[coral reef]] supporting numerous small islands. Islands average only one to two square kilometers in area, and lie between one and 1.5 meters above mean sea level. Although some of the larger atolls are approximately 50 kilometers long from north to south, and 30 kilometers wide from east to west, no individual island is longer than eight kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan A. Maniku, ''Changes in the Topography of the Maldives''. Novelty. Male 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldives has no hills, but some islands have dunes which can reach {{convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level, like the NW coast of [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)]] in [[Addu Atoll]]. Islands are too small to have rivers, but small lakes and marshes can be found in some of them.

On average, each atoll has approximately 5 to 10 inhabited islands; the uninhabited islands of each atoll number approximately 20 to 60. Some atolls, however, consist of one large, isolated island surrounded by a steep coral beach. The most notable example of this type of atoll is the large island of Fuvahmulah situated in the [[Equatorial Channel]].

The [[tropical vegetation]] of Maldives differs in the inhabited and in the uninhabited islands. Inhabited islands have small groves of [[banana]], [[papaya]], [[Moringa oleifera|drumstick]] and [[citrus]] trees by the homesteads, while [[breadfruit]] trees and [[coconut]] palms are grown in available patches of land. On the other hand, uninhabited islands have mostly different kinds of bushes ([[Scaevola taccada|magū]], [[Heliotropium foertherianum|boshi]]) and [[mangrove]]s ([[Pemphis acidula|kuredi]], [[Bruguiera cylindrica|kandū]]) along the waterline as well as some coconut trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''. 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some islands are [[marsh]]y, while others are higher owing to sand and gravel having been piled up by wave action. Often the soil is highly [[alkaline]], and a deficiency in nitrogen, potash, and iron severely limits agricultural potential. Ten percent of the land, or about 26&amp;nbsp;km², is cultivated with taro, bananas, coconuts, and other fruit. Only the lush island of Fuvammulah produces fruits such as oranges and pineapples - partly because the terrain of Fuvammulah sits higher than most other islands, leaving the groundwater less subject to seawater penetration. However, as population grows, even in this island the cultivated areas are shrinking rapidly.

Freshwater floats in a layer known as "[[Saltwater intrusion#Ghyben-Herzberg relation|Ghyben/Herzberg lens]]" above the seawater that permeates the limestone and coral sands of the islands. These lenses are shrinking rapidly on Male and on many islands where there are resorts catering to foreign tourists. [[Mango]] trees already have been reported dying on Male because of salt penetration. Most residents of the atolls depend on groundwater or rainwater for drinking purposes.

==Climate==
{{See also|Maldives#Climate|l1=Climate}}

[[File:405-Maldives.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many uninhabited islands of the Maldives.]]
The temperature of Maldives ranges between {{convert|24|and|33|°C|°F|1}} throughout the year. Although the humidity is relatively high, the constant sea breezes help to keep the air moving. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeast monsoon and the rainy season brought by the summer southwest monsoon. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|2540|mm|in|sp=us}} in the north and {{convert|3810|mm|in|sp=us}} in the south.

The weather in Maldives is affected by the large landmass of the South Asia to the north. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. Scientists also cite other factors in the formation of monsoons, including the barrier of the Himalayas on the northern fringe of the South Asia and the sun's northward tilt, which shifts the jet stream north. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over the South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. The hot air that rises over the South Asia during April and May creates low-pressure areas into which the cooler, moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean flow. In Maldives, the wet southwest monsoon lasts from the end of April to the end of October and brings the worst weather with strong winds and storms. In May 1991 violent monsoon winds created tidal waves that damaged thousands of houses and piers, flooded arable land with seawater, and uprooted thousands of fruit trees. The damage caused was estimated at US$30 million.

The shift from the moist southwest monsoon to the dry northeast monsoon over the South Asia occurs during October and November. During this period, the northeast winds contribute to the formation of the northeast monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of December and lasts until the end of March. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of the South Asia. Rain showers over the whole country have been known to persist for up to one week during the midst of the dry season.

[[Andorra]] is located in the ''Axial Zone'' of the central [[Pyrenees]] mountain range in south western Europe, which means that it has intensely folded and thrusted rocks formed when the [[Iberian peninsula]] was rotated onto the European continent.

==Overview==
Rocks from the [[Cambrian]] or [[Ordovician]] occur in the form of [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[limestone]], [[phyllite]], [[quartzite]], and [[slate]]. [[Diapir]]s of slate from the [[Silurian]] Period are found in the Llavirsi [[syncline]] near [[Bixessarri]] in the south west. [[Gneiss]] and [[schist]] are found in the cores of [[anticline]]s in the north east of the country. This gneiss contains [[muscovite]]. The antiforms are connected with near horizontal [[shear zone]]s, containing [[nappe]]s of [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] sediments. Younger overlying [[Paleozoic]] metamorphosed sediments found over most of Andorra have also been steeply folded.

In the south east of the country is an alkaline [[granite]] from a [[batholith]] called Mt-Louis-Andorra Batholith. It extends into [[Spain]] and covers an area of {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}}. Different rock composition zones occur, with [[monzogranite]] found at the centre, [[quartz]] [[diorite]] at the edge and [[granodiorite]] in intermediate parts. The batholith has caused metamorphism on its western edge. The base of the batholith is exposed in the east of Andorra.

In the Central and Eastern Pyrenees, which includes Andorra, no fossils older than the [[Caradoc (age)|Ordovician Caradoc]] 450–460&amp;nbsp;million years ago have been found.&lt;ref name="jd1990"&gt;Julivert M and Durán H (1990). Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Central and Northern part of the Catalonian Coastal Ranges (NE Spain). ''Acta Geologica Hispanica''. 25(1-2):3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glaciation==
Andorra was extensively glaciated during the [[Quaternary]]; glaciers flowed down all of the major valleys of Andorra, merging into one large glacier at [[Escaldes-Engordany]], which in the coldest stage reached as far south as Pont de la Fontaneda near Santa Coloma.&lt;ref name="ada"&gt;Govern d'Andorra (1991). ''Atlas d'Andorra'', map of northwestern Andorra, p.51. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andorra has numerous [[Glacier#Erosion|glacial erosion]]al features, including U-shaped valleys, [[cirque]]s, [[arête]]s, and [[roche moutonnée]]s. Examples of cirques include the Cirque de Pessons in the east, Llac de Tristaina in the northwest, and the two cirques at approximately 2400&amp;nbsp;m elevation on [[Pic de Casamanya]] (2740&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name="ada"/&gt; Santa Coloma has a glacial [[terminal moraine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11128">[[File:Jubilee field 002.svg|right|400px|thumb|Location of the [[Jubilee Field]] offshore Ghana]]
The geology of Ghana is primarily very ancient crystalline basement rock, volcanic belts and sedimentary basins, affected by periods of igneous activity and two major [[orogeny]] mountain building events. Aside from modern sediments and some rocks formed within the past 541 million years of the [[Phanerozoic Eon]], along the coast, many of the rocks in Ghana formed close to one billion years ago or older leading to five different types of gold deposit formation, which gave the region its former name [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. 

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
Ancient rocks from the [[Paleoproterozoic]], [[Neoproterozoic]] and perhaps  early [[Paleozoic]] cover almost all of Ghana, except near the coast where [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] rocks are common. 

===Paleoproterozoic (2.5-1.6 billion years ago)===
[[Paleoproterozoic]] rock units belonging to [[Birimian]] Supergroup, common across West Africa, dominate northwest and southwest Ghana. The Birimian Supergroup has two units, one a succession of sedimentary rocks including [[phyllite]], [[tuff]] and [[greywacke]] overlain by [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[sandstone]] and [[shale]] and the other a volcanic [[tholeiitic magma series]]. Originally, geologists separated the units into the Lower Birimian and the Upper Birimian, but subsequent research found that the volcanic rocks form several hundred kilometer belts within the larger supergroup, with low-grade [[metamorphism]] of the tholeiitic lava rocks. 

The volcanic belts from north to south are the [[Lawra Belt]], [[Bole-Navrongo Belt]], [[Sefwi Belt]], [[Asankrangwa Belt]], [[Ashanti Belt]] and [[Kibi-Winiba Belt]]. Except for the Lawra Belt, they all trend northeast-southwest. Between the different belts are basins filled with [[dacite]], [[argillite]], volcaniclastic and [[granitoid]] rocks with [[isocline]] folding. At the transition between the basins and the volcanic belts are small outcrops of [[chert]], carbonates and manganese-rich sediments, which are inferred to be the exhalative remains of the eruptions that formed the volcanic belts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=116-117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volcanic and sedimentary rocks were folded during the [[Eburnean orogeny]] 2.2 to 2.0 billion years ago and intruded by granitoids. The orogeny also uplifted and eroded the rocks, filling a large [[graben]] with a folded [[molasse]] series of new sedimentary rocks, known as the [[Tarkwaian Group]]. Around the same time, the Birimian Supergroup was intruded again, this time by [[Cape Coast type]] [[batholith]] granites and [[granodiorite]], along with the [[Winneba type]] which has an [[Archean]] [[sial]] origin from the upper most layer of the mantle. Ghana also has a few other types of granites from this time period, including the [[Dixcove type]], which formed an unfoliated intrusion in the volcanic belt and the rare Bongo potassic granitoids, which formed after the Eburnean orogeny. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Eisenlohr &amp; Hirdes |year=1992|title=The structural development of the early Proterozoic Birimian and tarkwaian rocks of southwest Ghana, West Africa|publisher=Journal of African Earth Sciences|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089953629290035B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoproterozoic (1 billion-541 million years ago)===
In the [[Neoproterozoic]], Ghana was affected by the [[Pan-African orogeny]]. Today, the Pan-African mobile belt terrane spans eastern and southeastern Ghana, with several different units. The [[Dahomeyan System]] comprises both [[mafic]] and [[felsic]] [[gneiss]] while the [[Togo Series]] includes [[quartzite]], [[shale]] and small amounts of [[serpentinite]]. The [[Buem Group]] is a mix of sediments and igneous rocks, including shale, sandstone, [[basalt]], [[trachyte]] and volcanoclastic rocks. 

The [[Volta Basin]] formed during the Neoproterozoic and includes the one kilometer thick sandstones and claystones of the [[Bambouaka Supergroup]], which emplaced between 1.1 billion and 700 million years ago. In the Neoproterozoic, the [[Snowball Earth]] event led to widespread glaciation in what is now Africa. Glacial erosion created an [[unconformity]] between the Bambouaka Supergroup and the [[Pendjari Supergroup]] (also known as the Oti Supergroup), which in some cases is directly atop more ancient crystalline basement rock. The 2.5 kilometer thick, 600 to 700 million year old Pendjari Supergroup has [[tillite]] and dolomitic limestone, rich in [[barite]] and [[silixite]] at its base and siltstone and argillite in its upper layers. The third major unit in the Volta Basin is the [[Tamale Supergroup]], with a thickness of 500 meters, claystone and siltstone at its base, giving way to coarse sandstone. Geologists debate the age of the Tamale Supergroup which may have formed in the Late Neoproterozoic or possibly in the [[Cambrian]] of the [[Early Paleozoic]] era. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=116-117}}

===Phanerozoic (541 million years ago-present)===
The [[Phanerozoic]], the current eon in which multicellular life became commonplace is mainly recorded along the coast of Ghana. The [[Accraian Series]] deposited in the [[Early Devonian]] and [[Middle Devonian]] while the [[Sekondian Series]] formed between the Middle Devonian and the [[Early Cretaceous]], overlapping with the [[Late Jurassic]] to Early Cretaceous [[Amisian Group]]. The [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Apollonian Group]] is among the most recent rock units. The past 66 million years of the [[Cenozoic]] are mainly recorded with marine, lagoonal and riverine sedimentary rocks as well as with unconsolidated sediments that cover most of the country and form soils. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=116-117}}

==Hydrogeology==
The three major units of the Volta Basin are important aquifers in eastern Ghana with very low, if any, intergranular permeability. The middle and upper Pendjari Supergroup and [[Obosum Group]] sandstones, mudstones and siltstones typically have low mineralization, but contain some fluoride, while the deeper Bambouaka Supergroup rocks have generally high sulfate, iron and manganese concentrations and in some places fluoride and high salinity. Although generally impermeable, fractured rock aquifers in basement rocks cover most of southern and western Ghana with slight acidity, low salinity, low hardness and low iodine, but high fluoride. In some places in southwest Ghana, groundwater from weathered basement rock contains high levels of arsenic associated with gold in mineralized veins. 

Groundwater recharge is poorly studied in Ghana except for 15 monitored wells in the northeast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Ghana|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Ghana#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold plays an important role in the [[economy of Ghana]], with up to 1500 tons of gold produced throughout its history. Ghana has five major types of gold deposits. Native gold in steeply dipping quartz veins in shear zones at the margins of Birimian basins, [[arsenopyrite]] in sulfur bodies, disseminated mineralization in basin [[granitoid]] rocks and alluvial placer gold in river deposits in gravel are major sources of gold. In some cases, ancient placer gold has mineralized and reconstituted along wit other minerals such [[magnetite]] and [[hematite]] in the quartz-pebble conglomerates of the [[Tarkwaian Group]]. 

From the late [[15th century]] until the mid [[19th century]], two-thirds of Africa's gold production was estimated to have originated from the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].  Annual production in the early [[1980s]] was 12,000-15,000 kg.  The major primary gold [[lode]]s are found in the [[shear zone]] between the Lower Birimian [[phyllite]]s and Upper Birimian [[greenschist|greenstone]]s, and consist of [[quartz vein]]s and [[lenticular (geology)|lenticular]] reefs.  The gold is usually accompanied with [[arsenopyrite]].  Mines along the west side of the Tarkwa [[syncline]] include the [[Obuasi Gold Mine]], and those located at [[Prestea]] and [[Konongo, Ghana|Konongo]].  [[Sediment|Sedimentary]] gold is found in the Banket [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] near the base of the Tarkwaian.  This includes the [[Iduapriem Gold Mine]], [[Teberebie Mine]], and those located at Tarkwa, and Abosso, located along the eastern margin of the Tarkwa syncline.  Accompanying minerals include [[rutile]], [[zircon]], and [[detrital]] [[hematite]], all within [[gravel]] horizons.  [[Placer gold]] is mainly [[dredging|dredge mined]] along the [[Ofin River]] at [[Dunkwa-on-Offin]].  Additionally, [[eluvium]], [[beach sand]]s,  [[terrace (geology)|terraces]], and [[Pleistocene]] stream sediments contain [[alluvial]] gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=J.B. |last2=Hastings |first2=D.A. |last3=Jones |first3=W.B. |last4=Williams |first4=H.R. |editor1-last=Wright |editor1-first=J.B. |title=Geology and Mineral Resources of West Africa |date=1985 |publisher=George Allen &amp; UNWIN |location=London |isbn=9780045560011 |pages=45–47 |ref=gold}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Ryan |last2=Anderson |first2=Eric |title=Quartz-Pebble-Conglomerate Gold Deposits, Chapter P of Mineral Deposit Models for Resource Assessment, USGS Scientific Investigations Report 2010-5070-P |date=2018 |publisher=US Dept. of the Interior, USGS |location=Reston |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5070/p/sir20105070p.pdf |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant diamond deposits are found in river gravels in the central and eastern part of Ghana, although the country does not have [[kimberlite pipes]] where diamonds formed in the geologic past. [[Awaso]], in southwest Ghana hosts a [[bauxite]] mine run by the [[Ghana Bauxite Company]]. The bauxite formed from the weathering of [[Paleoproterozoic]]  [[phyllite]]. [[Nsuta]] in the [[Sekyere Central District]] of the [[Ashanti Region]] has a manganese oxide and carbonate mine. The country also has small, poorly researched deposits of [[asbestos]], [[chromite]], [[andalusite]], [[mica]], [[barite]], [[cassiterite]], [[columbite]], [[monazite]], [[beryl]], [[spodumene]] and [[molybdenite]]. It also has [[nepheline]] [[syenite]] and on-shore alluvial deposits of [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]]. 
Ghana has widespread quarrying of sand, gravel, [[kaolin]] and other clay deposits for road and building construction as well as brick production. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=118-119}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="805">The '''geology of the [[Maldives]]''' formed beginning 68 million years ago as a hotspot which produced the [[Deccan Traps]] in India. As India moved northward, the hotspot generated an island chain in the [[Indian Ocean]], which includes Mauritius and Reunion. The Reunion hotspot trail was offset by the Central Indian Ridge 35 million years ago. The hotspot theory is supported by the fact that the basement basalts underlying the atolls of the Maldives are younger in the south, toward Reunion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=534}}&lt;/ref &gt;

{{Other people|John Mason}}

Captain '''John Mason''' (1586–1635) was a sailor and colonizer born at [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and educated at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=M602J|name=Mason, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed the second [[Proprietary Governor]] of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]'s [[Cuper's Cove]] [[colony]] in 1615, succeeding [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]]. Mason arrived on the island in 1616 and explored much of the territory. He compiled a map of the island and wrote and published a short tract (or "Discourse") of his findings.

Mason drew up the first known English map of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Published in [[William Vaughan (Welsh writer and colonial investor)|William Vaughan]]'s Cambrensium Caroleia in 1625, the [https://www.mun.ca/rels/hrollmann/relsoc/texts/pics/map.gif map] included previously established placenames as well as new ones such as [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]] and Butter Pots, near [[Renews]]. His tract entitled [https://www.mun.ca/rels/hrollmann/relsoc/texts/mason.html ''A Briefe Discourse of the New-Found-Land with the situation, temperature, and commodities thereof, inciting our nation to go forward in the hopefull plantation begunne''{{dead link|date=October 2018}}], was published in 1620 by Mason while in England.

[[File:New Hampshire Historical Marker for John Mason.jpg|thumb|left|alt=TheNew Hampshire historical marker for Mason's Patent and named after John Mason.|The [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (26–50)|New Hampshire historical marker]] for Mason's Patent]]

In 1620 [[James I of England|King James I]]'s Privy Council issued Mason a commission and provided him with a ship to suppress [[piracy]] in Newfoundland. Mason ceased to be Cuper's Cove governor in 1621 and apparently he was not replaced, although the settlement continued to be occupied throughout the seventeenth century.

Upon returning to England, Mason consulted with Sir [[William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] about possibly colonizing [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1622, Mason and Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]] received a patent from the [[Council for New England]] for all the territory lying between the [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] and [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] rivers.&lt;ref name=burrage&gt;Burrage, Henry S. ''The Beginnings of Colonial Maine, 1602-1658''. Marks Printing House (1914), p. 166-67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1629 they divided the grant along the [[Piscataqua River]], with Mason receiving the southern portion.&lt;ref name=burrage/&gt; The colony was recharted as the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. It included most of the southeastern part of the current [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Hampshire]], as well as portions of present-day [[Massachusetts]] north of the Merrimack.

Although Mason never set foot in New England, he was appointed first vice-admiral of New England in 1635. He died that same year while preparing for his first voyage to the new colony.

'''Jutland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ʌ|t|l|ə|n|d}}; {{lang-da|Jylland}} {{IPA-da|ˈjylanˀ|}}; {{lang-de|Jütland}} {{IPA-de|ˈjyːtlant|}}), also known as the '''Cimbric''' or '''Cimbrian Peninsula''' ({{lang-la|Cimbricus Chersonesus}}; {{lang-da|Den Kimbriske Halvø}}; {{lang-de|Kimbrische Halbinsel}}), is a peninsula of [[Northern Europe]] that forms the continental portion of [[Denmark]] and part of northern [[Germany]]. The names are derived from the [[Jutes]] and the [[Cimbri]], respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, [[heath]]s, plains and [[peat]] [[bog]]s in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.

== Geography ==
[[File:Sandy cliff beach at North Sea, Denmark 2004 ubt.jpeg|thumb|left|Dunes on Jutland's northwest coast.]]
Jutland is a peninsula bounded by the [[North Sea]] to the west, the [[Skagerrak]] to the north, the [[Kattegat]] and [[Baltic Sea]] to the east and [[Germany]] to the south. Geographically and historically, Jutland comprises the regions of South Jutland, West Jutland, East Jutland (including [[Djursland]]) and North Jutland (including [[Himmerland]], [[Vendsyssel]] and [[Thy (district)|Thy]]). There are several historical subdivisions and regional names, some of which are still occasionally encountered today. They include ''Nørrejyllland'', ''Sydvestjylland'', ''Nordvestjylland'' and ''Slesvig''. Politically, Jutland currently comprises the three contemporary Danish Administrative Regions of [[North Denmark Region]], [[Central Denmark Region]] and the [[Region of Southern Denmark]], along with portions of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

In medieval times, Jutland was regulated by the [[Codex Holmiensis|Law Code of Jutland]] (''Jyske Lov''). This civic code covered the Danish part of the Jutland Peninsula, i.e. north of the [[Eider (river)]], [[Funen]] as well as [[Fehmarn]].

The Danish part of Jutland is currently divided into three administrative regions: [[North Denmark Region]], [[Central Denmark Region]] and [[Region of Southern Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The North Denmark Region|url=http://www.rn.dk/Service/English|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three regions have a total area of {{convert|29,775|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, a population of 2,599,104 (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/FT |title=Danmarks Statistikbank |publisher=Statistikbanken.dk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a population density of 84 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (218 per sq.mi.).

The northernmost part of Jutland is separated from the [[mainland]] by the [[Limfjord]], a narrow stretch of water bisecting the peninsula from coast to coast. The Limfjord was formerly a long brackish water inlet, but a breaching North Sea [[flood]] in 1825 created a coast to coast connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fishery Before the flood the land was connected to the west. History|url=http://www.museumsallingsund.dk/English/fisheryhistory/fisheryhistory.htm|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is called the [[North Jutlandic Island]], [[Vendsyssel]]-[[Thy (district)|Thy]] (after its districts) or simply ''Jutland north of the Limfjord''; it is only partly co-terminous with the [[North Denmark Region|North Jutland]] region.

The islands of [[Læsø]], [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]] and [[Samsø]] in [[Kattegat]] and [[Als (island)|Als]] at the rim of the [[Baltic Sea]] South are administratively and historically tied to Jutland although the latter two are also regarded as traditional districts of their own. Inhabitants of Als would agree to be South Jutlanders, but not necessarily Jutlanders.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Danish Wadden Sea Islands]] and the German [[North Frisian Islands]] stretch along the southwest coast of Jutland in the [[German Bight]].

=== Danish part ===
[[File:Hafen St Marien Flensburg2007.jpg|thumb|[[Flensburg]] has the largest [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] of any city in Germany.]]

The largest cities in the Danish section of Jutland are as follows:
#[[Aarhus]]
#[[Aalborg]]
#[[Esbjerg]]
#[[Randers]]
#[[Kolding]]
#[[Horsens]]
#[[Vejle]]
#[[Herning]]
#[[Silkeborg]]
#[[Fredericia]]

[[Aarhus]], [[Silkeborg]], [[Billund, Denmark|Billund]], [[Randers]], [[Kolding]], [[Horsens]], [[Vejle]], [[Fredericia]] and [[Haderslev]], along with a number of smaller towns, make up the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]].

Administratively, Danish Jutland comprises three of [[Regions of Denmark|Denmark's five regions]], namely the [[North Denmark Region|Region Nordjylland]], [[Central Denmark Region|Region Midtjylland]] and the western half of [[Region of Southern Denmark]], which includes [[Funen]]. The five administrative regions came into effect on 1 January 2007, following a structural reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regioner.dk/om+regionerne/strukturreform|title=Strukturreform|publisher=Danske Regioner|language=Danish|date=27 January 2014|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German part ===
{{Main|Schleswig-Holstein}}
[[File:KielerStadtzentrumLuftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|[[Kiel]] is the largest city on the German side of the Jutland Peninsula.]]

The southern third of the Jutland peninsula is made up of the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|Bundesland]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Schleswig-Holstein has two parts: the former duchies of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] (Danish fief) and [[Holstein]] (German fief), both of which have passed back and forth between Danish and German rulers several times. The last adjustment of the Danish–German border followed the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] in 1920 and resulted in Denmark's regaining [[Northern Schleswig]] ({{lang-da|Nordslesvig}} or more commonly today: ''Sønderjylland'').

The historical southern border of Jutland are areas south of Kiel, Husum and Rendsburg, but the river [[Eider (river)|Eider]] was the border between the former duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, as well as the historical border between the Danish and German realms from c. 850 to 1864. Although most of Schleswig-Holstein is geographically part of the Jutland peninsula, most German residents there would not identify themselves with Jutland or even as "Jutlanders", but rather with ''North Germany'' ({{lang-de|Norddeutschland}}) and Schleswig-Holstein, considering themselves ''Northern Germans'' ({{lang-de|Norddeutsche}}) and ''Schleswig-Holsteiner''.

The medieval law [[Code of Jutland]] applied to Schleswig until 1900 when it was replaced by the [[Prussia]]n [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code]]. Some rarely used clauses of the Jutlandic Code still apply north of the Eider, even some cities south of the river- all of Rendsburg and more than half of Kiel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The largest cities in the German part of Jutland or the Jutland Peninsula are [[Kiel]] and [[Flensburg]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Geology ==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[Geology|Geologically]] the [[Mid Jutland Region]] and the [[North Jutland Region]] as well as the [[Capital Region of Denmark#Overview|Capital Region of Denmark]] are located in the north of Denmark which is rising because of [[post-glacial rebound]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Denmark|History of Schleswig-Holstein}}
[[File:Cimbrians and Teutons.png|thumb|right|Military stratagem in the Maneuver against the Romans by [[Cimbri]] and Teutons circa 100 B.C.]]

Jutland has historically been one of the three [[lands of Denmark]], the other two being [[Scania]] and [[Zealand]]. Before that, according to [[Ptolemy]], Jutland or the ''Cimbric Chersonese'' was the home of [[Teutons]], [[Cimbri]] and [[Charudes]].

Many [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] migrated from [[Continental Europe]] to [[Great Britain]] starting in c. 450 AD. The Angles themselves gave their name to the new emerging kingdoms called England (i.e., "Angle-land").
 
[[Saxons]] and [[Frisii]] migrated to the region in the early part of the Christian era. To protect themselves from invasion by the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Franks|Frankish]] emperors, the Danes built the [[Danevirke]], a wall stretching across South Jutland from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]], beginning in the 8th century.

The [[paganism|pagan]] [[Saxons]] inhabited the southernmost part of the peninsula at the Baltic Sea until the [[Saxon Wars]] in 772-804 AD in the [[Iron Age Scandinavia|Nordic Iron Age]], when [[Charlemagne]] violently subdued them and forced them to be Christianised. [[Old Saxony]] was politically absorbed into the [[Carolingian Empire]] and [[Obotrites|Abodrites]] (or [[Obotrites]]), a group of [[Wends|Wendish]] [[Slavs]] who pledged allegiance to Charlemagne and who had for the most part [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]], was moved into the area to populate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nugent|first1=Thomas|title=The History of Vandalia, Vol. 1|date=1766|location=London|pages=165–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOw-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=obotrites+old+saxony+charlemagne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8TG-EKePri&amp;sig=UtWIvZCGfTkQPw03M7PksxMYsLk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd_PD1_q7RAhVqrVQKHX-7CEoQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=obotrites%20old%20saxony%20charlemagne&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Saxony was later on referred to as [[Holstein]].

To speed transit between the Baltic and the North Sea, canals have been built across the peninsula, notably the [[Eider Canal]] in the late 18th century and the [[Kiel Canal]], completed in 1895 and still in use.

=== Battle of Jutland ===
During the [[First World War]], the [[Battle of Jutland]] in the North Sea west of Jutland was one of the largest naval battles in history. In this pitched battle, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Navy]] engaged the [[Imperial German Navy]], leading to heavy casualties and losses of ships on both sides. The British fleet sustained greater losses, but remained in control of the North Sea, so in strategic terms, most historians regard Jutland either as a British victory or as indecisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/naval-warfare-and-world-war-one/the-battle-of-jutland/ |title=The Battle of Jutland |publisher=History Learning Site |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Dialect ===
{{Main|Jutlandic}}
{{See also|Danish language#Dialects}}

The distinctive [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish (or Jutlandic)]] [[dialect]]s differ substantially from standard [[Danish language|Danish]], especially West Jutlandic and South Jutlandic. Dialect usage, although in decline, is better preserved in Jutland than in eastern Denmark, and Jutlander speech remains a stereotype among many [[Copenhagen]]ers and eastern Danes.

===Literature===
Jutland native Maren Madsen emigrated to the American town of [[Yarmouth, Maine]], in the late 19th century. She wrote a memoir documenting the transition, titled ''From Jutland's Brown Heather to the Land Across the Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yarmouth history center to break ground in April |first=Kelley |last=Bouchard |newspaper=Portland Press Herald | date=March 2012| url = https://www.pressherald.com/2012/03/02/history-center-to-offer-journey-back-to-origins_2012-03-02/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Christian Christensen, with whom she had four children. Maren died in 1965, aged about 93. She and her family are all buried in [[Cumberland County, Maine]].

[[File:Rilke 05.jpg|thumb|The cliffs of [[Duino]] ({{lang-sl|Devin}}) and the gulf of [[Sistiana]], [[Province of Trieste]], [[Italy]], seen from the [[Rilke Trail]]]]
The '''Karst Plateau''' or the '''Karst region''' ({{lang-sl|Kras}}, {{lang-it|Carso}}), also locally called '''Karst''', is a [[Karst|karst plateau]] region extending across the border of southwestern [[Slovenia]] and northeastern [[Italy]].

It lies between the [[Vipava Valley]], the low hills surrounding the valley, the westernmost part of the [[Brkini Hills]], northern [[Istria]], and the [[Gulf of Trieste]]. The western edge of the plateau also marks the traditional ethnic border between [[Italians]] and [[Slovenes]]. The region gave its name to the [[karst topography]]. For this reason, it is also referred to as the ''Classical Karst''.

== Geographical position ==
[[File:Štanjel street.JPG|230px|thumb|left|Typical rural Karst houses in [[Štanjel]] (municipality of [[Komen]]), [[Slovenia]]]]
[[File:Type-locality Karst-mountains Slovenia.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Approximate extent of the Karst region]]

The plateau rises quite steeply above the neighboring landscape, except for its northeastern side, where the steepness is less pronounced. The plateau gradually descends from the southeast to the southwest. On average it lies 334 m above sea level. Its western edge, known as the [[Karst Rim]] ({{lang-sl|[[:sl:Kraški rob|Kraški rob]]}}), is a continuation of the [[Učka]] mountain range in eastern [[Istria]], and rises to the east and southeast of [[Trieste]], ending in steep cliffs between [[Aurisina]] and [[Duino]]. Many interesting geological phenomena occur along the Karst Rim, including the picturesque [[Val Rosandra|Rosandra Valley]] (also known as Glinščica).

Because the Karst steeply descends towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], it is less exposed to the beneficial climatological effects of the [[Mediterranean]]. In the past, the main vegetation on the plateau was [[oak]]s, but these were replaced by [[pine]] forests in the 19th and 20th centuries. [[Forest]]s now cover only one-third of the Karst. Starting the [[Middle Ages]], the plateau suffered radical deforestation for economic reasons. Although much of the wood for the closely spaced [[Deep foundation|piles]] that support the island city of [[Venice]], [[Italy]] came from this region, Venice carefully managed the Karst forests as a reserve for naval timber. The most radical deforestation occurred in the mid-nineteenth century due to clear-cutting by local farmers and conversion of the land into pastures for sheep.

The Karst is famous for its [[cave]]s. In Slovenia, they include [[Vilenica Cave]] (the oldest [[show cave]] in Europe), [[Lipica Cave]], [[Divača Cave]], [[Kačna Cave]], [[Postojna Cave]], and [[Škocjan Caves]] (a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]), and [[Grotta Gigante]] in Italy (the largest show cave in the world).

Most of the Karst is located in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], covering an area of 429 square kilometres, with a population of about 19,000 people. The Karst as a whole has exactly 100 settlements. The town of [[Sežana]] is the center of the region on the Slovene side of the border. The main rural centers are the settlements of [[Divača]], [[Dutovlje]], and [[Komen]]. [[Štanjel]] is a picturesque [[nucleated village|clustered settlement]] at the top of the northern rim of the [[plateau]]; its houses are tightly clustered around Turn Hill, giving it the appearance of a [[medieval]] town. On the Italian side of the border, important settlements include [[Opicina]], [[Duino]], and [[Aurisina]].

Natural conditions, including the [[Bora (wind)|bora]] ({{lang-sl|burja}}) wind, and the local way of life all shaped the elements of Karst [[architecture]], creating simple but well-defined forms. One of the main tourist centers in the area is [[Lipica, Sežana|Lipica]], with its [[stud farm]] (the home of the [[Lipizzan]] horse breed) as well as other tourist facilities.

== Language, culture and traditions ==
[[Image:Slovenian celebration in Basovizza in 2010.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Traditional Karst folk costumes in a Slovenian commemorative celebration in [[Basovizza]] near [[Trieste]]]]

The vast majority of the inhabitants of the Karst Plateau are ethnic [[Slovenes]]. Traditionally, only the village of San Martino del Carso (in the municipality of [[Sagrado]]), has been inhabited by [[Friulian language|Friulian]] speakers, while all the rest of the region was almost entirely Slovene-speaking from the Middle Ages till the late 1940s and 1950s, when [[Istrian Italians]] [[Istrian exodus|fleeing from Yugoslavia]] were settled in Karst villages in the Province of Trieste, especially in the municipality of [[Duino-Aurisina|Duino]]. As a consequence, today an estimated one fifth of the population of the Karst Plateau is Italian speaking, while the rest is mostly Slovene speaking.

The Slovenes in the region speak two closely related [[Slovene dialects]], both belonging to the [[Littoral dialect group]]. In the southern part of the plateau (in the municipality of [[Divača]], [[Hrpelje-Kozina]], the southern part of the [[Sežana]] municipality, in the Italian municipality of [[Monrupino]] and in most of the Slovene-speaking areas of the municipality of [[Trieste]]), the [[Inner Carniolan dialect]] is spoken. In the northern part (the northern part of the Sežana municipality, in the Slovenian municipalities of [[Komen]], [[Miren-Kostanjevica]], in the Italian municipalities of [[Sgonico]], [[Duino-Aurisina]] and [[Doberdò del Lago]], as well in some eastern suburbs of [[Trieste]], like [[Barcola]]), the [[Karst dialect]] is spoken.

The Karst is  renowned for its strong red [[wine]], known as [[Terrano (grape)|teran]], [[prosciutto]] and its traditional cuisine, which is a mixture of [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]]an cuisine. The traditionally produced [[Karst prosciutto]], a sort of [[dry-cured ham]], is [[Protected Geographical Status|protected at the European level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/zdaj-uradno-originalen-kraski-prsut-zasciten-v-eu.html |title=Zdaj uradno originalen: kraški pršut zaščiten v EU |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Now Officially Original: The Karst Prosciutto Protected in the EU |newspaper=Delo.si |date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent natives and residents ==
[[Image:Kraševci-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|230px|Karst peasants in an engraving from [[Johann Weikhard von Valvasor]]'s monograph ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', 17th century.]]

Prominent persons that were born or lived in this region include the poets [[Srečko Kosovel]], [[Igo Gruden]], [[Ciril Zlobec]] and [[Branka Jurca]], social activist [[Danilo Dolci]], architect [[Max Fabiani]], painters [[Avgust Černigoj]] and [[Lojze Spacal]], writers [[Alojz Rebula]], [[Igor Torkar]], and [[Bogomir Magajna]], theologian [[Anton Mahnič]], politicians [[Drago Marušič]], [[Josip Ferfolja]] and [[Majda Širca]], economist [[Milko Brezigar]], and actress [[Ita Rina]]. The picturesque Karst landscape inspired numerous artists who were not from this region, including the poets [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Alojz Gradnik]], and [[Edvard Kocbek]], essayists [[Scipio Slataper]] and [[Marjan Rožanc]], writers [[Italo Svevo]], [[Fulvio Tomizza]] and [[Susanna Tamaro]], and film director [[Jan Cvitkovič]]. Many artists and authors settled in the area, including [[Josip Osti]] and [[Taras Kermauner]].

[[File:KidronValleyFromOldCity.JPG|thumb|right|Kidron Valley viewed from the Old City of Jerusalem.]]

The '''Kidron Valley''' ([[Classics|classical]] transliteration, ''Cedron'', from {{lang-he-n|נחל קדרון}}, ''Naḥal Qidron'', literally Qidron River; also '''Qidron Valley'''; {{lang-ar|وادي الجوز}}, '''Wadi al-Joz''' for the upper segment near the [[Temple Mount]], and '''Wadi an-Nar''', 'Fire Valley',&lt;ref name="Maan"/&gt; for the rest of it) is the valley on the eastern side of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]], separating the Temple Mount from the [[Mount of Olives]]. It continues east through the [[Judean desert]] in the [[West Bank]], towards the [[Dead Sea]], descending {{convert|4000|ft|m}} along its {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} course. The ancient [[Mar Saba]] monastery is located in the lower part of the valley.

In its upper part, the neighborhood of [[Wadi al-Joz]] bears the valley's Arabic name.&lt;ref name="GoffartWalter"&gt;Goffart, Walter. After Rome's Fall. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] [[Kedar (town)|Kedar]], located on a ridge above the valley, is named after the valley's Hebrew name.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] calls the upper course ''Emek [[Jehoshaphat|Yehoshafat]]'', the "[[Valley of Josaphat]]". It appears in Jewish [[Eschatology|eschatologic]] prophecies, which include the return of [[Elijah]], followed by the arrival of the [[Messiah#Judaism|Messiah]], and the [[War of Gog and Magog]] and Judgment Day.&lt;ref name="GoffartWalter" /&gt;

[[File:Jewish gathering at Tomb of Zacharieh, Kebron.jpg|thumb|[[Dry plate]] photograph of Jews gathering at Absalom's Tomb in the Kidron Valley]]
The upper Kidron Valley holds Jerusalem's most important cemetery from the First Temple period, the [[Silwan necropolis]], assumed to have been used by the highest-ranking officials residing in the city, with rock-cut tombs dating between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name="Ussishkin70"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3148025/The_Necropolis_from_the_Time_of_the_Kingdom_of_Judah_at_Silwan_Jerusalem] The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper Kidron Valley segment north of the Old City was one of the main burial grounds of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period, where hundreds of tombs have survived until today, while the segment east of, and opposite the Temple Mount, boasts several excellently preserved monumental tombs from the same period.&lt;ref name="Hachlili"&gt;Hachlili, Rachel. [https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=ro&amp;id=8BgLu74SWbAC&amp;q=Qidron#v=onepage&amp;q=Kidron&amp;f=false  Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period]. Boston: Brill, Leiden, 2005. Pages 2, 30-36, 237-242.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Second Temple period tombs were also used later in time, either as burial or as shelters for hermits and monks of the large monastic communities which inhabited the Kidron Valley during the Byzantine period (4th-7th century).&lt;ref name="Hachlili"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Martin. Jews in a Graeco-Roman World. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient tombs in this area attracted the attention of ancient travelers, most notably [[Benjamin of Tudela]].&lt;ref name="AdlerMarcus"&gt;Adler, Marcus Nathan. The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela. London: Oxford University Press, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

A source of confusion is the fact that the modern name "Kidron Valley" (''Nahal Kidron'' in Hebrew) applies to the entire length of a long [[wadi]], which starts north of the Old City of Jerusalem and ends at the Dead Sea, while the biblical names ''Nahal Kidron'', ''Emek Yehoshafat'', ''King’s Valley'' etc. might refer to certain parts of this valley located in the immediate vicinity of ancient Jerusalem, but not to the entire wadi, and certainly not to the long segment crossing the Judean desert. Similarly, in Arabic every more substantial wadi has many names, each applied to a certain distinct segment of its course.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew name Qidron is derived from the root ''qadar'', "to be dark", and may be meant in this context as "dusky".&lt;ref name="Hub"&gt;{{cite web |title=Qidron |author= |work=[[Strong's Concordance]] and [[New American Standard Bible|NAS]] Exhaustive Concordance, via BibleHub.com |publisher= |url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/6939.htm |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian tradition the similarity between the Greek word for [[Cedrus|cedar]], κέδρος (''kedros''), and the Greek name of the valley as used in the [[Septuagint]], Kedron, has led to the Qidron Valley being wrongly called "Valley of the Cedars".&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to John |author=[[D. A. Carson]] |year=1991 |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|Eerdmans Publishing]] |page=576 |isbn=9780851117492 |quote= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBRuo3LHyS4C&amp;pg=PA576&amp;lpg=PA576&amp;dq=Kedron+Valley+cedars&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ld779nePRT&amp;sig=JqYpamUMQZBfsoRNv3CgChDoGyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3rp_DiMjXAhWJ0xoKHYApDi4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kedron%20Valley%20cedars&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification with biblical locations==
===Valley of Jehoshaphat===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] talks of the "[[Valley of Jehoshaphat]] - Emek Yehoshafat" ({{lang-he|עמק יהושפט}}), meaning "The valley where Yahweh shall judge." It should be noted that not all scholars agree with the traditional view that the Kidron Valley, as the valley situated between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives to the east, is the location of the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Kidron Valley was not associated with the Valley of Jehoshaphat until the 4th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://classic.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T5301 |title=Kidron, the Brook | website=StudyLight.org |publisher= International Standard Bible Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; making this identification somewhat uncertain since no actual valley of this name is known to pre-Christian antiquity.

Biblical commentator Adam Clarke claims that the Valley of Judgment is a symbolic place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.godrules.net/library/clarke/clarkejoe3.htm |title=Adam Clarke's Bible Commentary - Joel 3 |website=www.godrules.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King's Garden and King's Valley===
In the times of the [[Old Testament]] kings, the Kidron Valley was identified with, at least in part, the King's Garden; the kings owned land in the area.&lt;ref name="AdlerMarcus" /&gt; That the upper Kidron Valley was also known as the King's Valley, in which Absalom set up his monument or "pillar" (see {{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 18:18}}; no connection to the much later "[[Tomb of Absalom|Absalom's Pillar]]"), is problematic. The Bible does not make this identification explicit, and the association can only be inferred as associated with En-rogel, which is farther down the Kidron Valley towards the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Kloner, Amos, and Boaz Zissu. The Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period. Leuven: Peeters, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name 'King’s Valley' may be derived from its location just east of the palace of David in the City of David on the western slopes of the Kidron Valley and south of where the platform was built.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, Adolf, trans. and ed. The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Vol. 1, Text, Bibliography, and Translation; vol 2, Note and Essays. New York: Hakesheth Publishing Co., 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental tombs==
[[File:Bnei Hazir tomb and Tomb of Zechariah2.JPG|thumb|Bnei Hazir Tomb and Tomb of Zechariah]]
[[File:אמק יהושפט עם יד אבשלום The valley of Yehoshafat with the Tomb of Absalom.jpg|thumb|The so-called "Tomb of Absalom" in Kidron Valley]]
The three monumental tombs on the eastern side of the Kidron Valley are among the most well-known landmarks of ancient Jerusalem. These are, from north to south, the so-called "[[Tomb of Absalom]]" (Hebrew: Yad Avshalom), which rises in front of the so-called "Cave" or "Tomb of Jehoshaphat", the (correctly named) [[Tomb of Benei Hezir]] (''Benei Hezir'' is the Hebrew for "sons of Hezir", meaning the Hezir priestly family ), and the so-called "[[Tomb of Zechariah]]", which could quite likely be the ''[[nefesh]]'' of the Tomb of Benei Hezir.

Absalom's Tomb consists of two parts. First, a lower cube hewn out of the bedrock, decorated with engaged Ionic columns bearing a Doric frieze and crowned by an Egyptian cornice.&lt;ref name="Hachlili" /&gt; This part of the monument contains a small chamber with an entrance and two [[arcosolium|arcosolia]] (arched funeral niches) and constitutes the actual tomb.&lt;ref name="Hachlili" /&gt; The second part, built of ashlars, is placed on top of the rock-hewn cube. It consists of a square pedestal carrying a round drum, itself topped by a conical roof. The cone is slightly concave and is crowned by an Egyptian-style lotus flower. The upper part has the general shape of a ''[[Tholos (architecture)|tholos]]''&lt;ref name="GoffartWalter" /&gt; and is interpreted as a ''[[nefesh]]'' or monument for the tomb below, and possibly also for the adjacent "Cave of Jehoshaphat". The "Pillar of Absalom" is dated to the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Hachlili" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Finegan" /&gt;

Literally, the word ''[[nefesh]]'' means 'soul', but in a funerary context it is the term applied to a form of funerary monument. In descriptions of the tombs of the Jewish nobility, the pyramid shape is also emphasized as the mark of a tomb. This would imply that ''nefesh'' and pyramid were synonymous. The Jewish tombs in the Kidron Valley are the best examples of this form of ''nefesh''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Shaye J. D. From the Maccabees to the Mishnah. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; They appear as a rectangular, pyramid-capped monument. Similar forms of the nefesh decorate ossuaries, with the addition of a dome-capped column. In Jerusalem the ''nefesh'' as a tomb monument stood either above or beside the tomb; set on steps or on a base.&lt;ref name="Finegan"&gt;Finegan, J. The Archeology of the New Testament. Princeton, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural significance==
===Hebrew Bible===
It was in this valley where King Jehoshaphat is thought to have overthrown the enemies of Israel ({{Bibleref2|2 Chr. 20:26}}).

[[King David]] fled through the Kidron Valley during the rebellion of [[Absalom]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 15:23}}).&lt;ref name="advent"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03475c.htm |title=Brook of Cedron |website= www.newadvent.org |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 29, 30 and 31 of 2 Chronicles ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 29-31}}) cover King Hezekiah's call for the sanctification of the ministers of the Lord, the purification of unclean things, an invitation to all Israel and Judah to celebrate Passover in Jerusalem, and liturgical reforms. During the reforms of King [[Hezekiah]] around 700 BCE, as part of the [[Ritual purification#Judaism|ritual cleaning]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the [[Kohen|priests]] removed the unclean items from the inner part of the Temple to the courts, and the [[Levites]] carried the unclean items to Wadi Kidron ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 29:16}}).

====Kidron Valley in Jewish eschatology====
The Book of Joel mentions that God will assemble all nations in the "Valley of Jehoshaphat" ({{Bibleref2|Joel 3:2}}, {{Bibleref2|Joel 3:12}}).

===Gospels===
According to the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] crossed the valley many times travelling between Jerusalem and [[Bethany (Jerusalem)|Bethany]].&lt;ref name="advent"/&gt; The valley contains the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], where Jesus prayed the night before he was executed.

====The Akeldama Tombs====
The Akeldma Tombs were discovered in 1989 at theconfluence of the Kidron and Hinnom Valleys, south of Jerusalem's Old City, and were excavated and published by archaeologists [[Gideon Avni]] and [[Zvi Greenhut]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Avni and Zvi Greenhut, [http://www.centuryone.com/9789654060189.html  The Akeldama Tombs: Three Burial Caves in the Kidron Valley, Jerusalem]. Israel Antiquities Authority, 1996, {{ISBN|9789654060189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the [[Jerusalem Municipality]] conducted routine development work in the area. Upon widening a narrow street near one of the approaches to the [[Silwan]] village, bulldozers uncovered a number of square openings hewn into rock. The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] immediately stopped the road construction. After uncovering the underground spaces, archaeologists found themselves standing inside large burial complexes which appeared intact. Moving carefully from one chamber to another, flashlights revealed an abundance of artifacts scattered on the floors, pottery and glass vessels, oil lamps and many ornamental [[ossuary|ossuaries]]. The three large caves proved to be part of an extensive Jewish burial ground in use at the end of the Second Temple period, which terminated in the year 70 AD, when Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed by the Roman legions.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Yizhar.

As of 2010, there is a controversial proposal to reconstruct part of the valley at Wadi Hilweh, a Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan in [[East Jerusalem]], and turn it into a park to be called the [[King's Garden (Jerusalem)|Garden of the King]].&lt;ref name=Selig&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=168833|title=Gan Hamelech residents wary of Barkat’s redevelopment plan|first=Abe| last=Selig|date=February 16, 2010|newspaper=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower course===
A road crossing the very steep valley of Wadi an-Nar and connecting Palestinian towns has been substantially upgraded as part of the USAID effort to modernise the Palestinian infrastructure. An existing road has been widened and re-paved, and efforts were made to improve the route it takes.&lt;ref name="Maan"&gt;Land owners angered over new West Bank road plan.

'''Lianjiang''' ({{zh|t=連江 |s=连江 |p=Liánjiāng |w=Lien²-chiang¹}}; [[Foochow Romanized|BUC]]: Lièng-gŏng) is a suburban [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]] of [[Fuzhou]] on the eastern coast of [[Fujian]] province, People's Republic of China. Most of the county is controlled by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), while a number of outlying [[island]]s, collectively referred to as the [[Matsu Islands]], are administered as a separate '''[[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]]''' (same Chinese name but in Wade–Giles Romanization) by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), based in [[Taiwan]] since 1949. As a result, the county has two governments governing separate jurisdictions.

See [[Matsu Islands]] for a description of ROC-governed Lienchiang County.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;In the ROC, 鎮 (镇, ''zhen'') is englished as '''''[[Political divisions of the Republic of China|Township]]''''' and 鄉 (乡, ''xiang'') as '''''[[Political divisions of the Republic of China|Rural Township]]'''''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These townships are divided into 266 villages.

==History==
Lianjiang, in 282, during the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]], was Wenma, named after a shipyard there, Wensha Ship-hamlet (溫麻船屯). It was incorporated into Min Prefecture (閩縣) in 607, during the [[Sui Dynasty]].

Wenma was changed to the present name and made its own county during in 623, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], when Baisha (白沙) or Fusha (伏沙) of Aojiang was the capital of Lianjiang County. The capital was changed to Fengcheng as today in 742.

After the [[Republic of China]] was established, Lianjiang switched back and forth numerous times between two special regions:
* Minhou Special Region (閩侯專區) (total 18 years)
* Fu'an (Ningde) Special Region (福安（寧德）專區) (total 16 years)

In 1949, the county was split in two due to the [[Chinese Civil War]], as it remains today.

Beginning on 1 July 1983, the PRC side reverted control to [[Fuzhou|Fuzhou Municipality]].

==Culture==
Residents of Lianjiang, both mainland and Matsu speak Lianjiang dialect, a subdialect of [[Fuzhou dialect]], a branch of [[Eastern Min Language|Eastern Min]]. The dialect is also known as '''Bàng-uâ''' (平話).

=== Language ===
The Lianjiang dialect is a subdialect of [[Fuzhou dialect]] (the most prestigious dialect of [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cdo Min Dong] or [[Eastern Min Language|Eastern Min]]). The Lianjiang dialect is mutually intelligible with Fuzhou dialect. It differs from Fuzhou dialect in its tonal sandhi pattern and vowel sandhi system. Small lexical differences also exist on object names, e.g. waxmelon is called "卷瓜" /kuoŋ˨ŋua˦/ in Fuzhou but "冬瓜" /tøyŋ˦ŋua˦/in Lianjiang.

Generally speaking, the tonal sandhi system of Lianjiang is more conservative than that of Fuzhou, in that the Lianjiang tonal sandhi is still largely controlled by the [[Middle Chinese]] tonal registers,&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J., &amp; Chen, Y. (2012). The Effect of Historical Tone Categories on Tone Sandhi in Lianjiang. Paper presented at the 20th Annual Conference of the IACL, Hongkong.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271849974_The_Effect_of_Historical_Tone_Categories_on_Tone_Sandhi_in_Lianjiang&lt;/ref&gt; while the Fuzhou tonal sandhi shows more deviation and irregularity.

Lianjiang vowel sandhi is more complicated than that of Fuzhou. Both Lianjiang and Fuzhou have systematic vowel variations between citation forms and non-final forms of the same morpheme, e.g. "地"/tei/ "land" - "地主"/'''ti'''-tsuo/ "landlord". However, not all morphemes have such variations. Only the morphemes with low-starting tones show such variation. The morphemes with high-starting tones instead only have the more close variant, e.g. "迟"/ti/ "late"- "迟早" /'''ti''' tsia/ "early or late".&lt;ref&gt;Wu,J., &amp; Chen, Y. (in prep.) Lianjiang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;冯爱珍, &amp; 李荣. (Eds.). (1998) 福州方言词典. 江苏教育出版社. {{ISBN|7534334217}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some [[cognate]]s are produced with different vowels in Lianjiang and Fuzhou, e.g. "江 river" is produced as /kyeŋ/ in Lianjiang, but /kouŋ/ in Fuzhou. Also, the rimes in Lianjiang are generally more close and front than that in Fuzhou, which is especially salient in the open vowels, e.g. "下 down" is [ɑ] in Fuzhou, but [a] in Lianjiang.&lt;ref&gt;Wu,J., &amp; Chen, Y. (in prep.) Lianjiang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounded by mountains, Lianjiang used to be a relatively isolated from the inland part of China for centuries. This explains why the Lianjiang phonological system is relatively more conservative. However, with the construction of the high-speed railway system &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaotie.cn/lianjiangzhan/&lt;/ref&gt; and the improvement of tunnel system, northern migrants are flooding into Lianjiang in the past decade, which may bring language contact into perspective. Just like in Fuzhou, most young or middle-aged Lianjiang speakers speak [[Standard Chinese]] fluently, but usually with a local accent influenced by the local dialect. However, due to the misleading language policy (Not speaking Standard Chinese is taken as "immoral".) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fjfqsz.com/Article_Print.asp?ArticleID=1301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206204915/http://www.fjfqsz.com/Article_Print.asp?ArticleID=1301 |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and disadvantageous status of the dialect, both Fuzhou and Lianjiang dialects are losing speakers in the youngest generation. More and more young people and children are only receptive bilinguals in Lianjiang.&lt;ref&gt;Wu,J., &amp; Chen, Y. (in prep.) Lianjiang.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Food products:
* Farm: [[loquat]]s, [[rice]], [[sweet potato]], [[bean]], [[cotton]], [[sugar cane]], [[tea plant]], [[jasmine]], [[watermelon]], [[mushroom]], [[grapes]].
* Sea: [[rhubarb]], [[hairtail]],  [[shad]],  [[pomfret (fish)|pomfret]],  [[cuttlefish]],  [[garoupa]],  [[prawn]],  [[crab]],  [[clam]], [[mudskipper]]s.
* Other: Yuanhong wine ("元紅")

==Transportation==
Luochang Express Way runs through the county
104 national Highway in {{Convert|500.3|km|mi}}. {{Convert|42.6|km|mi|adj=on}} navigable river length.

Guantou and Kemen (可門) are the largest seaports in Lianjiang with national access.

==Tourism==
There are [[hot spring]]s in Gui'an (貴安) and Tanghui (湯尾) of Pandu. There is a [[Dragon King]] Palace-Temple (龍宮廟) in the Xiaocang She Nationality Rural Township.

 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|2|20|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary=A couple of months have passed, and Gary reluctantly travels back in time again to try another investment scheme. He goes into a bank in 1941 and meets a bank manager named Mainwaring and Wilson, his chief clerk, both of whom are in the Home Guard. When he hears the names Mainwaring and Wilson, Gary begins singing the ''[[Dad's Army]]'' theme song. Back in 1941, he finds that Reg is off the force and Eric has died in an air-raid bombing — and that a much more hardened and cynical Phoebe is running the Royal Oak.

 |Title=Pennies from Heaven
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|3|23|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary=Gary desperately needs more wartime five pound notes, but Mrs. Flanagan, Ron's employer at the printing works, won't let the staff do private work in company time. Ron gets Gary to go on a 'date' with Mrs Flanagan to get her out of the way for a few hours so that he and other employees can do some private printing. When Gary and Flanagan return, they find the police have raided the printing works and Ron is arrested for counterfeiting wartime £5 notes. However, this turns out not to be an offense and he is released, but, since he has spilled the beans on the reason why he was printing the obsolete currency, is required to see a psychiatrist.

Back in 1944, Gary had been trying to raise local currency by using his knowledge of the results of races to win money from an illegal bookmaker. However, the bookmaker appears to have been cheating by reporting the wrong results. During the melee that resulted from Gary's remonstrations with the bookmaker, Reg is hit on the head, reducing his IQ to the level it had been before he was hit on the head when the bomb in Duckett's passage went off.

 |ShortSummary=Gary is very unsettled after his French adventure, and he feels like he's losing his mind: he can't tell whether he's awake or asleep, dreaming or experiencing reality. Then [[Rolf Harris]] appears in one of his dreams, while Gary is playing and singing ''[[Two Little Boys]]''. Anachronistically, the song was in fact written in 1902 and was quite popular at the time, before it had a resurgence in 1969 when Harris released the single.

In Gary's dreams, Yvonne and Phoebe come together (with Ron and, briefly, Reg) and deliberately make him feel guilty about how he has been using them all.

 |ShortSummary=Yvonne is signing copies of her just published autobiography. Meanwhile, Gary finds out from the porter in the 1990s that the owner of his 1940s West End flat is going to be killed in a road accident – what is he to do? Discovering Reg Deadman is still alive in the 90s visits the elderly Reg to get information. Reg at first recognizes Gary, but his memory is shot and is of no help in solving the mystery. In desperation, Gary moves the family out of the apartment and the real estate agent moves in rent-free. Gary feels guilty about having set him up to be killed and goes back to 1944 to warn him about the accident. During the discussion, they hear the sound of an accident, and it turns out to have been the person living in number 16 not number 15 who was killed. In the background, Gary is supposed to be attending Margie's 40th birthday party in 1944 while simultaneously staying in the Ritz for an amorous evening with Yvonne.

The pathologically evil replicate begins causing a stir, yet it seems Yvonne and Ron prefer Gary's alter ego. The alter ego first ties Gary up, but the original Gary gets free and hunts him down, taking a shot at him in ''The Royal Oak''. The evil one fools Ron into believing that it is the real Gary who is the twin and the two capture the real Gary, and the evil one is about to shoot him when a third Gary shows up. This is the ''really'' good and selfless Gary. The evil one is overcome by Ron and the Garys are reunited when they pass through the time portal together.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Palau'''. The avifauna of [[Palau]] include a total of 149 species, of which ten are [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], three have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and seventeen are rare or accidental. Three species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Palau.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Palau
*(E) '''[[Endemic]]''' - a species endemic to Palau
*(I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species introduced to Palau as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kites]], [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]] and [[Old World vulture]]s. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.

*[[Black kite]], ''Milvus migrans'' (A)
*[[Brahminy kite]], ''Haliastur indus'' (A)
*[[Chinese goshawk]], ''Accipiter soloensis''

==Falcons==
'''Order''': [[Falconiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Falconidae]]

Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.

*[[Peregrine falcon]], ''Falco peregrinus''

==Megapodes==
'''Order''': [[Galliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Megapodiidae]]

The Megapodiidae are stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet. All but the [[malleefowl]] occupy jungle habitats and most have brown or black colouring.

*[[Micronesian scrubfowl]], ''Megapodius laperouse''

==Pheasants and partridges==
'''Order''': [[Galliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phasianidae]]

The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of [[quail]]s, [[partridge]]s, [[snowcock]]s, [[francolin]]s, [[spurfowl]]s, [[tragopan]]s, [[monal]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[peafowl]]s and [[jungle fowl]]s. In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings.

==Rails, crakes, gallinules and coots==
'''Order''': [[Gruiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Rallidae]]

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the [[Rail (bird)|rails]], [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s and [[Rallidae|gallinule]]s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

*[[Red-legged crake]], ''Rallina fasciata'' (A)
*[[Slaty-legged crake]], ''Rallina eurizonoides''
*[[Buff-banded rail]], ''Gallirallus philippensis''
*[[Plain bush-hen]], ''Amaurornis olivaceus'' (A)
*[[White-browed crake]], ''Porzana cinerea''
*[[Watercock]], ''Gallicrex cinerea'' (A)
*[[Australasian swamphen]], ''Porphyrio melanotus''
*[[Common moorhen]], ''Gallinula chloropus''

==Avocets and stilts==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Recurvirostridae]]

Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the [[avocet]]s and [[stilt]]s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.

*[[Black-winged stilt]], ''Himantopus himantopus''

==Pratincoles and coursers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Glareolidae]]

Glareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the [[pratincole]]s, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the [[courser]]s, which have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards.

*[[Oriental pratincole]], ''Glareola maldivarum''

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[Red-kneed dotterel]], ''Erythrogonys cinctus'' (A)
*[[Pacific golden-plover]], ''Pluvialis fulva''
*[[Black-bellied plover]], ''Pluvialis squatarola''
*[[Common ringed plover]], ''Charadrius hiaticula''
*[[Little ringed plover]], ''Charadrius dubius''
*[[Snowy plover]], ''Charadrius alexandrinus''
*[[Lesser sandplover]], ''Charadrius mongolus''
*[[Greater sandplover]], ''Charadrius leschenaultii''
*[[Oriental plover]], ''Charadrius veredus''

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Swinhoe's snipe]], ''Gallinago megala''
*[[Black-tailed godwit]], ''Limosa limosa''
*[[Bar-tailed godwit]], ''Limosa lapponica''
*[[Little curlew]], ''Numenius minutus''

[[File:Pico Duarte.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Pico Duarte]] is the highest point in the [[Dominican Republic]], the [[Island of Hispaniola]], and the entire [[Caribbean]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Caribbean#Island groups|islands]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 20 highest major summits of the Caribbean by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 20 most prominent summits of the Caribbean.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 20 most isolated major summits of the Caribbean.

__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the 20 highest major summits of the Caribbean, only Pico Duarte exceeds {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, six peaks exceed {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 15 peaks exceed {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

Of these 20 peaks, three are located in the Dominican Republic, three in Cuba, two in Haiti, two in Saint Kitts and Nevis, one each in Jamaica, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Montserrat, and Venezuela.

The [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] of the British [[East India Company]] (EIC) passed many places and stopped at many ports on their voyages from Britain to India and China in the 17th to 19th centuries, both on the way and as destinations. Some of these places were simply landmarks, but a number of the places were the locations of EIC [[Factory (trading post)|factories]], i.e., trading posts.

In many cases the spelling of the names of these locations has changed between then and now. One purpose of this list is to link, where possible, the names as given in ships' logs with the modern name. Names in ''italics'' represent cases where the modern and older name are different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3778">The name "'''Miramichi'''" was first applied to a region in the northeast of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]], and has since been applied to other places in Canada and the United States. Although other interpretations have been suggested, it is believed that "Miramichi" was derived from the [[Innu language|Montagnais]] words "Maissimeu Assi" (meaning [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] Land), and was perhaps introduced for use in [[European languages]] by [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1535.&lt;ref&gt;Rayburn, A.

The '''Musgrave Block''' (also known as the Musgrave Province)  is an east-west trending belt of [[Proterozoic]] [[granulite]]-[[gneiss]] basement rocks approximately {{convert|500|km|mi}} long. The Musgrave Block extends from western [[South Australia]] into Western Australia.

The Musgrave Block is primarily exposed through the actions of the [[Petermann Orogeny]] at c. 535-550 Ma, which exhumed the [[orogeny|orogenic belt]] along the Woodroffe Thrust.

== Geomorphology of Quaternary deposits ==
The Musgrave Block is currently passive geologically, with surficial processes described as residual erosion. The area currently experiences on average less than 150mm (6 inches) of rainfall per annum, which provides little surface runoff and hence virtually no erosion. 

The landforms of the area are primarily composed of wide [[calcrete]] plains, often covered by [[Pleistocene]] Age [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] deposits of sand dunes, sometimes reworked into ephemeral sheetwash fans. Outcrop is rare, restricted primarily to the igneous rocks of the [[Giles Complex]] and several [[granite dome]]s, gneiss domes and isolated outcrops.

This area is also a distinct physiographic province of the larger [[Australian Shield|West Australian Shield]].

==Palaeozoic rocks==
Several Palaeozoic to neoproterozoic sedimentary basins onlap the Musgrave Block, and are exposed mostly around its edges. These were derived from erosion of the Musgrave Block basement during the neoproterozoic to Permian.

==Proterozoic basement==
The Proterozoic of the Musgrave Block is composed of seven main classes of rocks;
* Surficial volcanics of c.1050 to 1080 Ma, both mafic (Mummawarrawarra Basalt) and andesitic to rhyolitic (Tollu, Smoke Hill Volcanics) and the Bentley Supergroup volcanics and sediments of c. 1080 Ma
* Large intrusive caldera type granite intrusive complexes (Palgrave, Skirmish Hill, Smoke Hill), possibly of c. 1050 and likely no older than 1080 Ma
* Partly metamorphosed, rarely dissected c. 1080 Ma granite
* Usually unmetamorphosed, rarely dissected granites of a c. 1050 [[intrusive suite]]
* Partly metamorphosed, dissected intrusive rocks of the mafic-ultramafic c. 1080 Ma Giles Complex
* Highly metamorphosed metagranites of the c. 1200 Ma suite
* High-grade crystalline metamorphic basement rocks of c. 1550-1300 Ma age

The Musgrave Block is flanked by several [[Proterozoic]] to [[Palaeozoic]] sedimentary basins, whose sedimentary history can elucidate the timing of tectonic events in the Musgrave Block post-1080 Ma. These include the Proterozoic [[Amadeus Basin|Amadeus]] and [[Officer Basin]]s.

==Events==
The most illustrating way of considering the Musgrave Block is as part of a time-space plot in which geological events are arrayed in time against rock units, stratigraphic relationships and for correlative purposes. 

The key events in the Musgrave Block are;
* Protolith formation ~1550 Ma. Formation of crustal rocks of the Birksgate Complex, which are both mafic and felsic in composition.
* Igneous event and orogeny ~1300 Ma inferred from geochronology and distribution of felsic “volcanic” [[supracrustal sequence]] of the high grade gneisses&lt;ref&gt;White, Clarke, Nelson, 1999, SHRIMP U–Pb zircon dating of Grenville-age events in the western part of the Musgrave Block, central Australia, 17(5), 465-481&lt;/ref&gt;
* Musgravian orogeny at ~1200 Ma including generation of voluminous Kulgera Suite of [[granite]]s and metamorphosis of the Birksgate Complex and ~1300 supracrustal sequence to [[amphibolite]]-[[granulite]] facies
* Warakurna [[Large igneous province]] at 1076 ± 6 Ma including the intrusion of the [[Giles Complex]] and the Winburn Suite of granites, plus deposition of the Bentley Supergroup (including Tollu and Smoke Hill Volcanics)
* Amata Dyke Suite at ~830-880 Ma
* [[Petermann Orogeny]], 535-550 Ma; marginal foreland basin formation, trending to crustal consolidation and quiescence
* [[Permian]] glaciation and erosion of Petermann Orogeny mountains; deposition of Permian sequences in Officer and Amadeus basins
* Intracontinental setting till present

==Granites and calderas==
There are three main phases of [[granite]] intrusion into the Musgrave Block;
* Kulgera Suite at 1200 Ma
* At ~1080Ma synchronous with the [[Giles Complex]]
* Winburn Suite at ~1050Ma postdating the Giles Complex.

The Kulgera Suite is a widespread, voluminous suite of fractionated amphibole-bearing plagioclase rich tonalite to granodiorites of an I-type affinity (Stewart, 2003). They are dated at ~1200 Ma and are considered to be related to melting of the lower crust during the ~1200 Ma Musgravian Orogeny.  
The Windburn Suite is considered to be an [[anorogenic magmatism|anorogenic]] A-type granite suite produced by [[anatexis]] of the lower crust at ~1080 to 1050 Ma by the injection of the mafic Giles Complex intrusions. They are in most cases poorly fractionated, biotite-muscovite granites, with little hornblende, a high radiometric count and the presence of fluorine. The 1080 Ma granites and 1050 Ma granites can be distinguished on geochemical grounds, the latter is perhaps created by th above process, and the earlier suite a hybrid between A-type and I-type granites formed by assimilation and mixing. 

There are also significant granite caldera complexes, of many hundred square kilometres in area, which intrude the Musgrave Block. These are of the ~1050 Ma age, and are [[subvolcanic rock|subvolcanic]], possibly related to some of the ~1050 Ma volcanic rocks.

===Palgrave Volcanic Association===
The Palgrave Palgrave Volcanic Association is a large volcanic and granite caldera edifice of about 1500 square kilometres sandwiched between the Jameson Range Intrusion and the gneisses underlying the Bentley Supergroup volcanics. 

The caldera is in two parts, an overlying volcanic edifice composed primarily of porphyritic rhyolite and dacite with occasional vent complex agglomerates, which shows prominent circular ring-complex faults, and the Winburn Granite which underlies the caldera and is primarily exposed in the east as a pink, potassium-feldspathic porphyry granite, the lower margins of which are weakly tectonised.

The whole caldera edifice is tilted to the southwest, which is why the Winburn Granite is exposed along the east and northeast.

===Skirmish Hill Caldera===
The Skirmish Hill Caldera is poorly exposed along the southern margin of the Musgrave Block and consists of granite and overlying? rhyolite. It has been traditionally seen as a potential source for the Tollu Volcanics.

The caldera is truncated on the north by a north-dipping thrust fault and is probably tilted to the south.

===Other calderas===
Several other prominent gravity and magnetic highs are arranged along the Mugrave Block strike line, one of which was drilled by [[BHP Billiton|BHP]] in the 1990s through 300m of Permian glacial sediments. 

This caldera is composed of highly tectonised, stretched felsic volcanic rocks, interleaved with a significant thickness of equally sheared titaniferous differentiated mafic [[sill (geology)|sills]]. The best interpretation of this, and probably also of the Palgrave Caldera is that they represent hot spots along the Musgrave Block where significant magma flux penetrated, formed volcanic calderas with large subvolcanic granite intrusions, and associated mafic volcanism. 

The relationship of the large granite calderas to the 1050-1080 Ma volcanics has been postulated as one in which the granite calderas were the source for the intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks.

==Bentley Supergroup==
The Bentley Supergroup Volcanics are a sequence of bimodal supracrustal volcanic rocks formed during the ~1080 Warakurna Large Igneous Province, and are widely considered comagmatic with the [[ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions|mafic to ultramafic]] [[Giles Complex]] intrusions. 

The Bentley Supergroup is composed primarily of [[bimodal volcanism]], with several hundred-metres thicknesses each of alternating [[rhyolite]] and [[basalt]]ic volcanism adding up to several kilometres true thickness in the area of the Warburton Range to the southwest of the Palgrave caldera. The Bentley Supergroup is divided into the Cassidy Group, Pussycat Group and Tollu Group. 

The prevailing theory of the formation of the Bentley Supergroup is that the Warakurna Large Igneous Province, primarily represented by the Giles Complex intruding into the lower crust, breached the crust and erupted voluminous basaltic lava flows, and when enough heat had been added to the crust by the massive intrusions below, intracrustal felsic and intermediate melts were produced, forming A-type intracontinental granites of the Winburn Suite, and the felsic volcanic rocks. 

This created the typical bimodal volcanic signature of the Cassidy Group and Pussycat Groups; the Tollu Group is a bit different, and it is considered the product of the large granite calderas which were formed immediately after the Giles Complex mamatism.
Giles (1980) and earlier mappers have assigned the MacDougall Formation, overlying Mummawarrawarra Basalt, intermediate Smoke Hill Volcanics and the Tollu Volcanics to the Bentley Supergroup.  

There has been little real study done on the Bentley Supergroup Volcanics since the 1960s. Geochemical and petrological observations are few and far between or lacking comprehensive rare earth and trace elements suites. The Bentley Supergoup is poorly exposed in South Australia (if at all).

[[File:Escudo-reyno de galizia.jpg|thumb|right|Arms of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]], Pedro de Teixeira, 17th century]]

The '''name''' of '''''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''''', a nation on the Iberian Peninsula that is currently a part of [[Spain]], derives from the Latin toponym [[Callaecia]], later ''Gallaecia'', related to the name of an ancient tribe that resided north of the [[Douro]] river, the [[Gallaeci|Gallaeci or Callaeci]] in [[Latin]], or ''Kallaikói'' (καλλαικoι) in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref name='Moralejo'&gt;{{cite book|last=Moralejo|first=Juan J.|title=Callaica nomina : estudios de onomástica gallega|year=2008|publisher=Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza|location=A Coruña|isbn=978-84-95892-68-3|pages=113–148|url=http://ilg.usc.es/agon/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Callaica_Nomina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century. The earliest known attempt at this was due to [[Isidore of Seville]], who related the name of the Galicians and of the Gauls to the Greek word γάλα, ''milk'', 'they are called Galicians because of their fair skin, as the Gauls. For they are fairer than the rest of the peoples of Spain.'&lt;ref name='Moralejo' /&gt; Currently, scholars&lt;ref name='Moralejo' /&gt; relate the name of the ancient Callaeci either to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] *kal-n-eH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 'hill', derived through a local relational [[suffix]] -aik-, so meaning 'the hill (people)'; or either to [[Proto-Celtic]] *kallī- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'.&lt;ref&gt;Curchin, Leonard A. (2008) [http://estudiosgallegos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgallegos/article/view/41 Estudios Gallegos''The toponyms of the Roman Galicia: New Study'']. CUADERNOS DE ESTUDIOS GALLEGOS '''LV''' (121): 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Anyway, ''Galicia'', being ''per se'' a derivation of the ethnic name ''Callaicoi'', would mean the "land of the Galicians".

==History==
The ''[[Callaeci]]'' were the first tribe in the area to help the [[Lusitanians]] against the invading Romans, and gave their name to the rest of the tribes living north of them,&lt;ref&gt;Luján, Eugenio R. (2000): "Ptolemy's 'Callaecia' and the language(s) of the '[[Callaeci]]', in ''Ptolemy: towards a linguistic atlas of the earliest Celtic place-names of Europe : papers from a workshop sponsored by the British Academy'', Dept. of Welsh, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, 11–12 April 1999, pp. 55-72. Parsons and Patrick Sims-Williams editors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, Xoán (2000): "Curiosities across the Atlantic: a brief summary of some of the Irish-Galician classical folkloric similarities nowadays. Galician singularities for the Irish", in ''Chimera'', Dept. of Geography, University College Cork, Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; and to their victor,  [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]], who defeated them in 137 BC and was acclaimed in Rome.

From the beginning of the Christian era, after the campaigns of [[Augustus]] had brought all of [[Hispania]] under Roman control, the lands of Gallaecia—including Galicia and northern Portugal to the [[Douro river]]—were organized into two ''[[conventus iuridicus|conventi iuridici]]'', [[Braga|Bracarense]] and [[Lugo|Lucense]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=John T.|title=Celtic culture a historical encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1-85109-440-7|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the province [[Tarraconensis]]. During the last years of the 3rd century during [[Diocletian]]'s reforms these two convents, together with the [[Astorga, Spain|Asturicense]], and maybe also the [[Coruña del Conde|Cluniacense]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arce|first=Javier|title=El último siglo de la España Romana : 284-409|year=1982|publisher=Alianza Ed.|location=Madrid|isbn=84-206-2347-4|pages=50|edition=1a. ed.,2a. reimp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; were organized in a single [[praeses|presidential]] province, Gallaecia, later promoted to [[Roman consul|consular]] status in the 4th century, with the city of [[Braga|Bracara Augusta]] its capital.

In 411 the [[Suevi]], a Germanic people, settled in Gallaecia, establishing a kingdom which maintained its independence till 585, when it was annexed by the [[Visigoths]] of Spain. During these two centuries ''Gallaecia'' and its evolved form ''Gallicia''&lt;ref&gt;'Mirus rex Galliciensis legatos ad Guntchramnum regem dirixit'; 'In Gallitia quoque novae res actae sunt, quae de superius memorabuntur (...) Mironis Galliciensis regis (...) Quo defuncto, filius eius Eurichus Leuvichildi regis amicitias expetiit, dataque, ut pater fecerat, sacramenta, regnum Galliciensim suscepit (...) Hoc vero anno cognatus eius Audica (...) Ipse quoque acceptam soceri sui uxorem, Galliciensim regnum obtenuit.' [[Gregory of Tours]], History of the Franks, V.41 and VI.43.&lt;/ref&gt; became the name associated with the kingdom of the Suevi and with its territory, which included current Galicia, much of northern Portugal as far as [[Coimbra]] and [[Idanha-a-Velha]], much of the Spanish provinces of [[Asturias]], [[province of León|León]], and [[province of Zamora|Zamora]], and parts of [[province of Salamanca|Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López Carreira|first=Anselmo|title=O reino medieval de Galicia|year=2005|publisher=A nosa terra|location=Vigo|isbn=84-96403-54-8|pages=67–70|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 666 the southern extreme of the province, beyond the Douro, was formally reincorporated into [[Lusitania]], but the destruction of the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in 711 by the [[Arab expansion|Arabs]], and the early reconquest of Coimbra by Galician forces in 866 led to the name ''Gallicia'' being applied not just to the westernmost areas north of the [[Douro]], but also to much of the north-west of the Iberian peninsula,&lt;ref name='ALC'&gt;{{cite book|last=López Carreira|first=Anselmo|title=O reino medieval de Galicia|year=2005|publisher=A nosa terra|location=Vigo|isbn=84-96403-54-8|pages=213–248|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Bay of Biscay]] to Coimbra, and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Eo (river)|Eo]], [[Navia (river)|Navia]] and [[Cea River|Cea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Escalona|first=Fr.

Univ.|location=Salamanca|isbn=84-7481-160-0|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, from that time and to the twelfth century the name Galicia maintained some kind of duality, which is exactly symbolised by the Arab geographers and historians, who gave the name ''Ŷillīquiya'' (adaptation of Gallaecia) to the Christian kingdom of the northwest and to the lands north and west of the [[Sistema Central]] mountains, now known as [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and [[Kingdom of León]], whilst the term ''Galīsiya'' (adaptation of Galicia) was more usually reserved for Galicia and Portugal, although both terms were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;For the Arab use of the name Galicia cf. {{cite book|last=Carballeira Debasa|first=Ana María|title=Galicia y los gallegos en las fuentes árabes medievales|year=2007|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientifícas|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-00-08576-6|pages=59–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''Gallaecia'' or an evolved form of it was a common name used by other Europeans to refer in general to the Christians of the northwest of [[Hispania]] and to their kingdom.&lt;ref name='López'&gt;[[Alfonso II of Asturias]] was addressed as: ''"DCCXCVIII.

López Carreira, Anselmo (2005): ''O Reino medieval de Galicia''. A Nosa Terra, Vigo. {{ISBN|978-84-8341-293-0}} pp. 211–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'We must also consider that there are five kingdoms among the Spaniards, namely that of Aragon, that of the Navarrese, and that of those who specifically are named Spaniards, which capital is Toledo, as well as those of the inhabitants of Galicia and Portugal', "Considerandum etiam quod, cum sint quinque regna in Ispaniorum, videlicet Arragonensium, Navarrorum et eorum qui specificato vocabulo Ispani dicuntur, quorum metropolis est Tolletum, item incholarum Galicie et Portugalensium", ''Narratio de Itinere Navali Peregrinorum Hierosolymam Tendentium et Silviam Capientium, AD. 1189''.

En la España Medieval, 23: 41-66.&lt;/ref&gt; But from the 11th-12th century the independence of Portugal in the south, and the prominence of the city of [[León, Spain|León]] in the east as capital of the Christians, led to the restriction of the name ''Galicia'' to roughly its actual territorial boundaries. 

During the 13th century, with the written emergence of the Galician language, ''Galiza'' became the most usual written form of the name of the country, being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form, ''Galicia'', which coincides with the [[Castilian Spanish]] name. The historical denomination ''Galiza'' became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three quarters of the 20th century, and it is still used with some frequency by among others the Galician [[Reintegrationism|reintegrationists]]. Nevertheless, this alternative is now seldom used by the [[Xunta de Galicia]], the local [[devolved government]]. Besides, the [[Royal Galician Academy]], the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language, whilst recognizing it as a legitimate current denomination has stated that the only official name of the country is ''Galicia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fraga|first=Xesús|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/06/08/0003_6886803.htm|title=La Academia contesta a la Xunta que el único topónimo oficial es Galicia|trans-title=The Academy responds to the Xunta saying that the only official toponym is Galicia|publisher=[[La Voz de Galicia]]|date=2008-06-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131106/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/galicia/2008/06/08/0003_6886803.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''narrows''' is a restricted land or water passage. Most commonly a narrows is a [[strait]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|narrow}}: "a narrow part or passage; specifically a strait connecting two bodies of water —usually used in plural but singular or plural in construction".&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be a [[water gap]].

A narrows may form where a stream passes through a tilted bed of [[Rock (geology)|hard rock]] lying between two softer beds: "[i]f the hard beds are vertical, so that their [[outcrop]] does not shift as erosion proceeds, a narrows is developed".&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Ries and Thomas L.

A '''numbered street''' is a street whose name is an [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], as in ''Second Street'' or ''Tenth Avenue''. Such forms are among the most common street names in [[North America]], but also exist in other parts of the world, especially in the [[Middle East]]. Numbered streets were first used in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;Rybczynski, Witold. "City Life". Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and now exist in many major cities and small towns. [[Street name#Grid-based naming systems|Grid-based naming systems]] usually start at 1 (but sometimes at a higher number or even at zero), and then proceed in numerical order. In the United States, seven out of the top ten most common street names are numbers, with the top three names being "2nd," "3rd," and "1st" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Census and You'', February 1993 ([[United States Census Bureau]], Geography Division), as reported in "[http://www.nlc.org/about_cities/cities_101/184.aspx Most common street names]", [[National League of Cities]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806075013/http://www.nlc.org/about_cities/cities_101/184.aspx |date=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cities also have ''lettered'' street names. For example, [[Washington, D.C.]], in addition to having numbered streets, also has streets identified as a letter followed by "Street," going as high as the letter W. [[New York City]] (mostly in [[Brooklyn]]) has avenues titled "Avenue" followed by the respective letter of the alphabet, such as Avenue D. The idea for such a system was developed by [[Pierre Charles L’Enfant]], who devised the system for Washington.

The numbered street system is criticized for taking away the individuality from a community that a named street would provide.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Scribner's Magazine ...|author1=Burlingame, E.L.|author2=Bridges, R.|author3=Dashiell, A.|author4=Logan, H.|date=1910|volume=47|publisher=C.

{{See also|List of streets in Baltimore, Maryland#Numbered streets}}

[[File:HampdenSouth.jpg|right|thumb|300px|34th Street in Baltimore]]
The city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], has numbered streets in the north-central part of the city. The numbered streets in Baltimore do not begin with 1, but rather start with '''20th Street''' just north of and parallel to [[North Avenue (Baltimore)|North Avenue]], the former northern boundary of the city, and what is viewed by many today is the northern boundary of [[Downtown Baltimore]]. The numbered streets, which go as high as '''43rd Street''', correspond with the first two digits in the addresses of the north–south streets they cross. Unlike in Washington, where the numbered streets run north–south, Baltimore's numbered streets run west–east. All begin their names with either "West" or "East," depending on which side of [[Maryland Route 139|Charles Street]] the block is located.

Some of Baltimore's numbered streets are well known for various reasons. 28th and 29th streets, a [[one-way pair]], are the only numbered streets to have an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Jones Falls Expressway|I-83]]. They use the numbered designations to the east of the expressway, and to the west, they merge into a six-lane road known as [[Druid Park Lake Drive]]. [[33rd Street (Baltimore)|East 33rd Street]] was the location of the now-demolished [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], home to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for 38 years and the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] for 31. West 34th Street is the location of the annual [[Miracle on 34th Street (Baltimore)|Miracle on 34th Street]], where residents on one block of the street open their porches to tourists to view their holiday decorations. '''West 40th Street''' is the location of [[The Rotunda (Baltimore)|The Rotunda]] shopping mall, and it merges into West 41st Street, which crosses over (but does not have an interchange with) I-83 into [[Television Hill, Baltimore|Television Hill]] and is the only numbered street in the city west of I-83.

=== Chicago ===
{{Main|Streets and highways of Chicago}}
The City of [[Chicago]] is set on a grid with eight "standard" city blocks per mile. Some blocks are further divided in half. A standard block has 100 address numbers, meaning there are 800 numbers per mile. Chicago address numbering begins downtown at [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]]; State Street is 0 east and west, and Madison Street is 0 north and south. Major streets a mile apart have address numbers that, for the most part, are multiples of 800.

The south side of the city uses numbered east–west streets, although older streets that were already named retained their names, particularly in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. As stated above, Chicago house numbers are generally assigned at the rate of 8 blocks to a mile. The only exceptions are from Madison to 31st Street, just south of downtown.

The first two main numbered roads in the system were renamed for historical figures after the numbering system was adapted. Roosevelt Road (previously 12th Street and renamed for [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) is one mile south of Madison with 12 blocks to the mile, Cermak Road (previously 22nd Street and renamed in memory of assassinated mayor [[Anton Cermak]]) is two miles south of Madison with 10 blocks to the mile, and 31st Street (3100 S) is three miles south of Madison with 9 blocks to the mile. South of 31st Street, the pattern of 8 blocks to the mile resumes, with 39th Street the next major street, 47th after that, and so on.

The numbering within Chicago is continued throughout many suburbs south of the city proper. For instance, [[Chicago Heights, Illinois|Chicago Heights]] has a 185th Street, set on the same numbering schema.

Chicago's numbered street system was adopted in 1911 as a result of new legislation. Madison Street was made the base for all street numbering, and State Street for north–south streets.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chicago: Its History and Its Builders, a Century of Marvelous Growth|author=Currey, J.S.|date=1912|volume=3|publisher=S.

=== Cleveland ===

As a general rule, the only numbered streets in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] run—generally—north–south, while streets that run parallel to the lake shore (generally east–west) have names rather than numbers. Ontario Street in downtown Cleveland separates east- and west-numbered streets, with the numbers increasing as one travels further away from Ontario. Conforming east–west roads are given a name, rather than a number, and the suffix "Avenue."  Where an avenue crosses Ontario street or the [[Cuyahoga River]], its name changes, meaning that a numbered street does not intersect a given avenue more than once. For example, stating a location as "65th and Detroit" implies West 65th street, since Detroit Avenue changes to Superior Avenue when it crosses the river. Non-conforming streets are suffixed with names other than "street" or "avenue," e.g., West Boulevard, Old River Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Geographic idiosyncrasies in certain parts of the city mean that this is by no means an absolute rule, but generally applies within the city proper. The major exceptions to this system are the street names in the near west side city of [[Lakewood, Ohio|Lakewood]], and in a few cities on the far east side, generally south of Euclid Avenue and north of Chagrin Boulevard.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The street numbering extends from West 233rd in [[North Olmsted]] to East 367th in [[Eastlake, Ohio|Eastlake]], adjacent to the [[Willoughby, Ohio|Willoughby]] municipal line.

=== Denver ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|Street system of Denver}}

[[Denver]] has two systems in place in two distinct areas of the city. Downtown Denver's diagonal street system technically begins with 4th Street near Auraria Campus, underneath the Colfax Avenue viaduct. The system then counts up northeastward from 4th Street to 40th Street. The diagonal system meets the normal numbered grid at various points, with the termination of the downtown system at 40th Avenue and 40th Street in the Five Points neighborhood.

The second system is a typical East/West layout, with directional indicators. First Avenue is adjacent to Ellsworth Avenue in Central Denver; the series extends to 168th Avenue in unincorporated [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]]. Exceptions include [[Colfax Avenue]], which takes the place of 15th Avenue, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which generally takes the place of East 32nd Avenue. The designations ''East'' and ''North'' are generally not used unless needed.&lt;!--clarify? what determines need?--&gt;  Building numbers on cross-streets reflect the street numbering; for example, 1800 Colorado Boulevard would be at the corner of 18th Avenue. (1800 South Colorado Boulevard is outside the area of numbered streets.)

=== Detroit ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|Mile Road System (Detroit)}}

[[File:8 Mile Road.jpg|thumb|right|150px|8 Mile Road overpass]]
In the northern suburbs of [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]], "___ Mile Road" runs east–west, a stated number of miles from the center of Detroit. Some of these roads are also known by other names. The lowest numbered road is '''5 Mile Road''', while the city limits end at '''[[8 Mile Road]]''', which at one time was called "[[M-102 (Michigan highway)|Baseline Road]]". The highest such numbered road is '''38 Mile Road''', which is mostly in [[Almont, Michigan|Almont]].

The city of Detroit also has some conventional numbered streets within the city limits.

=== Greater Miami and rest of Florida ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}

In [[Greater Miami]], numbered streets go into three digits, with varying, overlapping sets of numbered streets. The area has roads that are named as a number followed by "Street" that run west–east, and a number followed by "Avenue" that run north–south. All these streets start their names with NW, NE, SW, or SE, depending where they are in relation to the center of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].

In the Miami suburbs, some numbered streets and avenues are paired with a parallel "Court", "Drive", "Place" or "Terrace"; while in the same area, other sets of numbered streets and avenues exist with lower numbers, such as in Hialeah, where W 68th St is also designated NW 122 St [https://maps.google.com/?ll=25.885713,-80.351&amp;spn=0.023359,0.042272&amp;t=m&amp;z=15].  This is known to lead to confusion among some, especially non-locals.

Similar numbering systems are used throughout the state of Florida, such as in [https://maps.google.com/?ll=29.630883,-82.418447&amp;spn=0.022568,0.042272&amp;t=m&amp;z=15 Gainesville], [https://maps.google.com/?ll=29.171124,-82.253008&amp;spn=0.045341,0.084543&amp;t=m&amp;z=14 Ocala], [https://maps.google.com/?ll=30.22062,-85.627892&amp;spn=0.011218,0.021136&amp;t=m&amp;z=16 Panama City], and [https://maps.google.com/?ll=30.246148,-81.720858&amp;spn=0.011215,0.021136&amp;t=m&amp;z=16 Jacksonville].

=== New York City ===

[[File:Street sign at corner of Fifth Avenue and E 57th Street in NYC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fifth Avenue and E. 57th Street in Manhattan]]
The [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] laid out the grid that covers most of [[Manhattan]] today. Most east–west streets (which actually run southeast–northwest) are named "___th Street", and a few major north–south streets (which actually run northeast–southwest, roughly parallel to the island's long axis) are named "___th Avenue".

The highest-numbered [[List of streets in Manhattan|street on Manhattan Island]] is 220th Street, and the highest-numbered street in the Borough of Manhattan is 228th Street.

The Manhattan numbered street grid continues north in The [[Bronx]], where the highest numbered street is West 263rd Street on the border of [[Yonkers]]. The only numbered avenue in The Bronx is a continuation of Manhattan's Third Avenue.

In Queens, the melding of various grids from pre-consolidation villages resulted in repeat numbers, for example 67th Street, 67th Place, 67th Avenue, 67th Road and 67th Drive. Streets and places run north to south, while avenues, roads and drives run east to west. The avenues run from Third Avenue in Whitestone to 165th Avenue in Howard Beach. Streets run from First Street in Astoria to 271st Street in Floral Park.

In [[Brooklyn]], there are ten sets of numbered streets ([[List of Brooklyn streets, 1–101|unprefixed numbered streets]] as well as North, South, East, West, Bay, Brighton, Paerdegat, Plumb, and Flatlands numbered streets), along with [[List of Brooklyn avenues, 1–28|numbered avenues]] up to 28th Avenue and [[Brooklyn avenues, Lettered A–Z|letter avenues]] up to Avenue Z. Manhattan's [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] consists of Avenues [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|A]] through [[Avenue D (Manhattan)|D]].

The [[Rockaway, Queens|Rockaways]] section of Queens has streets prefixed with the word ''Beach''. However, street signs in this area typically identify this prefix using only the letter B (e.g. "B 116 St"). The neighborhood of [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]] also has its own network of numbered roads, prefixed with East or West, relative to [[Cross Bay Boulevard]].

The closest cross street to a given [[building number]] in Manhattan can be estimated using  the [[Manhattan address algorithm]].

The highest-numbered street in all of New York City is 271st Street, located in [[Glen Oaks, Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/nyregion/fyi-414514.html F.Y.I.], ''NYTimes''&lt;/ref&gt; 704th Street in [[Orangeburg, New York]] is the highest-numbered street in the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York City]] area, and at one point was the highest-numbered street in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99046029/ Detroit Free Press].

Page 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/215243005/ The Times from Shreveport, Louisiana].
 Page 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest-numbered Avenue in Manhattan is the obscure [[13th Avenue (Manhattan)|13th Avenue]], on Gansevoort Peninsula in the Hudson River just north of Gansevoort Street. Currently, only one unmarked block remains, currently used as a garbage truck access behind the Bloomfield Street Sanitation Depot. The street was once longer, but much of the land it was built on was removed to provide longer piers for berthing larger ships, such as {{RMS|Lusitania}} and {{RMS|Titanic}}, without protruding further into the Hudson River. [[West Side Highway|12th Avenue]] is the highest numbered avenue that is signed by the city and accessible to the public. Higher-numbered avenues exist in other boroughs.

[[Sixth and a Half Avenue]], is the only numbered avenue in Manhattan involving [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/officially-marking-a-new-manhattan-avenue/ Officially Marking a New Manhattan Avenue], ''NYTimes - City Room'', July 13, 2012 - accessed 2012-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philadelphia ===
[[File:A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Original street plan of Center City Philadelphia]]
[[Center City, Philadelphia|Central]] [[Philadelphia]] was laid out by [[Thomas Holme]] in 1683&lt;ref name="virginia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/penn/pnplan.html|title=Planning Philadelphia|publisher=xroads.virginia.edu|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first city to use numbered streets systematically. While the original plan had two sets of north–south numbered streets, one parallel to the [[Delaware River]] and one to the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]]; all are now numbered from the Delaware, with numbers increasing westward and  continuing across the Schuylkill through [[West Philadelphia]] to the edge of the city. There are two main exceptions to this pattern: Holme's plan included [[Front Street, Philadelphia|Front Street]] in place of First and [[Broad Street, Philadelphia|Broad Street]] in place of Fourteenth; "Schuylkill Front Street" became 22nd when the streets west of Broad were renumbered. The highest numbered street is 90th Street.&lt;ref name=gm&gt;{{google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=90th+street+philadelphia&amp;sll=40.292097,-75.160217&amp;sspn=0.902918,2.705383&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=90th+St,+Philadelphia,+Pennsylvania+19153&amp;ll=39.884187,-75.248709&amp;spn=0.007508,0.021136&amp;t=h&amp;z=16|title=overview of 90th Street in Philadelphia|accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Southwest Philadelphia]], the grid is oblique, with numbered streets running from northwest to southeast and meeting their West Philadelphia equivalents at Baltimore Avenue. In general, numbered streets northwest of the Schuylkill are not aligned with their counterparts across the river in [[South Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The London-Scottish Reformed Presbyterian magazine|date=1869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA228|page=228|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington]] area has streets lettered "A" through "O". The [[East Oak Lane]] and [[West Oak Lane]] sections of the city contains east–west streets numbered from 64th Avenue to 80th Avenue, with the numbers correspondent with the block numbers north from [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]].&lt;ref name=adcphiladelphia&gt;{{cite map|publisher=[[ADC Map]]|title=Metro Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |year=2006|edition=19th|scale= 1"=2000'|isbn=978-0-87530-777-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, many of [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]]'s previously numbered streets were renamed for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Suburb in the City: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1850-1990|author=Contosta, D.R.|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=9780814205808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmhN8FN9VDEC&amp;pg=PA92|page=92|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Francisco ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|List of streets in San Francisco}}

[[San Francisco]] has two numbered series: First Street through 30th Street in South-of-Market and the Mission district, and 2nd Avenue through 48th Avenue in the Richmond and Sunset districts, with 48th nearest the Pacific Ocean. (The street that would be First Avenue is named Arguello Boulevard, and Funston Avenue replaces 13th Avenue, although 13th Street exists.)  Unlike Manhattan, the numbered streets and avenues do not meet; but, because of a bend in the pattern, Third Street meets 16th through 26th Streets. (This bend also marks where spelled-out street numbers are used interchangeably to the northeast, and where numbers written as 13th, 14th, etc. are required to the south – in contrast, all numbered avenues are always written as 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

The numbered streets and avenues make up the great majority of streets in San Francisco whose signs include the "St." or "Ave." designation (counter-examples include El Camino del Mar, and non-standard signs in Golden Gate Park and military bases).

=== Washington, D.C. ===
{{Main|Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.}}
[[File:Gallery Place.jpg|left|thumb|30opx|7th St and H Street NW in Washington, D.C.]]
[[Pierre L'Enfant]]'s plan for [[Washington, D.C.]] includes both radial avenues and grid system consisting of both numbered and lettered streets. North-south streets are named with numbers, such as "[[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|7th Street]]," and west–east streets are named with letters, such as "[[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H Street]]." The name is then followed with a directional suffix (NW, NE, SW, or SE), specifying a quadrant of the city (e.g. [[16th Street Northwest (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street Northwest]]). The quadrants meet at the [[U.S. Capitol]] building.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge|date=1920|volume=28|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA787|page=787|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the city, the quadrants are divided by three streets known as ''[[North Capitol Street|North]]'', ''[[East Capitol Street|East]]'', and ''[[South Capitol Street|South]]'' '''Capitol Streets''', and by the [[National Mall]], which takes the place of the non-existent ''West Capitol Street''. Numbers start counting upward on either side of North and South Capitol Streets, and letters start counting upward on either side of East Capitol Street and the National Mall.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Canada ==

=== Calgary ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}

The city of [[Calgary]] uses a quadrant system with a grid set. The east–west demarcation line separating the north and south is the [[Bow River]] west of Nose Creek, Centre Avenue directly east of Nose Creek, and Memorial Drive east of 36th Street. The north–south line is Centre Street. Streets run north–south and avenues run east–west; both are numbered beginning at the demarcation lines. Many older areas also have "A" and "B" streets interspersed between the numbered streets; for instance, in most older neighbourhoods the street directly west of Centre Street is 1st Street, but a Centre A Street runs for short distances in certain areas. Suburban neighbourhoods built since approximately 1971 tend to have named streets except in cases where numbered streets extend into the district. A typical (if fictional) street address in an older district would be "4214-19A Street SW". As such, addresses of buildings on numbered streets are worthless without a quadrant.

The grid is based on the [[Dominion Land Survey]], with many of the main roads in the older areas of town (such as Crowchild Trail SW and 17th Avenue SE) following the lines that separate one DLS section from another ("section lines").

Avenues in the [[Municipal District of Foothills No. 31]], south of the city are numbered as they would be if they were in the city (with quadrant omitted). However, the basis for numbered streets in the Municipal District of Foothills (the "zero" street) is the Fifth Meridian (114° west), approximately {{convert|3|km}} east of Calgary's Centre Street. Streets are then numbered east and west with 16 streets for each one-mile grid road – or one street number per 100&amp;nbsp;m. This leads to situations at the south city limit where the street number changes (e.g. 85 Street SW changes to 144 Street W). The impetus for this came originally from emergency response groups, such as fire departments and police.

[[Rocky View County]], which surrounds Calgary to the east, west and north, uses a different system of road numbers based on the Alberta Township System for land surveys. In Rocky View, range roads run north–south and are numbered in {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} (the boundary of one survey section) increments west from the nearest survey range line (e.g. Range Road 51 is 1 mile west of the east edge of Range 5 west of the 5th Meridian). Township roads are east–west roads numbered in similar increments north of survey township lines (e.g. Township Road 264 is 4 miles north of the south edge of Township 26). Addressing is based on the distance west or north from the nearest crossroad (e.g. 264054 Range Road 51 would be north of Township Road 264). Roads ending in 0 are on their respective range or township lines. Suffixed roads (e.g. ending with an "A", "B", etc...) are between section lines (e.g. along "quarter" lines which split the 640-acre sections into smaller quarter-sections).

=== Edmonton ===

The city of [[Edmonton]]'s grid system is similar in nature to Calgary's, except that the two roads designated at the "centre" of Edmonton were numbered 101st (Jasper) Avenue and 101st (Main) Street. This was done to eliminate the possibility that the city would have quadrants as Calgary does.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The gradual expansion of the city now extends it east and south of what is 1st (Meridian) Street and 1st (Quadrant) Avenue. As such, most of the city is officially located in the northwest quadrant, but common practice is to not refer to the quadrant unless the address being mentioned is not located in the northwest quadrant. The city limits do not yet extend into where the southeast quadrant would be located, meaning addresses will be post-fixed with either NW, SW, or NE.

=== Metro Vancouver ===

A grid system of numbered streets and avenues is used south of the [[Fraser River]], in the municipalities of [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] and [[Langley Township, British Columbia|Langley]]. Avenues run east–west and are numbered starting with 0 ("Zero") avenue next to the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] and going north, with the numbers incrementing each {{fraction|1|8}} mile (200 metres). Streets run north–south and are numbered starting with zero lying in the [[Strait of Georgia]] and going east, with the numbers incrementing each {{fraction|1|8}} mile, just like the avenues. Minor streets named with a number followed by a letter (136A Street, 136B street) are situated between the numbers.&lt;ref&gt;

The city of [[Vancouver]] proper uses its own road numbering system, numbering east–west avenues from first at [[False Creek]] and incrementing south. Similarly, the city of [[New Westminster]] has its own numbering system with avenues northeast–southwest and streets northwest–southeast.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Other Canadian cities and towns ===

Many small towns and cities in Western Canada use numbered streets. Some begin numbering at Centre or Main (0) as Calgary does, but others follow Edmonton's example and begin numbering at 1, 50, or 100. Examples include [[Brandon, Manitoba]], where streets, running north–south, are numbered; and [[Red Deer, Alberta]], where numbered streets run east–west, and numbered avenues run north–south. In [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] only the streets, running east–west, are numbered (aside from avenues downtown, which are numbered from 1st to 10th); there are lettered avenues to the west of Idylwyld Drive, which was formerly known as Avenue A (a stub of Avenue A does remain south of 20th Street though). Streets in the Sutherland district in Saskatoon are numbered 101 St to 117 St. This was done when the town of Sutherland amalgamated with Saskatoon, to avoid confusion with Saskatoon's numbered streets, which run from 1 to 71.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Numerous street numbering schemes were proposed for the various municipalities originally making up Greater [[Winnipeg]], but most were quickly rescinded, as the city is not built on a uniform grid and numbering was considered unwieldy.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Only one roadway (Fifth Avenue in [[St. Vital, Winnipeg|St. Vital]]) retains its "number", but the street name is legally the word "Fifth" and not the number. Numbered roadways are also found within [[CFB Winnipeg]], but the street names within the base were chosen by the Department of National Defence and not by the city itself.

Numbered streets are less common in Eastern Canada, with some notable exceptions. [[Owen Sound, Ontario]], is one of the few cities that primarily use numbered streets and avenues. [[Saint-Georges, Quebec]] has a numbered system of streets/rues and avenues that extends into the surrounding [[Chaudière-Appalaches]] region. Many urban enclaves were established with numbered streets or avenues as part of their distinct character. [[The Glebe]] in Ottawa is an example, with avenues numbered First to Fifth. [[New Toronto]] has numbered streets, running westward off of [[Lake Shore Boulevard]], starting at 1st Street (just west of [[Royal York Road]]), to 43rd Street, excluding Eighteenth Street and Thirty-Fourth Street, as [[Kipling Avenue]] and the [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch Avenue]] replace them, respectively. The city of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] has a single numbered street called 18th Street, located in the [[Waterford Valley, St. John's|Waterford Valley]] area; it is unclear how this name originated or whether this street was meant to form part of a larger grid system.&lt;ref&gt;

== Latin America ==

=== Brazil ===
Some cities (such as [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]]) use numbered streets, though main streets might receive different names.

=== Colombia ===
All 1,119 [[Municipalities of Colombia|municipalities]] in [[Colombia]]  have numbered streets divided into a grid, and the government of [[Colombia]] has a complete nomenclature to classify the streets. Occasionally main streets receive names like El Dorado Avenue in [[Bogota]] the capital city.

=== Cuba (Havana) ===
[[Havana]] has even-numbered streets running north–south, and odd-numbered streets running east–west on the west side of the city, with lettered streets from A through P running north–south beginning on the east side of Paseo Avenue. Some streets are named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Europe ==

=== Germany (Mannheim) ===
[[File:Quadratestadt.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Mannheim's city center]]
A notable European example is the city center of [[Mannheim]] where blocks are numbered in a grid-like system since 1811, and streets actually do not have names anymore—for example the houses in "street" B7 are those in the block in grid B7. The houses on the other side of the street belong to other blocks and therefore have another street name.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Hungary (Budapest) ===
In the capital city [[Budapest]] there are some outer districts which have areas with numbered streets (and in one case, a numbered square), like [[Akadémiaújtelep]]. These areas are [[Planned community|planned communities]] built in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Netherlands (Lelystad) ===
In [[Lelystad]] some streets have a combination of names and numbers. The streets with the same name (but different number) are in the same area. In [[Botter (Lelystad)|Botter]] the names are Botter and Tjalk, in [[Galjoen (Lelystad)|Galjoen]] the names are Galjoen and Jol, in [[Schouw (Lelystad)|Schouw]] the names are Schouw and Gondel, although there are "normal" names there, etc. There are also other cities with similar numbering like [[Wijchen]] and [[Nijmegen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Portugal (Espinho) ===
A notable example of a citywide numbered streets system in [[Portugal]], is the city of [[Espinho, Portugal|Espinho]]. Espinho, in the [[district of Aveiro]], was mainly built in the late 19th century in a grid pattern, with its streets being numbered instead of being named. Streets running north–south are numbered with [[even number]]s and streets running west–east are numbered with [[odd number]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Numbered streets are also occasionally used in other Portuguese cities, but only in specific areas within them and not as a citywide system. This happens mainly in newly built neighborhoods, especially those planned in a grid pattern.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Russia (Saint Petersburg) ===
{{Main|Lines of Vasilyevsky Island}}

=== United Kingdom ===
With the notable exception of [[Milton Keynes]], numbered streets are uncommon in the [[United Kingdom]] because cities and towns are generally not laid out in grids. However, [[Trafford Park#Trafford Park Village|the Village]], a small area of [[Trafford Park]] is laid out in a grid pattern. It has north–south streets numbered from First Avenue in the east to Fifth Avenue in the west, and west–east streets numbered from Fifth Street in the south to Eleventh Street in the north. The former mining town of [[Newtongrange]] in [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]] has residential streets numbered from First Street to Tenth Street.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Hong Kong ===
On Hong Kong Island, in the Sai Ying Pun neighborhood, there are a series of streets named with numbers.  They are part of a planned layout of the early development of Hong Kong.  See [[First Street (Hong Kong)|First Street]]

=== Iran (Tehran) ===
In [[Tehran]] there are multiple sets of numbered streets running from west to east in various sections of the north side of town. In many such sections, the street numbers count upward by two, with even-numbered streets on one side of a neighborhood, and odd-numbered streets on the other. The highest numbered street is 304th Street. The city also has other series of streets with a name combining with a number.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In the [[United Arab Emirates]], most streets and roads are numbered. Most commonly in smaller cities, they are identified with a 4-digit number followed by "way".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Abu Dhabi]] has even-numbered streets running west–east, and odd-numbered streets running north–south.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Dubai]] has numbered streets that simply have the number followed by "street" (e.g. 41st Street), as well as streets named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The '''Paired Fortress Gates''' or '''Gosha Gala Gapysy''' (also sometimes called '''Shamakhi gates''' and '''The gates of Shah Abbas''') are one of the main entrances to the [[Old City (Baku)| Icherisheher]] section of [[Baku, Azerbaijan]]. Until the end of the 19th century, the [[Shamakhi]] Gates had been the only entry to the fortress. &lt;ref name="national=tourism"&gt;{{cite| title=Museums, Reserves, Galleries of Baku: Arch-shaped Religious Architectural Complex | publisher=National Tourism Promotion Bureau | date=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second row of fortification walls was demolished in the late 19th century, the gates of the second row (called “Gates of Zulfugar Khan”) were moved next to the [[Shamakhi]] Gates. Since then, the Gates have been referred to as “Paired Fortress Gates”. &lt;ref name="national=tourism"&gt;{{cite| title=Museums, Reserves, Galleries of Baku: Arch-shaped Religious Architectural Complex | publisher=National Tourism Promotion Bureau | date=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palestine''' ({{lang-ar|فلسطين}} {{transl|ar|''Filasṭīn''}}, {{transl|ar|''Falasṭīn''}}, {{transl|ar|''Filisṭīn''}}; {{lang-el|Παλαιστίνη}}, ''Palaistinē''; {{lang-la|Palaestina}}; {{lang-he| פלשתינה }} ''Palestina'') is a geographic region in [[Western Asia]] usually considered to include [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]], and in some definitions, some parts of western [[Jordan]].

The name was used by [[ancient Greek]] writers, and it was later used for the Roman province [[Syria Palaestina]], the Byzantine [[Palaestina Prima]], and the Islamic provincial district of [[Jund Filastin]]. The region comprises most of the territory claimed for the biblical regions known as the [[Land of Israel]] ({{lang-he| ארץ־ישראל }} ''Eretz-Yisra'el''), the [[Holy Land]] or [[Promised Land]]. Historically, it has been known as the southern portion of wider regional designations such as [[Canaan]], [[Southern Syria|Syria]], [[Syria (region)|ash-Sham]], and the [[Southern Levant|Levant]].

Situated at a strategic location between [[Egypt]], [[Greater Syria|Syria]] and [[Arabia]], and the birthplace of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaan]]ites, [[Israelites]] and [[Judeans]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], [[Hellenistic period#Hellenistic Middle east|ancient Greeks]], the [[Jewish]] [[Hasmonean Kingdom]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[caliphate]]s, [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[British Empire|British]], and modern [[Israelis]], [[Jordanians]], [[Egyptians]] and [[Palestinians]].

The boundaries of the region have changed throughout history. Today, the region comprises the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] in which the [[State of Palestine]] was declared.

Modern archaeology has identified 12 ancient inscriptions from Egyptian and Assyrian records recording likely cognates of Hebrew ''Pelesheth''. The term "Peleset" ([[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliterated]] from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] as ''P-r-s-t'') is found in five inscriptions referring to a neighboring people or land starting from c. 1150 BCE during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt]]. The first known mention is at the temple at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] which refers to the Peleset among those who fought with [[Egypt]] in [[Ramesses III]]'s reign,{{sfn|Fahlbusch|Lochman|Bromiley|Barrett|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|Breasted|2001|p=24}} and the last known is 300 years later on [[Padiiset's Statue]]. Seven known [[Assyria]]n inscriptions refer to the region of "Palashtu" or "Pilistu", beginning with [[Adad-nirari III]] in the [[Nimrud Slab]] in c. 800 BCE through to a [[Esarhaddon's Treaty with Ba'al of Tyre|treaty made by Esarhaddon]] more than a century later.{{sfn|Sharon|1988|p=4}}&lt;ref name=Roomp285/&gt; Neither the Egyptian nor the Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.{{efn-lr|[[Eberhard Schrader]] wrote in his seminal "Keilinschriften und Geschichtsforschung" ("KGF", in English "Cuneiform inscriptions and Historical Research") that the Assyrian tern "Palashtu" or "Pilistu" referred to the wider Palestine or "the East" in general, instead of "Philistia".{{sfn|Schrader|1878|p=123-124}}{{sfn|Anspacher|1912|p=48}}}}

The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the entire area between [[Phoenicia]] and [[Egypt]] was in 5th century BCE [[Ancient Greece]],{{sfn|Jacobson|1999|ps=: "The earliest occurrence of this name in a Greek text is in the mid-fifth century b.c., Histories of Herodotus, where it is applied to the area of the Levant between Phoenicia and Egypt."..."The first known occurrence of the Greek word Palaistine is in the Histories of Herodotus, written near the mid-fifth century B.C. Palaistine Syria, or simply Palaistine, is applied to what may be identified as the southern part of Syria, comprising the region between Phoenicia and Egypt. Although some of Herodotus' references to Palestine are compatible with a narrow definition of the coastal strip of the Land of Israel, it is clear that Herodotus does call the "whole land by the name of the coastal strip."..."It is believed that Herodotus visited Palestine in the fifth decade of the fifth century B.C."..."In the earliest Classical literature references to Palestine generally applied to the Land of Israel in the wider sense."}}{{sfn|Jacobson|2001|ps=: "As early as the Histories of Herodotus, written in the second half of the fifth century B.C.E., the term Palaistinê is used to describe not just the geographical area where the Philistines lived, but the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt—in other words, the Land of Israel. Herodotus, who had traveled through the area, would have had firsthand knowledge of the land and its people. Yet he used Palaistinê to refer not to the Land of the Philistines, but to the Land of Israel"}} when [[Herodotus]] wrote of a "district of Syria, called ''Palaistinê''" ({{lang-grc|Συρίη ἡ Παλαιστίνη καλεομένη}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0125%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D91%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus- Histories Book 3 Chapter 91]&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', which included the [[Judean mountains]] and the [[Jordan Rift Valley]].{{sfn|Jacobson|1999|p=65}}{{efn-lr|In ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', Herodotus referred to the practice of [[History of male circumcision|male circumcision]] associated with the Hebrew people: "the [[Colchis|Colchians]], the [[Egyptians]], and the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], are the only nations who have practised circumcision from the earliest times. The [[Phoenicians]] and the Syrians of Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the custom of the Egyptians.... Now these are the only nations who use circumcision."{{sfn|Herodotus|1858|p=Bk ii, Ch 104}}}} Approximately a century later, [[Aristotle]] used a similar definition for the region in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', in which he included the [[Dead Sea]].{{sfn|Jacobson|1999|p=66-67}} Later Greek writers such as [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] also used the term to refer to the same region, which was followed by Roman writers such as [[Ovid]], [[Tibullus]], [[Pomponius Mela]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Dio Chrysostom]], [[Statius]], [[Plutarch]] as well as Roman Judean writers [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Feldman, whose view differs from that of Robinson, thinks that Josephus, when referring to ''Palestine'', had in mind only the coastal region, writing: "Writers on geography in the first century [CE] clearly differentiate Judaea from Palestine. ...Jewish writers, notably [[Philo]] and [[Josephus]], with few exceptions refer to the land as ''Judaea'', reserving the name ''Palestine'' for the coastal area occupied [formerly] by the Philistines." (END QUOTE). See: p. 1 in: {{cite journal |last=Feldman |first=Louis |title=Some Observations on the Name of Palestine |journal= Hebrew Union College Annual|volume=61 |issue= |pages=1–23 |jstor=23508170 |date=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used to denote an official province in c. 135 CE, when the [[Roman Empire|Roman authorities]], following the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba Revolt]], combined [[Iudaea Province]] with [[Galilee]] and the [[Paralia (Palestine)|Paralia]] to form "[[Syria Palaestina]]". There is [[circumstantial evidence]] linking [[Hadrian]] with the name change,{{sfn|Feldman|1996|p=553}} but the precise date is not certain{{sfn|Feldman|1996|p=553}} and the assertion of some scholars that the name change was intended "to complete the dissociation with Judaea"{{sfn|Sharon|1988|p=4a|ps=:"Eager to obliterate the name of the rebellious [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], the Roman authorities (General Hadrian) renamed it ''Palaestina'' or ''Syria Palaestina''."}} is disputed.{{sfn|Jacobson|1999|p=72-74}}

The term is generally accepted to be a translation of the Biblical name ''Peleshet'' ({{lang|he|פלשת}} ''Pəlésheth'', usually transliterated as [[Philistia]]). The term and its derivates are used more than 250 times in [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]]-derived versions of the [[Hebrew Bible]], of which 10 uses are in the [[Torah]], with undefined boundaries, and almost 200 of the remaining references are in the [[Book of Judges]] and the [[Books of Samuel]].{{sfn|Sharon|1988|p=4}}&lt;ref name=Roomp285&gt;{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, 1865, p.15: "Palestine, or Palestina, now the most common name for the Holy Land, occurs three times in the English version of the Old Testament; and is there put for the [[Hebrew]] name פלשת, elsewhere rendered Philistia. As thus used, it refers strictly and only to the country of the [[Philistines]], in the southwest corner of the land. So, too, in the Greek form, Παλαςτίνη), it is used by [[Josephus]]. But both Josephus and [[Philo]] apply the name to the whole land of the Hebrews ; and Greek and Roman writers employed it in the like extent."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis, 1993, p. 153"&gt;Lewis, 1993, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is rarely used in the [[Septuagint]], which used a transliteration ''Land of Phylistieim'' (''Γῆ τῶν Φυλιστιείμ'') different from the contemporary Greek place name ''Palaistínē'' (''Παλαιστίνη'').{{sfn|Jacobson|1999|p=72-74}}

The Septuagint instead used the term "allophuloi" (άλλόφυλοι, "other nations") throughout the Books of Judges and Samuel,{{sfn|Jobling|Rose|1996|p=404a}}&lt;ref name=Drews49&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1998|p=49}}: "Our names ‘Philistia’ and ‘Philistines’ are unfortunate obfuscations, first introduced by the translators of the LXX and made definitive by Jerome’s Vg. When turning a Hebrew text into Greek, the translators of the LXX might simply—as Josephus was later to do—have Hellenized the Hebrew פְּלִשְׁתִּים as Παλαιστίνοι, and the toponym פְּלִשְׁתִּ as Παλαιστίνη. Instead, they avoided the toponym altogether, turning it into an ethnonym. As for the ethnonym, they chose sometimes to transliterate it (incorrectly aspirating the initial letter, perhaps to compensate for their inability to aspirate the sigma) as φυλιστιιμ, a word that looked exotic rather than familiar, and more often to translate it as άλλόφυλοι. Jerome followed the LXX’s lead in eradicating the names, ‘Palestine’ and ‘Palestinians’, from his Old Testament, a practice adopted in most modern translations of the Bible."&lt;/ref&gt; such that the term "Philistines" has been interpreted to mean "non-Israelites of the Promised Land" when used in the context of Samson, Saul and David,&lt;ref name=Drews51&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1998|p=51}}: "The LXX’s regular translation of פְּלִשְׁתִּים into άλλόφυλοι is significant here. Not a proper name at all, allophyloi is a generic term, meaning something like ‘people of other stock’. If we assume, as I think we must, that with their word allophyloi the translators of the LXX tried to convey in Greek what p'lištîm had conveyed in Hebrew, we must conclude that for the worshippers of Yahweh p'lištîm and b'nê yiśrā'ēl were mutually exclusive terms, p'lištîm (or allophyloi) being tantamount to ‘non-Judaeans of the Promised Land’ when used in a context of the third century BCE, and to ‘non-Israelites of the Promised Land’ when used in a context of Samson, Saul and David. Unlike an ethnonym, the noun פְּלִשְׁתִּים normally appeared without a definite article."&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbinic sources explain that these peoples were different from the Philistines of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Jobling|Rose|1996|p=404|ps=: "Rabbinic sources insist that the Philistines of Judges and Samuel were different people altogether from the Philistines of Genesis. ([[Midrash Tehillim]] on Psalm 60 (Braude: vol. 1, 513); the issue here is precisely whether Israel should have been obliged, later, to keep the Genesis treaty.) This parallels a shift in the Septuagint's translation of Hebrew pelistim. Before Judges, it uses the neutral transliteration phulistiim, but beginning with Judges it switches to the pejorative allophuloi. [To be precise, Codex Alexandrinus starts using the new translation at the beginning of Judges and uses it invariably thereafter, Vaticanus likewise switches at the beginning of Judges, but reverts to phulistiim on six occasions later in Judges, the last of which is 14:2.]"}}

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the region of Palestine within [[Syria Palaestina]] was subdivided into [[Palaestina Prima]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Secunda]],{{sfn|Kaegi|1995|p=41}} and an area of land including the [[Negev]] and [[Sinai]] became [[Palaestina Salutaris]].{{sfn|Kaegi|1995|p=41}} Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslim conquest]], [[Place names of Palestine|place names]] that were in use by the Byzantine administration generally continued to be used in Arabic.{{sfn|Sharon|1988|p=4}}&lt;ref name=Marshallp559&gt;Marshall Cavendish, 2007, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the name "Palestine" became common in [[Early Modern English]],{{sfn|Krämer|2011|page=16}} was used in English and Arabic during the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]{{sfn|Büssow|2011|p=5}}{{sfn|Abu-Manneh|1999|p=39}}{{efn-lr|For example, the 1915 ''Filastin Risalesi'' ("Palestine Document"), an Ottoman army ([[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)]]) country survey which formally identified Palestine as including the sanjaqs of [[Acre Sanjak|Akka (the Galilee)]], the [[Nablus Sanjak|Sanjaq of Nablus]], and the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Sanjaq of Jerusalem (Kudus Sherif)]]&lt;ref name=Risalesi&gt;{{harvnb|Tamari|2011|pp=29–30}}: "Filastin Risalesi, is the salnameh type military handbook issued for Palestine at the beginning of the Great War... The first is a general map of the country in which the boundaries extend far beyond the frontiers of the Mutasarflik of Jerusalem, which was, until then, the standard delineation of Palestine. The northern borders of this map include the city of Tyre (Sur) and the Litani River, thus encompassing all of the Galilee and parts of southern Lebanon, as well as districts of Nablus, Haifa and Akka—all of which were part of the Wilayat of Beirut until the end of the war."&lt;/ref&gt;}} and was revived as an official place name with the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]].

Some other terms that have been used to refer to all or part of this land include [[Canaan]], [[Land of Israel]] (Eretz Yisrael or Ha'aretz),{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=133, 159}}{{efn-lr|The [[New Testament]], taking up a term used once in the [[Tanakh]] (1 Samuel 13:19),{{sfn|Whitelam|1996|p=40-42}}{{sfn|Masalha|2007|p=32}} speaks of a larger theologically-defined area, of which Palestine is a part, as the "land of Israel"{{sfn|Saldarini|1994|p=28-29}} (γῆ Ἰσραήλ) ([[Matthew 2:20–21]]), in a narrative paralleling that of the [[Book of Exodus]].{{sfn|Goldberg|2001|p=147|ps=: “The parallels between this narrative and that of Exodus continue to be drawn.

===Overview===
{{main list|Time periods in the Palestine region}}
Situated at a strategic location between [[Egypt]], [[Greater Syria|Syria]] and [[Arabia]], and the birthplace of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaan]]ites, [[Israelites]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], [[Hellenistic period#Hellenistic Middle east|Ancient Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[caliphate]]s, [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[British Empire|British]], and modern [[Israelis]] and [[Palestinians]]. Modern archaeologists and historians of the region refer to their field of study as [[Levantine archaeology]].

===Ancient period===
[[File:Palestine 1020BC Smith 1915.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Depiction of Biblical Palestine in c. 1020 BCE according to [[George Adam Smith]]'s 1915 ''Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land''. Smith's book was used as a reference by [[Lloyd George]] during the negotiations for the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Grief|2008|p=33}}]]
The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and [[civilization]].{{sfn|Ahlström|1993|p=72-111}} During the [[Bronze Age]], independent [[Canaan]]ite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete, and Syria. Between 1550 and 1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]] who held power until the 1178 BCE [[Battle of Djahy|Battle of Djahy (Canaan)]] during the wider [[Bronze Age collapse]].{{sfn|Ahlström|1993|p=282-334}} The Israelites emerged from a dramatic social transformation that took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein and Silberman, 2001, p 107&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Krämer|2011|page=8|ps=: "Several scholars hold the revisionist thesis that the Israelites did not move to the area as a distinct and foreign ethnic group at all, bringing with them their god Yahwe and forcibly evicting the indigenous population, but that they gradually evolved out of an amalgam of several ethnic groups, and that the Israelite cult developed on "Palestinian" soil amid the indigenous population. This would make the Israelites "Palestinians" not just in geographical and political terms (under the British Mandate, both Jews and Arabs living in the country were defined as Palestinians), but in ethnic and broader cultural terms as well. While this does not conform to the conventional view, or to the understanding of most Jews (and Arabs, for that matter), it is not easy to either prove or disprove. For although the Bible speaks at length about how the Israelites "took" the land, it is not a history book to draw reliable maps from. There is nothing in the extra-biblical sources, including the extensive Egyptian materials, to document the sojourn in Egypt or the exodus so vividly described in the Bible (and commonly dated to the thirteenth century). Biblical scholar Moshe Weinfeld sees the biblical account of the exodus, and of Moses and Joshua as founding heroes of the "national narration," as a later rendering of a lived experience that was subsequently either "forgotten" or consciously repressed -- a textbook case of the "invented tradition" so familiar to modern students of ethnicity and nationalism."}}

During the Iron Age the Israelites established two related kingdoms, [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The Kingdom of Israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century BCE before falling to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 722 BCE. Israel's southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th or 9th century BCE and later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 586 BCE.

The region became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from c. 740 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=C. L.|title=Israel and the Assyrians: Deuteronomy, the Succession Treaty of Esarhaddon, and the Nature of Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd3PBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=1 October 2014|publisher=SBL Press|isbn=978-1-62837-026-3|quote=Judah's reason(s) for submitting to Assyrian hegemony, at least superficially, require explanation, while at the same time indications of its read-but-disguised resistance to Assyria must be uncovered... The political and military sprawl of the Assyrian empire during the late Iron Age in the southern Levant, especially toward its outer borders, is not quite akin to the single dominating hegemony envisioned by most discussions of hegemony and subversion. In the case of Judah it should be reiterated that Judah was always a vassal state, semi-autonomous and on the periphery of the imperial system, it was never a fully-integrated provincial territory. The implications of this distinction for Judah's relationship with and experience of the Assyrian empire should not be underestimated; studies of the expression of Assyria's cultural and political powers in its provincial territories and vassal states have revealed notable differences in the degree of active involvement in different types of territories. Indeed, the mechanics of the Assyrian empire were hardly designed for direct control over all its vassals' internal activities, provided that a vassal produced the requisite tribute and did not provoke trouble among its neighbors, the level of direct involvement from Assyria remained relatively low. For the entirety of its experience of the Assyrian empire, Judah functioned as a vassal state, rather than a province under direct Assyrian rule, thereby preserving at least a certain degree of autonomy, especially in its internal affairs. Meanwhile, the general atmosphere of Pax Assyriaca in the southern Levant minimized the necessity of (and opportunities for) external conflict. That Assyrians, at least in small numbers, were present in Judah is likely - probably a qipu and his entourage who, if the recent excavators of Ramat Rahel are correct, perhaps resided just outside the capital - but there is far less evidence than is commonly assumed to suggest that these left a direct impression of Assyria on this small vassal state... The point here is that, despite the wider context of Assyria's political and economic power in the ancient Near East in general and the southern Levant in particular, Judah remained a distinguishable and semi-independent southern Levantine state, '''part of but not subsumed by the Assyrian empire''' and, indeed, benefitting from it in significant ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was itself replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in c. 627 BCE.{{sfn|Ahlström|1993|p=655-741, 754-784}} According to the Bible, a war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the king and upper class of the Kingdom of Judah were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylon]]. In 539 BCE, the Babylonian empire was replaced by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. According to the Bible and implications from the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], the exiled population of Judah was allowed to [[The Return to Zion|return to Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Ahlström|1993|p=804-890}} Southern Palestine became a province of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], called [[Idumea]], and the evidence from [[ostraca]] suggests that a [[Nabataean]]-type society, since the Idumeans appear to be connected to the Nabataeans, took shape in southern Palestine in the 4th century B.C.E., and that the [[Qedarite|Qedarite Arab kingdom]] penetrated throughout this area through the period of Persian and Hellenistic dominion.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Graf, 'Petra and the Nabataeans in the Early Hellenistic Period: the literary and archaeological evidence,' in Michel Mouton, Stephan G. Schmid (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpWGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48  ''Men on the Rocks: The Formation of Nabataean Petra,'']  Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH, 2013 pp.35-55 pp.47-48:'the Idumean textgs indicate that a large portion of the community in southern Palestine were Arabs, many of whom have names similar to those in the "Nabataean"onomasticon of later periods.' (p.47).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem functioned as the spiritual center of the various sects of [[Second Temple Judaism]] until it was destroyed in 70 CE. This picture shows the temple as imagined in 1966 in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]].]]
In the 330s BCE, Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, which changed hands several times during the [[wars of the Diadochi]] and later [[Syrian Wars]]. It ultimately fell to the [[Seleucid Empire]] between 219–200 BCE. In 116 BCE, a Seleucid civil war resulted in the independence of certain regions including the [[Hasmonean]] principality in the [[Judaean Mountains]].{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=215}} From 110 BCE, the Hasmoneans extended their authority over much of Palestine, creating a [[Judaea]]n–[[Samaritan]]–[[Idumaean]]–[[Ituraean]]–[[Galilean]] alliance.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=210}} The Judaean (Jewish, see [[Ioudaioi]]) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as [[Judaea]], a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the Judaean Mountains.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=210a||ps=: "In both the Idumaean and the Ituraean alliances, and in the annexation of Samaria, the Judaeans had taken the leading role. They retained it. The whole political–military–religious league that now united the hill country of Palestine from Dan to Beersheba, whatever it called itself, was directed by, and soon came to be called by others, 'the Ioudaioi'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, p.226, "The name Judea no longer referred only to...."&lt;/ref&gt; Between 73–63 BCE, the [[Roman Republic]] extended its influence into the region in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], conquering Judea in 63 BCE, and splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. In around 40 BCE, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] conquered Palestine, deposed the Roman ally [[Hyrcanus II]], and installed a puppet ruler of the Hasmonean line known as [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus II]].{{sfn|Neusner|1983|page=911}}{{sfn|Vermes|2014|page=36}} By 37 BCE, the Parthians withdrew from Palestine.{{sfn|Neusner|1983|page=911}} The three-year [[Ministry of Jesus]], culminating in his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], is estimated to have occurred from 28–30 CE, although the [[historicity of Jesus]] is disputed by a minority of scholars.{{efn-lr|For example, in a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] (a secular agnostic) described the dispute, whilst concluding: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees"&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, 2011, page 285&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 70 CE, [[Titus]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|sacked Jerusalem]], resulting in the dispersal of the city's Jews and Christians to [[Yavne]] and [[Pella]]. In 132 CE, [[Hadrian]] joined the province of Iudaea with [[Galilee]] and the [[Paralia (Palestine)|Paralia]] to form new province of [[Syria Palaestina]], and Jerusalem was renamed "[[Aelia Capitolina]]". Between 259–272, the region fell under the rule of [[Odaenathus]] as King of the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. Following the victory of Christian emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy]], the Christianization of the Roman Empire began, and in 326, Constantine's mother [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] visited [[Jerusalem]] and began the construction of churches and shrines. Palestine became a center of Christianity, attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The [[Samaritan Revolts]] during this period caused their near extinction. In 614 CE, Palestine was annexed by another Persian dynasty; the [[Sassanids]], until returning to Byzantine control in 628 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestine was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]], beginning in 634 CE.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=i}} In 636, the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as [[Jund Filastin]] within the province of [[Bilad al-Sham|Bilâd al-Shâm]] (Greater Syria).{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=47}} In 661, with the [[Assassination of Ali]], [[Muawiyah I]] became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=76}} The [[Dome of the Rock]], completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 2011, p. 122: 'the first great Islamic architectural achievement.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the population was Christian and was to remain so until the conquest of Saladin in 1187. The Muslim conquest apparently had little impact on social and administrative continuities for several decades.{{sfn|Avni|2014|p=314,336}}{{sfn|Flusin|2011|p=199-226, 215|ps=: "The religious situation also evolved under the new masters. Christianity did remain the majority religion, but it lost the privileges it had enjoyed."}}&lt;ref&gt;O'Mahony, 2003, p. 14: ‘Before the Muslim conquest, the population of Palestine was overwhelmingly Christian, albeit with a sizeable Jewish community.’&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|The earlier view, exemplifed by the writings of Moshe Gil, argued for a Jewish-Samaritan majority at the time of conquest: "We may reasonably state that at the time if the Muslim conquest, a large Jewish population still lived in Palestine. We do not know whether they formed the majority but we may assume with some certainly that they did so when grouped together with the Samaritans."{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=3}}}} The word 'Arab' at the time referred predominantly to Bedouin nomads, though Arab settlement is attested in the Judean highlands and near Jerusalem by the 5th century, and some tribes had converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Avni|2014|p=154-55}} The local population engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, and were called ''Nabaț'', referring to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking villagers. A [[hadith|ḥadīth]], brought in the name of a Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine, ordered the Muslim Arabs not to settle in the villages, "for he who abides in villages it is as if he abides in graves".{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=134-136}}

[[File:P1090530 (5147892579).jpg|thumb|The Crusader fortress in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], also known as the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] Fortress, was built during the 12th century.]]
The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], who had spurred a strong economic resurgence in the area,&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley, 2000, pp. 265-343, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; were replaced by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in 750. [[Ramla]] became the administrative centre for the following centuries, while Tiberias became a thriving centre of Muslim scholarship.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=329}} From 878, Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with the Turkish freeman [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], for whom both Jews and Christians prayed when he lay dying{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=306ff. and p. 307 n. 71; p. 308 n. 73}} and ending with the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidid]] rulers. Reverence for Jerusalem increased during this period, with many of the Egyptian rulers choosing to be buried there.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=103|ps=: “Under the Tulunids, Syro-Egyptian territory was deeply imbued with the concept of an extraordinary role devolving upon Jerusalem in Islam as al-Quds, Bayt al-Maqdis or Bayt al-Muqaddas, the “House of Holiness”, the seat of the Last Judgment, the Gate to Paradise for Muslims as well as for Jews and Christians. In the popular conscience, this concept established a bond between the three monotheistic religions. If Ahmad ibn Tulun was interred on the slope of the [[Mokattam|Muqattam]], [[List of governors of Islamic Egypt#Governors during the Second Abbasid Period (905–935)|Isa ibn Musa al-Nashari]] and [[Takin al-Khazari|Takin]] were laid to rest in Jerusalem in 910 and 933, as were their [[Ikhshidid]] successors and [[Abu al-Misk Kafur|Kafir]]. To honor the great general and governor of Syria [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari|Anushtakin al-Dizbiri]], who died in 433/1042, the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] had his remains solemnly conveyed from Aleppo to Jerusalem in 448/1056-57.”}} However, the later period became characterized by persecution of Christians as the threat from Byzantium grew.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=324}} The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], with a predominantly [[Berbers|Berber]] army, conquered the region in 970, a date that marks the beginning of a period of unceasing warfare between numerous enemies, which destroyed Palestine, and in particular devastating its Jewish population.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=336}} Between 1071 and 1073, Palestine was captured by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]],{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=410}} only to be recaptured by the Fatimids in 1098,{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=209, 414}} who then lost the region to the [[Crusaders]] in 1099.

In the course of the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlement]]s in those [[Palestinian territories|territories]]. From 1987 to 1993, the [[First Intifada|First Palestinian Intifada]] against Israel took place, which included the [[Declaration of the State of Palestine]] in 1988 and ended with the [[1993 Oslo Peace Accords]] and the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]].

In 2000, the [[Second Intifada]] (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation barrier]]. In the 2005 [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]], Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous aspects of the territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem continues to be the world's [[List of military occupations|longest military occupation]] in modern times.{{efn-lr|The majority of the international community (including the UN General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the International Criminal Court, and the vast majority of human rights organizations) considers Israel to be continuing to occupying Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The government of Israel and some supporters have, at times, disputed this position of the international community. In 2011, Andrew Sanger explained the situation as follows: "Israel claims it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, maintaining that it is neither a Stale nor a territory occupied or controlled by Israel, but rather it has 'sui generis' status. Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on israel for inter alia electricity, currency, telephone networks, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry. It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.",{{sfn|Sanger|2011|p=429}} and in 2012 Iain Scobbie explained: "Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza"{{sfn|Scobbie|2012|p=295}} and Michelle Gawerc wrote in the same year: "While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace. ln addition, Gaza was dependent upon Israel for water electricity sewage communication networks and for its trade (Gisha 2007. Dowty 2008). ln other words, while Israel maintained that its occupation of Gaza ended with its unilateral disengagement Palestinians - as well as many human right organizations and international bodies - argued that Gaza was by all intents and purposes still occupied."{{sfn|Gawerc|2012|p=44}}&lt;br&gt;For more details of this terminology dispute, including with respect to the current status of the Gaza Strip, see [[Israeli-occupied territories#International views|International views on the Israeli-occupied territories]] and [[Status of territories captured by Israel]].}}{{efn-lr|For an explanation of the differences between an annexed but disputed territory (e.g. [[Tibet]]) and a militarily occupied territory, please see the article [[Military occupation]].

[[File:Satellite image of Israel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Satellite image of the region of Palestine, 2003.]]

===Ancient and Medieval===
The boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history.{{efn-lr|According to the Jewish Encyclopedia published between 1901 and 1906:{{sfn|JE|1906}} "Palestine extends, from 31° to 33° 20′ N. latitude. Its southwest point (at Raphia, Tell Rifaḥ, southwest of Gaza) is about 34° 15′ E. longitude, and its northwest point (mouth of the Liṭani) is at 35° 15′ E. longitude, while the course of the Jordan reaches 35° 35′ to the east. The west-Jordan country has, consequently, a length of about 150 English miles from north to south, and a breadth of about {{convert|23|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the north and {{convert|80|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the south. The area of this region, as measured by the surveyors of the English Palestine Exploration Fund, is about {{convert|6040|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. The east-Jordan district is now being surveyed by the German Palästina-Verein, and although the work is not yet completed, its area may be estimated at {{convert|4000|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. This entire region, as stated above, was not occupied exclusively by the Israelites, for the plain along the coast in the south belonged to the Philistines, and that in the north to the Phoenicians, while in the east-Jordan country, the Israelitic possessions never extended farther than the Arnon (Wadi al-Mujib) in the south, nor did the Israelites ever settle in the most northerly and easterly portions of the plain of Bashan. To-day the number of inhabitants does not exceed 650,000. Palestine, and especially the Israelitic state, covered, therefore, a very small area, approximating that of the state of Vermont." From the Jewish Encyclopedia}}{{efn-lr|According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1911), Palestine is:{{sfn|EB|1911}} "[A] geographical name of rather loose application. Etymological strictness would require it to denote exclusively the narrow strip of coast-land once occupied by the Philistines, from whose name it is derived. It is, however, conventionally used as a name for the territory which, in the Old Testament, is claimed as the inheritance of the pre-exilic Hebrews; thus it may be said generally to denote the southern third of the province of Syria. Except in the west, where the country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, the limit of this territory cannot be laid down on the map as a definite line. The modern subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire are in no sense conterminous with those of antiquity, and hence do not afford a boundary by which Palestine can be separated exactly from the rest of Syria in the north, or from the Sinaitic and Arabian deserts in the south and east; nor are the records of ancient boundaries sufficiently full and definite to make possible the complete demarcation of the country. Even the convention above referred to is inexact: it includes the Philistine territory, claimed but never settled by the Hebrews, and excludes the outlying parts of the large area claimed in Num. xxxiv. as the Hebrew possession (from the " River of Egypt " to Hamath). However, the Hebrews themselves have preserved, in the proverbial expression " from Dan to Beersheba " (Judg. xx.i, &amp;c.), an indication of the normal north-and-south limits of their land; and in defining the area of the country under discussion it is this indication which is generally followed. Taking as a guide the natural features most nearly corresponding to these outlying points, we may describe Palestine as the strip of land extending along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea from the mouth of the Litany or Kasimiya River (33° 20' N.) southward to the mouth of the Wadi Ghuzza; the latter joins the sea in 31° 28' N., a short distance south of Gaza, and runs thence in a south-easterly direction so as to include on its northern side the site of Beersheba. Eastward there is no such definite border. The River Jordan, it is true, marks a line of [[delimitation]] between Western and [[Transjordan (region)|Eastern Palestine]]; but it is practically impossible to say where the latter ends and the Arabian desert begins. Perhaps the line of the pilgrim road from Damascus to Mecca is the most convenient possible boundary. The total length of the region is about {{convert|140|m|2|abbr=on}}; its breadth west of the Jordan ranges from about {{convert|23|m|2|abbr=on}} in the north to about {{convert|80|m|2|abbr=on}} in the south."}} The [[Jordan Rift Valley]] (comprising Wadi Arabah, the [[Dead Sea]] and [[River Jordan]]) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories.&lt;ref name="Aharoni1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yohanan Aharoni|title=The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMtoyNxWw0UC|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24266-4|quote=The desert served as an eastern boundary in times when Transjordan was occupied. But when Transjordan became an unsettled region, a pasturage for desert nomads, then the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea formed the natural eastern boundary of Western Palestine.|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, such as during certain periods during the [[Hasmonean]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader]] states for example, as well as during the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|biblical period]], territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Caliphate]] period, parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as ''[[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdun]]'', while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of ''[[Jund Dimashq]]'', which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of ''[[Jund Filastin]]''.{{sfn|Salibi|1993|p=17-18}}

The boundaries of the area and the ethnic nature of the people referred to by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BCE as Palaestina vary according to context. Sometimes, he uses it to refer to the coast north of [[Mount Carmel]]. Elsewhere, distinguishing the Syrians in Palestine from the Phoenicians, he refers to their land as extending down all the coast from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfn|Herodotus|1858|p=Bk vii, Ch 89}} [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in [[Latin language|Latin]] in the 1st century CE, describes a region of Syria that was "formerly called ''Palaestina''" among the areas of the Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' V.66 and 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Byzantine Period, the Byzantine borders of ''Palaestina'' (''I'' and ''II'', also known as ''Palaestina Prima'', "First Palestine", and ''Palaestina Secunda'', "Second Palestine"), have served as a name for the geographic area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Under Arab rule, ''Filastin'' (or ''Jund Filastin'') was used administratively to refer to what was under the Byzantines ''Palaestina Secunda'' (comprising [[Judaea and Samaria]]), while ''Palaestina Prima'' (comprising the [[Galilee]] region) was renamed ''Urdunn'' ("Jordan" or ''Jund al-Urdunn'').{{sfn|Sharon|1988|p=4}}

===Modern period===
Nineteenth-century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the [[Hejaz Railway|Hejaz-Damascus route]] east of the Jordan River valley.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=19-20}} Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=19-20}} Prior to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] victory in World War I and the [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], which created the British mandate in the [[Levant]], most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vilayet of Damascus]] ([[Syria]]), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the [[Vilayet of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=13}} What later became [[Mandatory Palestine]] was in late Ottoman times divided between the [[Vilayet of Beirut]] ([[Lebanon]]) and the [[Sanjak of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Risalesi/&gt; The [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]].{{sfn|Tessler|1994|p=163}}{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=41-80}}

The British administered [[Mandatory Palestine]] after World War I, having promised to establish a [[homeland for the Jewish people]]. The modern definition of the region follows the boundaries of that entity, which were fixed in the North and East in 1920-23 by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] (including the [[Transjordan memorandum]]) and the [[Paulet–Newcombe Agreement]],{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=133, 159}} and on the South by following the 1906 Turco-Egyptian boundary agreement.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Kliot|1995|p=9}}
{{wide template|Palestinian territory development}}

===Current usage===
{{further|Palestinian people|Palestinian territories|State of Palestine|Palestinian National Authority}}

The region of Palestine is the [[eponym]] for the [[Palestinian people]] and the [[culture of Palestine]], both of which are defined as relating to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The 1968 [[Palestinian National Covenant]] described Palestine as the "homeland of the Arab Palestinian people", with "the boundaries it had during the British Mandate".{{sfn|Said|Hitchens|2001|p=199}}

However, since the 1988 [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]], the term [[State of Palestine]] refers only to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This discrepancy was described by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a negotiated concession in a September 2011 speech to the United Nations: "... we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine - on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/full-transcript-of-abbas-speech-at-un-general-assembly-1.386385|title=Full transcript of Abbas speech at UN General Assembly|date=23 September 2011|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Palestine'' is also sometimes used in a limited sense to refer to the parts of the Palestinian territories currently under the administrative control of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], a quasi-governmental entity which governs parts of the State of Palestine under the terms of the [[Oslo Accords]].{{efn-lr|See for example, Palestinian school textbooks{{sfn|Adwan|2006|p=242|ps=: "The term Palestine in the textbooks refers to Palestinian National Authority."}}}}

Estimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.

The [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the 2nd century CE saw a major shift in the population of Palestine. The sheer scale and scope of the overall destruction has been described by [[Dio Cassius]] in his ''Roman History'', where he notes that Roman war operations in the country had left some 580,000 Jews dead, with many more dying of hunger and disease, while 50 of their most important outposts and 985 of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. "Thus," writes Dio Cassius, "nearly the whole of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]] was made desolate."&lt;ref&gt;''Dio's Roman History'' (trans. Earnest Cary), vol. 8 (books 61–70), [[Loeb Classical Library]]: London 1925, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/diosromanhistory08cassuoft#page/448/mode/2up 449]–[https://archive.org/stream/diosromanhistory08cassuoft#page/450/mode/2up 451]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Taylor | first = Joan E. | publisher = Oxford University Press | quote= Up until this date the Bar Kokhba documents indicate that towns, villages and ports where Jews lived were busy with industry and activity.

According to [[Israeli archaeology|Israeli archaeologists]] Magen Broshi and Yigal Shiloh, the population of ancient Palestine did not exceed one million.{{sfn|Broshi|1979|p=7|ps=: "...&amp;nbsp;the population of Palestine in antiquity did not exceed a million persons. It can also be shown, moreover, that this was more or less the size of the population in the peak period—the late [[Byzantine]] period, around AD 600"}}{{sfn|Shiloh|1980|p=33|ps=: "...&amp;nbsp;the population of the country in the Roman-Byzantine period greatly exceeded that in the Iron Age... If we accept Broshi's population estimates, which appear to be confirmed by the results of recent research, it follows that the estimates for the population during the Iron Age must be set at a lower figure."}} By 300 CE, Christianity had spread so significantly that Jews comprised only a quarter of the population.{{sfn|Krämer|2011|page=15|quote= "By A.D. 300, Jews made up a mere quarter of the total population of the province of Syria Palaestina"}}

===Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods===
In a study of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] registers of the early Ottoman rule of Palestine, [[Bernard Lewis]] reports:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he first half century of Ottoman rule brought a sharp increase in population. The towns grew rapidly, villages became larger and more numerous, and there was an extensive development of agriculture, industry, and trade. The two last were certamly helped to no small extent by the influx of Spanish and other Western Jews. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Safed]], [[Nablus]], [[Ramla|Ramle]], and [[Hebron]]. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.{{sfn|Lewis|1954|p=469-501}}{{Rp|487}}

According to Alexander Scholch, the population of Palestine in 1850 was about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews.{{sfn|Scholch|1985|p=503}}

According to Ottoman statistics studied by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of whom 94% were [[Arabs]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=26}} In 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=30}} McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882; 737,389 in 1914; 725,507 in 1922; 880,746 in 1931; and 1,339,763 in 1946.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=37–38}}

In 1920, the League of Nations' ''Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine'' described the 700,000 people living in Palestine as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, 2011, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Of these, 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.

The Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850, there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years, a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil.

{{See also|Demographics of Israel|Demographics of the Palestinian territories}}
According to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, the total population of Israel was 8.5 million people, of which 75% were [[Jews]], 21% [[Arabs]], and 4% "others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_01&amp;CYear=2016 |title=Population, by Population Group |date=2016 |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Jewish group, 76% were [[Sabra (person)|Sabras]] (born in Israel); the rest were [[Aliyah|olim]] (immigrants)—16% from Europe, the former Soviet republics, and the Americas, and 8% from Asia and Africa, including the [[Arab world|Arab countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_09&amp;CYear=2016 |title=Jews, by Continent of Origin, Continent of Birth &amp; Period of Immigration |date=2016 |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] evaluations, in 2015 the Palestinian population of the [[West Bank]] was approximately 2.9 million and that of the [[Gaza Strip]] was 1.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/gover_e.htm |title=Estimated Population in the Palestinian Territory Mid-Year by Governorate, 1997-2016 |date=2016 |publisher=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics |access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaza's population is expected to increase to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.{{sfn|UN News Centre|2012}}

Both Israeli and Palestinian statistics include Arab residents of [[East Jerusalem]] in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mezzofiore |first=Gianluca |date=2 January 2015 |title=Will Palestinians outnumber Israeli Jews by 2016? |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/will-palestinians-outnumber-israeli-jews-by-2016-1481628 |website=International Business Times |access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these estimates the total population in the region of Palestine, as defined as Israel and the Palestinian territories, stands approximately 12.8 million.

===Flora distribution===
{{see also|Category:Flora of Palestine (region)|List of native plants of Flora Palaestina (A-B)}}
The [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]] is widely used in recording the distribution of plants. The scheme uses the code "PAL" to refer to the region of Palestine – a Level 3 area. The WGSRPD's Palestine is further divided into Israel (PAL-IS), including the Palestinian territories, and Jordan (PAL-JO), so is larger than some other definitions of "Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brummitt |first=R.K. |year=2001 |title=World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions: Edition 2 |publisher=International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases For Plant Sciences (TDWG) |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tdwg/TDWG_geo2.pdf |accessdate=2016-04-06 |ref=harv |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125135239/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tdwg/TDWG_geo2.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regina Fleszarowa''' (28 March 1888-1 July 1969) was a [[Poles|Polish]] geographer and geologist, who participated in women's rights and served as a Senator in the [[Second Polish Republic]] between 1935 and 1938. Studying at the Sorbonne, in 1913, she received the first PhD in natural sciences awarded to a Polish woman. Considered a pioneer in establishing earth sciences in Poland, she published over 100 works concerning the geography and geology of the country. Her 5 volume bibliography on the history of earth sciences in Poland is considered her greatest achievement. She was awarded the 1st Class Banner of the Order of Labor in 1960.

==Early life==
Regina Zofia Danysz was born on 28 March 1888 in [[Wiśniew, Siedlce County|Wiśniewo]] in the [[Siedlce Governorate]] of [[Russian Poland]] to Piotr Danysz. Her parents owned a small estate in [[Brusów]], where she was raised and completed her elementary education. She went on to study in [[Warsaw]] and [[Kiev]], before moving to [[Zurich]] in 1906. Focusing her education on geography,{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=791}} Danysz moved to Paris in 1907,{{sfn|Górska|1999}} to attend lectures on geography and geology, participating in research trips during the semester breaks to the [[Tatra Mountains]] and [[Kujawy]], which were led by {{ill|Ludomir Sawicki|pl}}. In 1910, she received her [[Bachelor's degree|licenciée]] in science from the [[University of Paris]] in 1910, continuing on with doctoral studies. Studying with [[Eugeniusz Romer]] and [[Charles Vélain]], she prepared a thesis, ''Etude critique d'une carte ancienne de Pologne dresée par Stanislas Staszic (1806)'' (Critical study of an old map of Poland created by Stanislas Staszic [1806]) which analyzed his topographical work in the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Early in 1913, she received the first PhD of natural sciences awarded to a Polish woman.{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=791}}

==Career==
Beginning in 1912, Danysz lectured on topology and was active in the [[Riflemen's Association|Rifle Association]], as well as the women's legionnaires.{{sfn|Senate of Poland|2013}} She began her career in 1913 working with Romer, who was at the [[University of Lviv]], compiling information on atmospheric precipitation over various locations throughout Poland. While working with Romer, she met a fellow geologist, {{ill|Albin Fleszar|pl}}, whom she would later marry. Danysz and Romer published their findings in Warsaw in 1913.{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=791}} Moving to [[Zakopane]] around 1915, she became active in the press for women's rights and served as chair of the Council of Polish Women ({{lang-pl|Rady Polek}}),{{sfn|Górska|1999}} attending the European conventions of the [[International Council of Women]] in Brussels, Dubrovnik and Edinburgh.{{sfn|Senate of Poland|2013}} She and Felszar married and had a son, Mieczysław Albin. The couple worked together on geological surveys in the Carpathian Mountains. After her husband's death in 1916, Fleszarowa and her son moved to Warsaw, where she worked for a short time at the Ministry of Public Enlightenment.{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=792}} In 1918, she helped found the Polish Geographical Society ({{lang-pl|Polskie Towarzystwo Geograficzne, PTG}}).{{sfn|Górska|1999}}

In 1919, Fleszarowa became the librarian for the National Geological Institute in Warsaw.{{sfn|Górska|1999}} and acquired a collection of over 30,000 volumes during her tenure, which lasted until [[World War II]].{{sfn|Senate of Poland|2013}} She simultaneously continued her research, publishing articles such as ''Stanisław Staszic jako przyrodnik'' (Stanisław Staszic as a naturalist, 1926) and ''Spis jaskiń krajowych'' (List of National Caves, 1933) in scientific journals. Between 1920 and 1939, Fleszarowa published 18 texts for the Geological Bibliography of Poland. She also worked as an editor for ''Ziemia'', the journal of the Geographical Society starting in 1929.{{sfn|Górska|1999}} Over her lifetime, Fleszarowa published over 100 articles on the scientific history and geography of Poland,{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=792}} including compiling studies of Russian scientists on Polish territories, gathering information through questionnaires about the geological work done during the Occupation, as well as publishing a biographical dictionary of Polish geologists.{{sfn|Wójcik|1970|p=793}}

'''Urban social geography''' is a sub-field within [[human geography]], looking at the factors within an urban environment that affect human relationships on social, economic and political levels. Those human relationships then feed back into the factors which then shape dynamics of the actual city itself. With numerous inputs and outputs, this study is a constantly evolving field.

Cities are more than just a dot on the map or a set of buildings. [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], a Greek poet, wrote about cities "not the house finely  roofed or the stones of walls well builded, nay, nor canals, and dockyards make the city, but men able to use their opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;Pahl, R. E. (2013). "A perspective on urban sociology". ''Readings in Urban Sociology: Readings in Sociology'', '''3'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities have also been described as prisms in which one can see the social, economic, and geographical characteristics from which they evolved. Urban centers not only have  a disproportionate percentage of the population, but also have a large amount of fixed assets, capital, labor resources, and productive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, L. S., &amp; Ley, D. F. (1993). ''Changing social geography of Canadian cities'' (Vol. 2). McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==
;Social dynamics
:The confines of a city often force various social and ethnic groups to live within close proximity of one another. [[Society|Societies]] are defined as a  collective sense of individuals and the relationships they form.&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr, V. (2009). ''Social geography: a critical introduction''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Within societies, individuals help to distinguish from one another based on social identities. Often times, these social identity differences can result in conflict or in a group attempting to separate from the rest of society. London is one of the most diverse cities in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Helena Horton, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11926139/london-passport-diversity-map.html "This map perfectly displays the diversity of London"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 12 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; where a single street can have restaurants from more than 30 countries, from a vast range of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, P., &amp; Pinch, S. (2014). ''Urban social geography: an introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a dense distribution, conflict may arise. Another prime example of this is [[Kurdistan]]. Though the Kurds do not officially have a country of their own, they govern themselves and see themselves as very different from the Turks and Iraqis that surround them. 
;Economics
:In the age of the [[Industrial Revolution]], many populations shifted from rural, agrarian based into the urban areas. Later in the twentieth century, as manufacturing started to leave urban areas, such as happened in [[Detroit]], this acted as a force of change within urban households. Prior to, a single paycheck could often support a household. After manufacturing shifts, a household often had to shift to a dual-income where both parents have to work to support the family. As an example of the effect this creates, there is then a greater demand for child care in that urban area.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, P., &amp; Pinch, S. (2014). ''Urban social geography: an introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; While some families will stick in the area and change their lifestyles to acclimate, some will choose to leave for greener pastures. As families start to leave urban areas, neighborhoods will either become abandoned or to slowly wither in terms of economic status. This changing of the economy often results in a rise in crime and in deterioration of the physical neighborhoods. As those property values decline, eventually this leads to [[gentrification]] where individuals from outside the urban area will move in and fix up the neighborhood. This process will then force property values up and possibly force longstanding residents to move on. 
;Conflict
:In the relative close confines of a city, differences resulting from political, social, and economic differences can result in conflict amongst competing groups. Conflicts in urban areas are intensified because they are often such an extreme intersection of conflicting ideologies. With the close confines of urban areas, conflicts here often result in the greatest number of fatalities and amounts of property destruction, population displacement, and as a result stress on emergency infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Garba, S. B. (2016). "Population Growth, Governance and Urban Social Conflicts in Africa" in ''Population Growth and Rapid Urbanization in the Developing World'', 210-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime examples of these conflicts have been seen recently in [[South Africa]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Burundi]]. 
;Social media
:In the advent of the [[social media]] age, there has been a tremendous effect on the way which people interact with one another and the choices they make in their daily lives. Traditions depend on culture, however very often individuals will enter into relationships with those who may be within their neighborhood or those whom cross their paths during their daily routine. The advent of social media has changed that dynamic. No longer are individuals limited to relationships with those in their immediate surroundings. Very often, now, individuals are meeting across long distances via social media. When a relationship progresses, these individuals can choose to live with one another. Thus a person from a different culture, and how has different experiences is injected into a new urban environment. Thus feeding into the changing dynamics of the area. Social media is also used as a means to study the activity patterns of urban dwellers. The immense amount of geo-location available, from social media applications, has opened up a whole new method of study. People's geolocation data is helping to feed the study of the activity choices, and to offer insight into how groups of certain types choose particular neighborhoods that fit their interests. Behavioral analysis has opened up ways to hook into lifestyle patterns and their interconnections within transportation science, travel patterns, workplace location choice, restaurant choice, retail establishment type, vehicle ownership, and income levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, S., &amp; Ukkusuri, S. V. (2015). "Location contexts of user check-ins to model urban geo life-style patterns". ''PLoS ONE'', '''10'''(5), e0124819.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Saharan montane xeric woodlands''' is an [[ecoregion]] that extends across several highland regions in the [[Sahara]]. Surrounded at lower elevations by the largely barren Sahara, the West Saharan montane [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric woodlands]] are isolated refuges of plants and animals that can survive in the higher humidity and lower temperatures of the highlands.

==Setting==
The Sahara is a vast desert, stretching across northern Africa from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]]. Some mountains ranges (such as the [[Ahaggar]], [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], [[Tibesti]] and [[Aïr]]) rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and mostly present slightly cooler summer temperatures. These highlands support dry woodlands and shrublands distinct from the hot dry desert lowlands..&lt;ref name = WWF&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1214 | title = Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia | accessdate = 2016-11-27 | publisher = World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ecoregion has an area of {{convert|258,100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The boundaries for the largest part of this ecoregion, which includes the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] [[Ahaggar]] and [[Aïr]] (or [[Azbine]]) massifs, follow the '[[Desert pavement|reg]]s,' '[[hamada]]s' and '[[wadi]]s' above the 1,000 m contour. This covers a good part of southeast Algeria. These areas reach almost 3,000 meters in altitude. Additional areas further south were included within this ecoregion, including the Aïr ou Azbine in northern Niger, [[Dhar Adrar]] in Mauritania, and [[Adrar des Iforas]] in Mali and Algeria, using the 500 m-elevation contour.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

The mountains of the West Saharan Montane Xeric Woodland ecoregion are found within the Sahara Desert and are predominantly of volcanic origin. They rise from the surrounding flat desert landscape or sand dunes and create islands of moister habitat ([[guelta]]) which support flora and fauna. The most important area is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] Plateau, an outlier of the Ahaggar Mountains in Algeria which supports some near-endemic species and some globally threatened [[antelope]]s. The highest point of these mountains is 3,003 meters ([[Mount Tahat]]).&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

Winters are quite rigorous, with an amplitude in temperature of over 20°C. Day temperatures may be over 20°C while nights are freezing. In summer, days are very hot, though less so than in the central Sahara. Rainfall is rare and sporadic.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
Vegetation varies greatly depending on altitude and landscape, in particular wind protection. It is often composed of [[relict]] [[mediterranean]] vegetation.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

In the gueltas, vegetation is very diverse and hosts many animals. Trees may be found at lower elevations, while higher areas mostly host bushes. It is possible to find wild olive trees, or ''[[Olive#Taxonomy|Olea lapperrini]]''. Endemic and rare species include the [[Saharan Cypress]] (“tarout”) ''(Cupressus dupreziana)'' and [[Saharan Myrtle]] ''(Myrtus nivellei)'', both of which are relict Saharan-Mediterranean species. Olive and myrtle trees grow at the bottom of [[wadi]]s, intermittent stream valleys, or beside [[gueltas]] and permanent or temporary waterholes.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

Other species with a preference for moist habitats are ''[[Trianthema#Formerly placed here|Trianthema pentandra]]'', ''[[Lupinus pilosus]]'', and ''[[Convolvulus|Convolvulus fatmensis]]''. ''[[Silene|Silene kiliani]]'', ''[[Acacia laeta]]'', ''[[Vachellia nilotica|A. scorpiodes]]'', and ''[[Cordia|Cordia rochii]]'' grow in wadis. Other representatives of the 28 national Algerian plant rarities found on Tassili n'Ajjer include ''[[Ficus ingens]]'' and ''Anticharis glandulosa''.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Population and conservation==
The human population of the ecoregion is very small, with less than 5 persons per square kilometre. Many people are nomadic though some small cities also exist (such as [[Idlès]]). The vegetation remains fairly intact.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;
