'''Aggborough Stadium''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Kidderminster]], [[England]]. It is the home ground of [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]], and has a capacity of 6,444, of which 3,140 can be [[Seating capacity|seated]]. The ground was also the home of [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] between 2013 and 2016.

==History==
The ground was opened in May 1890 with a single grandstand on the western touchline, and initially included of a banked running track.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p12, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 a new 460-seat grandstand was built, and by [[World War II]] covered areas had been created on the east and southern sides of the ground.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

After the war the running track was replaced by a cycle track. On 27 November 1948 the ground's record attendance of 9,155 was set for an [[FA Cup]] first round replay against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]]. On 14 September 1955 Aggborough Stadium became the first ground to host a floodlit FA Cup match,&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; when they [[Brierley Hill Alliance F.C.|Brierley Hill Alliance]] in a preliminary round replay, with Kidderminster winning 4-2.

A new East Stand was built in 1979, and terracing was created all around the pitch in 1983. The ground was rebuilt in the 1990s, with the cycle track removed and a new Main Stand built in 1994. Covered terracing was added at each end of the pitch.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; When Kidderminster won their first [[Football Conference|Conference]] title in 1994, Aggborough Stadium was not deemed to meet [[The Football League|Football League]] standards and as a result Kidderminster were denied promotion to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]]. By the time Kidderminster won their second Conference title six years later, the ground had been upgraded to Football League standards and promotion was allowed. In 2003 the new 2,040-seat cantilever stand was built to replace the old East Stand.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The '''Argentine Hockey Confederation''' ("Confederación Argentina de Hockey") is the official governing body of [[field hockey]] in [[Argentina]]. It governs the [[Argentina men's national field hockey team|men's]] and the [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|women's]] national teams and club competitions "Liga Nacional de Hockey" (LNH) and "Argentino de Clubes".

Other local competitions, such as the [[Metropolitano de Hockey (Women)|Women's]] and [[Metropolitano de Hockey (Men)|Men's]] Torneo Metropolitano are regulated by the [[Buenos Aires Hockey Association]] (AHBA).

A large number of regional associations (more than 30) are affiliated to CAH, covering the most important provinces of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahockey.org.ar/nuestras-asociadas "Nuestras asociadas", CAH website], 7 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Argentine Hockey Confederation was established on August 26, 1908, formed by three clubs: [[Club Atlético San Isidro]], [[Belgrano Athletic]] and 
[[Club Atlético Ferrocarril General San Martín|Pacific Railway A.C.]]. The first president was Thomas Bell, owner of ''[[Buenos Aires Herald]]'', a newspaper by the [[Great Britain|British]] community of Argentina. The Confederation registered to Hockey Association of England (established 1875).&lt;ref name=weil&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210071907/http://www.hsra.com.ar/arg/historia/part_i.html "Historia del Hockey, I Parte: Una trilogía para la historia", by Eric Weil], ''Todo Nuestro Hockey, N° 1, Buenos Aires, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 the AHC allowed women's teams to join the association. The first team registered was Belgrano Ladies, that played its inaugural game on August 25 vs. St. Catherine's School, being defeated by 1-0.&lt;ref name=weil/&gt;

'''Ball badminton''' is a sport native to [[India]]. It is a [[Racquet|racket]] game, played with a yellow ball made of [[wool]], on a court of fixed dimensions (12 by 24 metres) divided by a net. The game was played as early as 1856 by the royal family in [[Tanjore]], the capital of [[Thanjavur]] district in [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It enjoys the greatest popularity in India. Ball badminton is a fast-paced game; it demands skill, quick reflexes, good judgment, agility, and the ability to control the ball with one's wrist.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballbadmintonfederationofindia.com/about_game.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Games are usually played outdoors during the day. As a result, weather conditions wield a considerable influence, and ball badminton's rules allow the effects of weather conditions to be distributed more-or-less evenly between both teams. More recently, indoor versions of the game have been played under artificial lighting. All-India tournaments are conducted regularly using floodlights in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Puducherry]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]] and [[Karnataka]].    Ball Badminton sport is managed by " Ball Badminton Federation of India" Now Ball badminton game is officially recognised game in India. Total 34 units are affiliated to "Ball badminton federation of india " in which 26 are States units including Bihar, jharkhand, Nagaland etc 5 Public sector units and 3 provisional affiliated units.

==History==
Ball badminton originated in [[Tanjore]],  in Tamil Nadu. It became popular, commanding the interest of the Maharaja of Tanjore. The game has attracted many players from southern India.

Previously, ball badminton was an attractive game for rural boys since it required a minimum of equipment. The game drew a large number of students from South India, resulting in the formation of the Ball Badminton Federation of India in 1954. The BBF was among the first three sports federations—along with the Indian Athletic Federation and the Indian Hockey Federation—to form the Indian Olympic Association in 1961. Ball badminton eventually spread to [[Andhra Pradesh]], and the first national championship was conducted at Hyderabad in 1956. It was later introduced at the junior and sub-junior levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballbadmintonfederationofindia.com/gamehistory.html "Game history" on Ball Badminton Federation of India website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of incumbent
The ball is yellow wool, from 27 to 30&amp;nbsp;grams in weight and from 5 to 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. A standard ball-badminton racket usually weighs from 165 to 185&amp;nbsp;grams and is 63 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm in length. 
The strung oval area of the racket should be 20 to 22 across and 24 to 27&amp;nbsp;cm in length. 
The net is made of fine cord to make a 2&amp;nbsp;cm square mesh along its length and is edged with red tape at the top. 
The entire net is red, white and blue, 100&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 13.5 metres in length. It is tied to a centre pole of 183&amp;nbsp;cm and two poles of 185&amp;nbsp;cm at the sides of the court to maintain the 183&amp;nbsp;cm height of the net at the centre. 
Two posts, each 180 cm high, are fixed one metre outside the court on either side at the end of the line to which the net is tied, strong enough to keep the net well stretched. A hook is fixed at 1.5 metres height to each pole to easily tighten the net whenever necessary.
The size of the court for "fives" teams is 12 metres wide and 24 metres long. It is divided across the middle by a net line over which the net is hung, the ends of which are attached to the tops of the two posts. The serving crease lines are drawn one metre away from each side of the net line and parallel to it. 
The centre line is drawn halfway between the serving crease lines and parallel to the sidelines; this divides the space on each side of the crease line into two halves, known as the right and left courts. 
The boundary lines are marked with white tape, 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The centre and crease lines are to be marked so as to be visible, about 10&amp;nbsp;mm wide&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballbadmintonfederationofindia.com/rules_regulations.html "Rules and regulations" on Ball Badminton Federation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Ball badminton is a [[team]] sport. The ball is served (hit from the right or left court of one side to the diagonally opposite court of the other side). The server begins on the right court and moves to the left court each time a point is scored. The ball may be returned by any opposing player. 
After the first 9th, 18th, and 27nd point the teams change positions, with the server continuing to alternate between the right and left courts. 
The ball is served underhand below the waist, then it must go over the net and beyond the serving crease line on the other side. An overhand service—if the ball is above the server's waist when it is struck—is a fault. The ball must be returned before it touches the ground, and no player may strike the ball twice in succession. 
The server must not serve until the other side is ready; ordinarily, the players of the receiving side are expected to be ready. During the game the player must not leave the court except in the act of playing, if he has an accident, or with the referee's permission for activities such as changing a [[Racquet|racket]], tying a shoelace, or tightening a belt. The referee normally grants a player's request for such activities, unless the ball is in play; however, he has the final right to refuse if he deems such activities delaying tactics. 
In "fives" [[tournament]]s, a team consists of ten formally designated players, any five of whom play while the other five remain on the sidelines with the team manager, ready to play. Doubles tournaments use teams of three players. During a match of two or three games, three player substitutions are allowed. Substitutions may be made at any time during the game. The ball may not be changed during a three-game match set, unless it is damaged.

===Faults===
If a [[fault (tennis)|fault]] is made by the serving team, the serving player shall be replaced by a teammate. If all five players on a team commit a serving fault, the serve goes to the receiving team. If a fault is made by the receiving team, the serving team is awarded a point and continues to serve.
It is a fault if:
* The server is not stationary (both feet on the ground) while serving
* The server misses his stroke
* The ball is served overhand (hits the racket above the server's waist)
* Service is delivered from the wrong court (right instead of left, or vice versa)
* The ball touches the ground before it is returned
* The ball served drops into the wrong court or on a line (center, serving crease, side or boundary)
* A player serves out of turn (before the previous server is out)
* Any part of the server’s body or racket crosses any of the lines when serving (even a foot on line is out of court)
* A "double touch" is made (a player, while making a stroke, hits the ball more than once)
* A "tip" is made (the ball is touched by two rackets of the same team in succession)
* A "clash" is made (the rackets of two or more players clash in playing the ball before, during, or after striking the ball)
* A player—or his racket—crosses the net line during the course of play (i.e. during a rally)
* The ball is sent out of bounds (a player is free to hit a ball going out of bounds back in, but if he misses it he commits a fault)
* The ball touches a player or his uniform, whether inside or outside the court
* A player's racket, in the act of striking, crosses or touches the net
* The ball fails to clear the net either in service or return
* The ball touches the top of the net
* The served ball falls on any line (a ball in rally, however, is faulted only if it fails on the boundary line; it can fall on the center or crease lines)
* The ball is bounced on the ground after the server is warned by the umpire to play
* Delay in serving is caused by passing the ball from one player to another after the umpire has requested play to begin

===Match play===
A match consists of three games. The team that wins two out of three games is the match winner. The team first scoring the 34th point wins a game. 
Teams start each game from the side opposite the one they played the previous game. There is a break of two minutes between the end of the first game and the start of the second game, and five minutes between the second and the third games. 
Choice of side and the right of first service is decided by a coin toss at the beginning of a match. If the team winning the toss chooses to serve, the other team has the choice of side and vice versa. 
At the beginning of a match the referee allows two trials, one from each side. After the trials are over, the umpire shall call "play" and regular play begins. A ball is in play from the time a player attempts to serve until it touches the ground or until a "fault" or "let" (a re-serve) is called by the [[umpire]].

The officiating team consists of one umpire, two or more line referees and a scorer. When the umpire calls "play", if a team refuses to play it forfeits the match. The umpire is the sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is the umpire's responsibility to call "fault" or "let", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls "fault" and immediately corrects himself and calls "play" but the striker fails to return the ball, a "let" is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and one half of the side line opposite the umpire, in addition to any other duties assigned by the umpire. Referees signal the umpire in a code prescribed by the BFF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. The umpire can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.

The umpire is also responsible for the net. He announces the score (for the benefit of the scorer) when a point is scored or a server is out. In announcing the score he calls the number of the serving hand, followed by the score of the serving team and the score of the other team.
If a match is suspended by the umpire for any reason (e.g. weather and light), it is resumed from the point at which it was stopped. In case of a tie between two or more teams in any tournament, a match is not replayed. If the tie is unbroken, teams are ranked based on game and point scores. In a league tournament, if two (or more) teams have identical won/lost records their game scores are used to break the tie.

'''Game Scoring'''

The number of games won and lost by each team in each league match is recorded. Keeping in mind that each match is played as a best of three games, a team winning a match after three games has won two games and lost one. If a team wins a match in two straight games, its official won/lost record is 3–0. The losing team in each case has a record of 1–2 and 0–3, respectively. The difference between the number of games won and lost is a team's game score. The team with the highest game score is the winner in the event of a tie; if two or more teams have the same game score, their point scores will also break the tie.

'''Point Score'''

Points scored in each game by each team in all league matches are recorded. A team winning a match in two straight games, after recording the points scored for and against in the two games played also receives 35 points in favour and zero points against for the third (unplayed) game. Correspondingly, zero points in favour and 35 points against are recorded for the losing team. The difference between total points in favour and against in all the matches is a team's point score. The team scoring the most net points (for minus against) is the winner.

===Discipline===
The umpire can warn a player if the player behaves on-court in a manner bringing discredit to the referee, other players or the officials, or otherwise lowering the image of the game. A second warning triggers a yellow card. A third warning triggers a red card and ejection from the game; following a red card, the player's team continues with four players. A team manager substitute for a player shown a yellow card, if a sufficient number of substitutions remain.

===Umpire duties===
* Since the umpire is the most important official, he should be well-versed in the rules of ball badminton
* Before the play begins, he makes necessary entries on the score sheet and hands it to the scorer for use and obtaining signatures of each team captain when the match ends
* Check net height and other ground arrangements
* Instructs line referees and scorer
* Instructs both the terms on discipline, major rules and recent rule changes
* Carefully consider his decisions, since his judgments are final; a player may only appeal based on a rule
* A line referee’s decision is final in all judgment calls on his own line; the umpire does not ordinarily overrule him. If a line referee's vision is blocked, the umpire may make the call if he can; otherwise a ‘let’ should be given
* If a decision is impossible, the umpire gives a ‘let’. He should not consult the players or spectators
* The umpire is responsible for all lines not covered by line referees
* When the umpire is uncertain whether there has been an infringement of a rule, ‘fault’ should not be called. A ‘let’ should be given
* The umpire should remember the game is for players, and keeps play in progress without unnecessary interruption
* In summation, the umpire should control the game firmly

'''Bogside Racecourse''' was a [[horse racing]] track situated in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], [[Scotland]], on the banks of the [[River Irvine]].  Its first meeting was held on 7 June 1808, and its last on 10 April 1965,&lt;ref name=GD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhoundderby.com/Bogside%20Racecourse.html |title=Bogside Racecourse |publisher=greyhoundderby.com |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is evidence of an event known as the Irvine Marymass Races in the area as far back as 1636, initiated by the [[Earl of Eglinton]].&lt;ref name=IA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irvineayrshire.org/marymass/Eracesearly.htm |title=Early Races |publisher=irvineayrshire.org |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogside's flat course was an undulating, right-handed triangular course of two miles in length.&lt;ref name=GD /&gt;&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;  Its jumps course, meanwhile, was two and a half miles round, with nine plain fences, two open ditches and one water jump.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/BogsideRacecourse |title=Bogside Racecourse |publisher=Secret Scotland |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was here that the first steeplechase recorded in Scotland took place on 25 April 1839.&lt;ref name=IA /&gt;

During its existence it hosted the [[Scottish Grand National]] (now contested at nearby [[Ayr Racecourse|Ayr]]) and twice hosted the [[National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup]] which now takes place at the [[Cheltenham Festival]].  Its other major race was the Bogside Cup.

Among the most notable achievements at the course was jockey Alec Russell riding all six winners in a day on 19 July 1957.&lt;ref name=AJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theapprenticejockey.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/remnants-of-past-bogside-racecourse.html |title=Remnants of the Past: Bogside Racecourse |publisher=The Apprentice Jockey blog |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GG /&gt;

For a short time the racecourse had its own [[railway station]], [[Bogside railway station|Bogside Racecourse]].

In 1963, the [[Horserace Betting Levy Board|Levy Board]] opted to cease funding the course, declaring 'When Ayr is developed as the main Scottish course, racing under both rules, the retention of Bogside, only 12 miles away, cannot be economically justified'.&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geegeez.co.uk/lost-racecourses-2-the-elephant-man/ |title=Lost Racecourses 2: The Elephant Man |publisher=geegeez.co.uk|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racing at Bogside ceased soon thereafter.

[[Point to point (steeplechase)|Point-to-Point]] meetings took place at Bogside until 1994, and evidence of the former racecourse still remains.&lt;ref name=GD /&gt;

The '''Breckenridge 100''' is an [[Marathon Mountain Bike Races|ultra-endurance]] mountain bike race held annually in mid July in [[Breckenridge, Colorado]]. 

At the same time the Breck 100 is being held, the organization offer three others options; solo 68 miles, solo 32 miles and a team relay. Initially this race offered just two distance classes, {{convert|100|mi|km}} and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} and no awards were presented to those doing the shorter version, it simply offered an easier alternative for those riders not ready to race the full 100 miles. The race was part of the [[National Ultra Endurance Series]] until 2012 and will be again in 2017.   

The sprawling course is nestled between three ski resorts and features a distinct cloverleaf format of three loops that each begin and finish in Carter Park, adjacent to historic downtown Breckenridge.  The race crosses the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] three times, once at Wheeler Pass at an elevation over 12,400&amp;nbsp;ft and twice at [[Boreas Pass]] at an elevation of 11,492&amp;nbsp;ft.  The course climbs a total of 13,719 feet, and includes backcountry trails, roads, double track, bike paths, and high mountain stream crossings.

'''CBSSports.com''' (formerly '''CBS SportsLine.com''' and '''SportsLine USA''') is an American sports news website operated by the [[CBS Interactive]] division of [[CBS Corporation]]. It is the website for [[CBS]]'s [[CBS Sports]] division, featuring news, video, and [[fantasy sports]] games.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

===SportsLine===

In 1997, the service entered into a content-sharing partnership with [[Viacom]]. SportsLine also entered into agreements to operate official websites for the [[NCAA]], [[NFL]], and [[PGA Tour]]. The company later launched a co-branded website for [[CBS Sports]] (then-owned by Viacom), CBSSportsLine&lt;ref name="s-s-slviacom"/&gt;

===CBS purchase===
In August 2004, already holding a 38% stake in the company, Viacom announced that it would acquire the remainder of SportsLine in a deal valued at $46 million ($1.75 per-share), and re-align it with the [[CBS Sports]] division (owing to Viacom's ownership of CBS at the time).&lt;ref name="s-s-slviacom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sportsline.com Taking Viacom's Buyout Offer|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-08-03/business/0408020325_1_sportsline-viacom-stock-offer|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=Sun-Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viacom Purchases All of SportsLine.com|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/viacom-purchases-all-sportslinecom-74089|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=Adweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company originally operated as a division of CBS Sports, reporting to its president [[Sean McManus (television executive)|Sean McManus]].

===Fantasy Sports===
CBSSports.com got into the fantasy sports business early on, producing games in 1997. In 1998, CBSSports.com partnered with Daedalus World Wide Corporation, a producer of online fantasy sports products. CBSSports.com would acquire Daedalus World Wide Corporation in 1999, using their products as the basis of its fantasy sports business going forward. Initially, CBSSports.com charged a subscription fee to play its fantasy games. However, in July 2000 the company decided to drop all fees associated with its fantasy sports games and starting offering the products free of charge. The switch caused a massive amount{{Quantify|date=August 2012}} of sign-ups for its fantasy sports games. However, the move to free fantasy sports products did not last long as just two years later CBSSports.com switched back to a subscription-based model to run their fantasy sports business. Behind the popularity of the CBSSports.com Commissioner product, which has been voted the best fantasy sports league manager service by the FSTA in eight of the last nine years,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} fantasy sports are a significant portion{{Quantify|date=August 2012}} of CBSSports.com's business.

In August 2015, the [[Sportsline|SportsLine]] brand was revived for a new subscription-based site featuring advanced statistics, [[sports betting]] and [[handicapping]] content. CBS continues to own the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS Bets Fantasy Sports Fans Will Pay for a New Site With an Old Name|url=http://recode.net/2015/08/03/cbs-bets-fantasy-sports-fans-will-pay-for-a-new-site-with-an-old-name/|website=Re/code|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''M.O. Campbell Educational Center''' is an indoor arena in [[Houston, Texas]]. The facility serves as the home [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] court for the five high schools in the [[Aldine Independent School District]] [[Aldine Independent School District|(AISD)]]. The Campbell Center is also used for graduations, theatrical performances, meetings, conferences, banquets and community events.

The arena seats 7,000 people and is located on [[Farm to Market Road 525|Aldine-Bender Road]] just south of [[Beltway 8]], a short distance from [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[Greenspoint Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aldine Athletic Complex brochure|url=http://www.aldineisd.org/common/pages/DisplayFile.aspx?itemId=50121|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=Aldine ISD}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for  M.O.

[[File:Carbide lamp lit.jpg|thumb|right|An acetylene gas miner's lamp]]
'''Carbide lamps''',  or '''acetylene gas lamps''', are simple lamps that produce and burn [[acetylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is created by the reaction of [[calcium carbide]] (CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Cite book| last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot | year = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = | isbn =0-07-049439-8 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetylene gas lamps were used to illuminate buildings, as [[lighthouse]] beacons, and as headlights on motor-cars and bicycles.  Portable acetylene gas lamps, worn on the hat or carried by hand, were widely used in mining in the early twentieth century.  They are still employed by [[caver]]s, hunters, and [[cataphile]]s. Small carbide lamps called "carbide candles" or "smokers" are used for blackening rifle sights to reduce glare. They are used because of the [[soot]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y flame produced by acetylene.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&amp;v=rXF0u8OrLdU|title=Using the Super Smoker|publisher=ray-vin.com|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Carbide lamp on a bicycle.jpg|thumb|right|A French manufactured acetylene gas lamp, of circa 1910, mounted on a [[bicycle]]]]

A mining or caving lamp has calcium carbide placed in a lower chamber, the generator. The upper reservoir is then filled with water.  A threaded valve or other mechanism is used to control the rate at which the water is allowed to drip into the chamber containing the calcium carbide.  By controlling the rate of water flow, the production of acetylene gas is controlled.  This, in turn, controls the flow rate of the gas and the size of the flame at the burner, and thus the amount of light it produces.

This type of lamp generally has a reflector behind the flame to help project the light forward. An acetylene gas powered lamp produces a bright, broad light.  Many cavers prefer this type of unfocused light as it improves peripheral vision in the complete dark. The reaction of carbide with water is exothermic and produces a fair amount of heat independent of the flame.  In cold caves, carbide lamp users can use this heat to help stave off hypothermia.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, C. E. (1996). An illuminating reaction. The Science Teacher, 63(5), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acetylene [[redox|combusts]] easily in the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]:

When all of the carbide in a lamp has been reacted, the carbide chamber contains a wet paste of slaked lime ([[Calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) which can be used to make a [[cement]]. This is emptied into a waste bag and the chamber can be refilled.

==History==
In 1892, [[Thomas Willson]] discovered an economically efficient process for creating calcium carbide in an [[electric arc furnace]] from a mixture of lime and coke.  The arc furnace provides the high temperature required to drive the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Domestic lighting with acetylene gas was introduced  circa 1894 and bicycle lamps from 1896. In France, [[Gustave Trouvé]], a Parisian electrical engineer, also made domestic acetylene lamps and [[gasometers]].

The first carbide bicycle lamp developed in the United States was [[patent]]ed in [[New York (state)|New York]] on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|656874}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early lamp design is shown in a [[patent]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota]] on October 21, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|711871}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, [[Gustaf Dalén]] invented the [[Dalén light]]. This combined two of Dalén's previous inventions: the substrate [[Agamassan]] and the [[Sun valve]]. Inventions and improvements to carbide lamps continued for decades.&lt;ref&gt; For example on March 10, 1925 Andrew Prader of [[Spokane, Washington]] was granted {{US Patent|1,528,848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After carbide lamp open flames were implicated in an Illinois coal-seam methane gas explosion that killed 54 miners, the [[1932 Moweaqua Coal Mine disaster]],&lt;ref&gt;Fifty-First Annual Coal Report of Illinois, 1932, Department of Mines and Minerals. Journal Printing Co.: Springfield, ILL., 1933&lt;/ref&gt; carbide lamp use declined in United States coal mines.  They continued to be used in the coal pits of other countries, notably [[Russia]] and the [[Ukraine]].

In the birth of the [[cinema of Iquitos]], a carbide lamp was used as light support to [[Film projection|project]] the first film in the [[Casa de Fierro]], in 1900.

==Lighting systems ==
[[Image:Gas Lighting.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for home acetylene gas lighting, 1922]]
Carbide lighting was used in rural and urban areas of the United States which were not served by [[electrification]]. Its use began shortly after 1900 and continued past 1950. [[Calcium carbide]] pellets were placed in a container outside the home, with water piped to the container and allowed to drip on the pellets releasing acetylene. This gas was piped to [[lighting fixture]]s inside the house, where it was burned, creating a very bright flame. Carbide lighting was inexpensive but was prone to [[gas leak]]s and explosions.

Early models of the [[Ford Model T]] automobile used carbide lamps as [[headlamp]]s.  Acetylene lamps were also used on riverboats for night navigation. The [[National Museum of Australia]] has a lamp made in about 1910 that was used on board {{PS|Enterprise}}, a [[paddle steamer]] which has been restored to working order and also in the museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/paddle-steamer-enterprise Paddle Steamer Enterprise, National Museum of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used for [[night hunting]].

==Use in caving==
[[File:Caver In Hollow Hill New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|While LED electric lights have mostly replaced carbide lamps, some still prefer the "old-school" approach of using carbide lamps during recreational [[caving]] excursions.]]
Early [[caving]] enthusiasts, not yet having the advantage of light-weight electrical illumination, introduced the carbide lamp to their hobby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/4/en Caving equipment and culture] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])&lt;/ref&gt; While increasingly replaced by more modern choices, a substantial percentage of cavers still use this method.

In cave surveys, carbide lamps are favoured for the lead or "point" surveyor, who must identify suitable points in the cave to designate as survey stations. The sooty carbide flame may be used to mark cave walls with a station label. Especially favoured for this purpose are all-brass lamps or lamps made with no [[ferromagnetic]] metals, as these lamps do not deflect the needles of a [[magnetic compass]], which is typically read while brightly illuminated from above using the caver's lamp.

Apart from their use as cave surveying tools, many cavers favour carbide lamps for their durability and quality of illumination. They were once favoured for their relative illumination per mass of fuel compared to battery powered devices, but this advantage was largely negated with the advent of high-intensity [[LED]] illumination.

The acetylene producing reaction is [[exothermic]], which means that the lamp's reactor vessel will become quite warm to the touch; this can be used to warm the hands. The heat from the flame can also be used to warm the body by allowing the exhaust gases to flow under a shirt or poncho pulled out from the body, a technique discovered almost immediately by cold miners, and nicknamed by cavers the "Palmer furnace".

[[Image:Fonte Nova2.jpg|300px|thumb|Estádio Fonte Nova.]]
The '''Estádio Fonte Nova''', also known as '''Estádio Octávio Mangabeira''', was a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium inaugurated on January 28, 1951 in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Bahia]],&lt;ref name="templosdofutebol"&gt;{{cite web | title = Estádio Fonte Nova | url=http://mavalem.sites.uol.com.br/ba/Salvador1.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-25 | publisher=Templos do Futebol }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a maximum capacity of 66,080 people.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"&gt;{{cite book | first = | last =  | title = Enciclopédia do Futebol Brasileiro Lance Volume 2 | publisher = Aretê Editorial S/A | location = Rio de Janeiro | year = 2001 | pages = 461&amp;ndash;462| isbn = 85-88651-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was owned by the Bahia government, and was the home ground of [[Esporte Clube Bahia]] and [[Esporte Clube Vitória]].&lt;ref name="templosdofutebol"/&gt; Its formal name honors Octávio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt;

After part of the upper terraces collapsed in 2007, killing 7 people and injuring several others, the government of Bahia announced the demolition of Fonte Nova and the construction of a new stadium, the [[Arena Fonte Nova]], in the same place.

The stadium was nicknamed Fonte Nova because it was located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt;

==History==
The stadium construction ended in 1951. On March 4, 1971, the stadium was reinaugurated, after a great reformation involving the addition of a second tier, which expanded the maximum stadium capacity from 35,000 to 110,000. In the reinauguration day, two matches were played: Bahia against [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], and [[Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória]] against [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]. On that day happened a big tumult, where two people died.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt;

'''Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena''' (nicknamed '''"The Floyd"'''; originally known as '''Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena''') is a 6,925-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Binghamton, New York]].  The Arena was completed in 1973, providing an entertainment venue for residents of the [[Greater Binghamton]] area. The arena contains eight luxury suites, each holding 25 fans (200 total). A longtime home to minor league hockey, the arena is currently home to the [[Binghamton Devils]] of the [[American Hockey League]].

==History==
The first act was the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], in an unfinished Arena in May 1973.  [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] played the first concert at the arena (with [[Bruce Springsteen]] as opener) on June 13, 1973.  The ribbon cutting and first event on ice was with the [[Ice Capades]]; and the Broome Dusters of the [[North American Hockey League]] were the building's first full-time tenant.  The Broome Dusters became the [[Binghamton Dusters]] in 1977 and moved into the [[American Hockey League]].  That AHL franchise would go through a number of name changes, becoming the [[Binghamton Whalers|Whalers]] and [[Binghamton Rangers|Rangers]] before moving in 1997. The [[BC Icemen]], of the [[United Hockey League]], occupied the Arena for five seasons until the AHL returned. From 2002 to 2016, the Arena was home to the [[Binghamton Senators]], who were affiliated with the [[Ottawa Senators]] of the [[National Hockey League]].  In 2017, the Senators were replaced with the [[New Jersey Devils]]' affiliate, the [[Binghamton Devils]].

In 2016 the Arena became the home court for the [http://newyorkinternationalacademy.org/ New York International Academy Eagles], a post grad basketball academy located in Endicott, New York.

The Arena has hosted some notable names in entertainment -[[AC/DC]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[B.B. King]], the [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[The Eagles]],[[Kenny Rogers]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Metallica]], [[Van Halen]], [[Elton John]], [[Keith Sweat]], [[Cher]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]], [[Green Day]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Carrie Underwood]] to name but a few.  Trade shows, the Binghamton Philharmonic, the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], and the Circus all make yearly visits.  Plus, every December, the Arena plays host to the Stop-DWI Holiday Classic, one of the premiere high school basketball tournaments in the nation. In 2016, the arena was awarded the [[New York State Public High School Athletic Association]] boys' basketball championship.  The arena contains 17,000 square feet of space on the arena floor and an additional 12,000 square feet on the concourse.

==Notable events==
[[Elvis Presley]] performed back-to-back sold out concerts at the Arena, May 26 &amp; 27, just prior to his death in the summer of 1977.

The [[New Jersey Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[Hartford Whalers]], [[Washington Capitals]], and [[Ottawa Senators]] of the [[NHL]] have all hosted exhibition games at the Arena.

The [[Grateful Dead]] performed at the Arena on November 6, 1977, May 9, 1979, and April 12, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists |author=Scott, John W. |author2=Dolgushkin, Mike |author3=Nixon, Stu. |year=1999 |publisher=DeadBase |location=Cornish, NH |isbn=1-877657-22-0 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1977 concert will be featured on the upcoming album ''Dave's Picks Volume 25''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Bernstein |date=October 25, 2017 |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/grateful-dead-release-famed-1977-show-daves-picks-volume-25 |title=Grateful Dead to Release Famed 1977 Show as ''Dave's Picks Volume 25'' |website=JamBase |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phish]]'s December 14, 1995 performance at the Arena was released as ''[[Live Phish Volume 1]]'' in 2001.

On June 13, 2005 [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] brought ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' to the Arena, which was broadcast live nationwide on [[television]].

The Arena played host to the 2008 [[American Hockey League|AHL]] All-Star Classic, with the skills contest and game broadcast on consecutive nights on live TV across the US and Canada.

'''Hungary national bandy team''' is competing for [[Hungary]] in the international [[bandy]] tournaments.

== History ==

Hungary national bandy team made its international debut in the [[Rossiya Tournament 1990]] in [[Novosibirsk]], [[Soviet Union]].

Hungary made its world championship debut in [[1991 Bandy World Championship|1991]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandysidan.nu/tavlinginfo.php?EVID=71&amp;sprak=eng&amp;land=3|title=World Championships 1990/91|publisher=Bandysidan|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the team has so far not reached any medals. On 6 January 2014 Hungary came in second in a [[Four nation bandy tournament in 2014|four nation tournament]] in [[Davos]], a centenary celebration of the European Championship of 1913. The other teams were [[Netherlands national bandy team|Netherlands]], [[Czech Republic national bandy team|Czech Republic]], and [[Germany national bandy team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandysidan.nu/tavlinginfo.php?EVID=187&amp;sprak=eng&amp;land=3|publisher=Bandysidan|title=Unofficial European Championships 2013/14|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Senastenytt/InternationelltStorgladjeiDavos/ |title=Internationellt Stor gladje i Davos |publisher=Idrittonline |language=Swedish |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111005949/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Senastenytt/InternationelltStorgladjeiDavos/ |archivedate=January 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the withdrawal by [[Canada national bandy team|Canada]], Hungary will take its place in Division A at the [[2018 Bandy World Championship|2018 WCS]], &lt;ref&gt;[http://bandy-vm2018.ru/node/208 The national team of Canada won’t come to Khabarovsk again.]&lt;/ref&gt; marking the first time Hungary will compete in the elite division, after Division B was created.

'''Konrad Motorsport''' is an [[auto racing]] team initially from [[Austria]], but now based in [[Germany]].  Founded by Austrian racer [[Franz Konrad (racing driver)|Franz Konrad]] in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://konradmotorsport.de/historie/?lang=en|website=konradmotorsport.de|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team has mostly run [[Porsche]]s, although they have also run [[Ferrari]]s, [[Lamborghini]]s, and [[Saleen]]s over their existence.

==History==
[[File:Konrad Saleen 26 Mosport.jpg|thumb|A Konrad Motorport's Saleen S7 at the [[2002 Grand Prix of Mosport]]]]
Initially competing in the [[Interserie]] championship, the team later moved to the [[World Sportscar Championship]] running [[Porsche 962]]s.  In 1991, Franz Konrad designed his own [[Group C]] chassis for the World Sportscar Championship with [[Lamborghini]] backing, known as the [[Konrad KM-011]], although the car was not successful.

The team moved to smaller championships in 1993, where they won the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] and [[Mil Milhas Brasil]]eiras, the later of which they won again in 1995.  The team eventually moved to the [[BPR Global GT Series]] competing with [[Porsche 911 GT2]]s.  By 1997, the team would be involved in multiple racing series, including the [[FIA GT Championship]], [[IMSA GT Championship]], and the [[Porsche Supercup]].  After briefly running [[Lola Cars|Lola]] prototypes, the team eventually switched to running [[Saleen S7]]-Rs in the [[American Le Mans Series]] and [[FIA GT Championship]].

The team returned to running [[Porsche 911 GT3]]-RSRs in 2006, where they won the 24 Hours of Bahrain.  Konrad Motorsport continues to use their Porsches in competition today.

Konrad Motorsports partnered with [[Dempsey Racing]] for the [[2014 United SportsCar Championship season]], fielding a [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche 911 GT America]] in the GTD class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dagys|first=John|title=Davis Rejoins Dempsey Racing, Forms Partnership with Konrad|url=http://sportscar365.com/imsa/tusc/davis-rejoins-dempsey-racing-forms-partnership-with-konrad/|work=Sportscar365.com|publisher=John Dagys Media|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MotoGP Legends''', is the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] hall of fame of [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]].

Since its opening in 2000, 27 racers have been inducted, including both the most successful world champions such as [[Giacomo Agostini]], [[Ángel Nieto]], [[Mike Hailwood]] and [[Carlo Ubbiali]], as well as champions who had died young such as [[Jarno Saarinen]] and [[Daijiro Kato]]. The first MotoGP Legend inductee was [[Mick Doohan]], who was inducted in May 2000 at the [[Mugello Circuit]]. The latest inductee is [[Dani Pedrosa]].
==Inductees==
Inductees with a (†) beside their name indicates that the inductee has passed away, with four of them (Hailwood, Kato, Simoncelli, and Saarinen) were inducted to the MotoGP Legends posthumously. 

Out of the 27 racers who have been inducted, Mamola is the only inductee who didn't win a single championship in his career. Nicky Hayden is the first rider to be inducted while the rider is still active in racing. Hayden, along with Dani Pedrosa, are the only members of the MotoGP Legends to start a race in MotoGP across any classes after getting inducted to MotoGP Legends as they're inducted before their respective final race as an active competitor in MotoGP.

'''Newark Schools Stadium''' (nicknamed "'''The Old Lady of Bloomfield Avenue'''") is the name of two stadiums that were both located on Bloomfield Avenue between Abingdon and Roseville Avenues in the [[Roseville, Newark, New Jersey|Roseville]] section of [[Newark, New Jersey]]. 

The first stadium was used primarily for [[American football|football]] and was built in 1925. It was the home of the [[Newark Tornadoes]] of the [[National Football League]] during the [[1930 NFL season|1930 season]]. The stadium was used for high school football until 2006. [[baseball|Baseball's]] [[Newark Stars]] of the [[Eastern Colored League]], which was a part of the [[Negro Leagues]], also used the stadium in 1926. Its primary use, however, was for Newark's high schools. The original stadium was a reinforced concrete horseshoe shaped venue that had a maximum seating capacity of 25,000.

The original stadium was condemned in 2006 and demolished in 2009. In its place, a brand new Schools Stadium was constructed on the site and the new stadium opened in 2011.

The current Schools Stadium shares some design elements with its predecessor but seats far fewer people (5,600) in two metal bleacher sections. It currently plays host to football games played by [[Barringer High School]], [[East Side High School (Newark, New Jersey)|East Side High School]], and [[Newark Collegiate Academy]]. The new Schools Stadium is one of three venues used by Newark's high schools; [[Malcolm X Shabazz High School|Shabazz High School]] and [[Weequahic High School]] both have football stadiums. Shabazz's field, Shabazz Stadium, is also used by [[Central High School (Newark, New Jersey)|Newark Central High School]]. Weequahic's Untermann Field is also home to [[West Side High School (Newark, New Jersey)|West Side High School]]'s football team.

==Soccer==
For the 1967-68 ASL (American Soccer League) season, the Newark Ukrainian Sitch club moved its home games to this field.  Prior to that season, 'Sitch' played at Ironbound field.  The move to an approx. 25,000 capacity ground was welcomed as an improvement.  The crowds never filled the stadium however and the Ukrainian Weekly refers to crowds only in the hundreds rather than thousands.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ukrainian Weekly'', September 30, 1967 (online archive at http://www.ukrweekly.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
After the Tornadoes folded, Newark's [[American Association (football)|American Association]] team became the primary tenants for the stadium. The American Association was the first attempt at establishing a farm system for the NFL. In 1937, the Tornadoes left [[Orange, New Jersey]] again for Newark. The team was once again called the Newark Tornadoes.  In 1939, the team was purchased by [[George Halas]], the owner of the [[Chicago Bears]], and called the Newark Bears. The Bears played in the stadium until [[World War II]]; the Newark Bombers would play in the same league and stadium in 1946 after the war ended. In 1963, [[Orlando Panthers|another Bears franchise]] would arrive when the Paterson Miners of the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] moved to Newark, took on the Bears name, and played through 1965; its last year in Newark was in the [[Continental Football League]]. Another Continental league team, the [[Jersey Jays]], played its 1969 season in Newark before moving to nearby Jersey City in 1970.

Most of Newark's public school football teams played at the stadium as well until 2006. The Stadium also served, since 1955 until its closing for reconstruction, as the home of the North Newark Little League (formerly the Saint Francis Xavier Little League).

==Baseball==
Schools Stadium was also used for baseball. In 1926, the [[Newark Stars]] of the Negro Leagues' [[Eastern Colored League]] played at stadium. When the stadium was configured for baseball, the distance down the foul lines was so short, that balls hit over the fence were ground rule [[Double (baseball)|doubles]]. High school teams also used the field for baseball until 2006. The Stadium was also the original home of what has become one of the largest youth baseball programs in the City of Newark - the North Newark Little League. Formerly the St. Francis Xavier Little League, the youth of the program utilized the baseball fields from 1955. It was the last organization to have continued use of the facility (even after it was condemned in 2006) right up to the point of its closing for reconstruction.

==Track and field==
Olympian [[Jesse Owens]], once ran [[track and field|track]] there and lost to a Newark local named [[Eulace Peacock]]. Meanwhile, another Olympian, [[Milt Campbell]] began his track career at Newark Schools Stadium. The National Women's Olympic Trials also were held in the stadium in 1928.

==Riots==
During the [[1967 Newark riots]], Schools Stadium served as the staging area for the [[New Jersey National Guard]], who were summoned to Newark to reinforce the overwhelmed [[Newark Police Department]].

==Decline and a new stadium==
Years of neglect allowed the stadium to experience a large amount of deterioration and compromised structural integrity. At various points in its later years, parts of the stadium's wooden bleachers were blocked off with fencing to prevent spectators from sitting in these seats.

In 2006, a capital bond request was approved by the Newark City Council that included $63.7 million in funding for 14 projects that ranged from a new robotics center to the rebuilding of Schools Stadium. In Fall 2006, Schools Stadium was condemned and three years later the stadium was demolished. Barringer and East Side moved their games to Untermann Field while the new stadium was being constructed.

It was built according to plans of architect [[Hanns Ostler]] in only 106 days for the [[figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] and [[ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]].  It was opened on 16 December 1934. It contained an ice rink 30 meters by 60 meters for these games. It was a partially covered stadium. The stadium was able to hold 10,000 people.

The Olympia-Kunsteistadion was rebuilt in 1939/1940 for the planned [[1940 Winter Olympics]] which were canceled due to [[World War II]].

After the war it was reopened in 1948. the stadium received a complete roof in 1964. From 1990 to 1994 it was rebuilt again and is now the Olympic-Eissport-Zentrum of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

[[Image:Orienteering symbol.svg|thumb|right|150px|The standard international [[orienteering]] symbol is used to designate a '''''checkpoint''''' on rogaining courses.]]

'''Rogaining''' is an [[orienteering]] sport of long distance cross-country [[navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=N. |last1=Phillips |first2=R. |last2=Phillips |year=2000 |title=Rogaining Cross-Country Navigation |publisher=Outdoor Recreation in Australia |isbn=0-9593329-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types.  In a rogaine, teams of 2–5 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score.  Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport. Championship rogaines are 24 hours long, but rogaines can be as short as two hours.

==History==
Rogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organized by the [[Melbourne University]] Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April 1976, in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade.

The word rogaining is derived from the names of three of the founders, Rod Phillips, Gail Davis (née Phillips) and Neil Phillips (RoGaiNe, hence 'rogaining', 'rogainer' etc.) who were all members of the [[Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew]] which organized the world's first rogaine. The name was formally adopted by the Victorian Rogaining Association at its inaugural annual general meeting in August 1976 and accepted by [[Scouts Australia]] and University [[hiking|bushwalking]] groups to give the new sport an identity in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[World Rogaining Championships]] were first held in 1992, and then every two years from 1996 to 2012. Since then they have been held annually, with the country chosen two years in advance by the [[International Rogaining Federation]]. As of 2017 this has changed back again to every two years.

==Basic play==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Teams of two to five members visit as many checkpoints as possible in the time allowed.   Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors.  Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints).  Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest.  A central base camp known as a "hash house" provides hot meals throughout the event and teams may return at any time to eat, rest or sleep.  Teams travel at their own pace and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at their own level of competition and comfort.  Team members stay within earshot of each other.

The duration of a championship rogaine is 24 hours, but shorter variations such as 3-, 6-, 8-, 12- and 15-hour events are also held (sometimes concurrently with a 24-hour event).  Depending on the terrain, experienced rogaining teams can cover more than one hundred kilometers over the 24-hour period.  There have also been longer events (dubbed "Endurogaines") lasting 48 and 50 hours.  In their native Australia, rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship.  They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants.  A competitive 24-hour rogaine requires a map area of around 250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (c. 100&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), for relatively flat terrain; terrain with significant climbs may require far less or far more area, depending on the placement of checkpoints.

==Variants==
[[Image:Rogainecontrol.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rogaine control placed on a small knoll. While some controls can be relatively easy to spot, many require careful navigation to locate.]]Other forms of rogaining are popular, particularly in [[Australia]] during the months when normal rogaines are not held because of the weather. Popular variations include:

* Metrogaine: An event of usually around 6 hours and held in predominantly urban areas.
* Cyclogaine: Usually run for six hours in areas with trails suitable for [[mountainbiking]].
* Snogaine: Held in areas that are snowbound and participants may either [[snowshoe]] or [[skiing|ski]] to reach checkpoints.
* Paddlogaine: A rogaine on a water covered area, such as a set of interconnected lakes. Participants can generally use any human-powered [[watercraft]].

'''Sunland Park Racetrack &amp; Casino''' is a [[racino]] located in [[Sunland Park, New Mexico]], a [[suburb]] of [[El Paso, Texas]].

Opened in 1959 as a [[Thoroughbred racing]] track, Sunland Park was the only legalized gambling venue in the region for many years. In 1999, at a time when horse racing was experiencing a decline as [[casino]]s and [[New Mexico Lottery|lotteries]] became commonplace, New Mexico legislators allowed [[slot machine]]s at the track. Now with over 700 machines in play, racing at Sunland has benefited greatly, with purses increasing from a $35,000 daily average in the early 1990s to nearly a quarter million per day today.&lt;ref name="racing"&gt;[http://www.sunland-park.com/racing.htm Sunland-Park.com: Racing history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunland Park was the track where [[jockey]]s [[Jerry Bailey]], [[Pat Valenzuela]], and [[Cash Asmussen]] got their starts. [[Bill Shoemaker]], who hails from the area, also rode at Sunland.&lt;ref name="racing"/&gt;

The casino, open 112 hours a week, also offers many electronic table games including roulette, blackjack and Texas Hold 'Em.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunland-park.com/about/ Sunland-Park.com: About Sunland Park Racetrack &amp; Casino]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 racing season, which features both Thoroughbreds and [[Quarter Horse]]s, runs from December 28 through May 5. Live racing is traditionally offered four days each week on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Year-round [[Simulcast]] wagering is also available on racetracks across the country.

The live racing season is highlighted by the [[Sunland Derby]], run at 1⅛ miles for three-year-olds in late March of each year. The race was granted a Grade 3 status for the 2010 running and now is an important preparatory race for the [[Kentucky Derby]]. The graded ranking is important because the Kentucky Derby uses graded stakes earnings to determine which horse(s) will be permitted to enter if its limit of 20 entries is exceeded.

Other notable races include the $200,000 [[Sunland Park Oaks]], 1-1/16 miles Kentucky Oaks prep for fillies; the $100,000 Harry W. Henson Handicap for fillies and mares at one mile; the $100,000 Riley Allison Derby, 6½ [[furlong]]s for three-year-olds; the $100,000 Mine That Bird Derby, 1 1/16-mile prep for the Sunland Derby; and the $150,000 Sunland Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up at 1⅛ miles. 

Sunland's top quarter horse race is the $350,000 Grade 1 Championship at Sunland Park, run late each December at 440 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ntra.com/content.aspx?type=news&amp;id=26656 |title=WinStar Derby once again meet highlight|publisher=NTRA.com/''[[Daily Racing Form]]''|first=Mary|last=Rampellini|date=July 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083924/http://www.ntra.com/content.aspx?type=news&amp;id=26656 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $140,000 added New Mexican Spring Futurity at 300 yards is run in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/sports/ci_6490957|publisher=''[[El Paso Times]]''|date=July 29, 2007|title=Sunland Park meet starts Dec. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After strong showings during her championship season in Australia, Gahan was invited to the [[Connecticut Sun]]'s training camp before the [[2008 WNBA season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/sun/news/sunsigngahan.html|title=SUN: Sun Sign Gahan to Training Camp|publisher=wnba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gahan was released before the season began.

===Europe===
After spending an additional year at college to complete her degree, Gahan began her career in Greece. In 2003, she spent her first season with Peiraikos, before moving to Panathinaikos for her second season in [[Greek Women's Basketball League|A1 Ethniki Women's Basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclones.com/news/2006/6/23/323626.aspx|title=Q&amp;A with Former Cyclone Women's Basketball Standout Tracy Gahan - Iowa State Athletics|publisher=cyclones.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Gahan travelled west to Ireland, playing for [[DCU Mercy]] in the Irish Women's Super League. After a season away, she returned in 2007 after her Australian season concluded, signing with [[Botaş SK]] for the conclusion of the Turkish season.

After three years in Australia, Gahan played for PTS Lider Pruszków in Poland's [[Basket Liga Kobiet]]. Towards the end of the 2009–10 season, she switched to Tęcza Leszno for the remainder of her time in Poland.

===Australia===
In 2006, Gahan signed with the [[Adelaide Lightning]] to play in the [[Women's National Basketball League]], Australia's premier women's league and the strongest league in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/team_info.cgi?action=PSTATS&amp;pID=191728650&amp;client=1-4478-56413-116972-5935177|title=Player statistics for TRACY GAHAN|publisher=sportstg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her second season with the Lightning, Gahan was awarded a place in the [[WNBL All-Star Five]] for [[2007–08 WNBL season|2007–08]]. The Lightning would also go on to take home the 2007–08 WNBL Championship. She returned to the league in 2010, signing with the [[Dandenong Rangers]].

'''Walhalla Idrottsplats''' (short form '''Walhalla IP''') was a sports [[stadium]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] with a total capacity of 8,000. It was located near [[Korsvägen]], on the site that currently is the [[Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre]]. Walhalla IP was in use between 1908 and 1921.

== History ==

Walhalla IP was built by [[Örgryte IS]] in 1908 to replace their old stadium [[Balders Hage]] as the [[Swedish Football Association]] had banned international football on it.{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}} The city deeded land to Örgryte IS for this purpose, which today is used by the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre, opposite to amusement park [[Liseberg]].{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}}{{sfn|IFK Göteborg – Arenor genom åren}}

The roofed main stand had 1,200 seats, and another 6,800 spectators could be accommodated on terraces around the pitch. The stadium was modelled after [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s [[Anfield]].{{sfn|Persson|2011|p=131}} At the time of its opening, Walhalla IP was the most modern stadium in [[Scandinavia]].{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}} The pitch was enclosed by a slightly longer than 400 metre [[All-weather running track|running track]] and other [[sport of athletics|athletics]] facilities,{{sfn|Persson|2011|p=131}} and several Swedish athletics championships were held in the stadium.{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}}

The inauguration match was played on 6 September 1908, between Örgryte and German champions [[BFC Viktoria 1889|Viktoria Berlin]].{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}} It was the main venue for sports events in Sweden until [[Stockholm Olympic Stadium]] was opened in 1912. The [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national team]] played its first ever international against [[England national football team]] on Walhalla IP in September 1908,{{sfn|Persson|2011|p=133}} and [[IFK Göteborg]]—that rented the stadium from Örgryte IS—won their two first [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championships]], in 1908 and 1910, there.{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}}

In 1912, the stadium was the scene of one of the first known instances of Swedish [[football hooliganism]]. IFK Göteborg supporters [[pitch invasion|stormed the pitch]] to get to the referee, who had first awarded IFK a penalty kick against Örgryte IS in the last minute of the match, but then blown the final whistle before the kick could be taken.{{sfn|Persson|2011|pp=225–227}}

IFK Göteborg left Walhalla IP for newly built [[Gamla Ullevi (1916)|Ullevi]] in 1916.{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}} The land on which Walhalla IP stood was chosen as one of the sites for the 1923 [[Gothenburg Exhibition (1923)|Gothenburg Tercentennial Jubilee Exposition]], and Örgryte IS was forced to move from the stadium as a consequence.{{sfn|Josephson|Jönsson|2004|p=44}}{{sfn|Alsiö|Persson|2011}} The last event at Walhalla was an international sports gala arranged by Örgryte and held on 25 September 1921.{{sfn|Jerneryd|1981|p=96}}

'''Watertown Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Watertown, South Dakota]].  It was primarily used for [[baseball]] and [[American football]] and was the home of minor-league professional baseball including, most recently (c. 1970), the [[Watertown Expos]] of the [[Northern League (baseball, 1902–71)|Northern League]].  The ballpark has a capacity of 5,000 people and opened in 1940.

It is currently used by [[Watertown High School (South Dakota)|Watertown High School]], to host baseball and football games.

The stadium was built around the 1930s as [[Works Progress Administration]] Project 4265, and still holds the original plaque dedicating the structure. It is the home of the Watertown Arrows.

In 2005, an additional building was built to the East of the field. This building houses restrooms, a concession stand, and both Varsity and Sophomore locker rooms.

The stadium was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  It is built of reinforced concrete.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=00000721}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Watertown Stadium |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Megan D. Eades |date=January 2000 |accessdate=January 10, 2018}} With {{NRHP url|id=00000721|photos=y|title=two photos from 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its NRHP nomination asserts:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Watertown Stadium is a physical reminder of the unprecedented use of government aid to construct community improvements, particularly for recreation and leisure. Built in 1940, the stadium was reportedly planned as a band shelter, since the W.P.A. wanted to build them as part of their music project. According to a local story, the structure was built in phases, and it initially looked more like a bandshell. During the last phase of construction, it was then modified for use as an athletic stadium. Although the story is rumor, the existing structure is an excellent example of W.P.A. construction and one of the more outstanding federal relief projects in the northeastern part of the state.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wire Loop Game.jpg|thumb|A man playing a version of the wire loop game.]]

A '''wire loop game''' is a game which involves guiding a metal loop (a 'probe') along a serpentine length of [[wire]] without touching the loop to the wire. The loop and wire are connected to a power source in such a way that, if they touch, they form a closed [[electric circuit]]. The [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is connected to a light or sound-emitting device of some sort, so that when the loop and the wire touch, the light-emitting device will light up, and the sound-emitting device will make a sound, traditionally a buzzing noise.

Virtual versions of this game exist, in which the [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]] takes the place of the wire loop and must be guided down a narrow, twisting path without touching the sides. Both versions require well-developed [[hand-eye coordination]]. The difficulty of any particular game depends in part on the shape of the twisted wire and the size of the loop.

One example of a virtual version of this game is 'The Wire Loop Game VR', designed to be played in [[virtual reality]] using the [[HTC Vive]] headset. The player holds a motion controller, representing the hoop in the game, and uses it to move along the wire inside a virtual room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/495390/|title=The Wire Loop Game VR|publisher=Steam}}&lt;/ref&gt;
