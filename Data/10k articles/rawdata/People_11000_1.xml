[[File:Noorat Alan Marshall Memorial Tree 001.JPG|thumb|A tree dedicated to the memory of Marshall in his childhood home town of [[Noorat]].]]
'''Alan Marshall''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}}, (2 May 1902 – 21 January 1984) was an Australian writer, story teller, humanist and social documenter.

Marshall received the Australian Literature Society Short Story Award three times, the first in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marshall, Alan|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/marshall-alan-14935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His best known book, ''I Can Jump Puddles'' (1955) is the first of a three-part autobiography. The other two books are ''This is the Grass'' (1962) and ''In Mine Own Heart'' (1963).

==Life and work==
Marshall was born in [[Noorat, Victoria]]. At six years old he contracted [[polio]], which left him with a physical disability that grew worse as he grew older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116385769 |title=Alan Marshall dies in nursing home. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=22 January 1984 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |page=1|edition=SUNDAY EDITION|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, he resolved to be a writer, and in ''I Can Jump Puddles'' he demonstrated an almost total recall of his childhood in [[Noorat, Victoria|Noorat]]. The characters and places of his book are thinly disguised from real life: ''Mount Turalla'' is [[Mount Noorat]], ''Lake Turalla'' is [[Lake Keilambete]], the ''Curruthers'' are the ''Blacks'', Mrs. Conlon is Mary Conlon of Dixie, Terang, and his best friend, ''Joe'' from the books, is Leo Carmody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Marshall, Alan | title=Papers of Alan Marshall, 1903–1982 | publication-date=1903 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/23400100 | accessdate=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian poet and contemporary, [[Hal Porter]] wrote in 1965 that Marshall was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''... the warmest and most centralized human being ... To walk with ease and nonchalance the straight, straight line between appearing tragic and appearing willfully brave is a feat so complex I should not like to have to rake in the dark for the super-bravery to accomplish it.''&lt;ref&gt;Porter (1965) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Mount Noorat summit.jpg|thumb|Mount Noorat crater and summit, featured in Marshall's books]]
Marshall wrote numerous short stories, mainly set in [[The bush#Australia|the bush]]. He also wrote newspaper columns and magazine articles. He traveled widely in Australia and overseas. He also collected and published [[Indigenous Australian]] stories and legends.

His literary friends and associates included [[John Morrison (author)|John Morrison]] and [[Clem Christesen]].

He married Olive Dulcie Dixon in May 1941 and they had 2 daughters, Katherine and Jennifer. The couple divorced in 1957.

Marshall died in 1984. His remains are interred at [[Nillumbik]] (Diamond Creek) Cemetery, Victoria, Australia.

==Television series==
{{main|I Can Jump Puddles}}
In 1981 the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] produced a nine-part mini-series of Marshall's autobiographical stories.&lt;ref name= screen&gt;{{cite web |title= ''I can jump puddles'' (1981) |publisher= [[Australian Screen]] |url= http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/i-can-jump-puddles/ |accessdate= 2008-02-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119174224/http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/i-can-jump-puddles/| archivedate= 19 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor, [[Adam Garnett]], won the 1982 [[Logie Awards of 1982|Logie Awards]] for ''Best Performance by a Juvenile'', for his role as Alan Marshall in the series.

==Recognition==

In 1937, he completed his first novel, ''How Beautiful Are Thy Feet'', which remained unpublished until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaren|first=John|title=Marshall, Alan (1902–1984)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/marshall-alan-14935|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the [[1981 Australia Day Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Alan Marshall |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870259&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true |website=It's an Honour |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]].

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
In [[Christian theology]] and [[ecclesiology]], the '''apostles''' ({{Lang-el|ἀπόστολος|lit=one who is sent away|translit=apóstolos}}), particularly the '''Twelve Apostles''' (also known as the '''Twelve Disciples''' or simply the '''Twelve'''),  were the primary [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus]], the central figure in [[Christianity]]. During the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[ministry of Jesus]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]], the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of [[the gospel]] message of Jesus. The word ''disciple'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''apostle''; for instance, the [[Gospel of John]] makes no distinction between the two terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In modern usage, prominent [[missionaries]] are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the [[Latin]] equivalent of ''apostle'', i.e. ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''missionary''. For example, [[Saint Patrick]] (AD 373–463) was the "Apostle of Ireland", [[Saint Boniface]] (680–755) was the "Apostle to the [[German people|Germans]]", &lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; [[José de Anchieta|Saint José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) was the "Apostle of Brazil" and [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur|Saint Peter of Betancur]] (1626–1667) was the "Apostle of Guatemala".

While [[Christian tradition]] often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different [[Four Evangelists|gospel writers]] give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one [[gospel]] are not mentioned in others. The [[commissioning of the Twelve Apostles]] during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. After his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus sent eleven of them (minus [[Judas Iscariot]], who by then had [[Judas Iscariot#Death|died]]) by the [[Great Commission]] to spread his teachings to all nations.  This event is commonly called the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. There is also an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] tradition derived from the [[Gospel of Luke]] of there having been as many as [[Seventy disciples|70 apostles]] during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in [[early Christianity]], notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.

The period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the [[Apostolic Age]].&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; During the 1st century AD, the apostles established [[Local church|churches]] throughout the territories of the [[Roman Empire]] and, according to tradition, through the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[India]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles by Constantinople master (early 14th c., Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|The [[Synaxis]] of the Twelve Apostles. Russian, 14th century, Moscow Museum.]]

The word "apostle" comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπόστολος}}}} (''apóstolos''), formed from the prefix {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπό-}}}} (''apó-'', "from") and root {{lang|grc|{{linktext|στέλλω}}}} (''stéllō'', "I send", "I depart") and originally meaning "messenger, envoy". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a "delegate".&lt;ref name="Coppieters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bauer lexicon|Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]]'' argues that its Christian use translated a [[Judaism|Jewish]] position known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the ''sheliach'' ({{lang|he|{{linktext|שליח}}}}). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the English "[[missionary]]".

==Background==
In the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have [[Hebrew name]]s, although some have [[Greek name]]s. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.&lt;ref&gt;As was not uncommon for Jews at the time, some of them had two names, one Hebrew/Aramaic and the other Greek. Hence the lists of Jesus' twelve apostles contains 14 names not 12; the 4 [[Greek language|Greek]] names are [[Andrew]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thaddaeus]] and [[Lebbaeus]]. Reference: [[John P. Meier]]'s [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew|''A Marginal Jew'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bibleref2|Mark|6:7–13}} states that Jesus initially sent out these twelve in pairs ([[cf.]] {{Bibleref2|Mt|10:5–42}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk|9:1–6}}) to towns in [[Galilee]]. The text states that their initial instructions were to [[Faith healing|heal the sick]] and [[Exorcism#Jesus|drive out demons]].&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt; They are also instructed to "take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, but to wear sandals, and not put on two [[tunic]]s", and that if any town rejects them they ought to shake the dust off their feet as they leave, a gesture which some scholars think was meant as a contemptuous threat (Miller 26).{{incomplete citation|date= November 2018}} Their carrying of just a staff (Matthew and Luke say not even a staff) is sometimes given as the reason for the use by Christian [[bishop]]s of a [[Crosier|staff of office]] in those denominations that believe they maintain an [[apostolic succession]].

Later in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as [[Great Commission|having been commissioned to preach]] the Gospel to "all the nations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mt|28:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk|13:10}}, and {{Bibleref2-nb|Mk|16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether Jew or Gentile.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:1–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:7–9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:4–8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|10:1–11:18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is "built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone".{{Bibleref2c|Ephesians|2:19–20}}
{{anchor|The twelve apostles}}

Although not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a [[Jews|Jew]] named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Jesus]] and is considered "the apostle of the [[Gentiles]]",{{Bibleref2c|Romans|11:13|9}} for his missions to spread the gospel message after [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|his conversion]]. In his writings, the [[Pauline epistles|epistles]] to Christian churches throughout the [[Levant]], Paul did not restrict the term "apostle" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor [[Barnabas]] as an apostle.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Apostle." Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280290-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted usage appears in the [[Revelation to John]].&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 21:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century AD]], association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as [[apostolic see]]s. Paul's epistles were accepted as [[Development of the New Testament canon|scripture]], and two of the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] gospels were associated with apostles, as were other [[New Testament]] works. Various Christian texts, such as the ''[[Didache]]'' and the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', were attributed to the apostles. [[Bishops]] traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and [[Early centers of Christianity|established churches]] across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by [[apostolic succession]], from the Twelve.&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; Early [[Church Fathers]] who came to be associated with apostles, such as [[Pope Clement I]] with [[St. Peter]], are referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. The [[Apostles' Creed]], popular in the [[Western Christianity|West]], was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.

==The Twelve Apostles==

===Calling by Jesus===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Exhortation to the Apostles (Recommandation aux apôtres) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Exhortation to the Apostles''.]]
{{Main|Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles}}
The three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from [[Temptation of Jesus|being tempted by the devil]].

Despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that  Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of [[John the Baptist]], and started following Jesus as soon as [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus had been baptized]].

Albright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian [[ascetics]].

[[File:De zielenvisserij - Fishing for souls (Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne).jpg|thumb|[[Adriaen van de Venne]]'s ''Fishers of Men''. Oil on panel, 1614]]
Matthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of [[Zebedee]]. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.

This parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.

The Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]], he noticed, while teaching, a [[tax collector]] in his booth. The tax collector,  called Matthew in {{Bibleref2|Matthew |9:9}}, Levi in {{Bibleref2|Mark|2:14}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:27}}, is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as [[villain]]s in Jewish society, and the [[Pharisees]] are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the [[righteous]], but sinners".

===Replacement of Judas===
{{Main article|Saint Matthias}}
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:
{{quote|Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus... For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry... For it is written in the book of Psalms, "Let his habitation be made desolate, Let no one dwell therein", and, "Let another take his office"...&amp;nbsp;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become with us a witness to his resurrection|{{Bibleref2|Acts|1:15–26}}}}

So, between the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension of Christ]] and the day of [[Pentecost]], the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by [[Sortition|casting lots]], a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|16:33}}). The lot fell upon [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#replace-judas |title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul the Apostle in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:
{{quote|For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.|{{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:3–8}}}}

===Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles===
{{Paul}}
{{Main article|Paul the Apostle}}
In his writings, [[Paul the Apostle]], although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an ''apostle'', one "born out of due time" (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1}}, 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his [[Road to Damascus]] vision and given the name "Paul".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1–9}} With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:2}} He referred to himself as the ''apostle of the Gentiles.''{{Bibleref2c|Rom|11:13|9}}

As the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states, "It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt;

Since Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|9:3–19}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|9:26–27}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|22:6–21}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|26:12–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the latter's death and [[resurrection]] (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|9:1||1 Cor. 9:1 "Am I not an apostle?"}}) and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.

James, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the [[Gentiles]] (specifically those not [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) as of equal authority as Peter's to the [[Jew]]s (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul.{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:7–9}} "James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars&amp;nbsp;... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews."{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:9}}

Paul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|15:9||1 Cor. 15:9}} In addition, despite the [[Matthew 10|Little Commission of Matthew 10]], the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as [[Cornelius the Centurion]] is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the [[Great Commission]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Jesus]] is specifically to "all nations".

===Deaths===

Of the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with [[John the Evangelist|John]] surviving into old age. Only the death of [[James, son of Zebedee]] is described in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#james-the-elder|title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:5}} says that Judas Iscariot threw the silver he received for betraying Jesus down in the Temple, then went and hanged himself. {{bibleref2|Acts|1:18}} says that he purchased a field, then "falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out".

According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|author-link1=Edward Gibbon|year=1826|chapter=Chapter XVI.

Harper for Collins &amp; Hanney|page=20|quote=27. In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria the glory of martyrdom was confined to St. Peter, St. Paul and St. James.

===List of the Twelve Apostles as identified by the Bible===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15464 Jesus and the 12 apostles in Domus Galileae.JPG|thumb|Jesus and the 12 apostles in [[Domus Galilaeae]], [[Israel]].]]
Each of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Mark|3:13–19|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:1–4|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|6:12–16|9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:13|9}}) indicate that all the apostles were men. The [[canonical gospels]] and the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the [[Gospel of Luke]] differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists "Judas the son of James" instead of "Thaddeus". (For more information, see [[Jude the Apostle]].) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the [[Gospel of John]] does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to "the Twelve" ({{Bibleref2|John|6:67–71|9}}), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms "apostles" and "disciples" in John.

| [[Andronicus of Pannonia|Andronicus]] and [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] || {{Bibleref2|Rom|16:7}} || Paul states that Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles." This has been traditionally interpreted in one of two ways:
* That Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles," that is, distinguished apostles.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Andronicus and Junia were "well known ''among'' the apostles" meaning "well known ''to'' the apostles"
If the first view is correct then Paul may be referring to a female apostle&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, J. D. and Reed, J. L., ''In Search of Paul'', Harper San Francisco (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116. {{ISBN|978-0-06-051457-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. ''Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend''. Oxford University Press, US. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - the Greek name (Iounian) is in the accusative and could be either Junia (a woman) or Junias (a man)&lt;ref name="CBMW"&gt;CBMW [https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/a-female-apostle/ "A Female Apostle?"], June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Later manuscripts add accents to make it unambiguously Junias, however while "Junia" was a common name, "Junias" was not&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006" /&gt;, and both options are favoured by different Bible translations.

In the second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the apostles.

Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the two views were correct. The second view, in recent years, has been defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel B. Wallace and Michael H. Burer, "Was Junia Really an Apostle?" NTS 47 (2001): 76–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women who followed Jesus===
In Luke (10:38–42), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: "[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salomé]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.

===The Seventy disciples===
{{main|Seventy disciples}}

The "seventy disciples" or "seventy-two disciples" (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the "Seventy Apostles") were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:1–24}}. According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to (Luke 10:1) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521-524; 543-545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''.

Various English translations published, standard reference translation by [[Philip Schaff]] at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxxix.html CCEL]: "[C]oncerning Matthew he [Papias] writes as follows: 'So then(963) Matthew wrote the oracles in the Hebrew language, and every one interpreted them as he was able.'(964)" Online version includes footnotes 963 and 964 by Schaff.&lt;br&gt;[[Irenaeus]] (died c.&amp;nbsp;202 CE) makes a similar comment, possibly also drawing on Papias, in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.ii.html Book III, Chapter 1]: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect".

Although the [[Gospel of John]] is anonymous,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=215}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Christian tradition historically has attributed it to [[John the Apostle]], son of [[Zebedee]] and one of Jesus' [[Twelve Apostles]]. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving [[Johannine epistles]] that commentators treat the four books,{{sfn|Lindars|1990|p=63}}{{Incomplete short citation}} along with the [[Book of Revelation]], as a single corpus of [[Johannine literature]], albeit not necessarily written by the same author.{{refn|group=Notes|{{harvnb|Harris|2006|p=479}}{{Incomplete short citation}}: "Most scholars believe that the same person wrote all three documents but that he is not to be identified with either the apostle John or the author of the Gospel."}}

The [[Gospel of Mark]] was written anonymously.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63–64}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Early Christian tradition, first attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis]], ascribes it to [[John Mark]], a companion and interpreter of the [[apostle Peter]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=155–56}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Hence its author is often called [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=36}}{{Incomplete short citation}} It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13–14}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

According to Church tradition, [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the [[Gospel of Luke]], though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172, 235}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

'''Saints Behnam, Sarah, and the Forty Martyrs''' were 4th-century Christians who suffered martyrdom during the reign of [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref name="Rassam"&gt;Rassam (2005), pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; They are venerated as saints in the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] and their feast day is 10 December.

==Biography==
Behnam and Sarah were born in the 4th-century in [[Adiabene]], and were the children of [[Sinharib]], an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king.&lt;ref name="socwus"&gt;''[http://www.soc-wus.org/page.php?id=206 Mor Behnam saint and martyr]''. Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch -  Archdiocese of the Western United States&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst hunting on [[Mount Alfaf]] with forty slaves, Behnam became separated from his entourage and was forced to spend the night on the mountain. He received a dream in which an angel instructed him to seek [[Mar Mattai|Saint Matthew]], who lived on the mountain, as the saint could heal his sister Sarah, who was afflicted with leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ar icon}} ''[http://www.syrian-orthodox.com/readnews.php?id=215 القديس مار متى الناسك والشهداء مار بهنام وسارة ورفاقهما الأربعين]''. Syrian Orthodox Patriarchate&lt;/ref&gt; Behnam met with his entourage the next day, and they discovered Saint Matthew in a cave and requested he join them on their return to the city, to which he agreed.&lt;ref name="MOSC"&gt;''[http://www.neamericandiocese.org/feasts-memorials.60/sts-behnam-sarah-and-the-40-martyrs.aspx Sts. Behnam, Sarah, and the 40 Martyrs]''. Northeast American Diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church&lt;/ref&gt;

Behnam and his entourage returned to the city ahead of Saint Matthew and told his mother of his dream and the saint. His mother allowed Behnam and Sarah to return to the saint in secret, and he healed Sarah of her leprosy, after which Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves were baptised and Saint Matthew returned to Mount Alfaf. Sinharib discovered Behnam and Sarah's conversion and demanded they abandon Christianity. Stalwart in their faith, Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves, fled to Mount Alfaf, but were slain by soldiers sent by Sinharib.&lt;ref name="MOSC" /&gt;

Following his children's death, Sinharib was afflicted with madness. Behnam spoke to his mother in a dream and instructed her to seek Saint Matthew, as he could heal the king.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://sor.cua.edu/ChMon/MosulDMattay/index.html Dayro d-Mor Matay]''. Syriac Orthodox Resources&lt;/ref&gt; The queen took the king to the place of Behnam and Sarah's death, where he met with Saint Matthew and was cured. Sinharib and his wife returned to [[Assur]] with the saint and were baptised.&lt;ref&gt;Radner (2015), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The king had a monument to the martyrs built at the place of their martyrdom, and, at the request of Saint Matthew, constructed a monastery on Mount Alfaf, which later became known as the [[Mar Mattai monastery|Monastery of St. Matthew]].&lt;ref name="Rassam"/&gt; Sinharib had the martyrs buried at the monastery atop Mount Alfaf.&lt;ref name="MOSC" /&gt; In the 6th century, a Persian merchant constructed a shrine to the martyrs alongside Sinharib's monument, and would later develop into the [[Mar Behnam Monastery|Monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah]].&lt;ref name="socwus"/&gt;

'''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''', or '''Saint Catharine of Alexandria''', also known as '''Saint Catherine of the Wheel''' and '''The Great Martyr Saint Catherine''' ({{lang-cop|Ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ Ⲕⲁⲧⲧⲣⲓⲛ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|'''ἡ Ἁγία Αἰκατερίνη ἡ Μεγαλομάρτυς'''}} "Holy Catherine the Great Martyr"; {{lang-la|Catharina Alexandrina}}), is, according to tradition, a [[Christian]] [[saint]] and [[virgin]], who was [[martyred]] in the early 4th century at the hands of the pagan emperor [[Maxentius]]. According to her [[hagiography]], she was both a princess and a noted scholar, who became a [[Christian]] around the age of 14, converted hundreds of people to [[Christianity]], and was [[martyred]] around the age of 18. More than 1,100 years following her [[martyrdom]], [[Saint Joan of Arc]] identified Catherine as one of the Saints who appeared to her and counselled her.&lt;ref name="joan"&gt;Williard Trask, ''Joan of Arc: In Her Own Words'' (Turtle Point Press, 1996), 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] venerates her as a [[Great Martyr]] and celebrates her [[feast day]] on 24 or 25 November (depending on the regional tradition). In Catholicism she is traditionally revered as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. In 1969 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] removed her [[feast day]] from the [[General Roman Calendar]];&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; however, she continued to be commemorated in the [[Roman Martyrology]] on 25 November.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, her feast was restored to the General Roman Calendar as an optional memorial.

Some modern scholars consider that the legend of Catherine was probably based on the life and murder of the [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher [[Hypatia]], with reversed roles of Christians and pagans.&lt;ref name=walsh&gt;See Christine Walsh: ''The Cult of St Katherine of Alexandria in Early Medieval Europe'', Aldershot 2007, p. 3–26; [[Michael A.

==Legend==

According to the traditional narrative, Catherine was the daughter of Constus, the governor of [[Alexandria|Egyptian Alexandria]] during the reign of the emperor [[Maximian]] (286–305).&lt;ref name=oca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oca.org/saints/lives/2015/11/24/103382-greatmartyr-catherine-of-alexandria|title=Great Martyr Catherine of Alexandria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age she devoted herself to study. A vision of the Madonna and Child persuaded her to become a Christian. When the persecutions began under [[Maxentius]], she went to the emperor and rebuked him for his cruelty. The emperor summoned 50 of the best [[pagan]] [[philosophers]] and [[orators]] to dispute with her, hoping that they would refute her pro-Christian arguments, but Catherine won the debate. Several of her adversaries, conquered by her eloquence, declared themselves Christians and were at once put to death.&lt;ref name=clugnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03445a.htm |title=Clugnet, Léon.

===Torture and martyrdom===
[[File:IconEcaterina.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Icon]] of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, with scenes from her martyrdom]]
Catherine was then [[Scourge|scourged]] and imprisoned. She was scourged so cruelly and for so long, that her whole body was covered with wounds, from which the blood flowed in streams. The spectators wept with pity; but Catherine, strengthened by God, stood with her eyes raised to heaven, without giving a sign of suffering or fear. He ordered her to be imprisoned without food, so she would starve to death.  During the confinement, angels tended her wounds with [[Salve|salve]]. Catherine was fed daily by a dove from Heaven and Christ also visited her, encouraging her to fight bravely, and promised her the crown of everlasting glory. 

During her imprisonment, over 200 people came to see her, including Maxentius' wife, [[Valeria Maximilla]]; all converted to Christianity and were subsequently [[martyr]]ed.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99687/Saint-Catherine-of-Alexandria |title=Saint Catherine of Alexandria |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later, when the dungeon was opened, a bright light and fragrant perfume filled it, and Catherine came forth even more radiant and beautiful. 

Upon the failure of Maxentius to make Catherine yield by way of torture, he tried to win the beautiful and wise princess over by proposing marriage. The saint refused, declaring that her [[spouse]] was [[Jesus Christ]], to whom she had consecrated her [[virginity]]. 

The furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on a spiked [[breaking wheel]], but, at her touch, it shattered.&lt;ref name=clugnet/&gt; Maxentius ordered her to be [[decapitation|beheaded]]. Catherine herself ordered the execution to commence. A milk-like substance rather than blood flowed from her neck. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Burial===
Angels transported her body to the highest mountain (now called [[Mt. Saint Catherine]]) next to Mount Sinai, where God gave His Law. In 850, her incorrupt body was discovered by monks from the Sinai Monastery. The monks found on the surface of the granite on which her body lay, an impression of the form of her body. Her hair still growing, and a constant stream of the most heavenly fragranced healing oil issuing from her body. This oil produced countless miracles. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} 

In the 6th century, the Eastern [[Emperor Justinian]] had established what is now [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]] (which is in fact dedicated to the [[Transfiguration of Christ]]). Her relics include her left hand, often warm to the touch and her head. Her incorrupt body is not publicly displayed. Countless people make the pilgrimage to the Monastery to receive miracle healing from Saint Catherine.

[[File:Vita di santa Caterina vergine e martire.tif|thumb|[[Pietro Aretino]], ''Vita di santa Caterina vergine e martire'', 1636.]]

Donald Attwater dismisses what he calls the "legend" of Saint Catherine, arguing for a lack of any "positive evidence that she ever existed outside the mind of some Greek writer who first composed what he intended to be simply an edifying romance."&lt;ref name="Azevedo2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mateus Soares de Azevedo|title=Ye shall know the truth: Christianity and the perennial philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAGfNe2sN5EC&amp;pg=PA324|accessdate=2011-11-29|date=25 April 2005|publisher=World Wisdom, Inc|isbn=978-0-941532-69-3|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Davis writes that "assiduous research has failed to identify Catherine with any historical personage" and has theorized that Catherine was an invention inspired to provide a counterpart to the story of the slightly later pagan philosopher [[Hypatia of Alexandria]] (c. 350–370 – March 415 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Harold Thayer Davis, ''Alexandria: The Golden City'' (Principia Press of Illinois, 1957), p&amp;nbsp;441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, pp. 214–217&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship supports Davis’ assumption that the legend of Catherine of Alexandria was probably based on the life and murder of Hypatia, with the roles of Christians and pagans reversed.&lt;ref name=walsh/&gt; 

Hypatia was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher, who was brutally murdered by a [[Christianity|Christian]] mob after being accused of exacerbating a conflict between two prominent figures in Alexandria, the governor, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], and the bishop, [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0j94OFipg2MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria''.

Sometimes cited as a possible inspiration of Saint Catherine, the writer [[Eusebius]] wrote, around the year 320, that the Emperor had ordered a young Christian woman to come to his palace to become his mistress, and when she refused, he had her punished, by having her banished and her estates confiscated.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/saintsHoly/saints/C/stcatherineofalexandria.asp |title=Catherine of Alexandria, ''Lives of Saints''|publisher=John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc.|date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eusebius did not name the woman, she had been identified with [[Dorothea of Alexandria]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The earliest surviving account of Saint Catherine's life comes around 600 years after the traditional date of her martyrdom, in the ''menologium'' a document compiled for Emperor [[Basil II]] (976), although the rediscovery of her relics at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] was about 800,&lt;ref name=ArdeeneDobson&gt;S. R. T. O d'Ardeene and E. J. Dobson, ''Seinte Katerine: Re-Edited from MS Bodley 34 and other Manuscripts'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1981), xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably implies an existing cult at that date (the common name of the monastery developed after the discovery). The monastery was built by order of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (reigned 527–565), enclosing the Chapel of the [[Burning Bush]] ordered to be built by [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], the mother of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], at the site where [[Moses]] is supposed to have seen the burning bush; the living bush on the grounds is purportedly the original. It is also referred to as "Saint Helen's Chapel". The main church was built between 548 and 565, and the monastery became a major pilgrimage site for devotees of Catherine and the other [[relic]]s and sacred sites there. Saint Catherine's Monastery survives, and is a famous repository of [[early Christian art]], [[architecture]] and [[illuminated manuscript]]s that remains open to tourists and visiting scholars. The site is sacred to [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://st-katherine.net/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=29 | title=The Monastery | publisher=St-Katherine-net | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The Cult of St Katherine of Alexandria in Early Medieval Europe'', Christine Walsh discusses "the historical Katherine": &lt;blockquote&gt;"As we have seen, the cult of St Katherine of Alexandria probably originated in oral traditions from the 4th-century [[Diocletianic Persecution]]s of Christians in Alexandria.  There is no evidence that Katherine herself was a historical figure and she may well have been a composite drawn from memories of women persecuted for their faith.  Many aspects of her ''Passio'' are clearly legendary and conform to well-known hagiographical topoi."&lt;ref name=ChristineWalsh&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com  Walsh, Christine. ''The Cult of St Katherine of Alexandria in Early Medieval Europe'' Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington, 2007, p 143]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Name ==
[[Rufinus (poet)|Rufinus]] states that her first name was Dorothea ({{lang-gr|Δωροθέα}}), and that at her christening she acquired the name Aikaterina ({{lang|grc|Αικατερίνα}}), a name that signifies her pure, clean and uncontaminated nature (from Greek {{lang|grc|αιέν καθαρινά}} 'ever clean').

==Medieval cult==
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 014.jpg|thumb|left|''Catherine of Alexandria'', by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]

Saint Catherine was one of the most important saints in the religious culture of the [[late Middle Ages]], and arguably considered the most important of the virgin martyrs, a group including [[Saint Agnes]], [[Margaret of Antioch]], [[Saint Barbara]], [[Saint Lucy]], [[Valerie of Limoges]] and many others. Her power as an [[Intercession|intercessor]] was renowned and firmly established in most versions of her [[hagiography]], in which she specifically entreats Christ at the moment of her death to answer the prayers of those who remember her martyrdom and invoke her name.

The development of her medieval [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was spurred by the reported rediscovery of her body around the year 800 at [[Mount Sinai]], with hair still growing and a constant stream of [[myrrh|healing oil]] issuing from her body.&lt;ref name=ArdeeneDobson /&gt; There are several [[pilgrimage]] narratives that chronicle the journey to [[Mount Sinai]], most notably those of [[John Mandeville]] and Friar [[Felix Fabri]].&lt;ref&gt;John Mandeville, ''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'' (New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1964); Felix Fabri, ''The Wanderings of Felix Fabri'' (New York: AMS Press, 1971), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the monastery at Mount Sinai was the best-known site of Catherine [[pilgrimage]], but was also the most difficult to reach. The most prominent Western shrine was the monastery in [[Rouen]] that claimed to house Catherine's fingers. It was not alone in the west, however, accompanied by many, scattered shrines and altars dedicated to Catherine, which existed throughout France and England. Some were better known sites, such as [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] and [[Westminster Cathedral|Westminster]], which claimed a phial of her oil, brought back from [[Mount Sinai]] by [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Christine. "The Role of the Normans in the Development of the Cult of St. Katherine", ''St. Katherine of Alexandria: Texts and Contexts in Western Medieval Europe'' (eds. Jacqueline Jenkins and Katherine J. Lewis) (Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2003), p.31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Katherine J., ''Pilgrimage and the Cult of St. Katherine of Alexandria in Late Medieval England'', ''St. Katherine of Alexandria: Texts and Contexts in Western Medieval Europe'' (eds. Jacqueline Jenkins and Katherine J. Lewis) (Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2003),p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Other shrines, such as [[St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire]] were the focus of generally local pilgrimage, many of which are only identified by brief mentions in various texts, rather than by physical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Pilgrimage and the Cult of St. Katherine'', 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Catharine's College, Cambridge]] was founded on St Catharine’s Day (25 November) 1473 by Robert Woodlark (the then-[[Provost (education)|provost]] of [[King's College Cambridge]]) who sought to create a small community of scholars who would study exclusively theology and philosophy. Wodelarke may have chosen the name in homage to [[Catherine of Valois]], mother of [[Henry VI of England]], although it is more likely that it was named as part of the Renaissance cult of Saint Catharine, who was a patron saint of learning. At any rate, the college was ready for habitation and formally founded on Saint Catharine’s Day, 1473.

Saint Catherine also had a large female following, whose devotion was less likely to be expressed through [[pilgrimage]]. The importance of the [[virginity|virgin]] martyrs as the focus of devotion and models for proper feminine behavior increased during the [[Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bugge, ''Virginitas: An Essay in the History of the Medieval Ideal'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1975), 132; Katherine J. Lewis, ''The Cult of St. Katherine of Alexiandria in Late Medieval England'' (Rochester: The Boydell Press, 2000), 229; Eamon Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England c. 1400-c. 1580'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, St. Catherine in particular was used as an [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]] for women, a status which at times superseded her [[Intercession|intercessory]] role.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine J. Lewis, "Model Girls? Virgin-Martyrs and the Training of Young Women in Late Medieval England" in ''Young Medieval Women'' eds. Katherine J. Lewis, Noel James Menuge and Kim M. Phillips (New York: St. Martin's PRess, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Christine de Pizan]] and [[Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry|Geoffrey de la Tour Landry]] point to Catherine as a paragon for young women, emphasizing her model of virginity and "wifely chastity."&lt;ref&gt;Christine de Pizan, ''[[The Treasure of the City of Ladies]]'' trans. by Sarah Lawson (New York: Penguin Books, 2003), 146; Christine de Pizan, ''The Book of the City of Ladies'' trans. by Rosalind Brown-Grant (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), 203; Rebecca Barnhouse, ''The Book of the Knight of the Tower'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006), 126, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the early 14th century the [[Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine]] first appears in hagiographical literature and, soon after, in art. In the Western church, the popularity of her cult began to reduce in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Her principal symbol is the spiked wheel, which has become known as the [[Breaking wheel|Catherine wheel]], and her [[feast day]] is celebrated on 25 November by most Christian churches. However, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] celebrates it on 24 November (as do also the Polish, Serbian and Bulgarian Orthodox Churches). The exact origin of this tradition is not known. In 11th-century [[Kievan Rus'|Kyivan-Rus]], the feast day was celebrated on 25 November. Saint [[Dimitry of Rostov]] in his ''Kniga zhyttia sviatykh'' (''Book of the Lives of the Saints''), T.1 (1689) places the date of celebration on 24 November. A story that [[Catherine II of Russia|Empress Catherine the Great]] did not wish to share her patronal feast with the [[Afterfeast|Leavetaking]] of the feast of the [[Presentation of Mary|Presentation of the Theotokos]] and hence changed the date is not supported by historical evidence. One of the first Roman Catholic churches to be built in Russia, the [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|Catholic Church of St. Catherine]], was named after Catherine of Alexandria because she was Catherine the Great's patron.  A footnote to the entry for 25th November in ''The Synaxarion'' compiled by Hieromonk Makarios of Simonos Petra states: "Until the 16th century, the memory of St Catherine was observed on 24 Nov.   According to a note by Bartholomew of Koutloumousiou inserted in the ''Menaion'', the Fathers of Sinai transferred the date to 25 Nov. in order that the feast might be kept with greater solemnity."

The 1908 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes her historical importance:

{{quote|text=Ranked with [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret]] and [[Saint Barbara|St Barbara]] as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers|fourteen most helpful saints in heaven]], she was unceasingly praised by preachers and sung by poets. It is believed that [[Jacques-Benigne Bossuet]] dedicated to her one of his most beautiful [[panegyric]]s and that [[Adam of St. Victor]] wrote a magnificent poem in her honour: ''Vox Sonora nostri chori''.}}

In many places her feast was celebrated with the utmost solemnity, servile work being suppressed and the devotions attended by great numbers of people. In several dioceses of [[France]] it was observed as a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] up to the beginning of the 17th century, the splendour of its ceremonial eclipsing that of the feasts of some of the [[Apostles]]. Numberless chapels were placed under her patronage and her statue was found in nearly all churches, representing her according to medieval [[iconography]] with a [[breaking wheel|wheel]], her instrument of torture.

In France, unwed women who have attained the age of 25 wear richly decorated bonnets on the day of her feast. This custom gave rise to the French idiom ''{{lang|fr|coiffer Sainte-Catherine}}'' ('don St. Catherine's bonnet'), to describe an unmarried woman between the ages of 25 and 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france-pittoresque.com/spip.php?article5227 |language=fr |title=Coiffer sainte Catherine |work=La France pittoresque |date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In memory of her sacrifice in some homes, Egyptian and other Middle Eastern foods are offered for her feast, such as [[hummus]] or [[tabbouleh]] salads. Favorites also are melons cut into circles with sherbet "hubs," or cookies shaped as spiked wheels with icing. 

Meanwhile, owing to several circumstances in his life, [[Nicholas of Myra|Saint Nicholas of Myra]] was considered the patron of young [[bachelors]] and [[student]]s, and Saint Catherine became the patroness of young [[maiden]]s and female students. Looked upon as the holiest and most illustrious of the virgins of Christ after the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], it was natural that she, of all others, should be worthy to watch over the virgins of the cloister and the young women of the world. The [[breaking wheel|spiked wheel]] having become emblematic of the saint, [[wheelwright]]s and [[mechanic]]s placed themselves under her patronage. Finally, as according to tradition, she not only remained a virgin by governing her passions and conquered her executioners by wearying their patience, but triumphed in science by closing the mouths of [[sophist]]s, her intercession was implored by [[theologian]]s, [[apologist]]s, [[pulpit]] [[orator]]s, and [[philosopher]]s. Before studying, writing, or preaching, they besought her to illumine their minds, guide their pens, and impart eloquence to their words. This devotion to Saint Catherine which assumed such vast proportions in [[Europe]] after the [[Crusades]],&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; received additional [[wiktionary:éclat|éclat]] in [[France]] in the beginning of the 15th century, when it was rumoured that she had spoken to [[Jeanne d'Arc|Joan of Arc]] and, together with [[Margaret of Antioch|Saint Margaret]], had been divinely appointed Joan's adviser.&lt;ref name=clugnet/&gt;

[[File:Ring Sinaya.jpg|thumb|Ring of Saint Catherine, given to [[pilgrim]]s visiting [[Mount Sinai]].]]
Devotion to Saint Catherine remains strong amongst [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]]. With the relative ease of travel in the modern age, pilgrimages to Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai have increased. Pilgrims to her monastery on Mt Sinai are given a ring, which has been placed on the relics of the saint as an ''[[wiktionary:εὐλογία|evlogia]]'' (blessing) in remembrance of their visit.

==Legacy==
The pyrotechnic [[Catherine wheel (firework)|Catherine wheel]], from which sparks fly off in all directions, took its name from the saint's wheel of martyrdom.&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt;

==In art==

Countless images of Saint Catherine are depicted in art, especially in the late [[Middle Ages]], which is also the time that the account of  [[Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine|Saint Catherine's Mystical Marriage]] makes its first literary appearance. She can usually be easily recognised as she is richly dressed and crowned, as befits her rank as a princess, and often holds or stands next to a segment of her wheel as an [[Emblem|attribute]].  She also often carries either a [[martyr's palm]] or the sword with which she was actually executed. She often has long unbound blonde or reddish hair (unbound as she is unmarried). The vision of Saint Catherine of Alexandria usually shows the Infant Christ, held by the Virgin, placing a ring (one of her attributes) on her finger, following some literary accounts, although in the version in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' he appears to be adult, and the marriage takes place among a great crowd of angels and "all the celestial court",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume7.htm#Katherine Life of Saint "Katherine"] in [[William Caxton]]'s English version of the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and these may also be shown.

She is very frequently shown attending on the Virgin and Child, and is usually prominent in scenes of the ''[[Master of the Virgo inter Virgines]]'', showing a group of virgin saints surrounding the Virgin and Child.  Notable later paintings of Catherine include single figures by [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria (Raphael)|Raphael (National Gallery)]] and 
[[Saint Catherine (Caravaggio)|Caravaggio (Madrid)]], ([[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2896">'''Cecil Husk''' (1847-1920) was a British professional singer and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[Mediumship|medium]].

==Biography==
Husk was a professional singer and member of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]]. His eyesight deteriorated and he became a full-time medium. It was alleged he could materialize [[spirit]]s and perform [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 445. {{ISBN|978-1161361827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1891 at a public [[séance]] with twenty sitters Husk was exposed as a fraud. He was caught leaning over a table pretending to be a spirit by covering his face with [[phosphor]] material. It was noted by investigators that the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] of Husk had fine singing voices and sounded similar to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 90. {{ISBN|978-0786427703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husk also claimed to have the [[psychic]] ability to push his entire arm through an iron ring with a size that did not allow its passage over the hand, however, it was discovered that he performed the trick by using a local [[anesthetic]] on his hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1939). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 203. {{ISBN|978-0766142428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Edward Turner]] attended séances with Husk. He became convinced that Husk could materialize spirits and defended the medium in various newspaper articles. During one of the séances he stated that he had witnessed the materialization of [[W. T. Stead]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (December 15, 1913). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045396/1913-12-15/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1789 ''Spirits Appear at Seance in London'']. The Salt Lake Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (December 15, 1913). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025182/1913-12-15/ed-1/seq-9/#date1=1789 ''Stead's Ghost Floating Around'']. The Daily Gate City.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magician [[Will Goldston]] exposed the fraudulent mediumship of Husk. During a séance that Goldston attended a pale face materialization appeared in the room. Goldston wrote that "I saw at once that it was a gauze mask, and that the moustache attached to it was loose at one side through lack of gum. I pulled at the mask. It came away, revealing the face of Husk."&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Goldston|Goldston, Will]]. (1942). ''Tricks Of The Masters''. G. Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Deerfoot-Bad Meat was born ''c.''1864 on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve on the Western Canadian plains. The son of Nato-West-Sitsi (Medicine Fire) and nephew of Big [[Crowfoot|Chief Crowfoot]]. Deerfoot-Bad Meat followed the Blackfoot tradition at the time of having several wives and several children; he died on Feb 24, 1897 in Calgary.

== Career as a runner ==
By 1880, Deerfoot-Bad Meat had become an exceptional [[Long-distance running|long-distance runner]] working as a messenger for the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]] running between camps in [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashfm.ca/hall-of-fame-honoured-members/browse/achievement-award/deerfoot|title=Alberta Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deerfoot-Bad Meat first began running in minor local races when he was discovered by a Calgary gambling group called The Syndicate. The group was interested in finding local runners who could compete with continental champions for gambling money. Around the same time the indoor track "Star-Rink" was being built in Calgary which would serve as a venue for these championship foot-races. In 1883, in one of his first professional races, Deerfoot-Bad Meat defeated professional runner James Green and Blackfoot runner Little Plume in a four-day endurance race. In 16 hours, he completed 84 miles and 6 laps. Following this, Api-kai-ees was officially given the professional name Deerfoot, after the original [[Seneca people|Seneca]] runner [[Deerfoot|Deerfoot-Red Jacket]].

Deerfoot-Bad Meat continued to run successfully in many more local races in the Calgary area and beyond defeating challengers from as far away as Europe. In 1886 he won the prestigious [[Canada Day|Dominion Day]] one-mile race, coming within a second of breaking the world record for that distance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/api_kai_ees_12E.html|title=API-KAI-EES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that autumn, in order to showcase Canadian talent to the world, multiple gambling groups decided to organize a major ten-mile race in Calgary. Deerfoot-Bad Meat was entered to run against the favourite J.W. Strokes of [[Birmingham]], [[England]] and George Irvine of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Deerfoot+Revenge/6752087/story.html|title="Deerfoots Revenge"  The Calgary Herald|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In what was considered the race of the decade, Deerfoot-Bad Meat overwhelmingly defeated Stokes and Irvine, beating the Englishman by a full lap. Not happy with what the Europeans considered a "humilliating" defeat, the handlers of the British runner claimed a miscount of laps and the race was invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Deerfoot+Revenge/6752087/story.html|title="Deerfoot's Revenge"  The Calgary Herald|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/api_kai_ees_12E.html|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers rescheduled a new race for several days later. Nevertheless, being already suspicious of the British team, Deerfoot-Bad Meat stepped onto the race track only after giving Stokes a six lap head-start in order to dispel any possibility of another miscount. Deerfoot nevertheless passed the Birmingham racer and finished the ten miles in 54 minutes 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/wayward-west-episode-1-deerfoot-api-kai-ees-1.4183603|title="How the legend of Deerfoot rallied Calgary — and ruined the man"  - CBC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://passherald.ca/archives/170719/index6.htm|title="Deerfoot - The Original Sinister 7 Runner" - Crowsnest Pass Herald|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career and death ==
Disillusioned and disappointed with the corruption involving the gambling group The Syndicate, Deerfoot parted ways with his team in 1886 and began running as an independent with mixed success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashfm.ca/hall-of-fame-honoured-members/browse/achievement-award/deerfoot|title=Api-Kai-ees Deerfoot*|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deerfoot died in 1897 of [[tuberculosis]] and is buried in an unmarked grave in Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Deerfoot+Revenge/6752087/story.html|title=Deerfoot's Revenge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1974 the City of [[Calgary]] renamed a major [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]], [[Deerfoot Trail]], as well as an industrial centre and shopping venue ([[Deerfoot City]]) in his honour.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Edwin''' (died 933) was the younger son of King [[Edward the Elder]] and [[Ælfflæd, wife of Edward the Elder|Ælfflæd]], his second wife. He [[Drowning|drowned]] at sea in circumstances which are unclear. Edward the Elder died in 924, leaving five sons by three marriages. Of these, [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]] and [[Eadred]] were infants and thus excluded from the succession. Edward's careful work of expansion was undone when the [[Mercia]]ns chose Edward's oldest son [[Æthelstan]]—probably raised in Mercia at the court of [[Æthelflæd]]—to be their king while the [[West Saxons]] picked [[Ælfweard of Wessex|Ælfweard]], elder son of Edward's second wife Ælfflæd, who was perhaps Edward's own choice as successor. Ælfweard's "sudden and convenient"&lt;ref name = "Thacker 254-5"&gt;Thacker, ''Dynastic monasteries'', pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; death followed six weeks after that of his father, but Æthelstan appears not to have been recognised as king by the West Saxons until a year after his father's death, suggesting that there was considerable resistance to him and perhaps also support for Edwin.&lt;ref name = "Thacker 254-5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, ''Age of Athelstan'', pp. 101–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary evidence for Edwin's life is very limited. At some point during the reign of his half-brother Æthelstan, Edwin witnessed a charter, [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1417 S 1417], at [[New Minster, Winchester]], granting lands to one Alfred, a [[thegn]] (''minister'') of King Æthelstan. Edwin witnesses the charter immediately after his half-brother and is described as [[ætheling]] (''clito''). The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' states that Edwin drowned at sea in 933.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Francia]]n ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' compiled by [[Folcuin]] provide more detail:

{{cquote |For in the year of the Incarnate Word 933, when the same King Edwin, driven by some disturbance in his kingdom, embarked on a ship, wishing to cross to this side of the sea, a storm arose and the ship was wrecked and he was overwhelmed in the midst of the waves. And when his body was washed ashore, Count [[Adelolf, Count of Boulogne|Adelolf]], since he was his kinsman, received it with honour and bore it to the monastery of Saint Bertin [at [[Saint-Omer]]] for burial.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp. 346–347; Count Adelolf of Boulogne was a grandson of King [[Alfred the Great]] and thus Edwin's first cousin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later writers such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and [[Simeon of Durham]] rewrote Edwin's death. Sir [[Frank Stenton]] saw their reports as suggesting that "a rebellion against Athelstan may have been organised within the royal house itself".&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 355–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon's version baldly states that "King Æthelstan commanded that his brother Edwin be drowned at sea".&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; William's account is much longer and associates Edwin's death with an earlier plot to blind Æthelstan and replace him with Edwin. In this version, Æthelstan is convinced by jealous courtiers to have Edwin sent to sea in a leaky boat, without oars, without food, and without water. Despairing, Edwin throws himself into the sea and drowns.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, ''Age of Athelstan'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annales Bertiniani'' say that the monks of Saint Bertin were granted a monastery at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] by "King Æthelstan" in 944—in fact King Edmund, Æthelstan having died in 939—in gratitude for their care of Edwin's remains.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Marie, Vicomte de Lesseps''', [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]] ({{IPA-fr|də lesɛps|lang}}; 19 November 1805 &amp;ndash; 7 December 1894) was a [[France|French]] diplomat and later developer of the [[Suez Canal]], which in 1869 joined the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]]s, substantially reducing sailing distances and times between [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]].

He attempted to repeat this success with an effort to build a [[Panama Canal]] at [[sea level]] during the 1880s, but the project was devastated by epidemics of [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] in the area, as well as beset by financial problems, and the planned de Lesseps Panama Canal was never completed. Eventually, the project was bought out by the [[United States]], which solved the medical problems and changed the design to a non-sea level canal with [[lock (water transport)|locks]]. It was completed in 1914.{{sfn |McCullough |1977}}

==Ancestry==
The origins of de Lesseps' family are traceable back as far as the end of the 14th century. His ancestors, it is believed, came from [[Spain]], and settled at [[Bayonne]] during the region's occupation by the [[England|English]]. One of his great-grandfathers, Pierre de Lesseps ([[Bayonne]], 2 January 1690 – Bayonne, 20 August 1759), son of Bertrand Lesseps (1649–1708) and wife (m. 18 April 1675) Louise Fisson (1654–1690), was [[town clerk]] and at the same time secretary to Queen Anne of Neuberg, widow of [[Charles II of Spain]], exiled to Bayonne after the accession of Philip V, and married on 7 January 1715 his great-grandmother Catherine Fourcade (2 June 1690 – 22 August 1760), by whom he had fourteen children, six of whom died in childhood: Dominique de Lesseps (1715–1794), Pierre de Lesseps (1716 – ?), Marie de Lesseps (1717–1722), Arnaud de Lesseps (1719–1726), Jean-Barthélémy de Lesseps (1720–1795), Marcel de Lesseps (1720–1730), Jean-Pierre de Lesseps (1721–1721), Catherine de Lesseps, Gracy de Lesseps (1725–1791), Plaisance de Lesseps (1727–1735), Michel de Lesseps (1729–1801), married in 1769 to Florence Verdier (1739–1822) (parents of Louise Thérèse de Lesseps (1770–1866), married in 1788 to Mathieu Belland (1764–1817), Martin de Lesseps (1730–1807), married to Anna Caysergues (1730–1823) and had issue, Jeanne de Lesseps (1733 – ?), married in 1759 to Alexandre Dubrocq, and Etiennette de Lesseps (1735 – ?), married in 1761 to Pierre Simonin.

From the middle of the 18th century the ancestors of de Lesseps followed diplomatic careers, and he himself occupied several diplomatic posts from 1825 to 1849. His uncle was ennobled by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], and his father was made a count by Emperor [[Napoleon I]]. His father, Mathieu de Lesseps ([[Hamburg]], 4 May 1774 – [[Tunis]], 28 December 1832), was in the consular service; his mother, Catherine de Grévigné ([[Málaga]], 11 June 1774 – Paris, 27 January 1853), was Spanish on her mother's side, and aunt of the countess of Montijo, mother of the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]]. She was a daughter of Henri de Grevigné (baptised Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, [[Liège (city)|Liège]], 2 June 1744) and wife (m. [[Málaga]], 1766) Francisca Antonia Gallegos (1751–1853).

==Early years==
Ferdinand de Lesseps was born November 19, 1805 in [[Versailles, Yvelines]]. He had a sister, Adélaïde de Lesseps (1803–1879), married to Jules Tallien de Cabarrus (19 April 1801 – 1870), and two brothers, Théodore de Lesseps ([[Cádiz]], 25 September 1802 – [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], 20 May 1874), married in 1828 to Antonia Denois (Paris, 27 September 1802 – Paris, 29 December 1878), and Jules de Lesseps ([[Pisa]], 16 February 1809 – Paris, 10 October 1887), married on 11 March 1874 to Hyacinthe Delarue.

His first years were spent in Italy, where his father was occupied with his consular duties. He was educated at the [[College of Henry IV]] in Paris. From the age of 18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department of the army. From 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice-consul at [[Lisbon]], where his uncle, [[Barthélemy de Lesseps]], was the French ''[[chargé d'affaires]]''. This uncle was an old companion of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]] and the only survivor of the expedition in which La Pérouse perished. Barthélemy de Lesseps had left the expedition in [[Kamchatka]] to travel to [[St Petersburg]] overland.

==Career==
===Diplomatic===
In 1828 de Lesseps was sent as an assistant [[vice-consul]] to [[Tunis]], where his father was [[consul-general]]. He aided the escape of [[Youssouff]], pursued by the soldiers of the [[Bey]], of whom he was one of the officers, for violation of the [[seraglio]] law. Youssouff acknowledged this protection given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks of the French army at the time of the [[French conquest of Algeria]]. De Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with missions to Marshal Count [[Bertrand Clausel]], general-in-chief of the army of occupation in Algeria. The marshal wrote to Mathieu de Lesseps on 18 December 1830: "I have had the pleasure of meeting your son, who gives promise of sustaining with great credit the name he bears".

In 1832 de Lesseps was appointed vice-consul at [[Alexandria]]. While the vessel, in which de Lesseps sailed to Egypt, was in quarantine at the Alexandrian [[lazaretto]], M. Mimaut, consul-general of France at Alexandria, sent him several books, among which was the memoir written upon the previously filled and abandoned [[Ancient Suez Canal]], according to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s instructions, by the civil engineer [[Jacques-Marie Le Père]], one of the scientific members of the French expedition.

This work struck de Lesseps's imagination, and was one of the influences that gave him the idea of constructing a canal across the African isthmus. Fortunately for de Lesseps, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the viceroy of Egypt, owed his position in part to the recommendations made on his behalf to the French government by Mathieu de Lesseps, who was consul-general in [[Egypt]] when Ali was a colonel. Because of this, de Lesseps received a warm welcome from the viceroy and became good friends with his son, Said Pasha. Politically, the British were allied with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital in [[Constantinople]] - to prevent the [[Russians]] from [[Black Sea]] access to the Mediterranean Sea - and had also repelled [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt#Military campaigns|Ali's attempt to invade the Ottoman capital]] in 1833. The French were able to maneuver in Egypt under Ali's graces by playing off the British aggression against Ali in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=43|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833 de Lesseps was sent as consul to [[Cairo]], and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate general at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837. While in Egypt he encountered and was influenced by [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]], who was working on a [[Barrage (dam)|barrage]] north of Cairo for Ali while preaching for a marriage of the Mediterranean and Red Seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=31-37|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was there an epidemic of plague broke out and lasted for two years, resulting in the deaths of more than a third of the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria. During this time de Lesseps went from one city to the other with zeal and energy. Towards the close of the year 1837 he returned to France, and on 21 December married [[Miss|Mlle]] Agathe Delamalle ([[Garches]], Hauts-de-Seine, 15 October 1819 – Paris, 13 July 1853), daughter of the government prosecuting attorney at the court of [[Angers]]. By this mariage de Lesseps became the father of five sons: Charles Théodore de Lesseps (1838–1838), Charles Aimé de Lesseps (1840–1923), Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps (1842–1846), Ferdinand Victor de Lesseps (1847–1853) and Aimé Victor de Lesseps (1848–1896).

In 1839 he was appointed consul at [[Rotterdam]], and in the following year transferred to [[Málaga]], the ancestral home of his mother's family. In 1842 he was sent to [[Barcelona]], and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul general. In the course of a bloody insurrection in [[Catalonia]], which ended in the [[Bombardment of Barcelona (1842)|bombardment of Barcelona]], de Lesseps offered protection to a number of men threatened by the fighting regardless of their factional sympathies or nationalities. From 1848 to 1849 he was minister of France at [[Madrid]].

In 1849 the government of the French Republic sent him to Rome to negotiate the return of [[Pope Pius IX]] to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. He tried to negotiate an agreement whereby Pope Pius could return peacefully to the Vatican but also ensuring the continued independence of Rome. But, during negotiations, the elections in France caused a change in the foreign policy of the government - [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] replaced the previous foreign minister. His course was disapproved; he was recalled and brought before the Council of State. [[Louis-Napoleon]] needed a scapegoat and Lessups was an easy target. Lessups was accused of causing dishonor to the French army and was censured although he was not told to leave the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=63|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th [[Commander#Military and chivalric orders|Commander]] and then the 200th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]].

De Lesseps then retired from the diplomatic service, and never again occupied any public office. In 1853 he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days' interval. In 1854, the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave de Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal.

===Suez Canal===
[[File:Gill-Lesseps.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of de Lesseps by [[André Gill]], 1867.]]
[[File:DeLesseps.JPG|thumb|upright|De Lesseps statue now stands in Port Fouad shipyard. When it stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal, the outstretched hand indicated that the way was now open to the East.]]

Lessups had corresponded at least once with the [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] during the reign of [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] in Egypt, but Abbas had closed off most of Egypt to foreign influence. Upon Abbas' assassination in 1854, Lessups, made inquiries with a former, if short-term, acquaintance and successor in Egypt, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said Pasha]]. On 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=58-61,65,70-71,76|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first scheme, initiated by de Lesseps, was immediately drawn out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service, [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds]] called "Linant Bey" and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from others that were previously presented or that were in opposition to it, provided for a direct link between the Mediterranean and the [[Red Sea]]. After being slightly modified, the plan was adopted in 1856 by the civil engineers constituting the [[International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez]]. Encouraged by the engineers' approval, de Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no obstacle. Neither the opposition of [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who considered the projected disturbance as too radical and [[Panic of 1873#Europe|a danger to the commercial position of Great Britain]].  De Lesseps was similarly not deterred by the opinions entertained, in France as well as in England, that the sea in front of [[Port Said]] was full of mud which would obstruct the entrance to the canal, and that the sands from the desert would fill the trenches — no adverse argument could dishearten Lesseps.

De Lesseps succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two hundred million francs which he needed in order to form a company, but could not attract any substantial capital contribution from the public in England or other foreign countries. The Egyptian government thus subscribed for eighty million francs worth of shares.

The [[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]] was organized at the end of 1858. On 25 April 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by de Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, de Lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the British government preventing the [[Sultan]] from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the [[Khedive]], [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]].

[[File:Fernidan de Lesseps house Ismailia.JPG|thumb|left|Ferdinand de Lesseps house and office in [[Ismailia]], near the Suez Canal]]
While in the interests of his canal de Lesseps resisted the opposition of British diplomacy to an enterprise which threatened to give France control of the shortest route to India, he acted loyally towards Great Britain after [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Lord Beaconsfield]] acquired the Suez shares belonging to the Khedive, by admitting to the board of directors of the company three representatives of the British government. The consolidation of interests which resulted, and which was strengthened by the addition in 1884 of seven more British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants and business men, increased, for the benefit of all concerned, the commercial character of the enterprise.

De Lesseps steadily endeavored to keep out of politics. If in 1869 he appeared to deviate from this principle by being a candidate at [[Marseille]] for the Corps Législatif, it was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring [[Léon Gambetta]]. Afterward, de Lesseps declined the other candidatures that were offered to him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877. In 1873 he became interested in a project for uniting Europe and Asia by a railway to [[Bombay]], with a branch to [[Peking]]. The same year, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He subsequently encouraged [[François Élie Roudaire|Major Roudaire]], who wished to transform a stretch of the [[Sahara]] into [[Sahara Sea|an inland sea]] to increase rainfall in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/09/16/80661353.pdf THE INLAND AFRICAN SEA. The report. ''The New York Times''. 16 September 1877]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s [[International African Society]].  From this position he facilitated [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]]'s explorations, and acquired stations that he subsequently abandoned to the French government. These stations were the starting-point of [[French Congo]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1879.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 17 November 1899 to 23 December 1956, a monumental statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by [[Emmanuel Frémiet]] stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egy.com/landmarks/lesseps.shtml Ferdinand de Lesseps statue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331014421/http://www.egy.com/landmarks/lesseps.shtml |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Yahia2/DeLeSepp.html The Destruction of the statue of de Lesseps]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama Canal attempt===
[[Image:Mora-lesseps.jpg|thumb|upright|left]]In May 1879 a congress of 136 delegates (including de Lesseps) assembled in the rooms of the [[Société de géographie]] in Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncire le Noury, and voted in favor of the creation of a [[Panama Canal#History|Panama Canal]], which was to be without locks, like the Suez Canal. De Lesseps was appointed President of the [[Panama Canal Company]], despite the fact that he had reached the age of 74. It was on this occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of "Le Grand Français". However, the decision to dig a Panama Canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporary medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project.
[[File:Panama canal médaille Roty.JPG|thumb|Piercing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], medal by [[Louis-Oscar Roty]]]]
In February 1880, de Lesseps arrived in [[New York City]] to raise money for the project. When he stayed at the [[Windsor Hotel (Manhattan)|Windsor Hotel]], its staff flew the [[French flag]] in his honor. He met the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and the Geographic Society while touring the area. De Lesseps then went to [[Washington D.C.]], met with President [[Rutherford Hayes]], and testified to the House Interoceanic Canal Committee. He later went to [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and several other American cities to raise interest and capital for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Matthew. Panama Fever: The Epic Story of One of the Greatest Achievements of All Time – the Building of the Panama Canal. New York: Doubleday, 2007. pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1880, de Lesseps gave a speech in [[Liverpool]] where he was able to find support from a Captain Peacock, who felt the canal project was worth supporting as it would provide routes to save time.&lt;ref name="The University of Manchester, The John Rylands University Library"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lesseps|first=Ferdinand de|title=Address on the Inter-Oceanic Canal Scheme|journal=Foreign and Commonwealth Office Collection|date=June 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lesseps went with his youngest child to [[Panama]] to see the planned pathway. He estimated in 1880 that the project would take 658 million [[French franc|francs]] and eight years to complete. After two years of surveys, work on the canal began in 1882. However, the technical difficulties of operating in the wet tropics dogged the project. Particularly disastrous were recurrent [[landslide]]s into the excavations from the bordering water-saturated hills, and the death toll from [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]. In the end, insufficient [[financial capital]] and financial [[corruption]] ended the project. The Panama Canal Company declared itself bankrupt in December 1888 and entered [[liquidation]] in February 1889.

The failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the Panama Canal Scandal, after rumors circulated that French politicians and journalists had received [[bribe]]s. By 1892 it emerged that 150 French deputies had been bribed into voting for the allocation of financial aid to the Panama Canal Company, and in February 1893 de Lesseps, his son Charles (born 1849), and a number of others faced trial and were found guilty. De Lesseps was ordered to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence, but the latter was overturned by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] on the grounds that it had been more than three years since the crime was committed. Ultimately, in 1904 the United States bought out the assets of the Company and resumed work under a revised plan.

==Second marriage and issue==
In Paris on November 25, 1869 he married his second wife, [[Miss|Mlle]] Louise-Hélène Autard de Bragard.
She was born on the island of [[Mauritius]] in 1848 at [[Plaines Wilhems District|Plaines Wilhems]] and died on 29 January 1909 at Château de La Chesnay in [[Guilly, Indre|Guilly]], [[Vatan, Indre]].

==Statue of Liberty==
On 11 June 1884, [[Levi P. Morton]], the Minister of the United States to France, gave a banquet in honor of the Franco-American Union and in celebration of the completion of the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Ferdinand de Lesseps, as head of the Franco-American Union, formally presented the statue to the United States, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the result of the devoted enthusiasm, the intelligence and the noblest sentiments which can inspire man. It is great in its conception, great in its execution, great in its proportions; let us hope that it will add, by its moral value, to the memories and sympathies that it is intended to perpetuate. We now transfer to you, Mr. Minister, this great statue and trust that it may forever stand the pledge of friendship between France and the Great Republic of the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 1886, de Lesseps traveled to the United States to speak at the dedication ceremony of the [[Statue of Liberty]], attended by President [[Grover Cleveland]].

==Death==
De Lesseps died at [[Château]] de [[La Chesnaye]] in [[Guilly, Indre|Guilly]], [[Vatan, Indre]], on 7 December 1894. He was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|6286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1956 Egyptian President [[Gamal Nasser]] used his name in a radio speech, as the codeword to his army to raid the Suez Canal Company's offices on 26 July 1956. This was the first step to the Suez Canal's nationalization. In the course of the raid and seizure of the canal by Egypt, the statue of de Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal was removed from its pedestal, to symbolize the end of European ownership of the waterway. The statue now stands in a small garden of the [[Port Fuad]] shipyard.

==In popular culture==
De Lesseps was portrayed by [[Tyrone Power]] in the 1938 film ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'', with [[Loretta Young]], a film which provoked complaints and legal action from de Lesseps' family and the Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/91834/Suez/notes.html "Notes"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Manuel Soto (actor)|Manuel Soto]] played the part in a 1944 Spanish feature film, ''[[Eugenia de Montijo]]''.  On television, [[Guy Marchand]] played de Lesseps in the 1983 French/German [[mini-series]] ''L'homme de Suez'', and John Walters portrayed him in "The Panama Canal", an episode of the 2003 [[BBC]] docu-drama series ''[[Seven Wonders of the Industrial World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0053883/?ref_=fn_al_ch_1 "Ferdinand de Lesseps (Character)"] on [[IMDB.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lesseps appears as a great engineer in the game ''[[Civilization V]]''.

'''French Canadians''' (also referred to as '''Franco-Canadians''' or '''Canadiens'''; {{lang-fr|Canadien(ne)s français(es)}}) are an [[ethnic group]] who trace their ancestry to [[French people|French]] colonists who settled in [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] from the 17th century onward. Today, people of French heritage make up the majority of [[French language in Canada|native speakers of French in Canada]], who in turn account for about 22 per cent of the country's total population. The majority of French Canadians reside in [[Quebec]], where they constitute the majority of the province's population, although French-Canadian and francophone minority communities exist in all other Canadian provinces and territories as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/quick_facts_faits_bref_franco_e.php |title=Quick Facts about Canada's Francophonie |publisher=ocol-clo.gc.ca |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-18th century, Canadian colonists born in French Canada expanded across [[North America]] and colonized various regions, cities, and towns;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ISBN=0802034470 |title=Historical Atlas of Canada: The land transformed, 1800-1891 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |author=R. Louis Gentilcore }}&lt;/ref&gt; the French Canadian settlers originated primarily from districts in the west of France, such as [[Normandy]], [[Perche]], [[Beauce, France|Beauce]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], [[Touraine]], [[Poitou]], [[Aunis]], [[Angoumois]], [[Saintonge]] and [[Gascony]].&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Marquis and Louis Allen, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1014689?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "The French Canadians in the Province of Quebec"]. ''[[The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]'', Vol. 107, Social and Economic Conditions in The Dominion of Canada (May, 1923), pp. 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, French Canadians live across North America. Most French Canadians reside in Quebec, and are more commonly referred to as ''[[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecers]]'' or ''[[Québécois people|Québécois]]'', although smaller communities exist throughout Canada and in the United States. Between 1840 and 1930, roughly 900,000 French Canadians emigrated to the United States, mostly to the [[New England]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebecHistory/readings/leaving.htm |title=French Canadian Emigration to the United States, 1840-1930 |publisher=Marianopolis College |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acadians]] (''Acadiens''), who reside in [[the Maritimes]], may be included among the French Canadian group in linguistic contexts, but are considered a separate group from the French Canadians in a cultural sense due to their distinct history, much of which predates the admission of the Maritime Provinces to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.

French Canadians (including those who are no longer French-speaking) constitute the second largest ethnic group in Canada, behind those of [[English Canadians|English]] ancestry, and ahead of those of [[Scottish Canadians|Scottish]] and [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] heritage; there is nevertheless a distinction those identifying as French Canadians and those simply identifying as French. In total, those whose ethnic origins are French Canadian, French, Québécois and Acadian number up to 11.9 million people or comprising 33.78% of the Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=7&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=0&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=Age%20groups%20%2810%29&amp;VNAMEF=Groupes%20d%27%C3%A2ge%20%2810%29 |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables: Ethnic origin |publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |date=March 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all francophone Canadians are of French-Canadian descent or heritage, as the body of French language speakers in Canada also includes significant immigrant communities from other francophone countries such as [[Haiti]], [[Cameroon]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] or [[Vietnam]] — and not all French Canadians are francophone, as a significant number of people who have French Canadian ethnic roots are native English speakers.

==Etymology==
The French Canadians get their name from ''[[Canada, New France|Canada]]'', the most developed and densely populated region of [[New France]] during the period of [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonization]] in the 17th and 18th century. The original use of the term ''Canada'' referred to the land area along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], divided in three districts ([[Quebec City|Québec]], [[Trois-Rivières]], and [[Montreal|Montréal]]), as well as to the ''[[Pays d'en Haut]]'' (Upper Countries), a vast and thinly settled territorial dependence north and west of Montreal which covered the whole of the [[Great Lakes]] area.

From 1535 to the 1690s, the French word ''Canadien'' had referred to the [[First Nations]] the French had encountered in the St. Lawrence River valley at [[Stadacona]] and [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celat.ulaval.ca/temps/publications/hors_ethnonyme.htm |title=Gervais Carpin, Histoire d'un mot |publisher=Celat.ulaval.ca |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 17th century, ''Canadien'' became an [[ethnonym]] distinguishing the inhabitants of Canada from those of France.  After World War I, English-Canadians appropriated the term "Canadian" and French-Canadians identified as [[Québécois people|Québécois]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuitenbrouwer|first1=Peter|title=The Strange History of ‘O Canada’|url=https://thewalrus.ca/the-strange-history-of-o-canada/|accessdate=7 July 2017|work=[[The Walrus]]|date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that French-speaking Canadians identified their ethnicity most often as [[French people|French]], French Canadians, [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], and [[Acadian]]. The latter three were grouped together by Jantzen (2006) as "French New World" ancestries because they originate in Canada.&lt;ref name="Jantzen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jantzen|first=Lorna|title=THE ADVANTAGES OF ANALYZING ETHNIC ATTITUDES ACROSS GENERATIONS—RESULTS FROM THE ETHNIC DIVERSITY SURVEY|journal=Canadian and French Perspectives on Diversity|year=2003|pages=103–118|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/CH36-4-1-2004E.pdf#page=111|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006) Footnote 9: ''"These will be called "French New World" ancestries since the majority of respondents in these ethnic categories are Francophones."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Jantzen (2006) distinguishes the English ''Canadian'', meaning "someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations", and the French ''Canadien'', used to refer to descendants of the original settlers of New France in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006) Footnote 5: ''"Note that Canadian and Canadien have been separated since the two terms mean different things. In English, it usually means someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations. In French it is referring to "Les Habitants", settlers of New France during the 17th and 18th centuries who earned their living primarily from agricultural labour."''&lt;/ref&gt; "Canadien" was used to refer to the French-speaking residents of New France beginning in the last half of the 17th century. The English-speaking residents who arrived later from Great Britain were called "Anglais". This usage continued until [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacoursiere, Jacques, Claude Bouchard, Richard Howard|title=Notre histoire: Québec-Canada, Volume 2|date=1972|publisher=Editions Format|location=Montreal|page=174|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confederation united several former British colonies into the Dominion of Canada, and from that time forward, the word "Canadian" has been used to describe both English-speaking and French-speaking citizens, wherever they live in the country.

Those reporting "French New World" ancestries overwhelmingly had ancestors that went back at least four generations in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006): ''"The reporting of French New World ancestries (Canadien, Québécois, and French-Canadian) is concentrated in the 4th+ generations; 79% of French- Canadian, 88% of Canadien and 90% of Québécois are in the 4th+generations category."''&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth generation Canadiens and Québécois showed considerable attachment to their ethno-cultural group, with 70% and 61%, respectively, reporting a strong sense of belonging.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2005): ''"According to Table 3, the 4th+ generations are highest because of a strong sense of belonging to their ethnic or cultural group among those respondents reporting the New World ancestries of Canadien and Québécois."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The generational profile and strength of identity of French New World ancestries contrast with those of British or Canadian ancestries, which represent the largest ethnic identities in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006): ''For respondents of French and New World ancestries the pattern is different. Where generational data is available, it is possible to see that not all respondents reporting these ancestries report a high sense of belonging to their ethnic or cultural group. The high proportions are focused among those respondents that are in the 4th+ generations, and unlike with the British Isles example, the difference between the 2nd and 3rd generations to the 4th+ generation is more pronounced. Since these ancestries are concentrated in the 4th+ generations, their high proportions of sense of belonging to ethnic or cultural group push up the 4th+ generational results."''&lt;/ref&gt; Although deeply rooted Canadians express a deep attachment to their ethnic identity, most English-speaking Canadians of British or Canadian ancestry generally cannot trace their ancestry as far back in Canada as French-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006): ''"As shown on Graph 3, over 30% of respondents reporting Canadian, British Isles or French ancestries are distributed across all four generational categories."''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their identification with their ethnicity is weaker: for example, only 50% of third generation "Canadians" strongly identify as such, bringing down the overall average.&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen (2006): ''Table 3: Percentage of Selected Ancestries Reporting that Respondents have a Strong* Sense of Belonging to the Ethnic and Cultural Groups, by Generational Status, 2002 EDS"''.&lt;/ref&gt; The survey report notes that 80% of Canadians whose families had been in Canada for three or more generations reported "Canadian and provincial or regional ethnic identities". These identities include French New World ancestries such as "Québécois" (37% of Quebec population), "Acadian" (6% of Atlantic provinces).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 14 of the [http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/downpub/listpub.cgi?catno=89-593-XIE2003001 report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104202519/http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/downpub/listpub.cgi?catno=89-593-XIE2003001 |date=4 January 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
{{Main|French-speaking Quebecer}}
[[File:Quebec langues.png|thumb|right|Languages in Quebec]]
Since the 1960s, French Canadians in Quebec have generally used ''Québécois'' (masculine) or ''Québécoise'' (feminine) to express their cultural and national identity, rather than ''Canadien français'' and ''Canadienne française''. Francophones who self-identify as Québécois and do not have French-Canadian ancestry may not identify as "French Canadian" (''Canadien'' or ''Canadien français''). Those who do have French or French-Canadian ancestry, but who support [[Quebec sovereignty]], often find ''Canadien français'' to be archaic or even pejorative. This is a reflection of the strong social, cultural, and political ties that most Quebeckers of French-Canadian origin, who constitute a majority of [[francophone]] Quebecers, maintain within Quebec. It has given Québécois an ambiguous meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The emphasis on the French language and Quebec autonomy means that French-speakers across Canada may now self-identify as ''québécois(e)'', ''acadien(ne)'', or ''Franco-canadien(ne)'', or as provincial linguistic minorities such as ''Franco-manitobain(e)'', ''Franco-ontarien(ne)'' or ''fransaskois(e)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education, health and social services are provided by provincial institutions, so that provincial identities are often used to identify French-language institutions:

*[[Franco-Newfoundlander]]s, province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], also known as Terre-Neuvien(ne)
*[[Franco-Ontarian]]s, province of [[Ontario]], also referred to as Ontarien(ne)
*[[Franco-Manitoban]]s, province of [[Manitoba]], also referred to as Manitobain(e)
*[[Fransaskois]], province of [[Saskatchewan]], also referred to Saskois(e)
*[[Franco-Albertan]]s, province of [[Alberta]], also referred to Albertain(e)
*[[Franco-Columbian]]s, province of [[British Columbia]] mostly live in the [[Vancouver]] metro area; also referred to as Franco-Colombien(ne)
*[[Franco-Yukonnais]], territory of [[Yukon]], also referred to as Yukonais(e)
*[[Franco-Ténois]], territory of [[Northwest Territories]], also referred to as Ténois(e)
*[[Franco-Nunavois]], territory of [[Nunavut]], also referred to as Nunavois(e)

[[Acadians]] residing in the provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]] represent a distinct francophone culture. This group's culture and history evolved separately from the French Canadian culture of Quebec, at a time when the Maritime Provinces were ''not'' part of what was referred to as Canada, and are consequently considered a distinct culture from French Canadians.

[[Brayon]]s in [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska County]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], [[Maine]] may be identified with either the Acadians or the Québécois, or considered a distinct group in their own right, by different sources.

French Canadians outside Quebec are more likely to self-identify as "French Canadian". Identification with provincial groupings varies from province to province, with Franco-Ontarians, for example, using their provincial label far more frequently than Franco-Columbians do. Some identify ''only'' with the provincial groupings, explicitly rejecting "French Canadian" as an identity label.

During the mid-18th century, French Canadian explorers and colonists colonized other parts of North America in what are today [[Louisiana]] (called ''Louisianais''), [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], far northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] as well as around [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Illinois"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also founded such cities as [[New Orleans]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and villages in the [[Mississippi Valley]]. French Canadians later emigrated in large numbers from Canada to the [[United States]] between the 1840s and the 1930s in search of economic opportunities in border communities and industrialized portions of [[New England]].&lt;ref name="Emigration"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; French-Canadian communities in the United States remain along the [[Quebec]] border in [[Maine]], [[Vermont]], and [[New Hampshire]], as well as further south in [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Connecticut]]. There is also a significant community of French Canadians in [[South Florida]], particularly [[Hollywood, Florida]], especially during the winter months. The wealth of Catholic churches named after [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] throughout New England is indicative of the French immigration to the area. They came to identify as [[French American|Franco-American]], especially those who were born American.

Distinctions between French Canadian, natives of France, and other New World French identities is more blurred in the U.S. than in Canada, but those who identify as French Canadian or Franco American generally do not regard themselves as French. Rather, they identify culturally, historically, and ethnically with the culture that originated in Quebec that is differentiated from French culture. In ''L'avenir du français aux États-Unis'', [[Calvin Veltman]] and [[Benoît Lacroix]] found that since the French language has been so widely abandoned in the United States, the term "French Canadian" has taken on an ethnic rather than linguistic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;

French Canadian identities are influenced by historical events that inform regional cultures. For example, in New England, the relatively recent immigration (19th/20th centuries) is informed by experiences of language oppression and an identification with certain occupations, such as the mill workers. In the Great Lakes, many French Canadians also identify as [[Métis]] and trace their ancestry to the earliest [[voyageurs]] and [[habitants|settlers]]; many also have ancestry dating to the lumber era and often a mixture of the two groups.

The main Franco-American regional identities are:
* French Canadians:
** French Canadians of the Great Lakes (including [[Muskrat French]])
** [[New England French]]
* Creoles:
** [[Missouri French]] (and other people of French ancestry in the former [[Illinois Country]])
** [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] (who speak [[Colonial French]])
* [[Cajuns]]

==Population==
[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Place d'Armes in Montreal, historic heart of French Canada]]
People who today claim some French-Canadian ancestry or heritage number some 7 million in Canada and 2.4 million people in the United States. (An additional 8.4 million Americans claim French ancestry; they are treated as a separate ethnic group by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]].)

===Distribution in Canada===
In Canada, 85% of French Canadians reside in [[Quebec]] where they constitute the majority of the population in all regions except the far North. Most cities and villages in this province were built and settled by the French or French Canadians during the French colonial rule.

There are various urban and small centres in Canada outside Quebec that have long-standing populations of French Canadians, going back to the late 19th century. [[Eastern Ontario|Eastern]] and [[Northern Ontario|Northern]] [[Ontario]] have large populations of francophones in communities such as [[Ottawa]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Welland]], [[Timmins]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. Many also pioneered the [[Canadian Prairies]] in the late 18th century, founding the towns of [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba]] and in Alberta's [[Peace Country]], including the region of [[Grande Prairie]].

The following table shows the population of Canada's that is of French ancestry. The data is from Statistics Canada.

It is important to understand that the French-speaking population have massively chosen the "Canadian" ("''Canadien''") ethnic group since the government made it possible (1986), which has made the current statistics misleading. The term ''Canadien'' historically referred only to a French-speaker, though today it is used in French to describe any Canadian citizen.

It is estimated that roughly 70%-75% of Quebec's population descend from the French pioneers of the 17th and 18th century.

===Distribution in the United States===
{{See also|French language in the United States}}
[[File:French in the United States.png|thumb|upright|Distribution of [[French language in the United States|French in the United States]]]]
In the United States, many cities were founded as colonial outposts of [[New France]] by French or French-Canadian explorers. They include [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile (Alabama)]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene (Idaho)]], [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes (Indiana)]], [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville (Illinois)]], [[Bourbonnais, Illinois|Bourbonnais (Illinois)]], [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois|Prairie du Rocher (Illinois)]], [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque (Iowa)]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge (Louisiana)]], [[New Orleans|New Orleans (Louisiana)]], [[Detroit|Detroit (Michigan)]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi (Mississippi)]], [[Creve Coeur, Missouri|Creve Coeur (Missouri)]], [[St. Louis|St. Louis (Missouri)]], [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne, Pennsylvania)]], [[Provo, Utah|Provo (Utah)]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay (Wisconsin)]], [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse (Wisconsin)]], [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee (Wisconsin)]] or [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien (Wisconsin)]].

The majority of the French-Canadian population in the United States is found in the New England area, although there is also a large French-Canadian presence in [[Plattsburgh, New York]], across [[Lake Champlain]] from [[Burlington, Vermont]]. Quebec and Acadian emigrants settled in industrial cities like [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], [[Leominster, Massachusetts|Leominster]], [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] in [[Massachusetts]]; [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]] in [[Rhode Island]]; [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] in [[New Hampshire]]; [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]] in [[Connecticut]]; throughout the state of [[Vermont]], particularly in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], and [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre]]; and [[Biddeford, Maine|Biddeford]] and [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] in [[Maine]]. Smaller groups of French Canadians settled in the Midwest, notably in the states of [[Michigan]], Illinois, [[Wisconsin]], Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and [[Minnesota]]. French-Canadians also settled in central North Dakota, largely in [[Rolette County, North Dakota|Rolette]] and [[Bottineau County, North Dakota|Bottineau]] counties, and in South Dakota.

Some [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] still speak [[Michif]], a language influenced by French, and a mixture of other European and Native American tribal languages.

==Culture==

===Language===
{{main|Canadian French}}
[[File:Arret.jpg|thumb|upright|Quebec [[stop sign]]]]
[[Canadian French]] is an umbrella term for the distinct [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of French spoken by [[francophone]] Canadians: [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] ([[Quebec French]]), [[Acadian French]], [[Métis French]], and [[Newfoundland French]]. Unlike Acadian French and Newfoundland French, the French of Ontario, the Canadian West, and New England all originate from what is now Quebec French and do not constitute distinct varieties from it, though there are some regional differences. French Canadians may also speak either [[Canadian English]] or [[American English]], especially if they live in overwhelmingly English-speaking Canadian provinces or in the United States.

In Quebec, about six million French Canadians are native French speakers. 599,225 (7.7% of population) are English-speaking, Anglophones or [[English-speaking Quebecer]]s, and others are [[Allophone (Quebec)|Allophones]] (literally "other-speakers", meaning, in practice, immigrants who speak neither French nor English at home). In the United States, assimilation to the [[English language]] was more significant and very few Americans of French-Canadian ancestry or heritage speak French today.

Six million of Canada's native French speakers, of all origins, are found in the province of Quebec, where they constitute the majority language group, and another one million are distributed throughout the rest of Canada. Roughly 31% of Canadian citizens are French-speaking and 25% are of French-Canadian descent. Not all French speakers are of French descent, and not all people of French-Canadian heritage are exclusively or primarily French-speaking.

Francophones living in Canadian provinces other than Quebec have enjoyed [[minority language]] rights under Canadian law since at least 1969, with the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], and under the [[Canadian Constitution]] since 1982, protecting them from provincial governments that have historically been indifferent towards their presence. At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] formally designates French as a full [[official language]], while other provinces vary in the level of French language services they offer. All three of Canada's territories include French as an official language of the territory alongside English and local indigenous languages, although in practice French-language services are normally available only in the capital cities and not across the entire territory.

===Religion===
[[File:Ste Anne de Beaupré, Québec.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec]]
[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion of French Canadians, with [[Roman Catholicism]] the chief denomination. The kingdom of [[France]] forbade non-Catholic settlement in [[New France]] from 1629 onward and thus, almost all French settlers of [[Canada, New France|Canada]] were Catholic. In the United States, some families of French-Canadian origin have converted to [[Protestantism]]. Until the 1960s, religion was a central component of French-Canadian national identity. The Church parish was the focal point of civic life in French-Canadian society, and religious orders ran French-Canadian schools, hospitals and orphanages and were very influential in everyday life in general. During the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, however, the practice of Catholicism dropped drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/events/quiet.htm |title=The Quiet Revolution |author=Claude Bélenger |date=2000-08-23 |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church attendance in [[Quebec]] currently remains low. Rates of religious observance among French Canadians outside Quebec tend to vary by region, and by age. In general, however, those in Quebec are the least observant, while those in the [[United States|United States of America]] and other places away from Quebec tend to be the most observant.

===Agriculture===
French Canadians have [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] distinct livestock over the centuries, including [[Canadienne cattle|cattle]], [[Canadian horse|horses]] and [[Chantecler chicken|chickens]].

Traditionally Canadiens had a [[subsistence agriculture]] in Eastern Canada (Québec),{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} this subsistence agriculture slowly evolved in dairy farm during the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century while retaining the subsistence side. By 1960 agriculture changed toward an industrial agriculture.

==History==
[[File:Voyageur canoe.jpg|left|thumb|Voyageurs Passing a Waterfall]]
The [[French people|French]] were the first [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] to permanently colonize what is now [[Quebec]], parts of Ontario, Acadia, and select areas of Western Canada, all in Canada (See [[French colonization of the Americas]].) Their colonies of [[New France]] (also commonly called Canada) stretched across what today are the [[Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], southern Quebec and [[Ontario]], as well as the entire [[Mississippi River]] Valley.

The first permanent European settlements in Canada were at [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608 as fur trading posts. The territories of New France were [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], [[Acadia]] (later renamed [[Nova Scotia]]), and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The inhabitants of Canada called themselves the ''Canadiens'', and came mostly from northwestern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1014689|title=The French Canadians in the Province of Quebec|first1=G. E.|last1=Marquis|first2=Louis|last2=Allen|date=1 January 1923|publisher=|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=107|pages=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early inhabitants of Acadia, or ''Acadiens'', came mostly but not exclusively from the Southwestern region of France. ''Canadien'' explorers and fur traders would come to be known as ''[[coureurs des bois]]'', while those who settled on farms in Canada would come to be known as ''[[habitants]]''. Many French Canadians are the descendants of the [[King's Daughters]] of this era. Many also are the descendants of mixed French and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]] marriages.

During the mid-18th century, French explorers and ''Canadiens'' born in French Canada colonized other parts of North America in what are today the states of [[Louisiana]] (called ''Louisianais''), [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Vincennes, Indiana]], [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the [[Windsor-Detroit]] region and the [[Canadian prairies]] (primarily Southern [[Manitoba]]).

[[File:Cornelius Krieghoff 001.jpg|thumb|''Habitants'' by [[Cornelius Krieghoff]] (1852)]]
After the 1760 British conquest of New France in the [[French and Indian War]] (known as the [[Seven Years' War]] in Canada), the French-Canadian population remained important in the life of the colonies.

The British gained Acadia by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. In 1755, the beginning of the French and Indian War, the British—ally British Americans from Massachusetts—committed what historian John Mack Faragher calls the first genocide by devastating Acadia, deporting 75% of the Acadian population to other British colonies and France in a massive diaspora. Those Acadians deported to Southern colonies close to French Louisiana migrated there, creating "Cajun" culture. Beyond Acadia, French Canadians escaped this fate in part because of the capitulation act that made them British subjects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It took the 1774 [[Quebec Act]] for them to regain the French civil law system, and in 1791 French Canadians in [[Lower Canada]] were introduced to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]ary system when an elected [[Legislative Assembly]] was created.

The Legislative Assembly having no real power, the political situation degenerated into the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]]s of 1837–1838, after which Lower Canada and [[Upper Canada]] were unified. Some of the motivations for the union was to limit French-Canadian political power and at the same time transferring a large part of the Upper Canadian debt to the debt-free Lower Canada. After many decades of British immigration, the ''Canadiens'' became a minority in the [[Province of Canada]] in the 1850s.

French-Canadian contributions were essential in securing [[responsible government]] for [[The Canadas]] and in undertaking [[Canadian Confederation]]. However, over the course of the late 19th and 20th centuries, French Canadians' discontent grew with their place in Canada because of a series of events, including the execution of [[Louis Riel]], the elimination of official bilingualism in [[Manitoba]], Canada's participation in the [[Second Boer War]], [[Regulation 17]] which banned French-language schools in Ontario, the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]].

Between the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians emigrated to the [[New England]] region. About half of them returned home. The generations born in the United States would eventually come to see themselves as [[French American|Franco-Americans]]. During the same period of time, numerous French Canadians also emigrated and settled in Eastern and Northern [[Ontario]]. The descendants of those Quebec immigrants constitute the bulk of today's [[Franco-Ontarian]] community.

Since 1968, French has been one of Canada's two official languages. It is the sole official language of Quebec and one of the official languages of [[New Brunswick]], [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]. The province of [[Ontario]] has no official languages defined in law, although the provincial government provides French language services in many parts of the province under the [[French Language Services Act]].

==Modern usage==

In English usage, the terms for provincial subgroups, if used at all, are usually defined solely by province of residence, with all of the terms being strictly interchangeable with French Canadian. Although this remains the more common usage in English, it is considered outdated to many Canadians of French descent, especially in Quebec. Most francophone Canadians who use the provincial labels identify with their province of origin, even if it is not the province in which they currently reside; for example, a Québécois who moved to Manitoba would not normally change their own self-identification to Franco-Manitoban.

Increasingly, provincial labels are used to stress the linguistic and cultural, as opposed to ethnic and religious, nature of French-speaking institutions and organizations. The term "French Canadian" is still used in historical and cultural contexts, or when it is necessary to refer to Canadians of French-Canadian heritage collectively, such as in the name and mandate of national organizations which serve francophone communities across Canada. Francophone Canadians of non-French-Canadian origin such as immigrants from francophone countries are not usually designated by the term "French Canadian" the more general term "francophones" is used for French-speaking Canadians across all ethnic origins.

At the beginning of the tale, the eponymous [[Math fab Mathonwy]] will die if his feet are not always held in the lap of a virgin or he is at war; Goewin is the virgin who performs this duty until Math is tricked into going to war by his nephews [[Gwydion]] and [[Gilfaethwy]], who proceed to [[rape]] Goewin. Once Math returns, Goewin reveals the crime and Math punishes the two by transforming them into a series of animals. He then marries Goewin, giving her power over his kingdom, in order to make amends.&lt;ref name="undefined"&gt;https://druidnetwork.org/what-is-druidry/deity-and-mythology/mythology/welsh-mythology/goewin &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janani Jakaliya Luwum''' (c. 1922 – 17 February 1977) was the [[Bishop of Uganda|archbishop]] of the [[Church of Uganda]] from 1974 to 1977 and one of the most influential leaders of the modern church in Africa. He was arrested in February 1977 and died shortly after. Although the official account describes a car crash, it is generally accepted that he was murdered on the orders of then-President [[Idi Amin]].

Since 2015 Uganda has a [http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1417242/uganda-declared-february-archbishop-janani-luwum-public-holiday public holiday on 16 February], to celebrate the life of Janani Luwum.

== Early life and career ==
Luwum was born in the village of Mucwini in the [[Kitgum District]] to [[Acholi]] parents. He attended [[Gulu High School]] and [[Boroboro Teacher Training College]], after which he taught at a primary school. Luwum converted to Christianity in 1948, and in 1949 he went to [[Buwalasi Theological College]]. In 1950 he was attached to St. Philip's Church in [[Gulu]]. He was [[Ordination|ordained]] a [[deacon]] in 1953, and the following year he was ordained a priest. He served in the Upper Nile [[Diocese]] of Uganda and later in the Diocese of [[Mbale]]. In 1969 he was [[Consecration|consecrated]] Bishop of the Diocese of Northern Uganda at Gulu. After five years he was appointed Archbishop of the Metropolitan Province of Uganda, [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and Boga (in [[Zaire]]), becoming the second African to hold this position.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Landreth, ''[http://www.stpetershenleaze.org/JananiLuwum.pdf Heroes – Janani Luwum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085906/http://www.stpetershenleaze.org/JananiLuwum.pdf |date=16 May 2008 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and death==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Luwum and Amin.jpg|thumb|left|Janani Luwum (right) and [[Idi Amin]]]] --&gt;
Archbishop Luwum was a leading voice in criticising the excesses of the Idi Amin regime that assumed power in 1971. In 1977, Archbishop Luwum delivered a note of protest to dictator Idi Amin against the policies of arbitrary killings and unexplained disappearances. Shortly afterwards the archbishop and other leading churchmen were accused of [[treason]].

[[Image:WestminsterAbbey-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maximilian Kolbe]] (left), [[Manche Masemola]] (center) and Luwum (right) statues – [[Westminster Abbey]]]]
On 16 February 1977, Luwum was arrested together with two cabinet ministers, [[Erinayo Wilson Oryema]] and [[Charles Oboth Ofumbi]]. The same day Idi Amin convened a rally in [[Kampala]] with the three accused present. A few other "suspects" were paraded forth to read out "confessions" implicating the three men. The archbishop was accused of being an agent of the exiled former president [[Milton Obote]], and for planning to stage a coup. The next day, [[Uganda Broadcasting Corporation|Radio Uganda]] announced that the three had been killed when the car transporting them to an interrogation center had collided with another vehicle. The accident, Radio Uganda reported, had occurred when the victims had tried to overpower the driver in an attempt to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918720,00.html "Death of an Archbishop"], ''Time Magazine'', 28 February 1977&lt;/ref&gt; When Luwum's body was released to his relatives, it was riddled with bullets. [[Henry Kyemba]], minister of health in Amin's government, later wrote in his book ''A State of Blood'', that "The bodies were bullet-riddled. The archbishop had been shot through the mouth and at least three bullets in the chest. The ministers had been shot in a similar way but one only in the chest and not through the mouth. Oryema had a bullet wound through the leg."&lt;ref&gt;''A state of blood: The inside story of Idi Amin'' (1977) Henry Kyemba&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the later testimony of witnesses, the victims had been taken to an army barracks, where they were bullied, beaten and finally shot. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said "Some reports even had it that Amin himself had pulled the trigger, but Amin angrily denied the charge, and there were no first-hand witnesses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918762,00.html Amin:The Wild Man of Africa], ''Time Magazine'', 7 March 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Janani Luwum was survived by a widow, Mary Lawinyo Luwum and nine children. He was buried at his home village of Mucwini in the [[Kitgum District]]. He is recognised as a [[martyr]] by the [[Church of England]] and the [[Anglican Communion]] and his death is commemorated on 17 February as a [[Lesser Festival (Church of England)|Lesser Festival]]. His statue is among the Twentieth Century Martyrs on the front of [[Westminster Abbey]] in London.

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

==Early life==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s, but disliked killing birds.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher= Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the Russian imperial family]], a view shared by many fellow centenarians.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter12&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]

Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value.

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters.

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically. In Calment's youth each French town had its own solar time. In 1891 the introduction of railways motivated a unified French time zone in line with Greenwich Time in Britain. In 1940 the invading Germans changed the French time by one hour to German time, to which France still adheres as of 2016.}} In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Allard1998Englishchapter2" /&gt; 

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]]. At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including [[fencing]], cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]] ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s.&lt;ref name="Garoyan1990ThesisPart1"/&gt; Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion.

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (''crèmes''), cakes and in particular ''quatre-quarts'' ([[pound cake]]), and vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; At "retirement age" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishWitticisms/&gt; She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; 

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">'''Johannes Monrad Aagaard''' (29 April 1928 – 23 March 2007) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[theologian]] and [[Evangelism|evangelist]]. He was a professor of [[missiology]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] and was active in the [[Christian countercult movement]] as the founder of the [[Dialog Center International]], an international educational organization concerned with groups it defines as [[cult]]s and other [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2007/aagaard.htm In memoriam: Johannes Aagaard (1928-2007)], [[Massimo Introvigne]],  [[CESNUR]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary missiology: an introduction'', Johannes Verkuyl, W. B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 1978, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Aagaard had travelled to Asia and was concerned about [[Buddhism]] and other [[Eastern religions]], which he felt were gaining influence in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharing Jesus in the Buddhist world'', David S. Lim, Steve Spaulding. William Carey Library, 2003, pages 57-66&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973 Aagaard founded the Dialog Center  which was later greatly influential in promoting a negative public opinion of cults in Denmark and other European nations. He regarded [[Scientology]] as being especially dangerous, but later in his life stated that Islam was an even greater threat. Other concerns included [[Satanism]] and [[New Age]] groups.

In 2005, Fishbein alleged that an NIH-funded [[clinical trial]] of the [[antiretroviral drug]] [[nevirapine]], conducted in Africa, was invalid because of poor data collection, faulty record-keeping, and lax quality control.&lt;ref name="usa-today"&gt;{{cite news

| date=January 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH subsequently attempted to fire Fishbein, and he sought protection as a [[whistleblower]].

The clinical trial in question was the HIVNET 012 study, which tested the [[antiretroviral drug]] [[nevirapine]], used in some [[developing country|developing countries]] as a cost-effective method to prevent transmission of [[HIV]] [[vertical transmission|from mother to unborn child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Guay LA, Musoke P, Fleming T, etal |title=Intrapartum and neonatal single-dose nevirapine compared with zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Kampala, Uganda: HIVNET 012 randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9181 |pages=795–802 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10485720 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)80008-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishbein was among several NIH employees to raise concerns about the study; he alleged that the NIH had become "so heavily invested in the trial's outcome" that it had lost objectivity about the quality of the result.&lt;ref name="usa-today"/&gt; Internal NIH documents showed that concerns had been raised about HIVNET012, but that the Institute did not notify the [[George W.

In response to the allegations of Fishbein and others, the [[Institute of Medicine]] conducted an independent review of HIVNET 012 methodology and findings. The institute's review concluded that nevirapine was safe and effective in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, as HIVNET 012 had found, and that the study's methodology was sufficiently sound that scientists and policy-makers could rely on the study's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Khora Ramji Chawda''' (1860–1923), better known as '''Seth Khora Ramji''', was a reputed railway contractor, coal mines owner, banker and philanthropist of the early 20th century in [[India]], who worked from [[Dhanbad]] and [[Jharia]].

==Life-sketch==
He was born in a small village called [[Sinugra]] in [[Cutch State|Cutch]] and belonged to small but enterprising [[Mestri (community)|Mestri]] community.&lt;ref name=a&gt;'''Encyclopaedia of Bengal, Bihar &amp; Orissa (1920) by British Gazetteer.'''-''Section : People from the region Life-sketch of Seth Khora Ramji Chawda''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;'''Diary of Golden Days at Jharia – A Memoir &amp; History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia''' – written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa of Calcutta compiled by Raja Pawan Jethwa published in 1998 in English. (  The book gives detail and names of pioneers [[KGK Community]] as well other communities in [[Jharia]] coalfields also like NH Ojha &amp; Amritlal Ojha, Chanchani &amp; Worah, Kesabji Pitambar, Agarwalla brothers, Karamchand Thapar, Diwan Bahadur DD Thacker, Further, a brief life-sketch of Seth Khora Ramji Chawda of Sinugra, Govamal Jeewan Chauhan of Kumbharia, Gangjee Dossa &amp; Khimjee Dossa of Nagalpar &amp; many others.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;'''Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj : A brief History &amp; Glory''' : by Raja Pawan Jethwa. (2007) Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one the reputed Railway Contractors of his times and his exploits were mentioned by British authorities. He is also credited by them to be the first Indian to break monopoly of Europeans in [[Jharia]] coalfields. He established his first Colliery name ''Khas Jharia Colliery'' in 1895 and moved on to establish five more by 1910. He was also a financing partner in many coalfields of Jharia coal belt and additionally worked as a Private Banker.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref name=kh&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nJA2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=khora+ramji&amp;dq=khora+ramji&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hd7ATZDsCovJrAeurqH8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Khora Ramji Legal : Partner in Khimji Walji]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IceyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=khora+ramji&amp;dq=khora+ramji&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hd7ATZDsCovJrAeurqH8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ Khora Ramji Khas Jharia Colliery : Legal Case] The law reports.

As per British records – a few lines are quoted&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt; – {{quote|''Seth Khora Ramji have done works of great magnitude :- Hundred Miles of Railway in [[Sindh]] &amp; North west India. Twenty Miles of Railway lines on [[Southern Mahratta Railway|S.M. Railway]]. Twenty two miles of railway line on [[Eastern Bengal Railway|East Bengal Railway]], loco quarters at [[Hubli]] including several bridges of great magnitude. His elder brothers were also carrying on at the same time railway works in Sothern India and they also won name as successful contractors. All them joined hands in business and formed themselves in syndicate and completed works in [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway|MSM Railway]] but later unfortunately he lost all brothers but one. So he was left almost single handed. Seth Khora Ramji deserved much credit for the satisfactory completion of the above works because they involve much skill and labour and many mathematical calculations. Though uneducated he grasped clearly all the principals underlying these constructions and worked all the contracts entrusted to him to the satisfaction of railway authorities. In 1900 there was a turn in his business life. Just a that time [[Jharia]] coal fields were being exploited by Europeans and Seth Khora Ramji was first Indian to seize the opportunity. He purchased two collieries to begin with. Gradually others from Kutch and Gujarat followed suite and now Jharia has been changed into a Gujarati settlement with about 50 [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] out of 92 [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] collieries proprietors with Seth Khora Ramji as head of them all. He is now sole proprietor of two collieries and a financing member of about eight colliries. Several District official have remarked him as "Multi-millionare, one of the first class parties in Jharia."''}}

Some of the works done by Khora Ramji Chawda of [[Sinugra]] are : 1880 : [[Hubli]] Loco Shed &amp; other Works, 100&amp;nbsp;Miles work in North Western Railway, 20&amp;nbsp;Miles Work in Southern Maratta Railway, 177&amp;nbsp;miles in 1182–84 [[Hotgi]] to [[Gadag]] with his brothers in SMR, 22&amp;nbsp;Miles Railway in East Bengal Railway, 1888 – 128&amp;nbsp;miles in [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] to [[Jharsuguda]] with fellow [[Mistris of Kutch|Mistris]] section including Bridge over [[Champa, Chhattisgarh|Champa River]] in BNR, in 1894 [[Jharia]] Branch line of EIR, 1895 : Railway line in East Coast Railway &amp; Bridge over [[Ganjam]]. His last Railway work was in 1903 : Bridge over [[Ganges]] river in [[Allahbad]] – [[Lucknow]] section. While working for this bridge, he was harassed by Engineer I.L. Gail, so he decided to stop Railway Contracts. By this time since 1895 to 1901 he had already started two collieries in Jharia. I.E. Gail later realised his mistake and offered him contracts in other section. But Khora Ramji declined the offer and diverted all his energy to Coal Mining business, in which he was assisted by his &amp; his brother's son. He also became a Private Banker. He rose to such a height by 1920 and became ''[[Sheth|Seth]]'' Khora Ramji from Khora Ramji that British had to mention his name in Encyclopaedia of Bengal, Bihar &amp; Orissa.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; He had studied up to fourth standard in his native village school but still managed to erect &amp; build Railway bridges requiring deep technical knowledge and mathematical calculations.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref name=nb&gt;''Nanji Bapa ni Nondh Pothi'' written by Nanji Govindji Taunk and compiled by Dharsi J.

The credit of being first Indian to break the monopoly of British in Jharia Coalfields goes to ''Seth'' Khora Ramji Chawda of [[Sinugra]].

The Jharia coalfields was discovered while digging up the earth for laying this railway line. Khora Ramji while working near Jharia Railway station immediately realized the gold he had struck and purchased the lands from [[Jharia Raj|Raja of Jharia]].}} He similarly purchased about eight coal-fields from years 1895–1909. Further, he also encouraged fellow [[Mistris of Kutch|Mistri]] contractors to purchase the land and even financed them to do so. He later approached Raja of Jharia for lease of mining rights and laid foundation of his colliery business.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The location of his three collieries named Jeenagora, Khas Jherria, Gareria is mentioned also in 1917 Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar &amp; Orissa.:- Unquote&lt;ref name=f&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CbmyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=seth+khora+ramji&amp;dq=seth+khora+ramji&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yubATdnwNYzqrQfW0KnfAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA] ''The Jharia underground fire still raging first came to notice in November 1930 with subsidence at Seth Khora Ramji's Khas Jharia Colliery(Page 159).

The '''Ludza Estonians''' (in Ludza dialect of [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Lutsi maarahvas'' – ‘Lutsi Estonians’, in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]: ''Ludzas igauņi'') were a group of ethnic [[Estonians]] living in and around [[Ludza]], south-eastern [[Latvia]].

== History ==
Most of the Ludza Estonians probably moved into the area in the 17th century during the [[Great Northern War]], but the settlement may have originated earlier. Throughout the era of [[feudalism]], when life was mostly confined to one's near environment, this ethnic group retained its Estonian identity and ethnographic features. Ludza Estonians were originally [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], but became Catholics and had close contacts with neighbouring [[Latgalians]] and [[Belarusians]]. As long as the church ceremonies and confessions were held in Estonian, the people had little need to speak [[Latvian language|Latvian]] or [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. Nevertheless, the local [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] dialect of Latvian, Belarusian, and Russian were spoken to a certain extent in the areas were those people were their neighbours. In [[manor house|manor]]s, [[Polish language|Polish]] was heard (in [[Latgale]], it was the administrative language at the time).

==Language==
By the 19th century the church had become Latvianised and Russian had become the official language and [[lingua franca]].{{clarify|date=August 2014}} According to [[Oskar Kallas]], who made a studying trip to area in 1893, there were 4,387 Ludza Estonians of whom some 800 could speak Estonian. In the 1970s and 80s, there were some 20 people left in the area still using the language, but it is now most likely to have perished. The dialect spoken by Ludza Estonians, was closely related to eastern [[Võro language|Võro]]-dialects. It contained about 180 loanwords from Latvian language and some from Russian. Ludza Estonians reportedly had some difficulty understanding standard Estonian.

'''Magomed Yakhyаvich Yevloyev''' (Магомед Яхьявич Евлоев; 1971 – 31 August 2008) was an [[Ingush people|Ingush]] journalist, lawyer, and businessman, and the owner of the news website [[Ingushetiya.ru]], known for being highly critical of [[Murat Zyazikov]], the President of [[Ingushetia]], a [[federal subject]] of Russia locating in the [[North Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingushetiya.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/owner-of-site-ingushetiyaru-killed/ Owner of the news site "Ingushetiya.Ru", Magomed Yevloev], 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Magomed Yevloyev is not to be confused with the Ingush rebel leader [[Akhmed Yevloyev]], who is also known as Magomed, or with the 20-year-old also named Magomed Yevloyev who is suspected of being a suicide bomber in the [[Domodedovo International Airport bombing]].

==Early life and education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Screenshot of ingushetiya.ru.png|border|666px|thumb|Screenshot of Magomed Yevloyev's website www.ingushetiya.ru in 2005 (no longer operational; available via http://old.ingushetiyaru.org/news/6214.html)]] --&gt;
Magomed Yevloyev was born in the town of [[Malgobek]], [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (now in the [[Republic of Ingushetia]], Russia) in 1971.&lt;ref name=lentopedia&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/lib/14176029/ Евлоев, Магомед] collection of materials on [[Lenta.ru]] library {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Yevloyev graduated from [[Saratov]] Law Institute (Саратовский Юридический Институт).&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Yevloyev began to work as a [[public procurator]] in Ingushetia. He soon became the Deputy Chief Procurator of Malgobek. In 1999, he was accused of complicity in the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev, who was at that time imprisoned as a kidnapper. Allegedly Yevloyev had signed the permit allowing the murderers to take Tsechoyev from his cell. The accusations were not proven but Yevloyev resigned from his post as a prosecutor.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

In 2001, Yevloyev founded the Moscow legal firm [[Infra-Yur]]. In 2008, the firm became [[Infra Holding]], a company which oversaw construction, fishing, legal firms, and security bureaus. It also controlled [[Infra North America]], a daughter firm operating in the United States. Yevloyev was the president of this holding.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

Also in 2001, Yevloyev created the website "Ingushetia.ru". Originally there was no intention to make an opposition website; Yevloyev planned to host a neutral collection of materials on the history and culture of the Ingush people, without favoring any particular point of view. But he soon found that historical and cultural materials often included explosive political content as well, and the site became a source of political materials, such as information on the [[Second Chechen War]], counter-terrorist operations, the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]], and kidnappings and murders in Ingushetia. Many of these materials were highly critical of Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov and his government.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

In July 2007, the public procurator of Moscow's [[Kuntsevo]] municipality initiated a criminal case accusing Yevloyev of "inciting inter-ethnic hatred", though in the end Yevloyev was never indicted for any criminal activities. In October 2007, the Tsechoyev murder case was reopened and Yevloyev's family house in [[Malgobek]] was searched. After the search, Yevloyev's father, Yakhyu Yevloyev, convinced his son to publicly sever all ties with the Ingushetia.ru site, as it appeared to be too dangerous. Since then, the site has been controlled by an editorial committee chaired by Ibragim Kostoyev.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

Yevloyev did not, however, completely withdraw from the politics of Ingushetia. He was one of the organizers of the ''I did not vote'' campaign, intended to expose mass [[voter fraud]] in Ingushetia during the [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 Russian presidential election]]. According to official data, 98% of eligible Ingushetia voters took part in the elections, almost all voting for [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. But Yevloyev alleged that less than half of registered voters had actually participated in the elections, and therefore sought to compile a list of people who could personally guarantee that they did not vote in the election. If the list proved to include more than 2% of Ingushetia's voting registry, it might constitute proof of massive election fraud.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

Yevloyev also organized and financed a campaign collecting signatures calling for the removal of Ingushetia President Zyazikov, and the restoration of the previous Ingushetia president [[Ruslan Aushev]].&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

In the beginning of 2008, the office of the Ingushetia public procurator initiated hearings in Kuntsevo Court, demanding that access to the site Ingushetia.ru be restricted. According to the prosecutors, in an interview with Ingushetia businessman [[Musa Keligov]] hosted on the site, Keligov directly accused Zyazikov of connections with guerillas. The prosecutors argued that this material constituted [[libel]] as well as "public advocacy of extremist activity". In May 2008, the court issued an injunction demanding that Russian providers "limit access to the site by filtering its [[Internet Protocol|IP]] addresses". In June 2008, the court characterized the site as "extremist" and demanded its closure. The site was not closed. According to Ingushetia.ru's lawyer Kaloy Akhilgov, since the site is registered in the United States, it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of Russian courts. Akhilgov also stated that the decision is technically incorrect because it classifies the site under the heading "mass media" despite the fact that the site is not officially registered as such. Akhilgov added that they intended to appeal the court decision.&lt;ref name=lentopedia/&gt;

==Death==
On 31 August 2008, Magomed Yevloyev was shot in the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] and killed while in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7590719.stm Ingushetia website owner killed], [[BBC News]], 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24272873-12377,00.html Kremlin critic found dead], ''[[The Australian]]'', 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/08/31/international/i072332D67.DTL&amp;tsp=1 Deputy says Russian police kill Web site owner], [[Associated Press]], 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks before his killing, it was rumoured that Magomed knew his life was in danger and he had planned on seeking [[political asylum]] in a [[European Union]] country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1010/42/369633.htm Editor of News Portal Flees Country], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 7 August retrieved 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Local police claimed that Yevloyev was shot after he had attempted to grab an [[assault rifle]] from one of the police officers in the car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/world/europe/01ingushetia.html ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups have rejected this account of Yevloyev's death, and the United States [[State Department]] has called for an investigation of the killing and for those responsible to be "held to account for what happened".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0244665820080902 ''Reuters'', "U.S. urges probe of journalist's death in Ingushetia", 2 Sep 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for [[Vladimir Putin]] has said that an investigation will take place, but that Yevloyev had resisted arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e4693d2c-791d-11dd-9d0c-000077b07658.html ''Financial Times'', "Tension in Ingushetia after journalist’s death", 3 September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] documented dozens of arbitrary detentions, [[forced disappearance|disappearances]], acts of [[torture]], and extrajudicial executions in Ingushetia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/06/24/russia19194.htm Killings, Torture, Disappearances in Chechnya-Style Counterinsurgency], [[Human Rights Watch]], 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] denounced Yevloyev's killing as an "assassination" aimed at cracking down on dissent in Ingushetia. The killing also triggered calls for Ingushetia's independence from Russia. The organizer of the protest rally, Magomed Khazibiyev, declared that the Ingush opposition would demand independence, appealing to [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|Russia's recognition]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s breakaway [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] as precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Belton, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e4693d2c-791d-11dd-9d0c-000077b07658.html Tension in Ingushetia after journalist’s death]. ''[[The Financial Times]]''. 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral of Yevloyev developed into an anti-government protest, in which, according to organizers, several thousands participated. Early on 2 September, police dispersed a sleeping crowd of around 50 men who remained in the main square in [[Nazran]], Ingushetia's capital city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL224586._CH_.2400 Police break up protest in Russia's Ingushetia]. Reuters. 2 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

His death investigation case is classified as "Murder by negligence" according to the [[Criminal Code of Russia]]. Another criminal case for his illegal detention (according to the investigators, police did not have the right to arrest him when they did) was opened in February 2009,&lt;ref name=secondcase&gt;{{cite news|first=Musa|last=Muradov|title=Убийство Магомеда Евлоева вышло на должностной уровень |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?docsid=1139375|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=17 March 2009|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but withdrawn in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Ingushetia_Prosecutor_Reverses_Decision_To_Investigate_Journalists_Death/1513766.html Ingushetia Prosecutor Reverses Decision To Investigate Journalist's Death]. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court==
On 11 December 2009, a court in Ingushetia found Ibragim Yevloyev guilty of unintentionally murdering Magomed Yevloyev. Ibragim Yevloyev was sentenced to two years of a "colony-settlement". In February 2010 his sentence was mitigated to two years of freedom restriction.&lt;ref name=lenta2010&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2010/03/02/change1/ Sentence of Murderer of Ingush Oppositioner Mitigated], Lenta.Ru, February 2010 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatives of Magomed Yevloyev do not trust the official version. In their view, the owner of [[Ingushetiya.Ru]] was murdered intentionally. The family addressed the European Court on Human Rights with a complaint.&lt;ref name=lenta2010/&gt;

'''[[Sayyid|Mir]]-Hossein Mousavi Khameneh''' ({{lang-fa|میرحسین موسوی خامنه|Mīr-Hoseyn Mūsavī Khāmené}}, {{IPA-fa|miːɾ hoˈsɛjn ɛ muːsæˈviː jɛ  xɑːmɛˈnɛ|pron}}; born 2 March 1942) is an Iranian [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] politician, artist and architect who served as the seventy-ninth and last [[Prime Minister of Iran]] from 1981 to 1989. He was a reformist candidate for the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] and eventually the leader of the opposition in the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests|post-election unrest]]. Mousavi served as the president of the [[Iranian Academy of the Arts|Iranian Academy of Arts]] until 2009, when Conservative authorities removed him.&lt;ref name="Radio Farda, Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ميرحسين موسوی از رياست فرهنگستان هنر برکنار شد|url=http://www.radiofarda.com/content/o2_iran_fires_opposition_leader/1911161.html|publisher=Radio Farda|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the revolution, Mousavi was the editor-in-chief of ''[[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri-e Eslami]]'', the official newspaper of the [[Islamic Republican Party]],  before being elevated to [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and eventually the post of Prime Minister. He was the last Prime Minister in Iran prior to the 1989 [[Iranian constitutional referendum, 1989|constitutional changes]] which removed the post of prime minister; he then went into semi-retirement for the next 20 years. He remains a member of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]] and the [[High Council of Cultural Revolution]]. However, he has not participated in their meetings for years, which is interpreted by political analysts and commentators as a sign of his disapproval.

For the 2009 Iranian Presidential election, Mousavi came out of semi-retirement and ran as one of two Reformist candidates against the administration of incumbent [[President of Iran]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. According to official results, he didn't win the election, and following alleged vote rigging and manipulation, his campaign sparked a long protest that eventually turned into a national and international movement against the Government and Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]. Despite the violent crackdown, he remains the leader of the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]] but his movements have remained severely restricted. He chose green as his campaign color, a color which is pervasive in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jun/1119.html|title=Even Iran Can Change|date=6 November 2009 |publisher=Peyvand|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently under [[house arrest]] along with his wife and [[Mehdi Karroubi]].&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/086/2011/en Iran: Further information: Opposition leaders arbitrarily held] [[Amnesty International]], 29 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He initially participated in the establishment of the Jonbesh-e Mosalmanan-e Mobarez ([[Movement of Militant Muslims]]) alongside [[Habibollah Peyman]] which eventually led him to join ranks with [[Mohammad Beheshti]], who was a close associate of the revolution leader, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], and abandoned his previous connections with Ali Shariati.&lt;ref name="bbcp"/&gt;

[[File:People of second cabinet of I.R.Iran.jpg|thumb|Mousavi (first from right, sitting) as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]] and Prime Minister [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]], 1981]]
Following the collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979, Mousavi helped [[Mohammad Beheshti]] found the Islamic Republican Party in 1979 in order to assist the establishment of the [[Islamic Republic]] in Iran and hasten the overthrow of Iran's monarchy.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He became the political secretary of the party,&lt;ref name="bbcp"/&gt; and chief editor of ''Jomhouri-e Eslami'', the party's official newspaper.&lt;ref name="bbcp"/&gt; For this, he is widely viewed as "The Architect" of the Islamic Republic both in Iran and abroad.

In mid-1979, he was appointed by Khomeini to the [[Iranian Council of Islamic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee (2007), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; As the chief editor of ''Jomhouri-e Eslami'', he was a loud critic and opponent of [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], the first president of the Islamic Republic, until the latter's 1981 flight to France, following a successful impeachment by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Baktiari (1996), pp.80–1.&lt;/ref&gt; During Banisadr's presidency, the prime minister [[Mohammad Ali Rajai]] nominated Mousavi as his foreign minister, however Banisadr opposed the nomination and Mousavi was not appointed.&lt;ref name=Amoueebio&gt;{{cite web|last=Amouee |first=Bahman Ahmadi |title=میرحسین موسوی، اندیشه های اقتصادی تا احساسات شاعرانه |url=http://www.amouee.net/spip.php?article322 |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113529/http://www.amouee.net/spip.php?article322 |archivedate=13 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 August 1981, as part of the restructuring of the government in Rajai's cabinet, Mousavi was appointed [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|foreign minister]].&lt;ref name="bbcp"/&gt; He held the post until 15 December 1981, when he received the higher appointment of prime minister.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

==Prime ministership==
{{See also|Prime ministership of Mir-Hossein Mousavi}}
[[File:Ali Khamenei (Left) - Mir-Hossein Mousavi (Right).jpg|thumb|left|Mousavi (right) with then-President [[Ali Khamenei]] (left)]]
In August 1981, President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]] and Prime Minister [[Mohammad-Javad Bahonar]] were assassinated in an explosion. [[Ali Khamenei]] was then elected as the third [[president of Iran]] in the [[Iranian presidential election, October 1981]]. He put forward [[Ali Akbar Velayati]] as his prime minister, but the Iranian parliament did not give him the [[vote of confidence]], and he was defeated with a vote of 80 to 74.&lt;ref name="bbcp" /&gt; Although Khamenei had strong reservations with Mousavi, as a compromise with the left-leaning parliament, agreed to offer Mousavi for the post of premier.&lt;ref name="bbcp" /&gt; On 28 October 1981, with the approval of Khomeini, the parliament approved Mousavi with a vote of 115 to 39 to become the 79th [[prime minister of Iran]] on 31 October 1981.&lt;ref name="rain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20090609/155210271.html|title=Biography: Mir-Hossein Mousavi|date=2009-06-09|agency=RIA Novosti|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iran under the Ayatollahs'', by Dilip Hiro, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflicts between Mousavi, who belonged to the left wing of the Islamic Republic, with Ali Khamenei (the current [[Supreme Leader of Iran|leader of Iran]]), who belonged to the right wing of the Islamic Republic, continued during their eight years of shared governance.&lt;ref name="bbcp" /&gt; However, an escalation in conflicts between the two led to Mousavi's resignation shortly after the end of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="bbcp" /&gt; As the prime minister, Mousavi had the full backing of Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader, and he refused to accept his resignation. While his government was viewed as somewhat liberal, he was still under the pressure of hardliners, though Khomeini generally protected Mousavi from the conservatives and gave him a free rein in deciding actions for the economy.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; However, his involvement in security matters remained less clear, and it was disputed whether or not Mousavi was involved in the killing of thousands of dissidents and minorities in Kurdistan and Mazandaran during this time. It has generally been accepted that Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaee (who was in charge of the Revolutionary Guards during this time) have never been close, though he was in charge of foreign operations, particularly in Lebanon.

Mousavi's premiership coincided with the Iran–Iraq War. He guided the country through its war with Iraq, and earned popular acclaim for his stewardship of the national economy.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; He pioneered a [[voucher|bond]]-based economy, which many believe was responsible for a fair distribution of goods among the people throughout the Iran–Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e0997f4-e40f-11dd-8274-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|title=Iran's ex-PM seen as candidate|date=16 January 2009|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts praise his handling of [[economy of Iran|Iran's economy]], his civil and economic leadership during the Iran–Iraq War, and his efforts to end Iran's international isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2009/03/090303_mg_mir_hossain_mosavi.shtml|date=3 March 2009|publisher=BBC|language=Persian|title=Mir-Hossein: Attempt to Exit 20-year long Isolation?

A year after the end of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] on 20 August 1988, Ruhollah Khomeini died (June 3, 1989), and Ali Khamenei was elected as the new [[Supreme Leader]] by the [[Assembly of Experts]]. Following his death, Mousavi and his fellow left-wingers lost their main source of support within the establishment.&lt;ref name="bbcp" /&gt; During the parliament hearing on post-war reconstruction plans, Mousavi had heated arguments with [[Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], the speaker of [[Iran's parliament]] at the time, over Rafsanjani's suggestion that Iran accept the offer of western countries to help with post-war reconstruction.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On 28 July 1989, the [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was amended and approved by Iranian voters in a [[Iranian constitutional referendum, 1989|national referendum]] with a 97% yes vote. At this time, [[Mehdi Karrubi]] had been elected as the new speaker of the parliament, to whom the amended constitution was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.irna.ir/occasion/12azar84/indexghanon.htm |script-title=fa:تصویب قانون اساسی جمهوری اسلامی |publisher=[[IRNA]] news agency |language=Persian |accessdate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414231346/http://www2.irna.ir/occasion/12azar84/indexghanon.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these amendments abolished the position of Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="rain" /&gt; Rafsanjani was [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|elected]] as the fourth president of Iran on 28 July 1989, and became the president on 3 August 1989. Mousavi's premiership ended on the same date.&lt;ref name="rain" /&gt; Mousavi was not invited to be a participant in the new government headed by Rafsanjani, and disappeared from the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

==Retirement from politics==
[[File:آرامگاه شهدای هفتم تیر در بهشت زهرای تهران 07.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hafte Tir bombing]] victims' mausoleum, which is designed by Mousavi]]

When Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, died in 1989, Mousavi was no longer welcome in the government.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; It was the start of 20 years of an almost total absence from public life for Mousavi, which many considered as a sign of his disapproval of the established government, though he did sit on two high-level government councils.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

In 1989, Ali Khamenei named him as a member of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]], his membership of which still continues. Mousavi has been a member of the [[Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution]] since 1996. He was also the political adviser of president [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] (1989–1997) and senior adviser of president Khatami (1997–2005).

During these years, he partly retired from politics and returned to architecture and teaching, becoming President of the [[Iranian Academy of Arts]], one of the four academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main building of the Academy is designed by him.&lt;ref name=Aftab&gt;{{cite web|title=آفتاب – افتتاح ساختمان اصلی|url=http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcjtyeo.uqeovzsffu.html|publisher=Aftab News|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he developed his passion for painting and writing poetry. He was a professor at [[Shahid Beheshti University]] and later joined the Academic staff of [[Tarbiat Modares University]]. His main field is architecture, and buildings such as ''Kanoon-e Tohid'' in Tehran, ''Beynolharamein Bazaar'' in [[Shiraz]], ''Haft-e-tir Martyr's tomb'' in [[Behesht-e Zahra|Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra]], and ''Salman mosque'' in the presidential residence are examples of his work. In recent years, he has been more active in painting and has participated in many exhibitions.

== Presidential candidacy==
{{Main article|Mir-Hossein Mousavi presidential campaign, 2009}}

===Pre-2009===
Mousavi refused to run for the presidency in the 1997 elections, which caused the reformists to turn to his former Cabinet Minister, then a little-known cleric, [[Mohammad Khatami]], who was elected by a landslide. During Khatami's administration, Mousavi served as the Senior Adviser to the President.

Mousavi was considered the leading candidate from the reformist alliance to run in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005]]. However, on 12 October 2004, he officially declined the proposal after a meeting with President Mohammad Khatami and the two other top members of one of Iran's main Reformist parties, the [[Association of Combatant Clerics]], [[Mehdi Karroubi]] and [[Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha]].

===2009 presidential candidacy===
[[File:Iran election (2).jpg|thumb|left|Mousavi supporters in Tehran]]

After 20 years of political silence, on 9 March 2009, Mousavi announced his intention to run in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]]. He stated that his main goals were: to institutionalize social justice, equality and fairness, freedom of expression, to root out corruption and to speed up Iran's stagnant process of privatization, and thus move Iran away from what he called "an alms-based economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=88106 |title=Moussavi officially joins presidential fray |publisher=[[PressTV]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618050730/http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=88106 |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavi criticized the then-current conservative President, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], for his alleged economic mismanagement, asking, when Iran "was making profits from the high prices of oil, did he (Ahmadinejad) envisage a situation when the prices would fall?" On 16 March 2009, the former Iranian President Khatami withdrew from the election in support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/mar/1195.html|title= Khatami will soon withdraw candidacy in favor of Mousavi: source |publisher=payvand|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some active members of the conservative camp, such as [[Emad Afroogh]], as well as the conservative newspaper ''Jomhouri-e Eslami'', supported Mousavi's candidacy, he did not receive the official backing of any major conservative party. His candidacy made it harder for the conservatives to support [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], and large conservative parties, such as the Combatant Clergy Association, did not back the current President for a second term of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/may/18//-8a5153f5c7.html|title=جامعه روحانیت دو پاره شد|publisher=rooz online|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=9 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522182832/http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/may/18/-8a5153f5c7.html|archivedate=22 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mousavi had on numerous occasions indicated his wish to change the constitution in order to remove the existing ban on the private ownership of television stations (currently all Iranian television stations are state-owned), as well as transfer the control of the law-enforcement forces to the President (so that they represent the people, since the people directly elect the President through popular vote) from the Supreme Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=90057 |title=Mousavi backs private TV, urges change recognition |publisher=[[PressTV]] |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618053241/http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=90057 |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "the issue of non-compliance with the Iranian rules and regulations is the biggest problem that the country is currently faced with" and that he wished to put in place ways to enforce the laws further,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=90375 |title=Moussavi warns against governmental cover-up |publisher=[[PressTV]] |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618053316/http://www.presstv.com/election2009/detail.aspx?id=90375 |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was also important to bring an end to keeping the populace uninformed about government matters.

 |title=Iran's Reform Candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, Says Open to U.S. Negotiations

 |date=6 April 2009 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavi has stated that giving up the country's nuclear program would be "irreparable" and that the Iranian people support the nuclear program.&lt;ref name=foxApril06 /&gt; "No one in Iran will accept suspension,"  Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide "guarantees" that Tehran's nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.&lt;ref name="PressTV-2009-04-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91361&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=Mousavi: Iran will never halt enrichment |date=14 April 2009 |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=1 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417033036/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91361&amp;sectionid=351020101 |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May, Mousavi pledged that if elected he would amend "[[women's rights in Iran|discriminatory and unjust regulations]]" against women, and take other measures in favour of women's rights and equality.&lt;ref name=BBCMay30/&gt; He said that he would seek to disband the so-called morality police force, and ensure that Iranian women are treated equally, with the ability to attain financial empowerment and to serve at the highest levels of decision making bodies.&lt;ref name=BBCMay30&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8075603.stm|title=Iran candidate Mousavi backs women's rights

====Foreign policies====
Mousavi directly addressed activating foreign policy to boost national interest by reducing tensions with other nations. This included negotiating with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] if "his actions are in keeping with his words".&lt;ref name="spiegelApril"/&gt; He condemned Ahmadinejad's attitude toward [[The Holocaust]] (namely, that it was "a myth"), and condemned the killing of Jews in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=foxApril06/&gt;

==Protests to the election results==
{{main article|2009 Iranian election protests}}
The election was held on 12 June 2009. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning by a landslide, though Mousavi and many others believed the results to be fraudulent, suggesting that the Interior Minister, [[Sadegh Mahsouli]], an ally of Ahmadinejad, interfered with the election and distorted the votes to keep Ahmadinejad in power.&lt;ref name=WPDispute&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/12/AR2009061200916_2.html|title=Iran Election In Dispute as 2 Candidates Claim Victory|work=The Washington Post|date=13 June 2009|first=Thomas|last=Erdbrink|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousavi has claimed victory, and called for his supporters to celebrate it, sparking [[2009 Iranian election protests|large protests]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Due to protests, from the opposition, the Supreme Leader ordered a partial recount of the election results. The recount was a random counting of 10% of the ballots. In order to create transparency, a 12-member council showed the recount on television, and concluded that President Ahmadinejad still led Mousavi after the recount. After the recount, the Guardian council certified the election, and concluded no evidence of irregularities, and closed the dossier on the election.&lt;ref name=recount3&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed1/idUSLT437642|accessdate=14 June 2009|title=Iran upholds Ahmadinejad victory, says matter closed|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the Green Movement===
[[File:6th Day - Mousavi inside the Crowd.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|Mousavi at the protests of 2009]]
The Iranian Green Movement refers to a series of actions after the Iranian presidential election, 2009, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office.

[[Mir Hossein Mousavi]], [[Mehdi Karroubi]], [[Hossein-Ali Montazeri]] and Mohammad Khatami are recognized as leaders of the Green Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asemandailynews.com/?p=2417| script-title=fa:دعوتنامه برگزارکنندگان مراسم ۱۸ تیر از موسوی و مهدی کروبی و محمد خاتمی|accessdate=5 July 2009|date=5 July 2009|work=Aseman Daily News|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where is my vote? ({{lang-fa|رای من کجاست؟}}) was a motto used during the protests. Anti-Ahmadinejad protesters chanted the English-language phrase in numbers not seen since the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], in an attempt to receive international attention. The Iranian Government had released results claiming a two-thirds majority for Ahmadinejad, but supporters of Mousavi and [[Karroubi]], the moderate opposition leaders, accused the government of [[vote rigging|rigging the vote]].

In the aftermath of the election and ensuing comments by Ahmadinejad and other conservative leaders, calling the opposition "a pile of dust" (خس و خاشاک), protests were widened and massive peaceful protests were held around the country. Although the Iranian government prohibited any gatherings of protesters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media supporting the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched in defiance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/1098601.html Iranians, by hundreds of thousands, ask: Where is my vote?] ''Miami Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of protesters were arrested, and several were killed by the police and militia forces [[Basij]]. [[Death of Neda Agha-Soltan|Neda Agha-soltan]] and [[Sohrab Aarabi]] were among the victims, and alleged cases of rape in prison ([[Taraneh Mousavi]]) were also uncovered.

Since the election, the government has severely restricted the access of foreign and Iranian media to footage and information relating to opposition activities. As a result, scenes of the massive street protests and more frequent student protests have been filmed by participants themselves.

===Death of Mousavi's nephew===
Seyed Ali Mousavi was the nephew of Mousavi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/27/iran.protests/index.html Several killed, 300 arrested in Tehran protests] ''CNN'', 28 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mousavi died on 27 December 2009, during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]], when he was reportedly shot in either the back or the chest by security forces during demonstrations against [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s contested election win.&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6969523.ece Hardliners seize Mousavi corpse as Iran regime hits back], ''The Times'', 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the official spokesman of Mir-Hossein Moussavi's campaign abroad, told BBC News in an interview that Iranian secret police had called Seyed Ali Mousavi several times, days before he was shot, saying: "We will kill you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8433991.stm Iran reformist Mousavi's nephew 'got death threats'], ''BBC'', 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After he died, his body was taken to Ebn-e Sina hospital, where protesters demonstrated outside. The protesters were broken up with tear gas by the Iranian security forces. It was later revealed that the government had removed his body and taken it to an undisclosed location in an attempt to crack down on the protests.&lt;ref name=timesonline /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=54286 Seven Iranian Opposition Leaders Arrested – Seyed Ali Mousavi's Body Goes Missing], ''San Francisco Sentinel'', 28 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Green Path of Hope===
Mousavi and other reformist leaders are now working with peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition, named The Green Path of Hope. Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Interior Ministry]]. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate, nor is likely to receive permission; the movement was named a "path" in order bypass this law.&lt;ref name="gooya-2009"&gt;{{cite web|author=Copyright: gooya.com 2010 |url=http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2009/08/092369.php |title=gooya news:: politics: جزييات "راه سبز اميد" از زبان عليرضا بهشتی: خاتمی و کروبی عضو شورای مرکزی هستند، کميته‌های "راه سبز اميد" در حال شکل گيری است، ايلنا |publisher=News.gooya.com |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Path of Hope seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad's presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlemannews.ir/index.aspx?n=2694 |title=پارلمان نیوز : تشکیلات "راه سبز امید" را ایجاد می‌کنیم تا حقوق مردم را استیفا کنیم/با برخوردهای اخیر، جا دارد انسان سر به زیر خاک کند |publisher=Parlemannews.ir |accessdate=9 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720180530/http://www.parlemannews.ir/index.aspx?n=2694 |archivedate=20 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=You can't follow some parts of the constitution and throw the rest into a bin.}}

Mousavi is quoted in describing the movement:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/08/16/Mousavi-announces-new-political-party/UPI-34501250401917/ Mousavi announces new political party], [[United Press International]], 16 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=The Green Path of Hope is formed for the sake of people’s rightful demands and for claiming their rights... the color green is the symbol of this movement; its slogan is demanding the impeccable implementation of the constitution, and innumerable self-motivated independent societies form the body of this movement.}}

According to organization officials, the movement encompasses numerous political parties, NGOs and social networks. Mousavi emphasized that existent, autonomous social networks in the community are part of this movement:&lt;ref name="ilna2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71086 |title=Green path of hope, Mousavi's new organization |accessdate=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723080421/http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71086 |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=During the election, our mottos supported and remained in the framework of the constitution; today we are devoted to those slogans. We believe that if the people's demands were treated fairly, instead of being distorted by the media and linked to foreigners, and the government promoted truth by fair criticism, our mottos could satisfy the public.&lt;ref name=ilna2/&gt;}}

The "Green Path" has six main members on its central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body will be ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner.&lt;ref name="gooya-2009"/&gt;

===Arab Spring===
{{main article|Arab Spring}}
In the wake of the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian]] revolutions, Green movement leaders in Iran called for demonstrations on 14 February 2011. The government responded by placing leaders of the movement under house arrest, and on 14 February Iranian state TV broadcast images of "some 50 conservative MPs marching through parliament's main hall" chanting "Death to Mousavi, death to Karroubi".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12462491 Iran unrest: MPs call for death of Mousavi and Karroubi], BBC News, 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===House arrest===
Mousavi and his wife, as well as Mehdi Karoubi, another opposition figure, were put under [[house arrest]] after they urged their supporters to organize demonstrations in support of uprisings in the Arab world in February 2011.&lt;ref name=upnews112&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian Authorities Arrest Opposition Leader’s Daughters |url=http://updatednews.ca/2013/02/11/iranian-authorities-arrest-opposition-leaders-daughters/ |accessdate=11 February 2013 |newspaper=Updated News |date=11 February 2013 |agency=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708095457/http://updatednews.ca/2013/02/11/iranian-authorities-arrest-opposition-leaders-daughters/ |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2013, Iran's security forces arrested Mousavi's two daughters, Zahra and Nargess Mousavi, in their home.&lt;ref name=rzamaneh&gt;{{cite news|title=Daughters of Iranian Opposition Leaders Arrested|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/13/feb/1093.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=Payvand|date=11 February 2013|agency=Radio Zamaneh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-official news agency ILNA reported that they were questioned, and then freed the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran releases daughters of opposition leader |url=https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/iran-releases-daughters-opposition-leader |accessdate=2 September 2017 |work=CNSNews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=11 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election of [[Hassan Rouhani]] as [[Iranian presidential election, 2013|President]] in 2013, it was announced that Mousavi and Rahnavard would soon be freed from house arrest.

'''Melfi  Al Hussaini  Al Harbi''', more commonly known as '''Muhannad''' ('''مهند'''; Mukhannad or Mukhanad, {{lang-ru|Муханнад, sometimes Моганнед or Моханнад}}), and also known as '''Abu Anas''' ('''ابو أنس'''), was a [[Mujahideen|Mujahid]] [[Emir]] (commander) fighting in [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]]. Following the death of [[Abu Hafs al-Urduni]] on 26 November 2006, he was named leader of the [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2006/12/12/6803.shtml |title=Commander Muhannad Assumes Leadership of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya |publisher=Kavkaz Center |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zel3sumW |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the battalion of foreign fighters once commanded by the notorious Saudi-born [[Ibn al-Khattab]].

Although Russian intelligence has claimed that he was a native of Jordan who served as a combat pilot (achieving the rank of Lieutenant) in the Jordanian Air Force and who also underwent military training in the United States they are not considered true. He is not Jordanian,&lt;ref name="Убитого"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/184324/ |title=Убитого в Чечне ‘Моханнада’ выдали свои, утверждают силовики |publisher=Кавказский Узил |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zgXkSGkm |archivedate=June 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is reported in other sources that he was Saudi.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.webcitation.org/5zek4KcL0 |title=Emir Muhannad: The Last of Chechnya’s Arab Volunteers |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="legendary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/legendary_arab_commander_reported_killed_in_chechnya/9502477.html |title=Legendary Arab Commander Reported Killed in Chechnya |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zekM6zYr |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed by Russian security forces outside the village of Serzhen-Yurt, Chechnya on 21 April 2011.

==Early life==

Although little is reliably known of Muhannad’s early life, he was born in 1969 and hailed from the [[Medina]] area of Saudi Arabia’s western [[Hejaz]] region.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; It is said that he have graduated with honors from the Islamic University of Madinah and is believed to have descended from Al Ashraf, meaning “from the family of the Prophet.”&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

==Rebel activity==

Muhannad arrived in the Caucasus in 1999 during the early days of the [[Second Chechen War]], attempting to pass through [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] into Chechnya. Upon arrival in the [[Pankisi Gorge]] – a mountainous valley in northeastern Georgia inhabited mostly by ethnic Chechens known as [[Kist people|Kists]] – Muhannad waited almost two years for his opportunity to cross the border.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;  During his time living amongst the Chechen refugees, Muhannad gave lectures on the history of Islam and advocated a “purer” form of the religion than that traditionally practiced by Chechens; it is perhaps no coincidence that [[Wahabbi]] influence began to appear in Pankisi around this same time.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;
Muhannad was eventually able to gain entry into Chechnya with a group controlled by the Akhmadov brothers in 2001, arriving along with other prominent Arab fighters such as Abu Atiya, Abu Rabia, and others.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; Having acquired previous battlefield experience in Afghanistan,The Philippines, Bosnia, and Kosovo, Muhannad joined the battalion of Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya led by [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]].&lt;ref name="legendary" /&gt; 
 
In October 2006, [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] president [[Dokka Umarov]] made Muhannad one of three deputies to [[Magomet Yevloyev|Magomet 'Magas' Yevloyev]], the Ingush commander of the separatist military wing then known as the [[Caucasian Front (Chechen War)|Caucasian Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.webcitation.org/5yAlnYIKB |title='&amp;#39;Magas: Shamil Basaev's Ingush Successor&amp;#39; |publisher=North Caucasus Analysis, Volume: 8 Issue: 31 |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, Abu Hafs al-Urduni - the successor to [[Abu al-Walid]] (killed in 2004) and [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] (killed in 2002) as commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya - was killed by Russian forces in [[Dagestan]], leading to Muhannad's unanimous appointment as the new Emir on 9 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1143777.html |title=Arab Named to Command Mercenaries in Chechnya |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=18 December 2006 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yAigH3Xz |archivedate=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that in this same time period, he became the key facilitator connecting Chechen separatists to financial supporters in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

Following Umarov's declaration of a North Caucasus-wide insurgent organization called the Caucasus Emirate in September 2007, Muhannad was declared his [[naib]], or deputy.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; In the meantime, Muhannad was also a ranking member of the rebel unit commanded by [[Aslambek Vadalov]], and his participation in combat operations put him on equal footing with his indigenous counterparts, garnering him much respect.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

In February 2008, he was reportedly killed by officers of the Russian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) during a search operation near the village of Arshty in [[Ingushetia]].&lt;ref name="arshty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/russ/content/2008/02/12/56259.shtml |title=ВИЛАЙЯТ Г1АЛГ1АЙЧЕ.

According to different sources, Muhannad took part in attacks on Russian security forces in eastern Chechnya in 2008 and in western Chechnya along the border with Ingushetia in 2009.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; In January 2009, he issued a statement declaring the Caucasus Emirate's support for the Palestinians in Gaza who at that time were [[Gaza War (2008–09)|under siege]] by the Israeli military;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkaz.org.uk/russ/content/2009/01/20/63503.shtml |title=Emir Muhannad: The Caucasus Supports Gaza |publisher=Kavkaz Center |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zemqdxyp |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he followed that with a declaration on 6 April appointing [[Umalat Magomedov]] (also known as al-Bara) to the role of Emir of the [[Vilayat Dagestan|Dagestan Front]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavkaz.org.uk/eng/content/2009/04/12/10652.shtml |title=Emir Bara appointed commander of Dagestan Front |publisher=Kavkaz Center |date=12 April 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zemxOT2q |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it suggested that Muhannad had a larger profile within the Caucasus Emirate than most believed a foreign fighter could attain, and that he had the legitimate ability to influence decisions made by Umarov.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

On 29 August 2010, Muhannad was one of two commanders who led an [[2010 Tsentoroy Attack|assault]] on the village of [[Tsentoroy]], birthplace of Chechen President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]].&lt;ref name="relieved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/04/russian_forces_kill.php |title=Russian forces kill al Qaeda's envoy to the Islamic Caucasus Emirate |publisher=The Long War Journal |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zgfW4n1L |archivedate=June 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audacious operation was ultimately defeated after several hours of heavy fighting that resulted in the deaths of twelve militants and five security officers.&lt;ref name="relieved" /&gt;

===Split with Dokka Umarov===

On 1 August 2010, the rebel website [[Kavkaz Center]] posted an announcement from Dokka Umarov in which he stated he was stepping down from the top leadership position in the Caucasus Emirate and naming Aslambek Vadalov as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Report_Claims_Top_Chechen_Rebel_Steps_Down_Appoints_Successor/2115894.html |title=Top Chechen Rebel Announces Command Handover |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=2 August 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zfRvjfDd |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just three days later Umarov would retract his resignation, leading to confusion over who was actually in control of the North Caucasus insurgency. On 12 August, a video posted on a Russian militant website appeared featuring Muhannad, [[Khuseyn Gakayev]], Vadalov, and [[Tarkhan Gaziev]]; in it, the four veteran field commanders alleged that Umarov's renunciation was disrespectful to his subordinates, and while they still pledged allegiance to the Caucasus Emirate, they no longer supported him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligence-analyst.com/intelligence/530789-power-struggle-among-russias-militants/ |title=Power Struggle Among Russia's Militants |publisher=Intelligence-Analyst.com |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zgemFkSL |archivedate=June 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muhannad, the primary reason for the mutiny was Umarov's disobedience of the mujahideen [[shura]] council's consensus that he step down; in response, [[Magomed Vagabov|Saifullah Gubdenski]] - leader of the Dagestani fighters - fiercely condemned Muhannad by accusing him and his foreign predecessors of "neglecting the aspirations of local rebel leaders" and lashing out at the "outsiders' selfish desire to install their men in leading positions in traditionally parochial" Caucasian militant groups.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; Furthermore, the vast majority of insurgents in the republics surrounding Chechnya continued to support Umarov, at one point reaching out for external theological support via the London-based Syrian Salafi ideologue named Abd al-Mun'im Mustafa Halima (also known as [[Abu Basir al-Tartusi]]), who called on Muhannad to "either repent and obey Emir Doku Abu Osman (Dokka Umarov) or leave the [North] Caucasus and return home."&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; Umarov himself accused Muhannad of being the "main organizer of [[fitna (word)|fitna]] (split/discord) among the Mujahideen" in Chechnya, 
and asked him to re-affirm his loyalty.&lt;ref name="relieved"/&gt; When Muhannad did not, Umarov allegedly relieved him of his command,&lt;ref name="relieved" /&gt; leading to a very significant break within militant ranks.

==Death==

Muhannad was killed on 21 April 2011 in a search and destroy operation carried out in forested, mountainous terrain east of the village of Serzhen-Yurt at the junction of three districts in the Chechen republic: Shali, Kurchaloi, and Vedeno.&lt;ref name="Убитого" /&gt; According to the press center of the Chechen Interior Ministry, the operation featured officers from several district police stations, a [[Spetsnaz]] battalion of Russian MVD “South” troops, Spetsnaz from the 2nd Patrol Regiment of the Chechen MVD, and a detachment of the “Terek” unit from the MVD of the [[North Caucasian Federal District|North Caucasus Federal District]] (SKFO).&lt;ref name="Убитого" /&gt; The search team allegedly happened upon a group of six militants at 11:50 AM,&lt;ref name="уничтожен"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsru.com/russia/22apr2011/mohhanad.html |title=В Чечне уничтожен арабский эмиссар "Аль-Каиды" по кличке Моганнед |publisher=newsru.com |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zgcWlytL |archivedate=June 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who promptly split into groups of "two or three" so as to avoid capture.&lt;ref name="Убитого" /&gt; According to Russian officials, Muhannad and an Ingush militant named Ilez Sultygov ran into an ambush set by a group of commandos, and were killed in the ensuing shootout.&lt;ref name="Убитого" /&gt; Russian television showed footage of Muhannad's body on 22 April 2011,&lt;ref name="legendary" /&gt; a common practice by Russian authorities following the successful liquidation of militant commanders.

Following his death, Russian authorities stated that Muhannad was "directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years," at least according to intelligence gathered from captured Chechen militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/04/22/russia.chechnya.militant/index.html |title=Top al Qaeda militant dies in Chechnya |publisher=CNN.com |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zenvvV3S |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramzan Kadyrov also claimed that Muhannad only weighed around 50 kilograms at the time of his death, using this as proof that the insurgency was having "serious difficulties with the supply of food" and was "on the verge of starvation."&lt;ref name="Убитого" /&gt; Kadyrov, however, is known for outrageous and unverifiable claims, making it worth noting that in the photograph released of Muhannad's corpse he does not appear to be much different physically than those taken over the past decade.&lt;ref name="уничтожен" /&gt;

Muhannad's top deputy and presumed successor - an ethnic [[Kurd]] from [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]] called [[Abdulla Kurd]] - would be killed less than two weeks later, capping a momentous month for the Russian security services that included the elimination of several high-ranking Emirs in other provinces, including [[Supyan Abdullayev]] (Deputy Emir of the Caucasus Emirate), [[Israpil Velijanov]] (Emir of [[Vilayat Dagestan]]), [[Asker Dzhappuyev]] (Emir of the [[Vilayat KBK|United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay]]) and several other field commanders and lesser known Emirs of smaller sectors. Muhannad's killing was of significant importance given that he was one of the most ruthless, capable and tactically proficient field commanders as well as the last prominent Arab volunteer in Chechnya; analysts called it one of Russia's most significant security successes in the region in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia_al-qaeda_militant_chechnya/24091315.html |title=Russia Kills Top Al-Qaeda Militant in Chechnya |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zhySmfBD |archivedate=June 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2011 rapprochement by the feuding separatist factions re-aligned Gakayev, Vadalov, and numerous other field commanders who had previously forsworn their oaths of loyalty to Umarov; Muhannad's death is thought to have paved the way to reconciliation between the two sides.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/07/caucasus_emirate_cla_1.php |title=Internal divisions resolved, claims Caucasus Emirate |publisher=The Long War Journal |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60SJUdWF7 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myōken''' '''Bosatsu''' ([[Sanskrit]]: Sudrsti/Sudarśana, Japanese: 妙見菩薩) or ''Hokushin-sonsei-myōken Daibosatsu'', is a [[bodhisattva]] (''bosatsu''), who is the deification of the [[North Star]]. It is mainly associated with the [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]], [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] and [[Tendai]] temples. 

As god of the Polestar, he was associated with [[Amenominakanushi]]-no-kami, but also [[Kisshōten]] (one of the [[Seven Lucky Gods]]) and [[Bhaisajyaguru|Yakushi Nyōrai]] (medicine god). Myōken has always been worshipped by the Heike, and among them one of the first samurai, [[Taira-no-Masakado]]. Even today, he is still worshipped by the [[Sōma clan]]'s lords and honorary generals, as part of the rituals of ''[[Sōma Nomaoi]]''.

===Early life and career beginnings===
Newton-John was born in [[Cambridge]], England, to [[Welsh people|Welshman]] Brinley "Bryn" Newton-John (1914–1992) and Irene Helene (née Born) (1914–2003).

She attended Christ Church Grammar School, and then [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]], near to [[Ormond College]]. At 14, Newton-John formed a short-lived all-girl group, Sol Four, with three classmates often performing in a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law.&lt;ref name="ilovethatsong1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilovethatsong.com/artist/default.aspx?aid=237|title=Olivia Newton-John – Hip-O Records|publisher=Ilovethatsong.com|date=26 October 1987|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a regular on local Australian radio and television shows including [[HSV (TV station)|HSV-7]]'s ''[[Happy Hammond|The Happy Show]]'' where she performed as "Lovely Livvy".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

She also appeared on ''[[The Go!! Show]]'' where she met future duet partner, singer [[Pat Carroll (singer)|Pat Carroll]], and future music producer, [[John Farrar]] (Carroll and Farrar would later marry). She entered and won a talent contest on the television program ''Sing, Sing, Sing,'' hosted by 1960s Australian icon [[Johnny O'Keefe]], performing the songs "[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]" and "[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]". She was initially reluctant to use the prize she had won, a trip to Great Britain, but traveled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Newton-John recorded her first single, "Till You Say You'll Be Mine", in Britain for [[Decca Records]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; While in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, [[Ian Turpie]], with whom she had co-starred in the Australian telefilm, ''Funny Things Happen Down Under''. She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia which her mother would subsequently cancel.&lt;ref name="ilovethatsong1"/&gt;

Newton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called "Pat and Olivia" and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at [[Paul Raymond's Revue]] in [[Soho]], London. Dressed primly in frilly, high-collared dresses, they were unaware that this was a [[strip club]] until they began to perform onstage.)&lt;ref name="classic bands.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|url=http://www.classicbands.com/olivia.html|title=Olivia Newton-John|publisher=Classicbands.com|date=26 September 1948|accessdate=13 August 2010}}"&lt;/ref&gt; After Carroll's visa expired forcing her to return to Australia, Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work until 1975.&lt;ref name="classic bands.com"/&gt;

Newton-John was recruited for the group [[Toomorrow (soundtrack)|Toomorrow]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064989,00.html|title=Pop's Hottest Pipes – Olivia Newton-John|website=People|first=Robert|last=Windeler|date=24 February 1975|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by American producer [[Don Kirshner]]. In 1970, the group starred in a "science fiction musical" [[Toomorrow (film)|film]] and recorded an accompanying soundtrack album, on RCA records, both named after the group. That same year the group made two single recordings, "You're My Baby Now/Goin' Back" and "I Could Never Live Without Your Love/Roll Like A River". Neither track became a chart success and the project failed with the group disbanding.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Early success===
Newton-John released her first solo album, ''If Not For You'' (US No. 158 Pop), in 1971. The [[If Not For You|title track]], written by [[Bob Dylan]] and previously recorded by former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] for his 1970 album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', was her first international hit (US No. 25 Pop, No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] ("AC").&lt;ref name=ONJ.com_bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio.html|title=Olivia Newton-John Biography|publisher=Olivianewton-john.com|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her follow-up single, "[[Banks of the Ohio]]", was a top 10 hit in the UK and Australia. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine ''[[Record Mirror]]''. She made frequent appearances on [[Cliff Richard]]'s weekly show, ''It's Cliff Richard'',&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT387|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9780823076772|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred with him in the telefilm ''The Case''.

In the United States, Newton-John's career floundered after ''If Not For You''. Subsequent singles including "[[Banks of the Ohio]]" (No. 94 Pop, No. 34 AC) and remakes of George Harrison's "[[What Is Life]]" (No. 34 AC) and [[John Denver]]'s "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" (No. 119 Pop) made minimal chart impact until the release of "[[Let Me Be There]]" in 1973. The song reached the American Top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7),&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eKicir5sZr4C&amp;pg=PA461|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country…|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for Best Country Female&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.&lt;ref name=ONJ.com_bio/&gt;

In 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Long Live Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|Long Live Love]]". The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries. (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song.)&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John finished fourth at the contest held in [[Brighton]] behind [[ABBA]]'s winning Swedish entry, "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]". All six Eurovision contest song candidates were recorded by Newton-John and included on her ''Long Live Love'' album, her first for the [[EMI Records]] label.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The ''Long Live Love'' album was released in the US as ''[[If You Love Me, Let Me Know]]'' with the six Eurovision songs dropped for four different, more country-oriented tracks intended to capitalise on the success of "Let Me Be There". The title track was the first single reaching No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; (her best country position to date) and No. 2 AC. The next single, "[[I Honestly Love You]]", became Newton-John's signature song. Written and composed by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; the ballad became her first number-one Pop (two weeks), second number-one AC (three weeks) and third Top 10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]] for Record of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=iAzZZI-jQv4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPA5,M1|title=At the Grammys!: Behind the Scenes…|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9781423430735|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Ken|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female. The success of both singles helped the album reach No. 1 on both the Pop (one week)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcvM0rFOR_cC&amp;pg=PA191|title=Notable Moments of Women in Music|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9781423429517|last1=Warner|first1=Jay|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Country (eight weeks) Albums charts.

Newton-John's country success sparked a debate among purists, who took issue with a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music being equated with native Nashville artists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In addition to her Grammy for "Let Me Be There", Newton-John was also named the [[Country Music Association]] Female Vocalist of the Year in 1974, defeating more established Nashville-based nominees [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tanya Tucker]], as well as Canadian artist [[Anne Murray]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT405,M1|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9780823076772|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This protest, in part, led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Bill|title=50 Country Dissidents Organize New Assn., See Threat to CMA|journal=Billboard|pages=3, 48|date=23 November 1973|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=ace+olivia+cma#v=onepage&amp;q=ace%20olivia%20cma&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. [[Stella Parton]], Dolly's sister, recorded "Ode to Olivia" and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin']]'', in [[Nashville]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Aankomst zangeres Olivia Newton John op Schiphol Olivia Newton John in de persk, Bestanddeelnr 930-0132.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton-John in 1978]]
Encouraged by expatriate Australian singer [[Helen Reddy]], Newton-John left the UK and moved to the US. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) Albums charts with her next album, ''[[Have You Never Been Mellow]].'' The album generated two singles – the [[John Farrar]]-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; No. 1 AC)&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22|title=All music guide to country: the …|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9780879304751|last1=Erlewine|first1=Michael|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Please Mr. Please]]" (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC).&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; However, her pop career cooled with the release of her next album, ''[[Clearly Love]].'' Her streak of five consecutive gold Top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] ended when the album's first single, "[[Something Better to Do]]", stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Although her albums still achieved gold status, she did not return to the Top 10 on the Hot 100 or [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts again until 1978.

Newton-John's singles continued to easily top the AC chart, where she ultimately amassed ten No. 1 singles including a record seven consecutively:
* "[[I Honestly Love You]]" (1974) – 3 weeks
* "[[Have You Never Been Mellow (song)|Have You Never Been Mellow]]" (1975) – 1 week
* "[[Please Mr. Please]]" (1975) – 3 weeks
* "[[Something Better to Do]]" (1975) – 3 weeks
* "[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]"/"[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]" (1976) – 2 weeks
* "[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]" (1976) – 1 week
* "[[Don't Stop Believin' (1976 song)|Don't Stop Believin']]" (1976) – 1 week

She provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on [[John Denver]]'s "[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]" single which was succeeded by her own single, "[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]"/"[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]", at No. 1 on the AC chart. ("[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]" returned to No. 1 after the two-week reign of "[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]".) Newton-John also continued to reach the Country Top 10 where she tallied seven Top 10 singles through 1976's "[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]" (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; No. 1 AC) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) Top 10 albums through 1976's ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin']]'' (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; She headlined her first US television special, ''A Special Olivia Newton-John,'' in November 1976.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

By mid-1977, Newton-John's AC and country success also began to wane. Her ''[[Making a Good Thing Better]]'' album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) failed to be certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach even the AC Top 10 or the Country chart. Later that year, ''[[Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits]]'' (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album.

In 1979, Newton-John received the Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) medal from Queen Elizabeth at [[Buckingham Palace]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/47724/supplement/34/data.pdf|format=PDF|title=SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE|date=30 December 1978|website=Thegazette.co.uk|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grease''===
[[File:John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton-John appearing with [[John Travolta]] in 1982]]
Newton-John's career soared after she starred in the [[Grease (film)|film adaptation]] of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in 1978. She was offered the lead role of Sandy after meeting producer [[Allan Carr]] at a dinner party at [[Helen Reddy]]'s home.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Burned by her ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'' experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she turned 29 during ''Grease''{{'}}s 1977 filming), Newton-John insisted on a [[screen test]] with the film's co-star, [[John Travolta]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The film accommodated Newton-John's Australian accent by recasting her character from the play's original American Sandy Dumbrowski to Sandy Olsson, an Australian who holidays and then moves with her family to the U.S. Newton-John previewed some of the film's soundtrack during her second American network television special, ''Olivia'', featuring guests [[ABBA]] and [[Andy Gibb]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' became the biggest box-office hit of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/boxoffice|title=IMDb Top Box Office|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture|The soundtrack album]] spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and yielded three Top 5 singles for Newton-John: the platinum "[[You're The One That I Want]]" (No. 1 Pop, No. 23 AC) with John Travolta, the gold "[[Hopelessly Devoted to You]]" (No. 3 Pop, No. 20 Country, No. 7 AC) and the gold "[[Summer Nights (John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John song)|Summer Nights]]" (No. 5 Pop, No. 21 AC) with John Travolta and the film's cast. The former two songs were written and composed by her long-time music producer, [[John Farrar]], specifically for the film. ("[[Summer Nights (John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John song)|Summer Nights]]" was from the original play written by [[Jim Jacobs]] and [[Warren Casey]].){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John became the second woman (after [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1977) to have two singles – "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and "Summer Nights" – in the ''Billboard'' Top 5 simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT499,M1|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9780823076772|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John's performance earned her a [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Film Actress. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated "Hopelessly Devoted to You" at the 1979 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/grease-cast-now-movie-turns-40-1084136/item/olivia-newton-john-sandy-olsson-1084128|title=Olivia Newton-John as Sandy Olsson - The Cast of 'Grease,' Then and Now|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John's transformation in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' from goody-goody "Sandy 1" to [[spandex|spandex-clad]] "Sandy 2" emboldened Newton-John to do the same with her music career. In November 1978, she released her next studio album, ''[[Totally Hot]]'', which became her first solo Top 10 (No. 7) album since ''Have You Never Been Mellow''. Dressed on the cover all in leather, the album's singles "[[A Little More Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|A Little More Love]]" (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), "[[Deeper Than the Night]]" (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop) all demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPA335|title=All music guide to country: the …|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9780879304751|last1=Erlewine|first1=Michael|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album de-emphasised country, it still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart. Newton-John released the B-side, "Dancin' 'Round and 'Round", of the "Totally Hot" single to Country radio peaking at No. 29&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKicir5sZr4C&amp;pg=PA461|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country …|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as No. 82 Pop and No. 25 AC), becoming her last charted solo Country airplay single to date.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John began 1980 by releasing "[[I Can't Help It (Andy Gibb song)|I Can't Help It]]" (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with [[Andy Gibb]] from his ''[[After Dark (Andy Gibb album)|After Dark]]'' album, and by starring in her third television special, ''Hollywood Nights.'' Later that year, she appeared in her first film since ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' starring in the musical ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Michael Beck]]. Although the film was a critical failure, [[Xanadu (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]] (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum boasting five Top 20 singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT537,M1|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John charted with "[[Magic (Olivia Newton-John song)|Magic]]" (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), "[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]" with [[Cliff Richard]] (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song with the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC). (ELO also charted with "I'm Alive" (No. 16 Pop, No. 48 AC) and "All Over the World" (No. 13 Pop, No. 46 AC).){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

"Magic" was Newton-John's biggest Pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1)&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film has since become a cult classic and the basis for a [[Xanadu (musical)|Broadway show]] that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Xanadu-Moves-Up-Broadway-Closing-Date-to-928/broadway_news/571564|title=Xanadu Moves Up Broadway Closing Date to 9/28|publisher=Broadway.com|date=23 September 2008|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A successful international tour of the show followed.)

In 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum ''[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John album)|Physical]]''. The [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|title track]], written by [[Steve Kipner]] and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081457,00.html|title=Olivia Gets Physical – Personal Success, Matt Lattanzi, Olivia Newton-John|website=People|first=Carl|last=Arrington|date=15 February 1982|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; matching the record at that time for most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rock era held by [[Debby Boone]]'s "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]". The single was certified platinum and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade. (In 2008, ''Billboard'' ranked the song No. 6 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-10.shtml|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chat 50th Anniversary – All-Time Top Songs|website=Billboard|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Physical" earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&amp;B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) chart. The ''Physical'' album spawned two more singles, "[[Make a Move on Me]]" (No. 5 Pop, No. 6 AC)&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT559,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Landslide" (No. 52 Pop).

The provocative lyrics of the "Physical" title track prompted two [[Utah]] radio stations to ban the single from their playlists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannon|first=Bob|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308706,00.html|title=Olivia Gets 'Physical'|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=19 November 1993|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2010, ''Billboard'' magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61B5H620100213|agency=Reuters|title=Olivia Newton-John's "Physical" sexiest song ever|date=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a fashion accessory outside the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top50-no1s-80s.shtml|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart 50th Anniversary – Songs of the Year 1980 to 1989|website=Billboard|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She pioneered the nascent music video industry by recording a [[Olivia Physical|video album]] for ''Physical'' featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, ''Let's Get Physical,''&lt;ref name="people1"/&gt; becoming a Top 10 Nielsen hit. The success of ''Physical'' led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double platinum ''[[Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more Top 40 singles: "[[Heart Attack (Olivia Newton-John song)|Heart Attack]]" (No. 3 Pop)&lt;ref name="google5"/&gt; and "Tied Up" (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her ''Olivia in Concert'' television special which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Newton-John re-teamed with Travolta in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful ''[[Two of a Kind (1983 film)|Two of a Kind]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086629,00.html|title=Animal Magnetism – Two of a Kind, John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John|website=People|author=Carl Arrington|date=19 October 1983|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; redeemed by its platinum soundtrack (No. 26 Pop) featuring "[[Twist of Fate (Olivia Newton-John song)|Twist of Fate]]" (No. 5 Pop),&lt;ref name="google5"/&gt; "Livin' in Desperate Times" (No. 31 Pop), and a new duet with Travolta, "Take a Chance" (No. 3 AC).

That same year Newton-John and Pat Carroll founded ''Koala Blue.''&lt;ref name=koala/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-13/features/8701240363_1_koala-blue-pat-farrar-olivia-newton-john|title=Olivia Newton-john: Hopelessly Devoted|website=Sun-Sentinel|date=13 April 1987|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store, originally for Australian imports, evolved into a chain of women's clothing boutiques.&lt;ref name=koala/&gt; The chain was initially successful, but it eventually declared bankruptcy and closed in 1992.&lt;ref name=koala&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Maier|first=Anne|date=19 August 1991|title=Losing Their Shirts with Olivia|url=http://people.com/archive/losing-their-shirts-with-olivia-vol-36-no-6|magazine=People|publisher=TIME Inc. |volume=36|issue=6|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; Newton-John and Farrar would later license the brand name for a line of Australian produced wines, confections, and bed/bath products.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Olivia Newton-John (1989).jpg|thumb|upright|Newton-John at the 1989 [[Academy Awards]]]]
Newton-John married her long-time boyfriend, actor [[Matt Lattanzi]], in December 1984; they divorced in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089644,00.html|title=To Have and to Hold|website=People|date=7 January 1985|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had met four years earlier while filming ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]''. Their daughter, [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi|Chloe Rose]], was born in January 1986.&lt;ref name="people2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20132405,00.html|title=Showing Her Mettle – Olivia Newton-John Cover|work=People|first=Jill|last=Smolowe|date=25 September 2000|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John, a [[Carlton Football Club]] fan, performed the [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian national anthem]] at the [[1986 VFL Grand Final]] between Carlton and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=Riley|title=Your AFL club's most famous supporters, from Barack Obama to Cam Newton|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/your-afl-clubs-most-famous-supporters-from-barack-obama-to-cam-newton/news-story/03eb54659866d587cf9c2cc4b9f3d8c5|website=[[Fox Sports]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John's music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold ''[[Soul Kiss]]'' (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album's only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). Due to her pregnancy, Newton-John limited her publicity for the album. The video album for ''Soul Kiss'' featured only five of the album's ten tracks (concept videos for the album's singles "Soul Kiss" and "Toughen Up" as well as performance videos of the tracks "Culture Shock", "Emotional Tangle" and "The Right Moment").{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Motherhood and advocacy===
After a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of Chloe, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album, ''The Rumour.'' The album was promoted by an HBO special, ''Olivia Down Under'', and its first single, the title track, was written and produced by [[Elton John]]. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) fizzled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CieMGEblw6kC&amp;pg=PT225&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22|title=His Song: The Musical Journey of…|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed "old" when compared with the teen queens [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] ruling the Pop charts at that time. (Ironically, this album was praised by critics as more mature with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS, the environment and single-parent households).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The second single, "Can't We Talk It Over in Bed", did not chart, but was released in 1989 by [[Grayson Hugh]], the song's arranger, as "Talk It Over" becoming a Top 20 Pop hit. A year later, Newton-John recorded her self-described "self-indulgent" album, ''[[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]].'' Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the album cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; This album, the last one produced by John Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career struggling to No. 124 Pop.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, ''Back to Basics – The Essential Collection 1971–1992'', and planned her first tour since her ''Physical'' trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album including the tour. (Newton-John received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113234,00.html|title=Toughing It Out|website=People|date=3 August 1992|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126583,00.html|title=Victors Valiant – Cancer, Coping and Overcoming Illness|website=People|author=Schindehette, Susan|first2=Karen|last2=Schneider|first3=Anne-Marie|last3=O'Neill|date=26 October 1998|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since become an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. She is a product spokesperson for the Liv-Kit, a breast self-examination product. She is also partial owner of the Gaia Retreat and Spa in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiaretreat.com.au/flex/about_us/44/1|title=About US|publisher=Gaiaretreat.com.au|accessdate=10 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223024814/http://www.gaiaretreat.com.au/flex/about_us/44/1|archivedate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John's advocacy for health issues was presaged by her prior involvement with many humanitarian causes. Newton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of Japan to protest the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9CQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=newton-john+tour+cancel+japan+dolphins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FU4YoCWiGX&amp;sig=2gR8KQBiHMsyKq04dNuPl2Hj4QE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RMF2TKHjEIKClAe-2JDsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Billboard, 1978], books.google.com, 1 July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her the matter was being addressed.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

She was a performer on the 1979 ''[[Music for UNICEF Concert]]'' for the UN' [[International Year of the Child]] televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. She was appointed a [[Goodwill Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio_text.html Biodata],  Olivianewton-john.com, 22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children's Health Environmental Coalition) following the death of four-year-old Colette Chuda, a family friend, from cancer. (Chuda was featured along with Newton-John and daughter Chloe on the cover of Newton-John's ''[[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]]'' album.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John's cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released ''Gaia: One Woman's Journey'' which chronicled her ordeal. This was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all of the songs encouraging her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. In 2005, she released ''[[Stronger Than Before]],'' sold exclusively in the U.S. by Hallmark. This was her second exclusive album for [[Hallmark Cards]] after her successful first Christmas album '''Tis the Season'' with [[Vince Gill]] five years earlier. Proceeds from the album's sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song "Phenomenal Woman" based on the poem by [[Maya Angelou]] that featured guest vocals from [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Amy Holland]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Mindy Smith]] – all survivors of or affected by cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/newton-john%20records%20angelou%20poem%20for%20breast%20cancer|title=Newton-John Records Angelou Poem For Breast Cancer|publisher=Contactmusic.com|date=21 August 2005|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Newton-John released a healing CD, ''[[Grace and Gratitude]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1538540,00.html|title=Olivia Newton-John Moves On – Personal Tragedy, Olivia Newton-John|work=People|first=Sandra|last=Marquez|date=28 September 2006|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was sold exclusively by [[Walgreens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQ8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|title=Billboard|date=28 October 2006|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also to benefit various charities including [[Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization]]. The CD was the "heart" of their ''Body – Heart – Spirit'' Wellness Collection which also featured a re-branded Liv-Kit and breast-health dietary supplements. She re-recorded some tracks from ''[[Grace and Gratitude]]'' in 2010 and re-released the album as ''[[Grace and Gratitude|Grace and Gratitude Renewed]]'' on the Green Hill music label. The ''Renewed'' CD includes a new track, "Help Me to Heal", not featured on the original album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhillmusic.com/item/GHD5759_Grace+And+Gratitude+Renewed|title=Green Hill Music-Grace And Gratitude Renewed|publisher=Greenhillmusic.com|accessdate=13 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806173427/http://www.greenhillmusic.com/item/GHD5759_Grace+And+Gratitude+Renewed|archive-date=6 August 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Renewed'' CD yielded Newton-John's first appearances on the ''Billboard'' Christian Albums (No. 36), Christian &amp; Gospel Albums (No. 54) and New Age Albums (No. 2) charts.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 2008, she raised funds to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She led a three-week, 228&amp;nbsp;km. walk along the [[Great Wall of China]] during April joined by various celebrities and [[cancer survivor]]s throughout her trek. The walk symbolised the steps cancer patients must take on their road to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwalktobeijing.com|title=Archived copy|accessdate=7 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080217/http://www.greatwalktobeijing.com/|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's breast cancer docu-drama, ''[[1 a Minute]]'', released in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/indian-star-rallies-celebrity-support-for-cancer-movie_1118440|title=Mcg – Indian Star Rallies Celebrity Support For Cancer Movie News|publisher=Contactmusic.com|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was made by actress [[Namrata Singh Gujral]] and featured other celebrities who had survived breast cancer or who were affected by the disease.

===Later career===
Newton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to [[Nashville]] to record ''[[Back with a Heart]]'' (No. 59 Pop).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The album returned her to the Top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of "[[I Honestly Love You]]" produced by [[David Foster]] and featuring [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]] on background vocals&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; that charted Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18). Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, "Love Is a Gift," won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, ''[[As the World Turns]]''.

Newton-John's subsequent secular albums were released primarily in Australia. Newton-John, [[John Farnham]] and [[Anthony Warlow]] toured Australia as ''[[The Main Event (concert tour)|The Main Event]].'' The live album won an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Award]] for Highest Selling Australian CD and was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album.

(Green Hill Records re-released this album with different artwork in 2010.) In 2007, she re-teamed with her ''Grace and Gratitude'' producer, [[Amy Sky]], for ''Christmas Wish'' (No. 187 Pop) which was sold exclusively by Target in its first year of release.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Newton-John acted occasionally since ''[[Two of a Kind (1983 film)|Two of a Kind]]''. She appeared in a supporting role in the 1996 AIDS drama, ''It's My Party''.

McDermott disappeared following a 2005 fishing trip off the Californian coast.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqtinbjO0oEC&amp;pg=PA172|title=1001 Australians You Should Know|accessdate=13 August 2010|isbn=9781864033618|last1=Creswell|first1=Toby|last2=Trenoweth|first2=Samantha|date=2006-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories abounded regarding his disappearance ranging from his death by accident or foul play to McDermott staging his disappearance to avoid child support payments to his ex-wife, actress Yvette Nipar. Newton-John, who was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa at the time of his disappearance, was never a suspect in McDermott's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newton-John 'frantic'|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 August 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/newtonjohn-frantic/2005/08/22/1124562799885.html?oneclick=true|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John returned to the tabloid headlines again in 2007 when it was revealed that her daughter, [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi|Chloe]], was recovering from anorexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Feel Grateful for Where I Am Now|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20196244,00.html|website=People|first=Jessica|last=Herndon|author2=Michelle Tan|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John released another concert DVD, ''Olivia Newton-John and the Sydney Symphony: Live at the [[Sydney Opera House]],'' and a companion CD, ''Olivia's Live Hits'', in January 2008. An edited version of the DVD premiered on PBS station, WLIW ([[Garden City, New York]]) in October 2007 and subsequently aired nationally during the network's fund-raising pledge drives. This was Newton-John's third live album after the 1981 Japanese release, ''Love Performance,'' and her 2000 Australian release, ''One Woman's Live Journey''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2008, Newton-John took part in the [[BBC Wales]] program ''[[Coming Home (UK TV series)|Coming Home]]'' about her Welsh family history. In June 2008, she secretly wed John Easterling, founder and president of natural remedy firm Amazon Herb Company. The couple had first met 15 years earlier, but they only became romantically involved in 2007. (Like Newton-John, this was Easterling's second marriage.) The couple married alone in a private Incan spiritual ceremony in [[Cuzco]], Peru on 21 June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2008045935_eye11.html|title=seattletimes.nwsource, Newton-John marries|publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed nine days later by a legal ceremony on the [[Jupiter Island, Florida|Jupiter Island]] beachfront in Florida. There were no guests at either service since the couple preferred to marry simply and privately. Only Newton-John's daughter, Chloe, was aware of the nuptials. The couple did not announce their marriage until a 4 July barbecue at Newton-John's [[Malibu, California]] home, where guests were surprised with the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20210466,00.html|title=Olivia Newton-John Marries John Easterling – Twice!|work=People|author=Michelle Tan|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was confirmed thereafter by ''HELLO!''

In 2009, Newton-John appeared on [[Andrea Bocelli]]'s holiday album ''[[My Christmas]]'' and [[PBS]] TV holiday special ''[[My Christmas Special]]'', with [[David Foster]], [[Kenny Loggins]] and [[Richard Marx]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In January 2011, Newton-John began filming the comedy ''A Few Best Men'' in Australia with director [[Stephan Elliott]], in the role of mother of the bride. The groom is played by [[Xavier Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olivia Newton-John's back, with a few good men|location=Melbourne, Australia|work=Herald Sun|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd]]|date=14 January 2011|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/olivia-newton-johns-back-with-a-few-good-men/story-e6frf9h6-1225987475798?from=public_rss|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John still actively tours.&lt;ref name="Tour dates"&gt;[http://olivianewton-john.com/tour.html Tour dates] at her website&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian tour of [[Perth]], Melbourne and Sydney, as well a tour of the United States, treated fans to songs that she had never performed in concert before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivianewton-john.com/tour.html|title=Olivia's Tour dates|publisher=Olivianewton-john.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Newton-John teamed with John Travolta to make the charity album ''[[This Christmas (John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John album)|This Christmas]]'', in support of The Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre and the Jett Travolta Foundation. Artists featured on the album include: [[Barbra Streisand]], [[James Taylor]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Kenny G]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Cliff Richard]] and the [[Count Basie Orchestra]]. In March 2013 she toured the UK performing in Bournemouth, London, Brighton, Birmingham and Manchester.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A 2013 residency at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]] was postponed due to the May 2013 death of her elder sister, Rona (aged 70), from a brain tumor. Newton-John resumed with 45 shows beginning in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2013/apr/11/heart-attack-olivia-newton-john-heads-flamingo-spr|title=Heart attack!

The CD contains a cover of "Broken Wings" as well as the popular-with-fans original "Best of My Love", which had leaked on the internet many years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/olivia-newton-john-is-still-the-one-we-want-20140406|title=Olivia Newton-John Is Still The One We Want|publisher=Queerty.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Newton-John was a guest judge on an episode of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. That same year, she scored her first number-one single on ''Billboard''{{'s}} [[Dance Club Songs]] chart with "[[You Have To Believe]]" with daughter Chloe and producer [[Dave Aude]]. The song was a re-imaging of her 1980 single "Magic", which she notes was to celebrate both the 35th anniversary of ''Xanadu'' and as a dedication to her daughter, stating "I met Chloe's dad on the set of ''Xanadu'', so, without that film, Chloe wouldn't be here. She was the real 'magic' that came out of that film!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6762259/olivia-newton-john-first-number-1-dance-club-songs-chart "Olivia Newton-John Logs First No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart"] from ''Billboard'' (12 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The song became the first mother-daughter single to reach No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Play chart.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Osama bin Laden''', named after the [[Osama bin Laden|infamous elusive terrorist]], was a [[Elephant#Attacks|rogue]] bull [[Asian elephant|elephant]] responsible for at least 27 deaths and destruction of property in the jungled [[Sonitpur district]] of the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Assam]]. After a two-year rampage from 2004 to 2006, an elephant was eventually shot; but some were doubtful that the right animal was killed.

==Attacks==
Osama bin Laden was a [[Elephant#Attacks|rogue]] bull [[Asian elephant|elephant]] active in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Assam]]. He was named after the terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=bbckiller/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Authorities in India hunting killer elephant named after Osama bin Laden |url=http://www.waff.com/story/5820652/authorities-in-india-hunting-killer-elephant-named-after-osama-bin-laden |publisher=[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF]] |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the attacks, the elephant was thought to be between 45 and 50 years old.&lt;ref name=nbcserial/&gt; He measured between {{convert|9|and|10|ft|m|order=flip}} tall.&lt;ref name=nbcserial/&gt;&lt;ref name=ishe/&gt; He was given the status of a "rogue" elephant in the summer of 2006 after his death toll reached double figures.&lt;ref name=bbckiller/&gt;

In northeastern India, human and elephant conflicts have become problematic.  Expansion of human activities and [[Habitat destruction|destruction]] of elephants' natural habitat has resulted in elephants foraging for food where humans are situated.{{efn-ua|In India, they are a [[protected species|protected]] and [[endangered species]].  The Indian subcontinent has almost half of the world's population of 60,000 Asian elephants.  In 2002, a census in Assam counted approximately 5,000.  However, conservationists suggest the pachyderm population has fallen rapidly because of loss of habitat, human encroachment into forests, and concomitant human-elephant conflicts.&lt;ref name="reuters2"/&gt;}}  From 2001 to 2006 in Assam, more than 250 people were killed by elephants; distraught villagers killed 268 elephants, mainly by poisoning.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;

==Death==
Indian officials issued a "shoot to kill" directive in mid December 2006,{{efn-ua|"'I am looking for my target with a .400 bore rifle assisted by five forestry officials, but Laden is known to do the vanishing trick every time a hunter is put on its trail,' said Dipen Phukan, one of Assam's three licensed elephant hunters."&lt;ref name="WAFF"/&gt;}}  with a deadline of the end of the month. On 18 December, it was announced that the elephant had been tracked to a [[History of tea in India|tea plantation]] near Behali, a town {{convert|90|mi|km|order=flip}} north-west of [[Guwahati]].&lt;ref name=ishe/&gt; Local villagers used drums and fire to trap the elephant in the corner of the plantation.&lt;ref name=bbckiller/&gt; He was killed by hunter Dipen Phukan; however, once the elephant realised what was about to happen he charged the hunter, who killed him as he rapidly approached. Phukan said, "It was charging towards me and I kept firing. Another few yards and it would have run over me."&lt;ref name=bbckiller/&gt; It had been identified as Osama bin Laden as it had no [[tusk]]s.&lt;ref name=ishe/&gt; 

However officials were concerned that it was not the right elephant, with the death taking place a considerable distance &amp;ndash; {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} &amp;ndash; from where he had been seen previously.{{efn-ua|Elephant expert Kushal Sharma claimed: "The elephant was found 80km away from the usual place where he moves around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Osama bin Laden shot dead |publisher=metrowebukmetro |date=17 December 2006 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2006/12/17/osama-bin-laden-shot-dead-470377/ |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Forestry officials were accused of killing an innocent elephant, while conservation groups were concerned about the possibility of revenge attacks by other elephants of the same herd.&lt;ref name=ishe/&gt;{{efn-ua|Activists said the elephant was quickly buried by forest officials "without verifying the foot prints, dimensions and other identifying marks that were the same as 'Osama's.  'They have killed an innocent elephant. It is an eye wash and shame on the part of the forest officials in Assam,'" according to wildlife conservationist Soumyadeep Dutta.&lt;ref name="reuters2"&gt;{{cite news |title="Osama Bin Laden" shot dead in India |url=http://news.asiantown.net/r/1958/-osama-bin-laden--shot-dead-in-india |date=17 December 2006 |newspaper=today.reuters.comft |location=Guwahati, India |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Another "Osama" elephant incident==
In 2008, another elephant also named "Osama bin Laden"{{efn-ua|"Post 9/11, villagers across Assam have started naming any elephant they suspect of bringing down their homes or feasting on crops as Laden, viewing such [[Pachydermata|pachyderms]] as terrorists," according to Kushal Konwar Sharma, an elephant expert and teacher at the College of Veterinary Science in Gauhati.&lt;ref name="WAFF"/&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;– that caused more than 11 fatalities and dozens of injuries&amp;nbsp;– was shot dead in [[Jharkhand]].{{efn-ua|"The wild male elephant had been terrorizing villagers in two states, destroying their crops and homes."&lt;ref name="Calgary"&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian police track down and kill 'Osama bin Laden' {{mdash}} the elephant  |newspaper=[[The Calgary Herald]] |date=June 1, 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=260adced-0e25-4425-ae7e-5bcfcb4d56a1 |publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn-ua|"Yes, Osama has finally been killed and it took us 20 bullets to silence him," Ranjan told Reuters.&lt;ref name="Calgary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |title=Killer elephant "Osama" shot dead in Jharkhand

'''Sir Panambur Raghavendra Rau''', [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|IAAS]] (July 1889 – January 1942) was born in [[Panambur]] in 1889. He studied at Coondapur High School where he won the M.R.R.Y Medal for standing first in the Presidency Matriculation Examination in 1904. In 1907, he graduated from Madras Christian College, in which he stood first in all the examinations at the University level, winning the prestigious Gunn Medal. He joined the [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service]] in 1912. He was successively the Assistant Controller of Currency, Assistant Secretary and Under Secretary, Finance Department, Government of India, Assistant Secretary, Lee Commission, and Deputy Director of Finance, Railway Board. As budget officer and secretary, Public Accounts Committee, he was also the treasurer of Delhi University. He served as Financial Commissioner for [[Indian Railway Accounts Service|the Accounts Service on the Indian Railways]] between 1932-1937, and was the first Indian to hold this post.

[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Richard D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Richard D'Oyly Carte''' (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical [[impresario]], composer and hotelier during the latter half of the [[Victorian era]]. Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.

Carte started his career working for his father, [[Richard Carte]], in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English [[comic opera]] could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, together with his wife [[Helen Carte]], he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen [[Savoy opera]]s. He founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and built the state-of-the-art [[Savoy Theatre]] to host the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.

Carte also built the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and acquired other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the [[Palace Theatre, London]], which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English [[grand opera]], although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], and granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.

==Early life==
[[File:Richard-carte.jpg|thumb|left|Carte's father, Richard]]
Carte was born in [[Greek Street]] in the [[West End of London]] on 3 May 1844.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was the eldest of six children. His father, [[Richard Carte]] (originally Cart; 1808–1891), was a [[flautist]], and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814–1885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Blanch (1846–1935), Viola (1848–1925), Rose (b. 1854), Henry (1856–1926) and Eliza (1860–1941). Carte was of Welsh and [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which "was a forename (not part of a double surname)".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name comes from his mother's grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose &amp; Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt; After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;"New Music", ''The Era'', 21 March 1869. Rudall, Carte and Co was still trading in the West End in 1954: see ''The Times'', 16 December 1954, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was brought up in [[Dartmouth Park]] Road.&lt;ref name=Ainger75&gt;Ainger, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Rob. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/blue-plaque-at-london-home-of-a-victorian-simon-cowell-2158693.html "Blue plaque at London home of a Victorian Simon Cowell"]. ''The Independent'', 13 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age.&lt;ref name=Joseph8&gt;Joseph, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took their children to the theatre.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; He was educated at [[University College School]], which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Daily News'', 1 February 1861&lt;/ref&gt; and then attended [[University College London|University College]], London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=074-acc0727&amp;cid=-1&amp;Gsm=2008-06-18#-1 Rivington and Son (Solicitors)], London Metropolitan Archives, National Archives, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress [[Kate Terry]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm Biography of Carte] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903152000/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm |date=3 September 2006 }} at the ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'' website, 27 August 2001, accessed 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted in amateur theatricals.&lt;ref name=Ainger75/&gt;

==Career==
Between 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: ''Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret'', at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]] (1868);&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Musicians", ''The Daily News'', 12 April 1895&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marie'', with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's [[Opera Comique]] in 1871;&lt;ref name=Ainger92&gt;Ainger, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Original Correspondence", ''The Era'', 10 September 1871&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Happy Hampstead'', with librettist [[Frank Desprez]], which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1877.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; On tour in 1871, Carte conducted ''[[Cox and Box]]'' by composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and dramatist [[F. C. Burnand]], in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called ''Rose of Auvergne'' and ''Breaking the Spell'', in which Carte's client [[Selina Dolaro]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1. The composer's brother, [[Fred Sullivan]], managed the tour and played Cox, while [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] played Bouncer, in ''Cox and Box''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 20 November 1870, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and, by late 1874, from a nearby address in Craig's Court,&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 27 December 1874, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture management agency.&lt;ref name=Joseph8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainger92/&gt; His two hundred clients eventually included [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Adelina Patti]], [[Giovanni Matteo Mario|Mario]], [[Clara Schumann]], [[Antoinette Sterling]], [[Edward Lloyd (singer)|Edward Lloyd]], [[Thomas German Reed|Mr. and Mrs. German Reed]], [[George Grossmith]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesketh Pearson]] said of Carte: "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, ''quoted'' in Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Carte leased the [[Opera Comique]], a theatre off [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he presented [[Charles Lecocq]]'s new [[opéra bouffe]] ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;"Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 7 June 1874, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed this with ''The Broken Branch'', an English adaptation of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branche cassée''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte later said it was "the scheme of my life" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera,&lt;ref name="Joseph, p. 11"&gt;Joseph, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], "I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art."&lt;ref name=Joseph27&gt;Joseph, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with [[H. B. Farnie]] to write a new operetta on the theme of ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'', which played during the Christmas season at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Literary Gossip", ''[[The Manchester Times]]'', 29 August 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]].

In 1875, Carte became the business manager of the [[Royalty Theatre]], under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Madame [[Selina Dolaro]]. There he programmed Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act [[comic opera]] that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, ''[[Cox and Box]]'', had been revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref name=Ainger108&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt; Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew.

Carte managed the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', which stopped at the Theatre Royal in [[Dublin]], Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name [[Helen Lenoir]]. She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]]&lt;ref name="Ainger, p. 111"/&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref name=Joseph134&gt;Joseph, pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years after the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}} accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the initial production of ''Trial by Jury'', however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s ''La Périchole'', and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'', Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' and [[Léon Vasseur]]'s ''La Timbale d'argent''), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury''). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included [[W.H. Denny]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6; ''The Freeman's Journal'' (Dublin), 28 July 1876, p. 1; and ''The Era'', 23 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachs, Kevin.

Encouraged by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte made attempts in 1875–76 to raise money for either a revival of ''Thespis'' or a new piece.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 113 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he finally found four backers and formed the "Comedy Opera Company" to produce the future works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British author/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte's secretary to his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars, and Carte's agency provided many of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right: there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorcerer'' was followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878. Business for the new opera was slow at first.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several [[promenade concert]]s at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt; Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the ''Pinafore'' set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique",] ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

Pinafore'' in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref name=joseph18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Supreme Court of Judicature, Aug. 1 – Court of Appeal – Gilbert v.

===Early opera successes; property interests===
[[File:Pinafore1899.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'']]
''H.M.S. Pinafore'' was so successful that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest&gt;The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the operetta ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', which held that position until the record-breaking run of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' in 1886.

To try to counter this [[copyright infringement|copyright piracy]] and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an "authentic" production of ''Pinafore'' there, beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's assistant, Helen Lenoir, who became his wife in 1888, made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; Beginning with ''Pinafore'', Carte licensed the [[J.

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt; They hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

Carte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=savoyard&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 172–72&lt;/ref&gt; With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]], which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by [[Peter of Savoy, Earl of Richmond|Peter, Count of Savoy]]. It later passed to [[John of Gaunt]] but was destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P.

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire [[front of house]] was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Strand, including the Savoy Theatre, and a depiction of Richard D'Oyly Carte, are featured in [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The West End Horror]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets, the orderly "queue" system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery (an American idea), tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for [[cloakroom]] or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy, and all of their operas came to be known as [[Savoy opera]]s.

===Peak years for the opera company===
During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with ''Patience'', two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]), one with ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 81 and 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;

After ''Patience'', Carte produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, "Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt;

During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref name=Joseph27/&gt; Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref name=jacobssullivan&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.

Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
Carte produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and "picturesque" Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–96&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting ''Patience'' as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest/&gt; It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bradley|first=Ian|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hrgsp/old/productions/mik97/mik97hist.htm |title=Note on the popularity of '&amp;#39;The Mikado'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John.]] [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm "G&amp;S101: G&amp;S Story: Part III"], Musicals101.com, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Ruddigore'' closed after nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction.&lt;ref name=Wilson13/&gt; When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a [[grand opera]] that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants);&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Lytton]], "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html ''Secrets of a Savoyard''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} (1922), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." Carte rejoined, "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority."&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, stated:

===End of the partnership and last years===
[[File:Ivanhoe-programme.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' programme cover]]
On 22 April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |title=Approximately £37,818.60 in 2006 prices |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064621/http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt; Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=Vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Carte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, ''Ivanhoe'' was presented every night with alternating casts. When ''Ivanhoe'' finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' at first alternating in repertory with ''Ivanhoe'', and then ''La Basoche'' played alone, closing in January 1892.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. [[Henry J. Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], who had been [[répétiteur]] for the production, recalled in his autobiography, "If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of ''Ivanhoe'' I was already preparing ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' with [[Eugène Oudin]] in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the ''Dutchman'' was shelved."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Henry.

[[File:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|220px|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
Because of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Vowed/&gt; When ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]] for his next piece, ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall]]'', which held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to their operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wolfson| first=John| year=1976| title=Final curtain: The last Gilbert and Sullivan Operas|page=7 |publisher=Chappell in association with A. Deutsch| location=London | ISBN=0-903443-12-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''. While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, Carte produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]]. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|right|thumb|[[George Grossmith]] comforts Carte after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
''Utopia'' was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; Carte then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1896 by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; At the Savoy, Carte produced ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]]&lt;ref name=savoy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221064512/http://www.the-savoy-group.com/Simpsons/AboutUs/History/history.asp The Savoy Group, history pages, Simpson's-in-the-Strand], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claridge's]] Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claridges.co.uk/page.aspx?id=1846 The Savoy Group, history pages, Claridge's], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Brigid, Allen.

He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.

He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 in connection with the [[Schomburgk Line|Venezuelan boundary arbitration]] in Paris. There he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and later died of that disease at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was born on 27 December 1872 and was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was called to the bar in 1897. After he contracted tuberculosis, he worked for the rest of his life on issues relating to the disease and died on 18 January 1907. See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte's London house was at the [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]], not far from the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], to decorate the house.

Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as [[Henry Irving]], and for dramatists, including Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 128 ''quoting'' Gilbert, describing mid-19th century productions as "crude, unintelligent, and sometimes frankly improper"&lt;/ref&gt; George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, "Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera."&lt;ref&gt;''The World'', 2 August 1893, ''quoted'' in Laurence, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In Carte's obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the ''mise en scène'' of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard".&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan#Musical theatre|development of modern musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, Earl F. "W. S. Gilbert and American Musical Theatre", pp. 120–33, ''American Popular Music: Readings from the Popular Press'' by Timothy E. Scheurer, Popular Press, 1989 {{ISBN|0-87972-466-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. Bush.

Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'': "Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the ''nouveaux riches'' of the British empire.... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms."&lt;ref&gt;Ashburner, F.[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 "Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006, accessed 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]], overseeing his management of a revival of ''Iolanthe'' and several new comic operas.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert became chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] by 1903, which Helen continued to own.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London.&lt;ref name=profit/&gt; The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bradley | first = Ian| authorlink=Ian Bradley|title = Oh Joy!

'''Robert William Service''' (January 16, 1874 – September 11, 1958) was a British-Canadian poet and writer who has often been called "the Bard of the [[Yukon]]".&lt;ref name=star&gt;"[http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/print/25045/ 1905 R. W. Service: Bard of the Yukon]", ''Whitehorse Star'' online archive, September 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kilwinning&gt;"[http://www.threetowners.com/Kilwinning/bard_of_the_yukon.htm The Bard of the Yukon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027124031/http://www.threetowners.com/Kilwinning/bard_of_the_yukon.htm |date=2008-10-27 }}," Kilwinning, ThreeTowners.com, Web, Apr. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  He is best known for his poems "[[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]]" and "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]", from his first book, ''[[Songs of a Sourdough]]'' (1907; also published as ''The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses''). His vivid descriptions of the Yukon and its people made it seem that he was a veteran of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], instead of the late-arriving bank clerk he actually was. Although his work remains popular, Service's poems were initially received as being crudely comical works.&lt;ref name=answers&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-service Robert W.

==Life==

===Early life===

Service was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]], England,&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt; the third of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from [[Kilwinning]], Scotland, who had been transferred to England.&lt;ref name="electric" /&gt;

When he was five, Service was sent to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, the town's [[postmaster]].&lt;ref name=kilwinning/&gt; There he is said to have composed his first verse, a [[Grace (prayer)|grace]], on his sixth birthday:&lt;ref name=electric/&gt;
[[File:RobertWService-plaque-Preston.jpg|thumb|Commemorative Plaque in Preston, England]]
At nine, Service re-joined his parents who had moved to [[Glasgow]]. He attended Glasgow's [[Hillhead High School]].&lt;ref name=extended1&gt;"[http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4&amp;page=1 Extended Biography]," RobertWService.com, July 21, 2003, 1. Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving school,&lt;ref name=evans&gt;David Evans, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/robert-william-service/ Service, Robert William]," ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1981–1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Service joined the [[Commercial Bank of Scotland]] which would later become the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=electric&gt;"[http://www.electricscotland.com/poetry/robert_service.htm Poetry – Robert W. Service]," ElectricScotland.com, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing at this time and reportedly already "selling his verses".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} He was also reading poetry: [[Robert Browning|Browning]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], and [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]].&lt;ref name=extended1/&gt;

When he was 21, Service travelled to [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], with his [[Buffalo Bill]] outfit and dreams of becoming a [[cowboy]]. He drifted around western North America, "wandering from [[California]] to British Columbia,"&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; taking and quitting a series of jobs: "Starving in [[Mexico]], residing in a California [[Brothel|bordello]], farming on Vancouver Island and pursuing unrequited love in [[Vancouver]]."&lt;ref name=enid&gt;"''[http://www.yukonbooks.com/shop/customer/product.php?productid=13891 Robert Service: Under the Spell of the Yukon]''" by Enid Mallory, YukonBooks.com, Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes required him to leech off his parents' Scottish neighbours and friends who had previously emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;My Grandma, "Nanny Stiles"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Service was a store clerk in [[Cowichan Bay, British Columbia]]. He mentioned to a customer (Charles H. Gibbons, editor of the Victoria ''Daily [[Times Colonist|Colonist]]'') that he wrote verses, with the result that six poems by "R.S." on the [[Boer Wars]] had appeared in the ''Colonist'' by July 1900&lt;ref name=mitham&gt;Peter J. Mitham, Introduction to "Mossback Minstrelsy: The [http://www.uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/cpjrn/vol39/mitham.htm British Columbia Verse of Robert W. Service]," ''Canadian Poetry'' No. 39, UWO, Web, Apr. 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; – including "[[s:The March of the Dead|The March of the Dead]]" that would later appear in his first book. (Service's brother, Alick, was a prisoner of the Boers at the time. He had been captured on November 15, 1899, alongside [[Winston Churchill]].)&lt;ref name=mitham/&gt;

The ''Colonist'' also published Service's "[[s:Music in the Bush|Music in the Bush]]" on September 18, 1901, and "[[s:The Little Old Log Cabin|The Little Old Log Cabin]]" on March 16, 1902.&lt;ref name=mitham/&gt;

In her 2006 biography, ''Under the Spell of the Yukon'', Enid Mallory revealed that Service had fallen in love during this period. He was working as a "farm labourer and store clerk when he first met Constance MacLean at a dance in [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan B.C.]], where she was visiting her uncle." MacLean lived in Vancouver, on the mainland, so he courted her by mail. Though he was smitten, "MacLean was looking for a man of education and means to support her" so was not that interested. To please her, he took courses at [[McGill University]]'s [[Victoria College, British Columbia|Victoria College]], but failed.&lt;ref name=dawson&gt;Michael Gates, "[http://cityofdawson.com/history-pages/michael-gates/robert-service-secret-love-life Robert Service's Secret Love Life]," Dawson City History, CityofDawson.com, Web, Apr. 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, down on his luck, Service was hired by a [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]] branch in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia, using his Commercial Bank letter of reference.&lt;ref name=holloway&gt;Sam Holloway, "[http://www.yukoner.com/service.htm Robert Service and Destiny]," ''The Yukoner Magazine''. Web, Accessed 2008.11.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The bank "watched him, gave him a raise, and sent him to [[Kamloops]] in the middle of British Columbia. In Victoria he lived over the bank with a hired piano, and dressed for dinner. In Kamloops, horse country, he played polo. In the fall of 1904, the bank sent him to their [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] branch in Yukon. With the expense money he bought himself a [[raccoon coat]]."&lt;ref name=extended2&gt;"[http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4&amp;page=1 Extended &amp;#91;Biography&amp;#93;]," RobertWService.com, July 21, 2003, 2. Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, Service continued writing and saving his verses: "more than a third of the poems in his first volume had been written before he moved north in 1904."&lt;ref name=smulders&gt;Sharon Smulders, "'[http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/SCL/article/viewArticle/15270/16348 A Man in a World of Men]': The Rough, the Tough, and the Tender in Robert W. Service’s ''Songs of a Sourdough''," ''Studies in Canadian Literature'', 30:1 (2005), UNB.ca, Web, Apr. 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yukon period===
[[Image:Cabin of Robert Service.JPG|thumb|Cabin of Robert Service in Dawson City, Yukon]]
[[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] was a frontier town, less than ten years old. Located on the [[Yukon River]] at the [[White Horse Rapids]], it had begun in 1897 as a [[Campsite|campground]] for [[Prospecting|prospectors]] on their way to [[Dawson City]] to join the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. The railroad that Service rode in on, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]], had reached Whitehorse only in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://explorenorth.com/yukon/whitehorse-history.html The History of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory]," ExploretheYukon.com, Web, Apr. 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Settling in, "Service dreamed and listened to the stories of the great gold rush." He also "took part in the extremely active Whitehorse social life. As was popular at the time he recited at concerts – things like '[[Casey at the Bat]]' and '[[Gunga Din]]', but they were getting stale."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

One day (Service later wrote), while pondering what to recite at an upcoming church concert he met E.J. "Stroller" White, editor of the ''[[Whitehorse Star]]''. White suggested: "Why don’t you write a poem for it? Give us something about our own bit of earth. We sure would appreciate it. There’s a rich paystreak waiting for someone to work. Why don’t you go in and stake it?"&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Returning from a walk one Saturday night, Service heard the sounds of revelry from a saloon, and the phrase "A bunch of the boys were whooping it up" popped into his head. Inspired, he ran to the bank to write it down (almost being shot as a burglar), and by the next morning "The Shooting of Dan McGrew" was complete.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

"A month or so later he heard a gold rush yarn from a Dawson mining man about a fellow who cremated his pal." He spent the night walking in the woods composing "The Cremation of Sam McGee", and wrote it down from memory the next day.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Other verses quickly followed. "In the early spring he stood above the heights of Miles Canyon ... the line 'I have gazed on naked grandeur where there’s nothing else to gaze on' came into his mind and again he hammered out a complete poem, "[[s:The Call of the Wild (Service)|The Call of the Wild]]".&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Conversations with locals led Service to write about things he had not seen (some of which had not actually happened) as well.&lt;ref name=kilwinning/&gt; He did not set foot in Dawson City until 1908, arriving in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] ten years after the Gold Rush when his renown as a writer was already established.

After having collected enough poems for a book, Service "sent the poems to his father, who had emigrated to [[Toronto]], and asked him to find a printing house so they could make it into a booklet. He enclosed a cheque to cover the costs and intended to give these booklets away to his friends in Whitehorse" for Christmas. His father took the manuscript to William Briggs in Toronto, whose employees loved the book. "The foreman and printers recited the ballads while they worked. A salesman read the proofs out loud as they came off the typesetting machines."&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt; An "enterprising salesman sold 1700 copies in advance orders from galley proofs."&lt;ref name=extended2/&gt; The publisher "sent Robert's cheque back to him and offered a ten percent royalty contract for the book."&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt;

Service's book, ''Songs of a Sourdough'', was "an immediate success."&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; It went through seven printings even before its official release date.&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt; Ultimately, Briggs "sold fifteen impressions in 1907. That same year there was an edition in New York, Philadelphia, and London. The London publisher, [[T. Fisher Unwin]], struck a twenty-third printing in 1910, and thirteen more by 1917."&lt;ref name=extended2/&gt; "Service eventually earned in excess of $100,000 for ''Songs of a Sourdough'' alone"&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Smulders, "'A Man in a World of Men': The Rough, the Tough, and the Tender in Robert W. Service’s ''Songs of a Sourdough''," ''Studies in Canadian Literature'', 30:1 (2005). Web, Apr. 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (equal to about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1910|r=-5}}}} today after inflation).

(In the United States, the book would be given the more [[Jack London]]-ish title, ''The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses'').

"When copies of the book reached Whitehorse, Robert's own minister took him aside to let him know how wicked were his stories. Service hung his head in shame.... But, that summer, tourists from the south arrived in Whitehorse looking for the famous poet; and he autographed many of his books."&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt;

"In 1908, after working for the bank for three years in Whitehorse, he was sent outside on mandatory paid leave for three months, a standard practice for bank employees serving in the Yukon." According to Enid Mallory, he went to Vancouver and looked up Constance MacLean. Now that he was a successful author, she agreed to become engaged to him.&lt;ref name=dawson/&gt;

Following his leave, in 1908 the bank transferred Service to Dawson, where he met veterans of the Gold Rush, now ten years in the past: "they loved to reminisce, and Robert listened carefully and remembered." He used their tales to write a second book of verse, ''Ballads of a Cheechako'', in 1908. "It too was an overwhelming success."&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt;

In 1909, when the bank wanted Service to return to Whitehorse as manager, he decided to resign. "After quitting his job, he rented a small two-room cabin on Eighth Avenue in Dawson City from Mrs. Edna Clarke and began his career as a full-time author."&lt;ref name=dee/&gt; He immediately "went to work on his novel.... He went for walks that lasted all night, slept till mid-afternoon, and sometimes didn't come out of the cabin for days. In five months the novel, called ''The Trail of '98'', was complete and he took it to a publisher in New York." Service's first novel also "immediately became a best-seller."&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt;

Newly wealthy, Service was able to travel to [[Paris]], the [[French Riviera]], [[Hollywood]], and beyond. He returned to Dawson City in 1912 to write his third book of poetry, ''Rhymes of a Rolling Stone'' (1912).&lt;ref name="holloway" /&gt; During that time he became a [[Freemasonry|freemason]], being initiated into Yukon Lodge No. 45 in Dawson.&lt;ref name=freemason&gt;"[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/service_r_w/robert_service.html Robert W. Service]," Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon, Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear what happened between Service and Constance MacLean as no known letters between them exist after Service's departure for Dawson City. In 1912 she "married Leroy Grant, a surveyor and railroad engineer based in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]]."&lt;ref name=dawson/&gt;

===Later life===
Service left Dawson City for good in 1912.&lt;ref name=holloway/&gt; From 1912 to 1913 he was a [[correspondent]] for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' during the [[Balkan Wars]].&lt;ref name=freemason /&gt;

In 1913, Service moved to Paris, remaining there for the next 15 years. He settled in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]], posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at [[Lancieux]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]], in the [[Brittany]] region of France.&lt;ref name=extended3&gt;"[http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4&amp;page=2 Extended &amp;#91;Biography&amp;#93;]," RobertWService.com, July 21, 2003, 3. Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service survived him by 31 years, dying aged 102 in 1989.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

Service was 41 when [[World War I]] broke out; he attempted to enlist, but was turned down "due to [[varicose veins]]."&lt;ref name="electric"/&gt; He briefly covered the war for the ''Toronto Star'' (from December 11, 1915, through January 29, 1916), but "was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in [[Dunkirk]]." He then "worked as a [[Combat medic|stretcher bearer]] and [[Emergency medical technician|ambulance driver]] with the Ambulance Corps of the [[American Red Cross]], until his health broke." Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, ''Rhymes of a Red Cross Man'', in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's "brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916."&lt;ref name=extended3/&gt; Robert Service received three medals for his war service: [[1914–15 Star]], [[British War Medal]] and the Victory Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwservice.blogspot.fr/2013/10/robert-w-service-1914-1918-great-war.html|title=Robert W. Service 1914–1918 Great War Medals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the war, Service "settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a [[monocle]]. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city".&lt;ref name=extended3/&gt; During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, ''Ballads of a Bohemian'' (1921): "The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years."&lt;ref name=extended3/&gt;

In the 1920s, Service began writing thriller novels. ''The Poisoned Paradise, A Romance of Monte Carlo'' (New York, 1922) and ''The Roughneck. A Tale of Tahiti'' (New York, 1923) were both later made into silent movies.&lt;ref name=extended3/&gt; During the winter season, Service used to live in [[Nice]] with his family, where he met British writers, including [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]], A.K. Bruce, [[Somerset Maugham]], [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], Franck Scully, [[James Joyce]], Franck Harris, and Frieda Laurence, who all spent their winters in the French Riviera, and he wrote that he had been lucky to have had lunch with [[Colette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwservice.blogspot.com/p/biographie.html|title=Biographie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robert Service's memorial, Kilwinning.JPG|thumb|Robert Service Memorial, Kilwinning, Ayrshire.]]
In 1930, Service returned to Kilwinning, to erect a memorial to his family in the town cemetery.&lt;ref name=electric/&gt; He also visited the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the 1930s and later wrote a satirical "Ballad of [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin's Tomb]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Frgm5QodnFoC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=Lenin's%20Tomb%20%22Robert%20W%20Service%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H9MOHv4bdC&amp;sig=f7vECtBi3QxZV5PuUE6IaXYrJMg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DjDuTPrVJZChOumrxIoK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lenin's%20Tomb%20%22Robert%20W%20Service%22&amp;f=false|title=Comrades!: A History of World Communism|first=Robert|last=Service|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason his poetry was never translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] in the USSR, and he was never mentioned in Soviet encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/S/SERVIS_Robert_Uil'yam/_Servis_R.U..html|title=Сервис Роберт Уильям|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service's second trip to the Soviet Union "was interrupted by news of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Service fled across Poland, [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Stockholm]]. He wintered in [[Nice]] with his family, then fled France for Canada." Not long after, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] invaded France, and "arrived at his home in Lancieux ... looking specifically for the poet who had mocked [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in newspaper verse."&lt;ref name=extended4&gt;"[http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4&amp;page=3 Extended &amp;#91;Biography&amp;#93;]," RobertWService.com, July 21, 2003, 4. Web, Apr. 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Service lived in [[California]], "and Hollywood had him join with other celebrities in helping the morale of troops – visiting [[United States Army|US Army]] camps to recite his poems. He was also asked to play himself in the movie ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), working alongside [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[John Wayne]] and [[Randolph Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwservice.blogspot.fr/2013/03/the-spoilers-starring-robert-w-service.html|title="The Spoilers" starring Robert W. Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He was thrilled to play a scene with Marlene Dietrich."&lt;ref name=extended4/&gt; After the war, Service and his wife returned to his home in Brittany, to find it destroyed. They rebuilt, and he lived there until his death in 1958, though he wintered in [[Monte Carlo]] on the [[French Riviera]].&lt;ref name=extended4/&gt; Service's wife and daughter, Iris, travelled to the Yukon in 1946 "and visited Whitehorse and Dawson City, which by then was becoming a ghost town. Service could not bring himself to go back. He preferred to remember the town as it had been."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Service wrote prolifically during his last years, publishing six books of verse from 1949 to 1955. A book he had written in 1956 was published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;See Selected Works – Poetry&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1958, not long before Service died, Canadian broadcaster [[Pierre Berton]] recorded many hours of autobiographical television interview for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], in Service's Monte Carlo flat. At this occasion, Service recited The Shooting of Dan McGrew and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwservice.blogspot.fr/2013/05/the-cremation-of-sam-mcgee-recited-by.html|title=The Cremation of Sam McGee Recited by Robert W.

==Writing==
Robert Service wrote the most commercially successful poetry of the century.{{according to whom|date=May 2012}} Yet his most popular works "were considered [[doggerel]] by the literary set."&lt;ref name=answers/&gt; During his lifetime, he was nicknamed "the Canadian [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]."&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; – yet that may have been a double-edged compliment. As [[T. S. Eliot]] has said, "we have to defend Kipling against the charge of excessive lucidity," "the charge of being a '[[journalist]]' appealing only to the commonest collective emotion," and "the charge of writing [[jingle]]s."&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Eliot, Introduction to ''[[A Choice of Kipling's Verse]]'' (London: Faber, 1941), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; All those charges, and more, could be levelled against Service's best known and best loved works. {{according to whom|date=May 2018}}

Certainly Service's verse was derivative of Kipling's. In "The Cremation of Sam McGee", for instance, he uses the form of Kipling's "[[The Ballad of East and West]]".

In his [[E. J. Pratt]] lecture "Silence In the Sea," critic [[Northrop Frye]] argued that Service's verse was not "serious poetry," but something else he called "popular poetry": "the idioms of popular and serious poetry remain inexorably distinct." Popular poems, he thought, "preserve a surface of explicit statement" – either being "proverbial, like Kipling's '[[If—|If]]' or [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s '[[A Psalm of Life|Song of Life]]' or [[Robert Burns|Burns]]'s '[[Is There for Honest Poverty|For A' That]]'," or dealing in "conventionally poetic themes, like the [[pastoral]] themes of [[James Whitcomb Riley]], or the adventurous themes of Robert Service."&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "[http://northropfrye-thebushgarden.blogspot.com/2009/02/silence-in-sea.html Silence in the Sea]," ''The Bush Garden'' (Toronto, Anansi, 1971, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service himself did not call his work poetry. "Verse, not poetry, is what I was after ... something the man in the street would take notice of and the sweet old lady would paste in her album; something the schoolboy would spout and the fellow in the pub would quote. Yet I never wrote to please anyone but myself; it just happened. I belonged to the simple folks whom I liked to please."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

In his autobiography, Service described his method of writing at his Dawson City cabin. "I used to write on the coarse rolls of paper used by paper-hangers, pinning them on the wall and printing my verses in big charcoal letters. Then I would pace back and forth before them, repeating them, trying to make them perfect. I wanted to make them appeal to the eye as well as to the ear. I tried to avoid any literal quality."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

One remarkable thing about both of Service's best-known ballads is how easily he wrote them. When writing about composing "The Shooting of Dan McGrew", 'easy' was exactly the word he used: "For it came so easy to me in my excited state that I was amazed at my facility. It was as if someone was whispering in my ear."&lt;ref name=star/&gt; And this was just after someone had tried to shoot him. He continued: "As I wrote stanza after stanza, the story seemed to evolve itself. It was a marvelous experience. Before I crawled into my bed at five in the morning, my ballad was in the bag."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Similarly, when he wrote "The Cremation of Sam McGee", the verses just flowed: "I took the woodland trail, my mind seething with excitement and a strange ecstasy.... As I started in: There are strange things done in the midnight sun, verse after verse developed with scarce a check ... and when I rolled happily into bed, my ballad was cinched. Next day, with scarcely any effort of memory I put it on paper."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

In 1926, [[Archibald MacMechan]], Professor of English at Canada's [[Dalhousie University]], pronounced on Service's Yukon books in his ''Headwaters of Canadian Literature'':

:The sordid, the gross, the bestial, may sometimes be redeemed by the touch of genius; but that Promethean touch is not in Mr. Service. In manner he is frankly imitative of Kipling's barrack-room balladry; and imitation is an admission of inferiority. 'Sourdough' is Yukon slang for the provident old-timer ... It is a convenient term for this wilfully violent kind of verse without the power to redeem the squalid themes it treats. ''The Ballads of a Cheechako'' is a second installment of sourdoughs, while his novel ''The Trail of '98'' is simply sourdough prose.&lt;ref name=macmechan&gt;Archibald MacMechan, ''Headwaters of Canadian Literature (Toronto: New Canadian Library, 1974), 219–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacMechan did give grudging respect to Service's World War I poetry, conceding that his style went well with that subject, and that "his ''Rhymes of a Red Cross Man'' are an advance on his previous volumes. He has come into touch with the grimmest of realities; and while his radical faults have not been cured, his rude lines drive home the truth that he has seen."&lt;ref name=macmechan/&gt;

Reviewing Service's ''Rhymes of a Rebel'' in 1952, Frye remarked that the book "interests me chiefly because ... I have noticed so much verse in exactly the same [[idiom]], and I wonder how far Mr. Service's books may have influenced it. There was a time, fifty years ago," he added," when Robert W.Service represented, with some accuracy, the general level of poetic experience in Canada, as far as the popular reader was concerned.... there has been a prodigious, and, I should think, a permanent, change in public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "[http://northropfrye-thebushgarden.blogspot.com/2009/02/from-letters-in-canada-1952.html Letters from Canada – 1952]," ''The Bush Garden'' (Toronto, Anansi, 1971, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service has also been noted for his use of [[ethnonym]]s that would normally be considered offensive "slurs", but with no insult apparently intended. Words used in Service's poetry include ''[[List of terms used for Germans#Jerry|jerries]]'' (Germans), ''dago'' (Italian), ''[[pickaninny]]'' (in reference to a Mozambican infant), ''[[Chinook Jargon|cheechako]]'' (newcomer to the Yukon and Alaska gold fields, usually from the U.S.), ''[[nigger]]'' (black person), ''[[squaw]]'' (Aboriginal woman), and ''[[Jap]]'' (Japanese).

==Recognition==
[[File:Bust of Robert Service Whitehorse Yukon.jpg|thumb|A bust of Service in Whitehorse]]
Robert W. Service has been honoured with schools named for him including [[Robert Service High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], Robert Service Senior Public School (Middle/ Jr. High) in Toronto, [[Ontario]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdsb.on.ca/scripts/Schoolasp.asp?schno=4724 Robert Service Sr PS]&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Service School in Dawson City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.yk.ca/psb/directory.html Yukon Public School Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also honoured on a [[List of people on stamps of Canada|Canadian postage stamp]] in 1976. The [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon#Robert Service Way|Robert Service Way]], a main road in Whitehorse, is named after him.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

Additionally, the Bard &amp; Banker public house in Victoria is dedicated to him, the building having at one time been a Canadian Bank of Commerce branch where Service was employed while residing in the city.

Service's first novel, ''The Trail of '98'', was made into a movie by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], directed by [[Clarence Brown]].&lt;ref name=extended3/&gt; "''[[The Trail of '98|Trail of '98]]'' starring [[Dolores del Río]], [[Ralph Forbes]] and [[Karl Dane]] in 1929 ... was the first talking picture dealing with the Klondike gold rush and was acclaimed at the time by critics for depicting the Klondike as it really was."&lt;ref name=dee&gt;Dee Newman, "[http://the8thdimension.blogspot.com/2011/03/robert-services-little-cabin.html Robert Service's Little Cabin]," The Eighth Dimension (blog), Mar. 3, 2011.

In 1968 Canadian-born country singer [[Hank Snow]] recorded recitations of eight of Service's longer poems for an album entitled  Tales of the Yukon. The album was released by RCA Victor. Snow and other musicians including [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chubby Wise]] provided background music.&lt;ref&gt;RCA Victor LSP-4032&lt;/ref&gt;

Folksinger [[Country Joe McDonald]] set some of Service's World War I poetry (plus "The March of the Dead" from his first book), to music for his 1971 studio album, ''[[War War War]]''.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

The [[Canadian whiskey]] [[Yukon Jack (liqueur)|Yukon Jack]] incorporated various excerpts of his writings in their ads in the 1970s, one of which was the first four lines of his poem, ''"The Men Who Don't Fit In"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintagepaperads.com/assets/images/EH0654.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Lancieux]], where he used to come every summer, organized several recognitions to the memory of Robert W. Service. One of the streets of [[Lancieux]] has been called Robert Service Street. On July 13, 1990, a commemorative tablet was unveiled at the Lancieux Office du Tourisme by the daughter of the poet: Iris Service. An evening of celebration was organized afterwards with a dinner attended by many guests from Scotland and the Yukon. A few years later, on May 18, 2002 the school of Lancieux in Brittany took the name of "École Robert W. Service". [[Charlotte Service-Longépé]] the great granddaughter and the granddaughter of the poet attended the dedication ceremony and made a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=947&amp;page=1/|title=Hommage – Books and Poetry &gt; The Anne Longepe Collection - Archives - RobertWService.Com|first=Richard|last=Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=946&amp;keywords=charlotte Evening with the Bard]; accessed 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the towns of [[Lancieux]] and [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] are sister cities, due to Robert W.

[[Margaret Rutherford]] recited most of "[[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]]" in the 1964 [[Ealing Studios]] film ''[[Murder Most Foul]]''.

===Dawson City cabin===
Robert Service lived from 1909 to 1912 in a small two-room cabin on 8th Avenue which he rented from Edna Clarke in Dawson City.&lt;ref name=dee/&gt; His prosperity allowed him the luxury of a telephone.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}  Service eventually decided he could not return to Dawson, as it would not be as he remembered it. He wrote in his autobiography:

:"Only yesterday an air-line offered to fly me up there in two days, and I refused. It would have saddened me to see dust and rust where once hummed a rousing town; hundreds where were thousands; tumbledown cabins, mouldering warehouses."&lt;ref name=dee/&gt;

After Service left for Europe, the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]] (I.O.D.E.) took care of the cabin until 1971, preserving it. In 1971 it was taken over by [[Parks Canada]], which maintains it, including its sod roof, as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Parks Canada, Robert Service Cabin, Classified Federal Heritage Building Dawson, Yukon Territory |url= http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_fhbro_eng.aspx?id=3198 |publisher= Parks Canada|date= 2012-03-15|accessdate= 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish-born actor Tom Byrne created ''The Robert Service Show'' which was presented in the front yard of the cabin, starting in 1976. This was very popular for summer visitors and set the standard for Robert Service recitations. A resurgence in sales of Service's works followed the institution of these performances.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}} Byrne discontinued the show at the cabin in 1995, moving it to a Front Street storefront. Since 2004 the show has been held at the Westmark Hotel in Dawson City during the summer months.

At the Service Cabin, local Dawson entertainers dressed in period costumes and employed by Parks Canada offer biographical information and recite Service's poetry for visitors.

'''Sandra Marie Palmer''' (born August 4, 1969) is a Jamaican entrepreneur who founded [[information technology company]] SSP APTEC in 1997, eventually opening a branch in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Diana|title=Dr Sandra Palmer-Peart A vision for excellence|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/allwoman/125984_Dr-Sandra-Palmer-Peart-A-vision-for-excellence|accessdate=28 May 2015|agency=All Woman|publisher=Jamaica Observer|date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she founded Soulmates, a boutique match-making social club for the affluent and Peak Performance International, a consulting firm.

She currently lectures New Ventures and Entrepreneurship at the Mona School of Business and Management at the [[University of the West Indies, Mona]] and Managerial Economics and New Venture Creation at [[Northern Caribbean University]]. In 2010, the [[World Bank]] named her as one of the top female entrepreneurs in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="WB Source"&gt;{{cite web|author1=World Bank|title=Women’s Economic Opportunities in the Formal Private Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean: A Focus on Entrepreneurship|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35278574|website=World Bank|accessdate=28 May 2015|pages=121-9|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2016, Dr. Palmer was appointed CEO and Senior Partner at Above or Beyond (formerly The Job Bank). In this new role as CEO and Senior Partner, Dr. Palmer will leverage her experience in business and academia to lead the organisation during this transitional period and beyond. The new organisation plans to build on its past legacy in the area of human capital development by strengthening its internal capacity and expanding its reach in the Caribbean.

==Early life and education==
Sandra was born in the small, rural community of Topsham located in [[Manchester, Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="TVJ"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Smile Jamaica|title=Off The Shelf - On Seraph Wings|url=http://www.televisionjamaica.com/Programmes/SmileJamaica.aspx/Videos/40983|website=Television Jamaica|publisher=Television Jamaica|accessdate=28 May 2015|format=Video|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has two younger brothers. She attended Coley’s Mountain Primary School from 1974 – 1980. Upon failing her first attempt at the Common Entrance Examination, she was sent to Nazareth All Age School in 1980 where she was successful in her second attempt at the Common Entrance Examination moving on to Bishop Gibson High School for Girls in Mandeville in 1981. She graduated from Bishop Gipson in 1986.

After spending time briefly in the banking sector, Sandra began pursuing tertiary education in 1989 at the [[University of the West Indies, Mona]]. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] Honours degree majoring in [[History]], [[Political Science]] and [[Economics]].&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt;

In 1997, she earned her [[Masters of Business Administration]] (with Distinction) from [[Nova Southeastern University]] at the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship, where she specialized in General Management. In 2004, she completed her [[Doctorate]] in [[Business Administration]] with honours from [[Nova Southeastern University]]’s H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship where she specialized in [[Information Technology Management]].&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; Her doctoral dissertation entitled "A Study of the Inclination of Jamaican Employees to Opt for Telework: A Comparison with Findings for United Kingdom Employees" was published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer-Peart|first1=Sandra|title=A study on the inclination of Jamaican employees to opt for telework: A comparison with findings for United Kingdom employees|date=2004|publisher=Nova Southeastern University|location=Nova Southeastern University|pages=362|url=https://www.editlib.org/dissertations/topics/labor_economics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and entrepreneurial pursuits==
Palmer worked at the [[National Commercial Bank]] for four years until she resigned in 1990 to focus completely on her university education. After completing her first degree she began working at the information technology firm WTG-APTEC. In 1996, she left  and joined [[GraceKennedy]]’s InfoGrace team as corporate account executive.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In October of 1997, Palmer started SSP APTEC Limited in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], an [[information technology company]], which provided audio-visual equipment.&lt;ref name="WB Source" /&gt; The firm also advised the top management of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and institutions on issues of strategy, organizational operations and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Business Partners Information|url=http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/jm/|website=IBM|accessdate=28 May 2015|format=Webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, she expanded to Florida under the name SSP APTEC Inc. and remained in that market for 10 years. In March 2012, after almost two decades, she suspended both companies and went into academia full-time.

Palmer was acknowledged in the [[World Bank]] report, "Women’s Economic Opportunities in the Formal Private Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean: A focus on Entrepreneurship in 2010 for her entrepreneurial pursuits and was cited as one of Jamaica’s most successful female entrepreneurs".&lt;ref name="WB Source" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of women in IT prompts calls for education reform|url=http://www.afr.com/technology/enterprise-it/lack-of-women-in-it-prompts-calls-for-education-reform-20150222-137gil|website=AFR Weekend|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she founded two companies: '''Peak Performance International''', which offers [[executive coaching]], business and life coaching, motivational and keynote speaking as well as management consulting and '''Soulmates''' in 2014, an exclusive match making site, which finds love for the affluent and successful individual who is seeking a meaningful long-term relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Nadine|title=Finding Soulmates|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/allwoman/Finding-Soulmates_15949031|accessdate=8 July 2015|agency=All Woman|publisher=The Jamaica Observer|date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a core philosophy, Sandra believes that "only the companies who rethink their strategies and put plans in place to respond to the new business environment will remain viable or even survive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roache|first1=Alicia|title=SSP Aptec to move from Red Hills Road HQ into smaller office|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/SSP-Aptec-to-move-from-Red-Hills-Road-HQ-into-smaller-office_8277032|accessdate=28 May 2015|publisher=Jamaica Observer|date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Smile Jamaica|title=A Nw Way To Find Love|url=http://www.televisionjamaica.com/Programmes/SmileJamaica.aspx/Videos/32793|website=Television Jamaica|publisher=Television Jamaica|accessdate=6 July 2015|format=Video|date=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Dr. Sandra Palmer became Chief Executive Officer and Senior Partner at Above or Beyond (formerly The JobBank), the corporate brand of Leahcim T. Semaj and Company Limited. Her role is to leverage her experience in business and academia to lead the organisation during this transitional period and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboveorbeyondjm.com/|title=Above or Beyond|website=Above or Beyond|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a serial entrepreneur, Dr. Palmer has created and led successful businesses over the last two decades in Information Technology, Trucking, Coatings and Luxury Services. She has created a distinct personal brand that makes a real difference in the lives of individuals and organisations she touches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aboveorbeyondjm.com/content/partners|title=Partners|last=Palmer|first=Sandra|date=2016-12-23|work=Above or Beyond|access-date=2017-12-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lecturing ===

Palmer began her career in education at [[Jamaica College]] as a teacher of Caribbean History. She left after one semester but would return to education in 2007 when she became a lecturer at the [[University of the West Indies, Mona]] School of Business and Management and also at [[Northern Caribbean University]], College of Business and Hospitality Management.&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt;
At the Mona School of Business and Management at the [[University of the West Indies]] in Jamaica, Palmer redesigned the New Ventures and Entrepreneurship course, in the MBA, MBM, and EMBA programs at the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Ainsworth|title=MSBM students top business plan competition|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/career/MSBM-students-top-business-plan-competition_14589863#ixzz2XvcjAHEk|accessdate=28 May 2015|publisher=Jamaica Observer|date=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Northern Caribbean University, she teaches Business Writing, Entrepreneurship and New Venture Initiatives, and Managerial Economics in the MBA program. She also lectured Entrepreneurship at the [[University of Technology]] Jamaica from 2007 – 2014. From 2012 – 2014, she served as Dean of Undergraduate Studies at the University College of the Caribbean and also as the Director of [[Information Services]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4068">'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was a name used by Roman men during the early Roman Empire. They were descendants of Orfitus who was adopted by Servius Cornelius Scipio, an otherwise unknown member of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician branch]] of the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii Scipiones]]. 

There were at least six members of this family who used this name, all direct male descendants of the earliest known member of this branch, the consul of 51. Except for the first two generations, little is known about any of them.

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 51) ==
{{Main|Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 51)}}
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was ordinary consul in AD 51 as the colleague of the emperor [[Claudius]]. He was one of the victims of the ''[[delator]]'' [[Marcus Aquilius Regulus]] during the reign of [[Nero]].

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 1st century) ==
{{Main|Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 1st century)}}
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was a suffect consul in some year prior to 87; his colleague has not been identified. He was the son of the consul of AD 51. He was also a victim of imperial suspicion, and was first banished to an island by the emperor [[Domitian]] then later executed.

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 110) ==
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was ordinary consul in AD 110 as the colleague of [[Marcus Peducaeus Priscinus]]. He was the son of the previous Orfitus. The only other fact known of his life is that he was [[Urban prefect]] of Rome during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Géza Alföldy]], ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen'' (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (proconsul of Africa) ==
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' is known through inscriptions to have been [[proconsul]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in 163/164.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|8|24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it can be inferred that this Orfitus was suffect consul around 146. It is assumed he was the son of the consul of 110.

It was assumed at one point that this Orfitus was also the ordinary consul of 149, but more recent research has identified that Orfitus as Lucius Sergius Salvidienus Scipio Orfitus, a member of the ''[[Sergia (gens)|gens Sergia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Eck]], "Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit Géza Alföldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand" in ''Studia epigraphica in memoriam Géza Alföldy'', hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kovács (Bonn, 2013), p.75; James H. Oliver, [http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/9671 "The Solonian Constitution and a Consul of A.D. 149"], ''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'', 13 (1972), pp. 103-107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (consul 178) ==
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was ordinary consul in AD 178 with [[Decimus Velius Rufus]] as his colleague. He is known only through consular dating; it is assumed he was the son of the previous Orfitus.&lt;ref&gt;Alföldy, ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand'', pp. 191, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

== Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus (Salii Palatini) ==
'''Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus''' was a member of the ''[[Salii|Salii Palatinii]]'' an ancient Roman priesthood for the years 189 and 190.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|6|1980}}, {{CIL|6|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed he was the son of the previous Orfitus. There is no record of this Orfitus acceding to the consulate; while this may indicate that he died before the age of 31 or 32, the earliest point a Patrician could be a consul, attestations of suffect consul become much more scarce after 180 and evidence of his consulate simply has yet to be recovered.

'''''Shatner's Raw Nerve''''' was an American television program on [[The Biography Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/shatner/ | title=Official Biography Channel Page | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213233412/http://www.biography.com/shatner/ | archivedate=2008-12-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, [[William Shatner]] sits down with various celebrities and conducts offbeat interviews with them. Some celebrities who have appeared are [[Tim Allen]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Walter Koenig]], [[LeVar Burton]], [[Scott Bakula]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Judith Sheindlin]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Jenna Jameson]], and [[Leonard Nimoy]].  It is produced by [[Scott Sternberg Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ssprods.com/ | title=Official Scott Sternberg Production Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions from ''Star Trek'' cast members ==

During the interview with Walter Koenig, Shatner could tell that Koenig was withholding something about how he viewed Shatner. After Shatner persuaded him to continue, Koenig revealed that there had been a feeling on the set of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' that Shatner could get any of them fired, though he never saw Shatner actually follow through on that perceived feeling. Koenig also informed Shatner that while his and other actors' roles may not have been as prominent at Shatner's, [[Leonard Nimoy]]'s or [[DeForest Kelley]]'s, there were still contributions they could have made to each scene if Shatner had allowed them to. As Koenig put it, they wanted to say to him, "Cut the shit, Shatner", but did not.

Similar to his experience when conducting interviews for ''[[Star Trek Memories]]'', Shatner was surprised by this and remorseful, saying that he would have behaved differently if he had known. He then offered to find a role for Koenig on his then current series (''[[$h*! My Dad Says|$#*! My Dad Says]]'') since he had "a little more authority" than he did on ''Star Trek'', but the series was cancelled before he could fulfill that offer.

Stephen Jin-Woo Kim |url=https://fas.org/sgp/jud/kim/plea.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2016|date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors had charged that Kim's actions indirectly alerted [[North Korea]] to what U.S. intelligence officials "knew or did not know about its military capabilities and preparedness."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ex-state-dept-adviser-stephen-j-kim-sentenced-to-13-months-in-leak-case/2014/04/02/f877be54-b9dd-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born on August 15, 1967, in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. His family moved to New York in 1976. He attended [[Fordham Preparatory School]], a Jesuit school. For college he went to the [[Georgetown University]] [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] (1989). He tried out [[Wall Street]] but found the work did not suit him. Following that, he attended [[Harvard]] for a [[master's degree]] in [[national security]] (1992), and then [[Yale University|Yale]] for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Diplomatic history|diplomatic]] and [[military history]] (1999). He authored a book based on his dissertation.&lt;ref  name="creativejunkfood_llc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=onesheet/&gt;&lt;ref name="creativejunkfood_llc2"/&gt; He has also extensively studied philosophy and literature.&lt;ref  name="creativejunkfood_llc"/&gt;

== Employment ==
After graduation, he went to work at the [[Center for Naval Analyses]], where he analyzed US operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. After the [[September 11 attacks]], he moved to the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] where he focused on [[North Korea]]. He briefed the [[Defense Policy Board]] on his work as well as [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Stephen Hadley]], and [[Dick Cheney]]. He also worked at the [[Office of Net Assessment]] under the [[Secretary of Defense]], analyzing Chinese nuclear issues.&lt;ref name="creativejunkfood_llc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="creativejunkfood_llc2"/&gt;

In 2008, he went to work as a contractor at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] at the [[Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance]]. There, he was Senior Advisor for Intelligence to the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation]]. He studied North Korea's nuclear program, especially its claims of dismantling its equipment. He also participated in nuclear [[military simulation|war games]] at the [[Naval War College]].&lt;ref  name="creativejunkfood_llc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="creativejunkfood_llc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt;

=== Incident with Rosen ===
In June 2009,&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; Kim allegedly had a conversation&lt;ref name="creativejunkfood_llc3"/&gt; with Rosen about North Korea planning a [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear bomb test]].&lt;ref name="msncom"/&gt;

== Indictment ==
In August 2010, Kim was indicted by a [[grand jury]] on two charges:&lt;ref name="josh_gerstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=crypt1/&gt;

*Unauthorized disclosure of national defense information in violation of {{uscsub|18|793|d}} (the [[Espionage Act]])
*[[Making false statements]] in violation of {{uscsub|18|1001|a|2}}

The government alleges that Kim's conversation with Rosen contained information related to the "national defense"&lt;ref name=crypt1/&gt;&lt;ref name="mark_hosenball"/&gt; (793(d) does not use the word "classified"). The alleged false statements to the FBI occurred in September 2009,&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; regarding whether or not Kim had any contact with Rosen (whom he allegedly met around March 2009).&lt;ref name=crypt3/&gt;

Kim initially pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; Rosen and Fox were not named in the indictment (which listed them as a "reporter" and a "news organization"), but news reports identified the parties.&lt;ref name="msncom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mark_hosenball"/&gt;

Kim was defended by prominent attorneys [[Abbe Lowell]] of [[Chadbourne &amp; Parke]] and Paul M. Thompson and James M. Commons of [[McDermott Will &amp; Emery]].&lt;ref name="josh_gerstein"/&gt; One of Lowell's arguments was that [[Bob Woodward]]'s book ''[[Obama's Wars]]'' contains far more sensitive information than the information Kim is accused of leaking, which created a [[double standard]] in leak prosecution.&lt;ref name="msncom"/&gt; Lowell also said that the DOJ is "stretch[ing] the espionage laws" and having a [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on government officials communicating with the press. He also said that Kim would never do anything "for which he had any reason to believe would harm &lt;nowiki&gt;[US interests]&lt;/nowiki&gt;."&lt;ref name="mark_hosenball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpostcom2010"/&gt;

== Guilty plea ==

On February 7, 2014, Kim entered a guilty plea to a single felony count of disclosing classified national defense information to an unauthorized person, Rosen. His lawyer, Lowell, admitted that his client "made a decision to cross a line" and that he "should have known better." Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Harvey added that Kim "was motivated not by an altruistic purpose but by his own ego and desire for professional advancement." Before sentencing, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said Kim "did lose his moral compass."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Kim was sentenced to a 13-month prison term.&lt;ref name=GuiltyPlea/&gt;

'''Stéphanie Balique-Gibaud ''' is a public relations and an event marketing specialist.

Working for [[UBS]] France in Paris, she has in particular played a decisive role in blowing the whistle on the practices of tax evasion and laundering of tax fraud in organized group of [[UBS]] AG (Switzerland) with the complicity of [[UBS]] France.

== Biography ==
After studying languages in [[Lille]], [[France]], she worked for [[TransManche Link]] (TML,  the Channel Tunnel), the embassy of the United States of America, the [[RC Lens]] football club and [[UBS]] wealth management in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edwige Coupez |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/femmes-d-exception/2013-2014/evasion-fiscale-le-courage-de-stephanie-gibaud-la-femme-qui-en-savait-trop-02-16-2014-11 |title=Evasion fiscale : le courage de Stéphanie Gibaud, "La femme qui en savait trop" &amp;#124; France info |language=fr|publisher=Franceinfo.fr |date=2014-02-16 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She joined [[UBS]] in 1999 where her mission was to develop partnerships with luxury brands and organise client events in France. She has played a key role in blowing the whistle and making public the fact that [[UBS]] AG has encouraged tax evasion and money laundering practices with the complicity of [[UBS]] France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22810780 |title=UBS under formal investigation in France over tax evasion - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been acting as a [[whistleblower]] since 2008 working with French authorities and namely with the French customs.
She has also been listened by the Belgian authorities ([[UBS]] Belgium being under investigation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/france-ubs-ag-idUSL5N0W74GE20150305 |title=French court rules UBS bullied ex-employee |publisher=Reuters |date=2015-03-05 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published a book where she explained the practices of UBS&lt;ref name="cherche-midi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherche-midi.com/theme/La_femme_qui_en_savait_vraiment_trop-Stephanie_GIBAUD_-9782749135083.html|title=La femme qui en savait vraiment trop - Stéphanie GIBAUD - Documents - Editions le Cherche Midi|work=cherche-midi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translation into English available in Sept. 2015).
[[File:Anticor2015.jpg|upright=1.9|thumb|&lt;span style="font-size:80%"&gt;Anticor ethics prize 2015 &lt;/span&gt;]]
She received the Anticor ethics prize in January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2gkps4_soiree-prix-ethique-contre-casseroles-2015_school?start=18|title=Soirée prix "Ethique" contre Casseroles 2015|author=ANTICOR-TV|work=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being invited to testify by the "Tax Ruling" commission of the European Parliament in Brussels.

In June 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/multimedia/video/9530-ex-directiva-del-ubs-denuncio-existencia-de-red-de-intermediarios-que-ayudaban-a-argentinos-a-fugar-divisas-y-a-evadir-al-fisco-en-caso-identico-al-hsbc/|title=Ex directiva del UBS denunció existencia de red de intermediarios que ayudaban a argentinos a fugar divisas y a evadir al fisco, en caso idéntico al HSBC - Videos  - Télam - Agencia Nacional de Noticias|work=telam.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv23u8EDgTQ#t=209|title=Visión 7 - HSBC: La investigación de lavado en París|date=17 June 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was officially invited to an audition at the embassy of Argentina in Paris by Ricardo Echegaray,  minister of finance of Argentina and the members of the argentinian "commission bicamerale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/191797/hsbc-commission-to-meet-with-gibaud|title=HSBC commission to meet with Gibaud|work=buenosairesherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are working on the mechanism of tax evasion.

Stephanie Gibaud has publicly asked Argentina to bring to the G20 the question of the protection of citizens who put themselves at risk for standing up in the public interest.&lt;ref name="pagina12.com.ar"&gt;{{cite web|last= Febbro |first=Eduardo |url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-275049-2015-06-17.html|title=Página/12 {{!}} Economía {{!}} "Tiré del hilo y vi cosas que no debí ver"|date=17 June 2015 |work=pagina12.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Septembre 10, 2015, Stéphanie Gibaud  was nominated for the [[Sakharov Prize]] 2015, together with two other whistleblowers, [[Edward Snowden]] and Antoine Deltour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News {{!}} Sakharov Prize: the nominations for 2015 presented|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20150910STO92624/sakharov-prize-the-nominations-for-2015-presented|publisher=European Parliament|language=en|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The UBS case ==

During 8 years with [[UBS]] France, her job was to develop partnerships with luxury houses and to organize events for wealth clients of the bank on the French territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1028267.shtml|title=UBS whistleblower in France criticises banking omertà|work=finfacts.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the American banker [[Bradley Birkenfeld]] story gets out. His disclosures to the United States government led to a massive fraud investigation against the Swiss bank UBS and other banks that had enabled tax evasion by U.S.taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/birkenfeld-reward-may-tempt-other-bankers/33500198|title=Birkenfeld reward may tempt other bankers|work=SWI Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
All the internal procedures of the bank are thus modified everywhere in the world where [[UBS]] has offices.&lt;ref name="banque-france1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acp.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/acp/publications/registre-officiel/20130626-Decision-de-la-commission-des-sanctions.pdf |format=PDF |title=AUTORITÉ DE CONTRÔLE PRUDENTIEL COMMISSION DES SANCTIONS
|publisher=Acp.banque-france.fr |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Stephanie Gibaud was requested by her manager to delete the content of her hard drive because the office of the Paris general director was searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/uk-france-ubs-ag-idUKKBN0M122P20150305|title=French court rules UBS bullied ex-employee|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These files contained the names and coordinates of clients and prospects of the bank as well as the names of their respective client advisors in France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Monaco etc.&lt;ref name="banque-france1"/&gt;

Stephanie Gibaud refused to comply with the instruction, her manager repeated her request and will also ask her to toss the content of her paper archives. A tug-of-war then started and Stephanie Gibaud complained of harassment, exclusion and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-tax-evasion-_ubs-whistleblower-criticises-banking-s--code-of-silence-/40894464|title=UBS whistleblower criticises banking’s ‘code of silence’|work=SWI Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several executives of the bank confirmed to her that sales service proposed by Swiss client advisors is illegal in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonprogressivejournal.com/article/view/2069/the-big-banks-organise-massive-tax-evasion-on-an-international-scale|title=The Big Banks Organise Massive Tax Evasion on an International Scale|work=London Progressive Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further explained that [[UBS]] France has implemented a parallel accounting named "milk notebook" that gathers on a monthly basis the tax evasion transactions of French clients to offshore locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/uk-france-ubs-ag-idUKKBN0M122P20150305 |title=French court rules UBS bullied ex-employee &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2015-03-05 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UBS]] France tried to dismiss her in 2009 but the dismissal was refused. In 2010, [[UBS]] France filled in a complaint against her for defamation but lost their trial. She was finally made redundant in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20150601132251/http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/03/05/business/05reuters-france-ubs-ag.html?_r=1] &lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[whistleblower]] by the French labor inspection as of 2008 and by the public prosecutor when filling a complaint against her employer at the end of 2009, Stephanie Gibaud has been listened to by the brigade of repression of the crime against the people (BRPD, part of the French financial brigade) in February 2011 and in March 2015 and several times by the customs, judicial investigations in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHLA0RYJ1iw|title=Another whistleblower offers to help government with black money probe|date=5 December 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also listened to by Belgian investigators as part of the indictment of UBS Belgium in July 2014 and several times in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-tax-evasion-_ubs-whistleblower-criticises-banking-s--code-of-silence-/40894464&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Stephanie Gibaud was listened to by Eric Bocquet, senator and reporter of the tax evasion commission&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r11-673-1/r11-673-174.html|title=Commission d'enquête sur l'évasion des capitaux et des actifs hors de France et ses incidences fiscales|work=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by Yann Galut, deputy, in July 2013. Her name appears in the reports of the senate commission of inquiry dated July 17, 2012.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; and October 17, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r13-087-1/r13-087-10.html|title=Évasion des capitaux et finance : mieux connaître pour mieux combattre (Rapport)|work=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, she published "''La Femme qui en savait vraiment trop''" (the woman who knew too much) at the Cherche Midi&lt;ref name="cherche-midi.com"/&gt; publisher.

'''Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana''' (25 January 1873? – 18 September 1939) was the founder of the [[Rātana]] [[religion]] in the early 20th century in [[New Zealand]].  He rose to prominence as a [[faith healer]].

==Beginnings==

Rātana was of the [[Ngati Apa]] and [[Ngā Wairiki]] [[iwi]] — his subtribes were [[Nga Ariki]], [[Ngāti Hikapirau]], [[Ngāti Rangiwaho]], [[Ngāti Kiriwheke]] and [[Ngati Kauae]]. On his mother's side he was of [[Ngā Rauru Kiitahi]], his mother belonging to the [[Rangitaawhi]] Hapū.

He married Te Urumanao Ngāpaki Baker, who had whakapapa links to the [[Ngāti Ruanui]], and possibly [[Te Āti Awa]] also.

Rātana began his spiritual mission during the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]]. He claimed that while standing on the veranda of his home at 2pm, on 8 November 1918, three days before the end of the [[First World War]], he saw a small cloud coming in from the sea toward his house. When the cloud 'broke open' he was overwhelmed by a presence and he rushed into the house declaring 'Peace be unto you all, for I am the Holy Spirit that speaks to you all. Straighten yourselves. Repent.' He was told the [[Holy Spirit]] was looking for a people through whom [[God]] could be truly known and accepted. The [[Māori people]] had not forgotten Jehovah and so they had been chosen to become an example to the world if only they would turn from their dependence on [[Tohunga|tohungaism]] (particularly the manipulative forms of witchcraft) and Maori gods. Rātana was told to unite the Māori and turn them to Ihoa o nga Mano (Jehovah of the Multitudes).&lt;ref&gt;Ratana the Prophet, Keith Newman, Penguin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his study of the [[Bible]] and began one of the most powerful faith healing ministries in New Zealand history. He gained a large following among Māori, becoming known as "Mangai" (a mouthpiece of God). A splinter group, called the [[Christian Maramatanga Society]], formed in the mid-1920s when they misinterpreted Rātana's call to 'close the Bible' in order to stop fanciful prophecies.

Variants of his name include Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, Tahu Pōtiki Wiremu Rātana and T. W. Rātana.

==Politics==
From 1922 onwards the Rātana movement became increasingly occupied with politics. The movement campaigned for ratification of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] as a "cure-all" for Māori problems and collected 30,000 signatures on a petition calling for this. In 1928 Rātana proclaimed that Rātana candidates would win the four [[Māori seats]] in the [[Parliament of New Zealand]], likening them to the four parts of his body, or the Four Quarters, as the seats became known. [[Eruera Tirikatene]] arranged a meeting with [[Michael J. Savage]] in Parliament on 4 February 1936 at which an alliance with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] was agreed. Savage's predecessor [[Harry Holland]] had been reluctant, because of the animosity between Rātana and the [[Māori King Movement]], especially Princess [[Te Puea Herangi|Te Puea]]. By 1943, the seats had been won, although Rātana had died in 1939.

==Legacy==

The Rātana Church remains one of the largest churches in Māori. The political links with the Labour Party remained strong for over 40 years, but were effectively divided by the rise of the [[Māori Party]], which was founded in 2004 and came to power in a [[confidence and supply]] agreement (with the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], Labour's traditional rival) after the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|2008 election]].
