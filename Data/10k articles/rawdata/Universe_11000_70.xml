[[File:Alexander C. Kirk 1830-1892.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Alexander C. Kirk]]

'''Alexander Carnegie Kirk'''  (16 July 1830 – 5 October 1892) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[engineer]] responsible for several major innovations in the [[shipbuilding]], [[refrigeration]], and [[oil shale industry|oil shale industries]] of the 19th century. Kirk, born in [[Barry, Angus]], received his formal education at the [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;ref name=studies&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Scottish Business History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZTLy16O3KwC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=alexander+kirk+1830&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=alexander%20kirk%201830&amp;f=false|page=278|author=Peter L.

==Family==
Alexander Carnegie Kirk was the eldest son of John Kirk (died 1858) and Christian Guthrie, née Carnegie, (died 1865). The [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] was his younger brother. A.C. Kirk married Ada Waller at [[Croydon]] in 1869 and they had six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/92264 |title=Kirk, Alexander Carnegie |publisher=Oxford DNB article |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Kirk's Retort.png|thumb|right|220px|Kirk's retort]]

In 1850, Kirk began a five-year apprenticeship with Robert Napier and Sons. In 1861, he became chief draughtsman at [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]] in London but this seems to have lasted less than a year. Later in 1861 he became an engineering manager in the shale-oil industry, working for [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alexander_Carnegie_Kirk |title=Alexander Carnegie Kirk |publisher=Gracesguide.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this employment he developed an oil shale retort and a refrigeration technology, involving the delivery of [[ether]]. The latter was to address production problems stemming from summer heat.&lt;ref name=studies/&gt;&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Refrigeration, Cold Storage and Ice-Making - A Practical Treatise on the Art and Science of Refrigeration|author=A.

In 1870 he was appointed manager of the [[John Elder (shipbuilder)|John C. Elder]] engineering works. After returning to the Napier firm as a senior partner in 1877, his work was thereafter focused on marine engineering. His [[triple-expansion engine]]s as designed for the steamship ''Propontis'' were unsuccessful, but his subsequent versions of the engine design, particularly those designed for the steamship [[SS Aberdeen (1881)|''Aberdeen'']], are credited as technological breakthroughs.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

==Professional appointments==
He served as the President of The [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] from 1887 to 1889.

'''''Burn Up''''' is a 2008 [[BBC Television|BBC]]/[[Global Television]] [[Drama]] dealing with the issues of [[climate change]] and [[peak oil]].

==Plot summary==

===Episode one===
Oil surveyor Masud Khamil narrowly escapes an attack on his camp in the deserts of [[Saudi Arabia]] and flees with some valuable data. Tom McConnell replaces his father-in-law Sir Mark Foxbay as Chairman of Arrow Oil. At the celebration party, [[Inuit]] activist Mika Namuvai enters uninvited and serves Tom a writ from her people. The writ decries global warming and its causes, such as Arrow's production facility on the [[Athabasca tar sands]]. The shock of Mika's subsequent ejection causes Tom's daughter to have an asthma attack, but she is saved by Holly Dernay, head of renewable energy at Arrow.

In testimony before the [[US Senate]] in Washington, Sir Richard Langham, Tom's former geology professor, testifies on the dangers of global warming, but he is discredited by a pro-oil senator using muck racked up by devious oil lobbyist James "Mack" Mackintosh. Tom confronts Mack, his longtime friend, about the tactics. Mack denies that he spread the story, but he is clearly committed to serving his employers. Back in [[London]], Tom wins his court case but then sees Mika set fire to herself on the court steps.

Tom and Holly attend Mika’s funeral in [[Alberta]], where Sir Richard sends them into the wilderness to see the truth for themselves. Holly pokes a hole in the ice covering a swamp and is able to ignite the methane gas waiting to be released. Later, while overnighting in an isolated shack on the tundra, Tom and Holly become intimate.

Meanwhile, British Prime-Ministerial Aide Philip Crowley offers unofficial government assistance to the Green Congress as they prepare for the World Forum on Climate Change (WFCC), a [[United Nations]] conference about global warming in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.

Masud returns to London and makes contact with Sir Mark, who has spoken with Masud before and agrees to meet to accept some confidential geology data. Sir Mark is clearly conflicted over what to do with the data.

Tom and Holly discuss pulling out of Athabasca, which has the most polluting oil of Arrow's many interests, and investing that money in renewables. Phillip confronts Holly with his knowledge that the desert massacre was done by mercenaries for the oil industry and not terrorists. But before she can talk to Tom, Tom finds Mack at her overturned apartment, where Mack reveals that Holly orchestrated Mika's protest at the party. Phillip stops Holly from returning to her apartment, instructing her to lie low. Tom wanders off to visit Sir Mark. Sir Mark hears a noise and goes outside, only to be struck dead in a hit-and-run. Tom and Masud, approaching from different directions, are witnesses. Tom runs to help, and Masud flees.

===Episode two===
Crowley sends Dernay to the World Forum on Climate Change in Calgary to look for Masud. Mack leads the Open Business Coalition and their friendly countries in moves to scupper [[Kyoto II]]. Dernay contacts Masud and tries to go to McConnell but he dismisses her. Crowley gets support within the Open Business Coalition from McConnell and the insurance companies and they win over the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|United States Treasury Secretary]] Brent Schlaes. Under pressure from Schlaes the US delegate softens his stance at the conference. Mack feeling under threat from his boss tries to scare off Dernay who has finally convinced McConnell to meet with Masud. At the meeting Masud hands over the data from the survey Foxbay commissioned that proves that the Saudi oil reserves have run out.

At a meeting in the [[Calgary Tower]] Mack warns McConnell of the chaos that will be unleashed if Masud’s data is published. The hard-line Robert Cooper is appointed as the new US delegate and goes back on the agreements of his predecessor. The Chinese delegate makes approaches to McConnell and the Green Congress so Crowley brokers a deal with them to sign Kyoto II. Dernay tries to bluff Mack and he warns her off but he is too late and she is killed. Mack confronts his boss who threatens to go after McConnell next to get the data. Cooper agrees a sideline treaty with the Chinese and walks out without signing Kyoto II. Mack confronts McConnell on the roof and after getting the data from him, he smuggles it past his boss’s men and hands it over to Crowley for publication.

==Production==
BBC Controller of Fiction [[Jane Tranter]] commissioned the film for transmission on [[BBC Two]].

{{quote|''As a lifelong fan of the political thriller, it's been           incredibly satisfying to marry it to the most urgent issue facing us as the century unfolds – a potent           cocktail of fiction and fact that we hope will enlighten as much as it will entertain.''|Executive Producer Stephen Garrett.&lt;ref name="bbcPressOffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/09/burn_up.shtml|title=BBC Drama commissions Burn Up for BBC Two|date=2007-09-10|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film was produced by [[Kudos Film and Television]] in co-production with Canadian production company [[SEVEN24 Films]].

{{quote|''Burn Up is a highly authored piece wholly of this unique moment in time. The exciting mix of US, Canadian and UK talent, the awesome backdrop of the Canadian wilds combined with Simon's taut and provocative script makes for an epic proposition.''|BBC Commissioning Editor for Drama, Lucy Richer.&lt;ref name="bbcPressOffice" /&gt;}}

Shot in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] and [[London]], England, the film is unusual for actually being set in Calgary, prompting Eric Volmers to write in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' that, ''while filming in the city is hardly unique, it's rare for a high-profile project to feature Calgary as Calgary.''&lt;ref name="calgaryHerald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/reallife/greenguide/story.html?id=d213ebcd-6192-49a3-a6c6-1b25dc82e36b|title=Calgary stars in dark tale of oil|last=Volmers|first=Eric|date=2008-06-09|work=[[Calgary Herald]]|accessdate=2008-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614093512/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/reallife/greenguide/story.html?id=d213ebcd-6192-49a3-a6c6-1b25dc82e36b|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay was written by Simon Beaufoy.  See his works below.

==Reception==

===Reviews===
Eric Volmers writing in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' states that, ''the opening scene is a suitably violent and tense intro that manages to conjure up both a sinister and international tone to the four-hour Canadian-U.K. co-production,'' and goes on to say that, ''Burn Up asks decidedly unsettling questions about big oil and political expediency, the environmental impact of the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and even [[US foreign policy|American foreign policy]],'' which he claims, ''was perhaps a surprising project to find life amid the "oil-is-good" sentiment of Alberta.''&lt;ref name="calgaryHerald" /&gt;

Sam Wollaston writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' compliments the character development and interaction that is, ''going on all over the place,'' and credits Whitford and Warren as ''the stars of Burn Up,'' before going on to say Penry-Jones is, ''lively in the lead.'' He claims the film is an improvement on recent docudramas in that, ''it has a proper script'' and that while, ''the across-the-green-line romance is a little embarrassing,'' ''the whole thing skips along,'' and, ''at times it thrills, which is no bad thing in a thriller,'' but it, ''is issue-led, rather than story-led,'' and overall it feels, ''a bit crude,'' ''as opposed to refined.''&lt;ref name="the GuardianReview2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/24/television.television1 | title=Last night's TV | date=2008-07-24 | last= Wollaston | first=Sam | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gareth McLean writing in the same publication said that, ''despite the occasional flashy moment, high-octane drama this is not,'' criticising the film for, ''copious amounts of tiresome expositional dialogue and a leaden plot,'' before concluding, ''why not treat yourself and rent [[Syriana]] instead?''&lt;ref name="the GuardianReview1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/23/television2 | title=Watch This | date=2008-07-23 | last=McLean | first=Gareth | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Teeman writing in ''[[The Times]]'' calls the film, ''a consciousness-raising thriller,'' that, ''is trying desperately to do that BBC thing of being sexy and responsible.'' He states that, ''the arguments about oil production and the environment felt clunky and little more than speechifying,'' that the film was, ''in danger of forgetting that drama should be drama, not a lecture, and that characters should be characters, not ciphers,'' but, ''despite the didactic politicking, the pace is unrelenting and the baddies at least are colourful and engaging.'' He complimented Whitford who, ''villainously devoured every scene,'' for his, ''needling chemistry'' with the, ''brilliant,'' Warren, and concluded that, ''Whitford and Campbell together, him snarling, her looking all impish and button-nosed, had me almost pathetically excited: [[The West Wing]] and [[Party of Five]] united on screen is pretty near Teeman TV Heaven.''&lt;ref name="theTimeReview1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4385668.ece | title= Last Night’s TV | date=2008-07-24 | last=Teeman | first=Tim | publisher=[[The Times]] | accessdate=2008-07-26  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Chater writing in the same publication describes the film as, ''highly watchable,'' thanks to, ''a fast-paced, intelligent script and some fine acting,'' although the, ''characters tend to come with labels, and the elements of thriller are there for excitement rather than credibility'', he concludes, ''it is still an exciting ride in an eco-friendly racer,''&lt;ref name="theTimeReview2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4378800.ece | title=Tonight's TV | date=2008-07-23 | last=Chater | first=David | publisher=[[The Times]] | accessdate=2008-07-26  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, ''it’s like [[Doctor Who]] for grown-ups.''&lt;ref name="theTimeReview3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4392224.ece | title=Tonight's TV | date=2008-07-25 | last=Chater | first=David | publisher=[[The Times]] | accessdate=2008-07-26  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California electricity crisis''', also known as the '''Western U.S. Energy Crisis''' of 2000 and 2001, was a situation in which the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[California]] had a shortage of [[electricity supply]] caused by [[market manipulation]]s, and capped retail electricity prices.&lt;ref name="Sweeney_2002"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/OurEnergyFuture/TheCaliforniaElectricityCrisisLessonsfortheFuture.aspx
|title=The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for the Future|last=Sweeney|first=James L.|date=Summer 2002 |work= |publisher=National Academy of Engineering of the Nation Academies|accessdate=January 9, 2012|quote="... volatile commodity market, but it had fixed sales prices for the investor-owned utilities at the retail level, a potentially untenable combination"
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state suffered from multiple large-scale [[Power outage|blackouts]], one of the state's largest energy companies collapsed, and the economic fall-out greatly harmed [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Gray Davis]]' standing.

Drought, delays in approval of new power plants,&lt;ref name="Sweeney_2002" /&gt;{{rp|109}} and market manipulation decreased supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} This caused an 800% increase in wholesale prices from April 2000 to December 2000.&lt;ref name="Weare_2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=The California Electricity Crisis: Causes and Policy Options |last=Weare |first=Christopher |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=[[Public Policy Institute of California]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58213-064-7 |url=http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_103CWR.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} In addition, [[Rolling blackout#California|rolling blackouts]] adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail consumers.

California had an installed generating capacity of 45&amp;nbsp;GW.  At the time of the blackouts, demand was 28&amp;nbsp;GW.  A demand supply gap was [[market manipulation|created]] by energy companies, mainly [[Enron]], to create an artificial shortage. Energy traders took power plants offline for maintenance in days of peak demand to increase the price.&lt;ref name="tapes-cnn"&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/03/enron.tapes/ Tapes: Enron plotted to shut down power plant.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tapes-nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/national/04energy.html?ex=1107666000&amp;en=01449ebf62df572e&amp;ei=5070 |title=Tapes Show Enron Arranged Plant Shutdown |last=Egan |first=Timothy |date=February 4, 2005 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20 times its normal value. Because the state government had a cap on retail electricity charges, this market manipulation squeezed the industry's revenue margins, causing the bankruptcy of [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) and near bankruptcy of [[Southern California Edison]] in early 2001.&lt;ref name="Weare_2003" /&gt;{{rp|2-3}}

The financial crisis was possible because of partial deregulation legislation instituted in 1996 by the California Legislature (AB 1890) and Governor [[Pete Wilson]]. Enron took advantage of this deregulation and was involved in economic withholding and inflated price bidding in California's spot markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/wec/enron/summary-findings.pdf |title = FERC Summary of findings |format=PDF |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis cost between [[United States dollar|US$]]40 to $45 billion.&lt;ref name="Weare_2003" /&gt;{{rp|3-4}}

==Causes==

===Market manipulation===
As the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|FERC]] report concluded, [[market manipulation]] was only possible as a result of the complex market design produced by the process of partial deregulation. Manipulation strategies were known to energy traders under names such as "Fat Boy", "[[Death Star (business)|Death Star]]", "Forney Perpetual Loop", "Ricochet", "Ping Pong", "Black Widow", "Big Foot", "Red Congo", "Cong Catcher" and "Get Shorty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mresearch.com/pdfs/19.pdf Congestion Manipulation "DeathStar"], McCullough Research (June 5, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have been extensively investigated and described in reports.

'''Megawatt laundering''' is the term, analogous to money laundering, coined to describe the process of obscuring the true origins of specific quantities of electricity being sold on the energy market. The California energy market allowed for energy companies to charge higher prices for electricity produced out-of-state. It was therefore advantageous to make it appear that electricity was being generated somewhere other than California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''Overscheduling''' is a term used in describing the manipulation of capacity available for the transportation of electricity along power lines. Power lines have a defined maximum load. Lines must be booked (or ''scheduled'') in advance for transporting bought-and-sold quantities of electricity. "Overscheduling" means a deliberate reservation of more line usage than is actually required and can create the appearance that the power lines are congested. Overscheduling was one of the building blocks of a number of scams. For example, the ''Death Star'' group of scams played on the market rules which required the state to pay "congestion fees" to alleviate congestion on major power lines. "Congestion fees" were a variety of financial incentives aimed at ensuring power providers solved the congestion problem. But in the Death Star scenario, the congestion was entirely illusory and the congestion fees would therefore simply increase profits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In a letter sent from David Fabian to Senator Boxer in 2002, it was alleged that:
: "There is a single connection between northern and southern California's power grids. I heard that Enron traders purposely overbooked that line, then caused others to need it. Next, by California's free-market rules, Enron was allowed to price-gouge at will."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from David Fabian to Senator Boxer, February 13, 2002, p.1, quoted in [http://www.mresearch.com/pdfs/19.pdf Congestion Manipulation "DeathStar"], McCullough Research (June 5, 2002) at p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of partial deregulation===
On a federal level, the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], for which Enron had lobbied, opened electrical transmission grids to competition, unbundling generation and transmission of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A most favored corporation: Enron prevailed in federal, state lobbying efforts 49 times|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2003/01/06/3160/most-favored-corporation-enron-prevailed-federal-state-lobbying-efforts-49-times|work=Center for Public Integrity|date=January 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the state level, part of California's [[deregulation]] process, which was promoted as a means of increasing competition, was also influenced by lobbying from Enron, and began in 1996 when California became the first state to deregulate its electricity market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fogarty|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Iwata|first2=Edward|title=Energy deregulation: Is it friend or enemy?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-05-16-enron-california-hearings.htm|work=USAToday|date=May 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Don’t let ghosts of Enron haunt us again|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article103535032.html|work=Sacramento Bee|date=September 24, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a total of 40% of installed capacity&amp;nbsp;– 20&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatt]]s&amp;nbsp;– was sold to what were called "independent power [[electricity generation|producers]]." These included [[Mirant]], [[RRI Energy|Reliant]], [[Williams Companies|Williams]], [[Dynegy]], and [[AES Corporation|AES]]. The utilities were then required to buy their electricity from the newly created day-ahead only market, the California Power Exchange (PX).  Utilities were precluded from entering into longer-term agreements that would have allowed them to hedge their energy purchases and mitigate day-to-day swings in prices due to transient supply disruptions and demand spikes from hot weather.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Image:PG&amp;E Yard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|PG&amp;E yard in [[San Francisco]]]]
Then, in 2000, wholesale prices were deregulated, but retail prices were [[regulation|regulated]] for the incumbents as part of a deal with the regulator, allowing the incumbent utilities to recover the cost of assets that would be stranded as a result of greater competition, based on the expectation that "frozen" rates would remain higher than wholesale prices. This assumption remained true from April 1998 through May 2000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Energy deregulation put the three companies that distribute electricity into a tough situation.  Energy deregulation policy froze or capped the existing price of energy that the three energy distributors could charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2001/05/08/lookhow.DTL |title=Energy Crisis Overview: How we got here |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |date=May 8, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206194211/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fgate%2Farchive%2F2001%2F05%2F08%2Flookhow.DTL |archivedate=February 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deregulating the producers of energy did not lower the cost of energy. Deregulation did not encourage new producers to create more power and drive down prices. Instead, with increasing demand for electricity, the producers of energy charged more for electricity.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/12/24/MN71492.DTL |title = THE ENERGY CRUNCH / A YEAR LATER / State's deregulation folly is no laughing matter / Consumers face inflated bills for years for failed electricity plan |author=Carolyn Said |date = December 24, 2001 |accessdate=August 17, 2008 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The producers used moments of spike energy production to inflate the price of energy.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;  In January 2001, energy producers began shutting down plants to increase prices.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;

When electricity wholesale prices exceeded [[electricity retailing|retail]] prices, end user demand was unaffected, but the incumbent [[utility]] companies still had to purchase power, albeit at a loss. This allowed independent producers to manipulate prices in the electricity market by withholding electricity generation, [[arbitrage|arbitraging]] the price between internal generation and imported (interstate) power, and causing artificial [[electric power transmission|transmission]] constraints. This was a procedure referred to as "gaming the market." In economic terms, the incumbents who were still subject to retail price caps were faced with [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic demand]] (see also: [[Demand response]]).  They were unable to pass the higher prices on to consumers without approval from the public utilities commission. The affected incumbents were [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) and [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] (PG&amp;E). Pro-[[privatization]] advocates{{Attribution needed|date=May 2016}} insist the cause of the problem was that the regulator still held too much control over the market, and true market processes were stymied, whereas opponents of deregulation assert that the fully regulated system had worked for 40 years without blackouts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Government price caps===
By keeping the consumer price of electricity artificially low, the California government discouraged citizens from practicing conservation. In February 2001, California governor Gray Davis stated, "Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 20 minutes."&lt;ref name="signonsandiego.com"&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/recall/20030902-9999_1n2power.html Energy crisis cited as turning point for Davis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221160025/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/recall/20030902-9999_1n2power.html |date=February 21, 2009 }}, San Diego Union-Tribune, September 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy price regulation incentivized suppliers to ration their electricity supply rather than expand production.  The resulting scarcity created opportunities for market manipulation by energy speculators.

State lawmakers expected the price of electricity to decrease due to the resulting competition; hence they capped the price of electricity at the pre-deregulation level. Since they also saw it as imperative that the supply of electricity remain uninterrupted, utility companies were required by law to buy electricity from [[spot market]]s at uncapped prices when faced with imminent power shortages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

When the electricity demand in California rose, utilities had no financial incentive to expand production, as long term prices were capped. Instead, wholesalers such as [[Enron]] manipulated the market to force utility companies into daily spot markets for short term gain. For example, in a market technique known as megawatt laundering, wholesalers bought up electricity in California at below cap price to sell out of state, creating shortages. In some instances, wholesalers scheduled power transmission to create congestion and drive up prices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After extensive investigation, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) substantially agreed in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/wec/enron/summary-findings.pdf |title = FERC Summary of findings |format=PDF |accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "...supply-demand imbalance, flawed market design and inconsistent rules made possible significant market manipulation as delineated in final investigation report. Without underlying market dysfunction, attempts to manipulate the market would not be successful."

: "...many trading strategies employed by Enron and other companies violated the anti-gaming provisions..."

: "Electricity prices in California’s spot markets were affected by economic withholding and inflated price bidding, in violation of tariff anti-gaming provisions."

The major flaw of the deregulation scheme was that it was an incomplete deregulation&amp;nbsp;– that is, "middleman" utility distributors continued to be regulated and forced to charge fixed prices, and continued to have limited choice in terms of electricity providers.  Other, less catastrophic energy deregulation schemes, such as Pennsylvania's, have generally deregulated utilities but kept the providers regulated, or deregulated both.

===New regulations===
&lt;!-- Wrong term: it was not "deregulation" because companies were '''required''' to buy electricity from particular sources, and their were also price controls. If someone tagged it 'deregulation' we should say who (and why, in case they actually gave a reason). --&gt;
In the mid-90's, under Republican Governor [[Pete Wilson]], California began changing the electricity industry. Democratic State Senator [[Steve Peace]] was the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy at the time and is often credited as "the father of deregulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Mark|title=Newsmaker Profile: Steve Peace / Davis' finance chief skilled at raising hell / Brash ex-senator a bold pick|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/NEWSMAKER-PROFILE-Steve-Peace-Davis-finance-2709769.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=December 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the bill was Senator Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/120900-01.htm How California's Consumers Lost With Electricity Deregulation] [[Common Dreams]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson admitted publicly that defects in the deregulation system would need fixing by "the next governor".

[[Image:PG&amp;E Meter on Angel Island.jpg|thumb|200px|right|PG&amp;E electric meter on [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]].]]
The new rules called for the Investor Owned Utilities, or IOUs, (primarily [[Pacific Gas and Electric]], [[Southern California Edison]], and [[San Diego Gas and Electric]]) to sell off a significant part of their [[electricity generation]] to wholly private, unregulated companies such as AES, Reliant, and Enron.  The buyers of those [[power plant]]s then became the wholesalers from which the IOUs needed to buy the electricity that they used to own themselves.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

While the selling of power plants to private companies was labeled "deregulation", in fact Steve Peace and the California legislature expected that there would be regulation by FERC which would prevent manipulation. FERC's job, in theory, is to regulate and enforce federal law, preventing market manipulation and price manipulation of energy markets. When called upon to regulate the out-of-state privateers which were clearly manipulating the California energy market, FERC hardly reacted at all and did not take serious action against Enron, Reliant, or any other privateers. FERC's resources are in fact quite sparse in comparison to their entrusted task of policing the energy market. Lobbying by private companies may also have slowed down regulation and enforcement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Supply and demand===
California's population increased by 13% during the 1990s. The state did not build any new major power plants during that time, although existing in-state power plants were expanded and power output was increased nearly 30% from 1990 to 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

California's utilities came to depend in part on the import of excess [[hydroelectricity]] from the [[Pacific Northwest]] states of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} California's clean air standards favored in-state electricity generation which burned natural gas because of its lower emissions, as opposed to coal whose emissions are more toxic and contain more pollutants.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available to California. Though at no point during the crisis was California's sum of actual electric-generating capacity plus out-of-state supply less than demand, California's energy reserves were low enough that during peak hours the private industry which owned power-generating plants could effectively hold the State hostage by shutting down their plants for "maintenance" in order to manipulate supply and demand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} These critical shutdowns often occurred for no other reason than to force California's electricity grid managers into a position where they would be forced to purchase electricity on the "spot market", where private generators could charge astronomical rates. Even though these rates were semi-regulated and tied to the price of natural gas, the companies (which included Enron and Reliant Energy) controlled the supply of natural gas as well. Manipulation by the industry of natural gas prices resulted in higher electricity rates that could be charged under the semi-regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In addition, the energy companies took advantage of California's electrical infrastructure weakness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The main line which allowed electricity to travel from the north to the south, [[Path 15]], had not been improved for many{{Quantify|date=December 2010}} years and became a major bottleneck point which limited the amount of power that could be sent south to 3,900 [[Megawatt|MW]]. Without the manipulation by energy companies, this bottleneck was not problematic, but the effects of the bottleneck compounded the price manipulation by hamstringing energy grid managers in their ability to transport electricity from one area to another. With a smaller pool of generators available to draw from in each area, managers were forced to work in two markets to buy energy, both of which were being manipulated by the energy companies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The [[International Energy Agency]] estimates&lt;ref name="IEA-billing-2003"&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2000/powertochoose_2003.pdf The Power to Choose&amp;nbsp;– Enhancing Demand Response in Liberalised Electricity Markets] Findings of [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Demand Response Project, Presentation 2003&lt;/ref&gt; that a 5% lowering of demand would result in a 50% price reduction during the peak hours of the California electricity crisis in 2000/2001. With better [[demand response]] the market also becomes more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side.

==Some key events==
Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in August 2000.  On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the [[California Independent System Operator]] (ISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Most notably, the city of Los Angeles was unaffected by the crisis because government-owned public utilities in California (including the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power) were exempt from the deregulation legislation and sold their excess power to private utilities in the state (mostly to Southern California Edison) during the crises.  That enabled much of the greater Los Angeles area to suffer only rolling brown-outs rather than long term black outs suffered in other parts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hahn Orders DWP to Probe Power Deals|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/29/local/me-dwp29|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 29, 2002|author=Seema Mehta|author2=Nancy Vogel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2000, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) rejected California's request for a wholesale rate cap for California, instead approving a "flexible cap" plan of $150 per megawatt-hour. That day, California was paying wholesale prices of over $1400 per megawatt-hour, compared to $45 per megawatt-hour average one year earlier.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On January 17, 2001, the electricity crisis caused Governor [[Gray Davis]] to declare a state of emergency.  Speculators, led by [[Enron Corporation]], were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks, and finally suffered rolling blackouts on January 17 &amp; 18.  Davis was forced to step in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market, since the California power companies were technically [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] and had no buying power.  The resulting massive long term debt obligations added to the state budget crisis and led to widespread grumbling about Davis' administration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Consequences of wholesale price rises on the retail market==
As a result of the actions of electricity wholesalers, [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) and [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] (PG&amp;E) were buying from a spot market at very high prices but were unable to raise retail rates. A product that the IOU's used to produce for about three cents per kilowatt hour of electricity, they were paying eleven cents, twenty cents, fifty cents or more; and, yet, they were capped at 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour when charging their retail customers. As a result, PG&amp;E filed bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison worked diligently on a workout plan with the State of California to save their company from the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-03keeley-speech.html |title = The Energy Crisis: Keeping The Lights On |author = Fred Keeley |date = March 8, 2001 |accessdate = August 17, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120729140131/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-03keeley-speech.html |archivedate = July 29, 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

PG&amp;E and SCE had racked up $20 billion in debt by Spring of 2001 and their credit ratings were reduced to junk status. The financial crisis meant that PG&amp;E and SCE were unable to purchase power on behalf of their customers.  The state stepped in on January 17, 2001, having the California Department of Water Resources buy power.  By February 1, 2001 this stop-gap measure had been extended and would also include SDG&amp;E. It would not be until January 1, 2003 that the utilities would resume procuring power for their customers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Between 2000 and 2001, the combined California utilities laid off 1,300 workers, from 56,000 to 54,700, in an effort to remain solvent. SDG&amp;E had worked through the stranded asset provision and was in a position to increase prices to reflect the spot market. Small businesses were badly affected.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

According to a 2007 study of [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] data by Power in the Public Interest, retail electricity prices rose much more from 1999 to 2007 in states that adopted deregulation than in those that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Johnston | first = David  | title = Competitively Priced Electricity Costs More, Studies Show  | work = The New York Times  | date = November 6, 2007 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/business/06electric.html  | accessdate = August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement of Enron==
{{Main|Enron}}

One of the energy wholesalers that became notorious for "gaming the market" and reaping huge speculative profits was [[Enron|Enron Corporation]]. Enron CEO [[Kenneth Lay]] mocked the efforts by the California state government to thwart the practices of the energy wholesalers, saying, "In the final analysis, it doesn't matter what you crazy people in California do, because I got smart guys who can always figure out how to make money." The original statement was made in a phone conversation between [[S. David Freeman]] (Chairman of the California Power Authority) and Kenneth Lay in 2000, according to the statements made by Freeman to the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism in April&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/041102freeman.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040724061029/http%3A//commerce%2Esenate%2Egov/hearings/041102freeman%2Epdf |archivedate= July 24, 2004 |title=Testimony of S.

David Freeman |date =May 15, 2002|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. David Freeman, who was appointed Chair of the California Power Authority in the midst of the crisis, made the following statements about Enron's involvement in testimony&lt;ref name="FreemanMay2002" /&gt; submitted before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on May 15, 2002:

: "There is one fundamental lesson we must learn from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities to take advantage of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If [[Murphy's Law]] were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.

: "Enron stood for secrecy and a lack of responsibility. In electric power, we must have openness and companies that are responsible for keeping the lights on. We need to go back to companies that own power plants with clear responsibilities for selling real power under long-term contracts. There is no place for companies like Enron that own the equivalent of an electronic telephone book and [[game the system]] to extract an unnecessary middleman’s profits. Companies with power plants can compete for contracts to provide the bulk of our power at reasonable prices that reflect costs. People say that Governor Davis has been vindicated by the Enron confession."

Enron eventually went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], and signed a US$1.52 billion settlement with a group of California agencies and private utilities on July 16, 2005. However, due to its other bankruptcy obligations, only US$202 million of this was expected to be paid. Ken Lay was convicted of multiple criminal charges unrelated to the California energy crisis on May 25, 2006, but he died on July 5 of that year before he could be sentenced. Because Lay died while his case was on federal appeal, his conviction was vacated and his family was allowed to retain all his property.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Enron traded in energy [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] specifically exempted from regulation by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].  At a Senate hearing in January 2002, [[Vincent Viola]], chairman of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]&amp;nbsp;– the largest forum for energy contract trading and clearing&amp;nbsp;– urged that Enron-like companies, which don't operate in trading "pits" and don't have the same government regulations, be given the same requirements for "compliance, disclosure, and oversight." He asked the committee to enforce "greater transparency" for the records of companies like Enron.  In any case, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled "that FERC has had the authority to negate bilateral contracts if it finds that the prices, terms or conditions of those contracts are unjust or unreasonable." [[Nevada]] was the first state to attempt recovery of such contract losses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Handling of the crisis==

===Governor Gray Davis===
Perhaps the heaviest point of controversy is the question of blame for the California electricity crisis.  Former Governor [[Gray Davis]]'s critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis to the power trading fraud and [[accounting scandals|corporate accounting scandals]] and say that Davis did all he could considering the fact that the federal government, not states, regulate interstate power commerce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In a speech at [[UCLA]] on August 19, 2003, Davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis, but then forcefully attacked the [[Houston]]-based energy suppliers: "I inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers. We got no help from the Federal government. In fact, when I was fighting [[Enron]] and the other energy companies, these same companies were sitting down with [[Vice President]] Cheney to draft a national energy strategy."

Signs of trouble first cropped up in the spring of 2000 when electricity bills skyrocketed for customers in San Diego, the first area of the state to deregulate. Experts warned of an impending energy crisis, but Governor Davis did little to respond until the crisis became statewide that summer. Davis began asking the federal regulator FERC to probe possible price manipulation by power suppliers as early as August 2000. Davis would issue a state of emergency on January 17, 2001, when wholesale electricity prices hit new highs and the state began issuing [[rolling blackout]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Some critics, such as [[Arianna Huffington]], alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by [[campaign contribution]]s from energy producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/01/27/power/ |title=Gov. Davis and the failure of power|author=Arianna Huffington |publisher=Salon |date=January 27, 2001 |accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the California State Legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities, ensuring a more steady supply and slapping the nose of the worst manipulators &lt;!-- A reference for this comparison? (à la Kennedy and the Steel plant takeovers of the 60's)--&gt;. Meanwhile, conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators, and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200308/ai_n9286114 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070324221436/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200308/ai_n9286114 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = March 24, 2007 |title = Ten good reasons to recall Gray Davis |date=August 18, 2003   |accessdate=August 17, 2008 | work=Human Events }} &lt;/ref&gt; More criticism is given in the book ''[[Conspiracy of Fools]]'', which gives the details of a meeting between the governor and his officials; [[Clinton Administration]] Treasury officials; and energy executives, including market manipulators such as Enron, where Gray Davis disagreed with the treasury officials and energy executives. They advised suspending environmental studies to build power plants and a small rate hike to prepare for long-term power contracts (Davis eventually signed overpriced ones, as noted above), while Davis supported price caps, denounced the other solutions as too politically risky, and allegedly acted rudely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichenwald | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Eichenwald | title = Conspiracy of Fools

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts Davis signed locked Californians into high electric costs for the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/davis_20010525.html |title=Governor Davis and the Energy Crisis |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016005719/http://geoffmetcalf.com/davis_20010525.html |archivedate=October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2011 electric rates in California had yet to return to pre-contract levels.

The crisis, and the subsequent government intervention, have had political ramifications, and is regarded as one of the major contributing factors to the [[2003 California recall|2003 recall election]] of Governor Davis.

On November 13, 2003, shortly before leaving office, Davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on January 17, 2001. The state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies. The emergency authority allowed Davis to order the [[California Energy Commission]] to streamline the application process for new power plants. During that time, California issued licenses to 38 new power plants, amounting to 14,365 megawatts of electricity production when completed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Arnold Schwarzenegger===
On May 17, 2001, future Republican governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and former [[Los Angeles]] Mayor Republican [[Richard Riordan]] met with [[Enron]] CEO [[Kenneth Lay]] at the [[The Peninsula Hotels|Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel]] in [[Beverly Hills]]. The meeting was convened for Enron to present its "Comprehensive Solution for California," which called for an end to federal and state investigations into Enron's role in the California energy crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/13.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814133208/http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/13.html |date=August 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2003/10/6/schwarzenegger_accused_of_involvement_in_9b |title=Schwarzenegger Accused of Involvement in $9B California Swindle with Enron's Ken Lay |publisher=Democracynow.org |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/leopold08182003.html |title=Jason Leopold: Schwarzenegger, Michael Milken and Ken Lay |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620171610/http://counterpunch.org/leopold08182003.html |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2003, Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California to replace Davis.

Over a year later, he attended the commissioning ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wapa.gov/newsroom/cct/2005/jan14/27no12.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924224547/http://www.wapa.gov/newsroom/cct/2005/jan14/27no12.htm |archivedate = September 24, 2006 |title = Western Area Power Administration |publisher=Closed Circuit newsletter |date=January 14, 2005 |author= Carolyn Hinkley|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a new [[Western Area Power Administration]] (WAPA) 500 kV line remedying the aforementioned power bottleneck on [[Path 15]].

===National Energy Development Task Force===
Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was appointed in January 2001 to head the National Energy Development Task Force. In the spring of that year, officials of the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] met with the Task Force, asking for [[price control]]s to protect consumers. The Task Force refused, and insisted that deregulation must remain in place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Federal Energy Regulatory Commission===
The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) was intimately involved with the handling of the crisis from the summer of 2000. There were in fact at least four separate FERC investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/wec.asp |title = Summary of FERC documentation relating to the Western Energy Crisis 2000–2001 |accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''charm quark''', '''charmed quark''' or '''c quark''' (from its symbol, c) is the third most massive of all [[quark]]s, a type of [[elementary particle]]. Charm quarks are found in [[hadron]]s, which are [[subatomic particle]]s made of quarks. Examples of hadrons containing charm quarks include the [[J/&amp;psi;]] meson ({{SubatomicParticle|J/Psi}}), [[D meson]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|D}}), [[charmed Sigma baryon]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|charmed Sigma}}), and other charmed particles.

It, along with the [[strange quark]] is part of the [[generation (particle physics)|second generation]] of matter, and has an [[electric charge]] of +{{sfrac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']] and a [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of {{val|1.29|+0.05|-0.11|ul=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2011"/&gt; Like all [[quark]]s, the charm quark is an [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[fermion]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[spin-1/2|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], and experiences all four [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s. The [[antiparticle]] of the charm quark is the '''charm antiquark''' (sometimes called ''anticharm quark'' or simply ''anticharm''), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

The existence of a fourth quark had been speculated by a number of authors around 1964 (for instance by [[James Bjorken]] and [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]]&lt;ref&gt;

The 1974 discovery of the {{SubatomicParticle|J/Psi}} (and thus the charm quark) ushered in a series of breakthroughs which are collectively known as the ''[[November Revolution (physics)|November Revolution]]''.

==Hadrons containing charm quarks==
{{Main|List of baryons|list of mesons}}
Some of the [[hadron]]s containing charm quarks include:
*[[D meson]]s contain a charm quark (or its [[antiparticle]]) and an [[up quark|up]] or [[down quark]].
*{{SubatomicParticle|Strange D}} mesons contain a charm quark and a [[strange quark]].
*There are many [[charmonium]] states, for example the {{SubatomicParticle|J/Psi}} particle. These consist of a charm quark and its antiparticle.
*[[Charmed baryon]]s have been observed, and are named in analogy with strange baryons (e.g. {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Lambda+}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">[[Nitrogen]], as an element of great technical importance, can be produced in a '''cryogenic nitrogen plant''' with a purity of more than 99.9999%.
Air inside a distillation column is separated at cryogenic temperatures (about 100K/-173°C) to produce high purity nitrogen with 1ppm of impurities.
The process is based on the [[air separation]], which was invented by [[Carl von Linde|Dr. Carl von Linde]] in 1895.

==Purpose==
[[File:GAN1800.jpg|thumb|250px|Gaseous Nitrogen (GAN) plant with production rate of 800 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour]]
The main purpose of a cryogenic nitrogen plant is to provide a customer with high purity gaseous nitrogen (GAN). In addition [[liquid nitrogen]] (LIN) is produced simultaneously and is typically 10% of the gas production. High purity liquid nitrogen produced by cryogenic plants is stored in a local tank and used as a strategic reserve. This liquid can be vaporised to cover peaks in demand or for use when the nitrogen plant is offline.
Typical cryogenic nitrogen plants range from 250 Nm³/hour to very large range plants with a daily capacity of 63.000 tonnes of nitrogen a day (as the [[Cantarell Field]] plant in Mexico).

==Plant Modules==
A cryogenic nitrogen plant comprises:

===Warm End (W/E) Container===
*[[gas compressor|Compressor]]
*[[Air receiver]]
*Chiller ([[Heat exchanger]])
*Pre-filter
*[[Air purification unit]] (APU)

===Coldbox===
*Main heat exchanger
*[[Fractionating column|Distillation Column]]
*[[Condenser (heat transfer)|Condenser]]
*Expansion brake turbine

===Storage and Backup System===
*Liquid nitrogen tank
*Vapouriser

==How the plant works==
[[File:schemeGAN.jpg|thumb|650px| [[Process flow diagram|Flowsheet]] GAN Plant Linde Cryoplants Ltd.]]

===Warm end process===
[[Earth's atmosphere|Atmospheric air]] is roughly filtered and pressurised by a [[gas compressor|compressor]], which provides the product pressure to deliver to the customer. The amount of air sucked in depends on the customer’s nitrogen demand.

The Air Receiver collects condensate and minimises pressure drop. The dry and compressed air leaves the air to refrigerant [[heat exchanger]] at about 10°C.

To clean the process air further, there are different stages of [[filtration]]. First of all, more condensate is removed, this removes some [[hydrocarbon]]s.

The last [[unit process]] in the warm end container is the [[thermal swing adsorber]] (TSA). The Air purification unit cleans the compressed process air by removing any residual water vapour, [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrocarbons]]. It comprises two vessels, valves and exhaust to allow the changeover of vessels. While one of the TSA beds is on stream the second one is regenerated by the oxygen rich waste flow, which is vented through a silencer into the ambient environment.

===Coldbox process===
After leaving the air purification unit, the process air enters the main heat exchanger, where it is rapidly cooled down to -165°C. All residual [[impurities]] (e.g. [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) freeze out, and the process air enters at the bottom of the [[Fractionating column|distillation column]] partially liquefied.

===Back up process===
[[Liquid Nitrogen]] produced from the cold box transfers into the liquid [[storage tank]].  An ambient air vaporiser is used to vaporise stored liquid during peak demand. A pressure control panel senses the demand for gaseous nitrogen and regulates the gas flow into the end-users pipeline to maintain line pressure.

==Applications for high purity nitrogen production==
*[[Ammonia]] production for the [[fertilizer]] industry
*[[Float glass]] manufacture
*[[Petrochemical]]
**Purge gas
**Blanketing/Inerting gas for tanks and reactor vessels
**[[Amine]] gas treatment
**[[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]] seal gas
*[[Polyester]] manufacture
*[[Semiconductor]] manufacture
*[[Photovoltaic]] manufacture

'''Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi Ltd. (ESCOM)''' is the [[state-owned]] power producing company in [[Malawi]]. It is entirely in control of transmission and distribution of electric power in the country. ESCOM represents Malawi in the [[Southern African Power Pool]]. It is not to be confused with its [[South Africa]]n equivalent [[Eskom]].

Nearly 95% of Malawi’s electricity supply is provided by hydropower from a cascaded group of interconnected hydroelectric power plants located on the middle part of [[Shire River]] and a mini hydro on the [[Wovwe River]], which constitute the interconnected system. Total installed capacity of these hydropower plants is 285.82MW (thus 281.5MW for main hydro, and 4.32MW of mini-hydro Wovwe). The hydroelectric schemes on the Shire River are all of run-of the river type. Some thermal power plants serve as stand-by for the interconnected system: a 15 MW Gas Turbine Plant in Blantyre and a 1.1 MW Diesel Power Plant in [[Mzuzu]]. [[Likoma District]] has two separate isolated systems with a total installed thermal power plants capacity of 1.050MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escommw.com/generation.php |title=Escom website: Generation Business Unit |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305005609/http://www.escommw.com/generation.php |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power generation is however not meeting demand and [[rolling blackout]]s are scheduled routinely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">The Euler [[pump]] and [[turbine]] equations are the most fundamental equations in the field of [[turbo-machinery|turbomachinery]]. These equations govern the power, efficiencies and other factors that contribute to the design of turbomachines. With the help of these equations the [[Hydraulic head|head]] developed by a pump and the head utilised by a turbine can be easily determined. As the name suggests these equations were formulated by [[Leonhard Euler]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Euler (1752) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_60EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Maximes pour arranger le plus avantageusement les machines destinées à élever de l'eau par moyen des pompes"] (Maxims for arranging most advantageously machines intended to raise water by means of pumps), ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles Lettres à Berlin'', '''8''' : 185-232.  Here, Euler presents his results for maximizing the outputs of windmills and water wheels, among other means of powering pumps.
*  Euler (1754) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ypFYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Théorie plus complette des machines qui sont mises en mouvement par la réaction de l'eau"] (More complete theory of machines that are set in motion by reaction with water), ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles Lettres à Berlin'', '''10''' :  227-295.  An analysis of [[Segner wheel|Segner's wheel]].
*  Euler (1756) [https://books.google.com/books?id=60x1VYMxKMUC&amp;pg=PA166-IA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Recherches plus exactes sur l'effect des moulins à vent"] (More exact research on the effect [i.e., work output] of windmills), ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles Lettres à Berlin'', '''12''' :  166-234.&lt;/ref&gt; These equations can be derived from the moment of momentum equation when applied for a pump or a turbine.

== Conservation of angular momentum ==
A consequence of [[ Newton's second law]] of mechanics is the conservation of the [[angular momentum]] (or the “moment of momentum”) which is fundamental to all turbomachines. Accordingly, the change of the angular momentum is equal to the sum of the external moments. Angular momentums ρ×Q×r×cu at inlet and outlet, an external torque M and friction moments due to [[shear stress]]es Mτ act on an [[impeller]] or a diffuser.

Since no pressure forces are created on cylindrical surfaces in the circumferential direction, it is possible to write:

:::&lt;math&gt;M + Mr = \rho \cdot Q (c_{2u} r_2 - c_{1u} r_1) &lt;/math&gt; (1.13)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Johann Friedrich Gülich
|title=Centrifugal Pumps
|edition = 2nd
|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]
|location = Berlin
|isbn = 978-3-642-12823-3
|year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{2u}=c_2\cos\alpha_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{1u}=c_1\cos\alpha_1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Velocity triangles==

[[File:Euler-turbinaegyenlethez.svg|650px]]

The color triangles formed by velocity vectors u,c and w are called velocity triangles and are helpful in explaining how pumps work.

:&lt;math&gt;c_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are the absolute velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;w_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are the relative velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;u_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are the velocities of the blade at the inlet and outlet respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;\omega &lt;/math&gt; is angular velocity. 

'a' and 'b' show impellers with backward and forward-curved vanes respectively.

== Euler's pump equation ==
Based on Eq.(1.13), Euler developed the equation for the pressure head created by an impeller:

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_{th} = H_t \cdot g = c_{2u} u_2 - c_{1u} u_1 &lt;/math&gt;     (1)

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_{th}=1/2(u_2^2-u_1^2+w_1^2-w_2^2+c_2^2-c_1^2)&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Y&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; : theoretical specific supply ; H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;  : theoretical  head pressure  ;    g : gravitational acceleration

For the case of a [[pelton turbine]] the static component of the head is 
zero, hence the equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;
H = {1 \over {2g}} ( V_1^2 - V_2^2 ). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==

Euler’s pump and turbine equations can be used to predict the effect that
changing the impeller geometry has on the head. Qualitative estimations can 
be made from the impeller geometry about the performance of the 
turbine/pump.

[[File:Simmering (Wien) - Gasometer (1).JPG|thumb|300px|Gasometer Vienna]]
[[File:Gasometer-hyblerpark-2001.jpg|thumb|300px|Southside of gasometer Vienna]]
The '''Gasometers''' in [[Vienna]] are four former [[Gasometer|gas tanks]], each of 90,000&amp;nbsp;m³ storage capacity, built as part of the Vienna municipal gas works ''Gaswerk Simmering'' in 1896&amp;ndash;1899. They are located in the 11th district, [[Simmering (Vienna)|Simmering]]. They were used from 1899 to 1984 as gas storage tanks. After the changeover from [[town gas]] to [[natural gas]] between 1969 and 1978, they were no longer used and were shut down. Only the brick exterior front walls were preserved.  The structures have found new residential and commercial use in modern times.

==History==
The Gasometers were built from 1896 to 1899 in the [[Simmering (Vienna)|Simmering]] district of [[Vienna]] near the ''Gaswerk Simmering'' gas works of the district. The containers were used to help supply Vienna with [[town gas]], facilities which had previously been provided by the English firm Inter Continental Gas Association (ICGA). Once the contracts with the ICGA expired, the city decided to construct facilities to handle its own gas needs. At the time, the design was the largest in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/de/geschichte/1892-planung-des-gaswerk-simmerings |title=1892 Planung des Gaswerkes Simmering |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gasometers were retired in 1984 due to new technologies in gasometer construction, as well as the city's conversion from [[town gas]] and [[coal gas]] to [[natural gas]]. Gas can be stored underground or in modern high-pressure gas storage spheres under much higher pressures and in smaller volumes than the relatively large gasometers. In 1978, they were designated as protected historic landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/en/history |title=History of the Gasometers |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna undertook a remodelling and revitalization of the protected monuments and in 1995 called for ideas for the new use of the structures. The chosen designs by the architects [[Jean Nouvel]] (Gasometer A), [[Coop Himmelblau]] (Gasometer B), [[Manfred Wehdorn]] (Gasometer C) and [[Wilhelm Holzbauer]] (Gasometer D) were completed between 1999 and 2001. Each gasometer was divided into several zones for living (apartments in the top), working (offices in the middle floors) and entertainment and shopping (shopping malls in the ground floors). The shopping mall levels in each gasometer are connected to the others by skybridges. The historic exterior wall was conserved. One of the ideas rejected for the project was the plan by architect Manfred Wehdorn to use the Gasometers for hotels and facilities for the planned [[World Expo]] in Vienna and Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/en/gasometer |title=The Architecture of the Gasometers |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2001, the mayor attended the official grand opening of the Gasometers, but people had begun moving in as early as May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/de/geschichte/1999-die-revitalisierung-der-gasometer |title=1999 Die Revitalisierung der Gasometer |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gasometers are four [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] telescopic gas containers, each with a volume of about 90,000 m³ seated in a water basin; each is enclosed by a red-brick facade. They are each 70 meters tall and 60 meters in diameter. The Gasometers were gutted during the remodelling and only the brick exterior and parts of the roof were left standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/de/technik |title=Technik der Gasometer und des Gaswerks |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coal gas]] was dry-distilled from coal and was stored in these containers before it was distributed into the city gas network. The "[[town gas]]" was originally used only by the street lamps, but in 1910, its use for cooking and heating in private homes was introduced.

==Today==
Indoor facilities include a music hall (capacity 2000&amp;ndash;3000 people), [[movie theatre]], student [[dormitory]], municipal archive, and so on. There are about 800 apartments (two thirds within the historic brick walls) with 1600 regular tenants, as well as about 70 student apartments with 250 students in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/de/geschichte/2001-die-gasometer-mit-neuer-funktion |title=2001 Die neuen Gasometer |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Gravitic density meter''' is a type of [[density meter]] used in multiple industries to measure the [[density]] of a [[slurry]] flowing through a pipe line. It consists of a flexible rubber hose that deflects when weight is flowing through the hose. A displacement measurement device, usually a high precision laser or load cell, is used to measure how much change has occurred in the system. 
By calculating the change of deflection of the hose, a gravitic density meter can be used to 
find the real time, continuous density.

Gravitic density meters do not measure the [[specific gravity]] directly. The specific gravity is 
calculated after the density has been measured.

==Components==

A gravitic density meter has multiple components.

An [[resistance thermometer|resistance temperature detector (RTD)]] is used to acquire 
temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A [[pressure

sensor|pressure transducer]] is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the 
rigidity of the flexible hose. Changes in rigidity affect the way that the flexible hose 
deflects. The flexible hose is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more 
deflection in the flexible rubber hose. The flexible hose must be repeatable, accurate, and 
precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.

Insulation is used to protect the flexible cartridge as well as isolate the flexible 
cartridge from the effects of ambient temperature. Large differentials between the ambient 
temperature and media temperature cause the flexible cartridge to behave differently than 
what is normal. The displacement measurement device needs to have a fast response time. A 
fast response results in more data which can be used to compensate for vibration. 
Gravitic density meters measure the entire volume inside the flexible cartridge. This makes 
the sample size very large. This large sample size leads to measurements that reflect the 
entire sample, because the entire sample is going to go through the hose.

==Industries==

'''Gravitic density meters''' have many uses in many different industries. Mining, dredging, 
wastewater, paper, and oil and gas all make use of gravitic density meters. All these 
industries need to measure the amount of solids moving through its respective process.

Mining industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of ore being transported.

Dredging industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of debris being moved 
and carried by the dredge.

Wastewater industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of sewage that needs 
to be treated.

Paper production uses gravitic density meters to measure the amount of pulp currently being 
used in the process.

Oil and gas use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of oil and gas in the system. 
This case exemplifies the versatility of gravitic density meters because oil and gas are 
lighter than water.

The '''HVDC Gezhouba–Shanghai''' is a [[high voltage direct current]] [[electric power transmission]] system between [[Gezhouba Dam|Gezhouba]] and [[Nanqiao]] near [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] put in service in 1989. The [[Bipolar electricity transmission|bipolar]] {{convert|1046|km|adj=on}} line is rated at 500&amp;nbsp;kV and a maximum power of 1,200&amp;nbsp;MW.

Between 2008 and 2011 the towers of the most part of the line, which were almost guyed towers capable of carrying two conductors were replaced by new free-standing line towers for 4 conductors in order to install the conductors for the HVDC Hubei-Shanghai on them. This 970 km long line, which is also a bipolar HVDC with an operating voltage of 500 kV runs from Jingmen to Fenjing and has a transmission capacity of 3000 MW.

HVDC Hubei-Shanghei shares also the grounding electrode of HVDC Gezhouba–Shanghai for the Nanqiao terminal. In most parts of its length, the electrode line of HVDC Gezhouba–Shanghai carries also the electrode line of HVDC Hubei-Shanghei. HVDC Gezhouba–Shanghai carries between Fenjing and Nanqiao also the electrode line of HVDC Hubei-Shanghei in most part of its length on its towers.

The grounding electrode of HVDC Hubei-Shanghai at Chujiahu is also used by [[HVDC Three Gorges-Changzhou]].

In [[particle physics]], a '''hadron''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-hadron.ogg|ˈ|h|æ|d|r|ɒ|n}} ({{lang-el|ἁδρός}}, ''hadrós;'' "stout, thick") is a [[composite particle]] made of two or more [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]] in a similar way as [[molecule]]s are held together by the [[electromagnetic force]]. Most of the mass of ordinary matter comes from two hadrons, the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]].

Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s, made of an odd number of [[quark]]s – usually three quarks – and [[meson]]s, made of an even number of quarks—usually one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]].&lt;ref name="Gell-Mann 1964"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9163(64)92001-3 |bibcode=1964PhL.....8..214G |title=A schematic model of baryons and mesons |journal=Physics Letters |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=214–215 |last1=Gell-Mann |first1=M. |year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s are examples of baryons; [[pion]]s are an example of a meson. [[Exotic hadrons|"Exotic" hadrons]], containing more than three valence quarks, have been discovered in recent years. A [[tetraquark]] state (an [[exotic meson]]), named the [[Z(4430)]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, was discovered in 2007 by the [[Belle experiment|Belle Collaboration]]&lt;ref&gt;

Almost all "free" hadrons and antihadrons (meaning, in isolation and not bound within an [[atomic nucleus]]) are believed to be [[particle decay|unstable]] and eventually decay (break down) into other particles. The only known exception relates to free protons, which are [[Proton decay|''possibly'' stable]], or at least, take immense amounts of time to decay (order of 10&lt;sup&gt;34+&lt;/sup&gt; years). Free neutrons are unstable [[free neutron decay|and decay]] with a [[half-life]] of about 611 seconds. Their respective [[antiparticle]]s are expected to follow the same pattern, but they are difficult to capture and study, because they immediately annihilate on contact with ordinary matter. "Bound" protons and neutrons, contained within an [[atomic nucleus]], are generally considered stable. Experimentally, hadron physics is studied by [[High_energy_nuclear_physics|colliding protons or nuclei of heavy elements]] such as lead or gold, and detecting the debris in the produced particle showers. In the environment, mesons such as [[pion]]s are produced by the collisions of [[cosmic ray]]s with the atmosphere.

==Etymology==
The term "hadron" was introduced by [[Lev B. Okun]] in a [[plenary talk]] at the 1962 [[International Conference on High Energy Physics]].&lt;ref name="okun"&gt;
{{cite conference
 |author=Lev B. Okun

 |title=The Theory of Weak Interaction
 |booktitle=Proceedings of 1962 International Conference on High-Energy Physics at CERN

 |page=845
 |bibcode=1962hep..conf..845O
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this talk he said:

{{bquote|Notwithstanding the fact that this report deals with weak interactions, we shall frequently have to speak of strongly interacting particles. These particles pose not only numerous scientific problems, but also a terminological problem. The point is that "strongly interacting  particles" is a very clumsy term which does not yield  itself to the formation of an adjective. For this reason, to take but one instance, decays into strongly interacting particles are called non-[[leptonic]]. This definition is not exact because "non-leptonic" may also signify "photonic". In this report I shall call strongly interacting particles "hadrons", and the corresponding decays "hadronic" (the Greek ''ἁδρός'' signifies "large", "massive", in contrast to ''λεπτός'' which means "small", "light"). I hope that this terminology will prove to be convenient. }}

==Properties==

According to the [[quark model]],&lt;ref name="Quark model"&gt;
{{Cite journal
 |author=C. Amsler et al. ([[Particle Data Group]])
 |year=2008
 |title=Review of Particle Physics – Quark Model
 |url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/quarkmodrpp.pdf
 |journal=[[Physics Letters B]]
 |volume=667 |issue=1
 |pages=1–6
 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.018
|bibcode = 2008PhLB..667....1A }}&lt;/ref&gt; the properties of hadrons are primarily determined by their so-called ''[[valence quark]]s''. For example, a [[proton]] is composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with [[electric charge]] +{{frac|2|3}}, for a total of +{{frac|4|3}} together) and one [[down quark]] (with electric charge −{{frac|1|3}}). Adding these together yields the proton charge of +1. Although quarks also carry [[color charge]], hadrons must have zero total color charge because of a phenomenon called [[color confinement]]. That is, hadrons must be "colorless" or "white". The simplest ways for this to occur are with a quark of one color and an [[antiparticle|antiquark]] of the corresponding anticolor, or three quarks of different colors. Hadrons with the first arrangement are a type of [[meson]], and those with the second arrangement are a type of [[baryon]].

Massless virtual gluons compose the numerical majority of particles inside hadrons. The strength of the [[strong force]] [[gluon]]s which bind the quarks together has sufficient energy (''E'') to have resonances composed of massive (''m'') quarks ([[Mass–energy equivalence|''E &gt; mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'']]) . One outcome is that short-lived pairs of [[virtual particle|virtual quarks and antiquarks]] are continually forming and vanishing again inside a hadron. Because the virtual quarks are not stable wave packets (quanta), but an irregular and transient phenomenon, it is not meaningful to ask which quark is real and which virtual; only the small excess is apparent from the outside in the form of a hadron. Therefore when a hadron or anti-hadron is stated to consist of (typically) 2 or 3 quarks, this technically refers to the constant excess of quarks vs. antiquarks.

Like all [[subatomic particle]]s, hadrons are assigned [[quantum number]]s corresponding to the [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Poincaré group]]: ''J&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt;''(''m''), where ''J'' is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] quantum number, ''P'' the intrinsic parity (or [[Parity (physics)|P-parity]]), ''C'' the charge conjugation (or [[C-parity]]), and ''m'' the particle's [[mass]]. Note that the mass of a hadron has very little to do with the mass of its valence quarks; rather, due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], most of the mass comes from the large amount of energy associated with the [[strong interaction]]. Hadrons may also carry [[flavour quantum number|flavor quantum numbers]] such as [[isospin]] ([[G&amp;nbsp;parity]]), and [[strangeness]]. All quarks carry an additive, conserved quantum number called a [[baryon number]] (''B''), which is +{{frac|1|3}} for quarks and −{{frac|1|3}} for antiquarks. This means that baryons (composite particles made of three, five or a larger odd number of quarks) have ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 whereas mesons have ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Hadrons have [[excited state]]s known as [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]]. Each [[ground state]] hadron may have several excited states; several hundreds of resonances have been observed in experiments. Resonances decay extremely quickly (within about 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; [[second]]s) via the strong nuclear force.

In other [[phase (matter)|phases]] of [[matter]] the hadrons may disappear.  For example, at very high temperature and high pressure, unless there are sufficiently many flavors of quarks, the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) predicts that quarks and [[gluon]]s will no longer be confined within hadrons, "because the [[coupling constant|strength]] of the strong interaction [[coupling constant#Running coupling|diminishes with energy]]". This property, which is known as [[asymptotic freedom]], has been experimentally confirmed in the energy range between 1 [[GeV]] (gigaelectronvolt) and 1 [[TeV]] (teraelectronvolt).&lt;ref name="Bethke"&gt;

All [[free particle|free]] hadrons [[proton decay|except (possibly) the proton and antiproton]] are [[Exponential decay|unstable]].

==Baryons==
{{Main article|Baryon|Exotic baryon}}

[[Baryon]]s are hadrons containing an odd number of valence quarks (at least 3).&lt;ref name="Gell-Mann 1964" /&gt; Most well known baryons such as the [[proton]] and [[neutron]] have three valence quarks, but [[pentaquark]]s with five quarks – three quarks of different colors, and also one extra quark-antiquark pair – have also been proven to exist. Because baryons have an odd number of quarks, they are also all [[fermion]]s, ''i.e.'', they have half-integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. As quarks possess [[baryon number]] ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}, baryons have baryon number ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. 

Each type of baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon) in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, just as a proton is made of two up-quarks and one down-quark, its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up-antiquarks and one down-antiquark.

As of August 2015, there are two known pentaquarks, {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4380)}} and {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4450)}}, both discovered in 2015 by the [[LHCb]] collaboration.&lt;ref name="LHCb2015" /&gt;

==Mesons==
{{Main article|Meson|Exotic meson}}
[[Meson]]s are hadrons containing an even number of valence quarks (at least 2).&lt;ref name="Gell-Mann 1964"/&gt; Most well known mesons are composed of a quark-antiquark pair, but possible [[tetraquark]]s (4 quarks) and [[hexaquark]]s (6 quarks, comprising either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs) may have been discovered and are being investigated to confirm their nature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/06/four-quark-particle Mysterious Subatomic Particle May Represent Exotic New Form of Matter]&lt;/ref&gt; Several other hypothetical types of [[exotic meson]] may exist which do not fall within the quark model of classification. These include [[glueball]]s and [[hybrid meson]]s (mesons bound by excited [[gluon]]s).

Because mesons have an even number of quarks, they are also all [[boson]]s, with integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]], ''i.e.'', 0, 1, or −1. They have baryon number ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}} − {{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Examples of mesons commonly produced in particle physics experiments include [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s. Pions also play a role in holding [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] together via the [[residual strong force]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">'''Hadron spectroscopy''' is the subfield of [[particle physics]] that studies the masses and decays of [[hadrons]]. Hadron spectroscopy is also an important part of the new nuclear physics. The properties of hadrons are a consequence of a theory called [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).

QCD predicts that [[quark]]s and antiquarks bind into particles called [[meson]]s. Another type of hadron is called a [[baryon]], that is made of three quarks. There is good experimental evidence for both mesons and baryons. Potentially QCD also has bound states of just [[gluon]]s called [[glueballs]]. One of the goals of the field of hadronic spectroscopy is to find experimental evidence for [[exotic meson]]s, [[tetraquark]]s, molecules of hadrons, and [[glueballs]].

An important part of the field of hadronic spectroscopy are the attempts to solve QCD. The properties of hadrons require the solution of QCD in the strong coupling regime, where perturbative techniques based on [[Feynman diagram]]s do not work. There are several approaches to trying to solve QCD to compute the masses of hadrons:

Tyrrell Rockafellar |first=R. Tyrrell |last=Rockafellar |authorlink2=Roger J-B Wets |first2=Roger J-B |last2=Wets |title=Variational Analysis |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2005 |isbn=3-540-62772-3 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; measures how far two [[subset]]s of a [[metric space]] are from each other. It turns the set of [[non-empty set|non-empty]] [[compact space|compact]] subsets of a metric space into a metric space in its own right. It is named after [[Felix Hausdorff]].

Informally, two sets are close in the Hausdorff distance if every point of either set is close to some point of the other set. The Hausdorff distance is the longest distance you can be forced to travel by an adversary who chooses a point in one of the two sets, from where you then must travel to the other set. In other words, it is the greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set.

It seems that this distance was first introduced by Hausdorff in his book ''[[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]]'', first published in 1914, although a very close relative appeared in the doctoral thesis of [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]] in 1906, in his study of the space of all continuous curves from &lt;math&gt;[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
[[Image:Hausdorff distance sample.svg|thumb|250px|right|Components of the calculation of the Hausdorff distance between the green line ''X'' and the blue line ''Y''.]]

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two non-empty subsets of a metric space (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''d''). We define their Hausdorff distance {{nowrap|''d''&lt;sub&gt; H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''Y'')}} by

: &lt;math&gt; d_{\mathrm H}(X,Y) = \max\{\,\sup_{x \in X} \inf_{y \in Y} d(x,y),\, \sup_{y \in Y} \inf_{x \in X} d(x,y)\,\}\mbox{,} \! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''sup'' represents the [[supremum]] and ''inf'' the [[infimum]].

Equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;d_H(X,Y) = \inf\{\epsilon \geq 0\,;\ X \subseteq Y_\epsilon \ \mbox{and}\ Y \subseteq X_\epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munkres |first=James |title=Topology |edition=2nd |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-181629-2 |pages=280–281 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XjoZAQAAIAAJ |page=280 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; X_\epsilon := \bigcup_{x \in X} \{z \in M\,;\ d(z,x) \leq \epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt; ,

that is, the set of all points within &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-fattening of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; or a generalized [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;).

===Remark===

It is not true in general that if &lt;math&gt; d_H(X,Y) = \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt; X\subseteq Y_\epsilon \ \mbox{and} \ Y\subseteq X_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; .

For instance, consider the metric space of the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; induced by the absolute value,

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) := |y - x|, \quad x,y \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; .

Take

:&lt;math&gt;X := (0, 1] \quad \mbox{and} \quad Y := [-1,0) &lt;/math&gt; .

Then &lt;math&gt;d_H(X,Y) = 1\ &lt;/math&gt;. However &lt;math&gt;X \nsubseteq Y_1&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;Y_1 = [-2,1)\ &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;1 \in X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
*In general, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''Y'') may be infinite. If both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[bounded set|bounded]], then ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''Y'') is guaranteed to be finite.
*''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''Y'') = 0 if and only if ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same closure.
*For every point ''x'' of ''M'' and any non-empty sets ''Y'', ''Z'' of ''M'': ''d''(''x'',''Y'') ≤ ''d''(''x'',''Z'') + ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'',''Z''), where  ''d''(''x'',''Y'') is the distance between the point ''x'' and the closest point in the set ''Y''.
*|diameter(''Y'')-diameter(''X'')| ≤ 2 ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''Y'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/375296/diameter-and-hausdorff-distance Diameter and Hausdorff Distance], Math.SE&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the intersection ''X''∩''Y'' has a non-empty interior, then there exists a constant ''r''&gt;0, such that every set ''X′'' whose Hausdorff distance from ''X'' is less than ''r'' also intersects ''Y''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/732850/hausdorff-distance-and-intersection Hausdorff Distance and Intersection], Math.SE&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the set of all non-empty subsets of ''M'',  ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; yields an extended [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]].
*On the set ''F''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'', ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is a metric.
**If ''M'' is [[complete metric space|complete]], then so is ''F''(''M'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Completeness and total boundedness of the Hausdorff metric |first=Jeff |last=Henrikson |journal=MIT Undergraduate Journal of Mathematics |year=1999 |pages=69–80 |url=http://www-math.mit.edu/phase2/UJM/vol1/HAUSF.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020623095720/http://www-math.mit.edu/phase2/UJM/vol1/HAUSF.PDF |archivedate=June 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''([[Blaschke selection theorem]])'' If ''M'' is compact, then so is ''F''(''M'').
**The [[topological space|topology]] of ''F''(''M'') depends only on the topology of ''M'', not on the metric ''d''.

==Motivation==
The definition of the Hausdorff distance can be derived by a series of natural extensions of the distance function ''d''(''x'', ''y'') in the underlying metric space ''M'', as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Barnsley
  | first = Michael
  | authorlink = Michael Barnsley
  | title = Fractals Everywhere
  | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann
  | year = 1993
  | pages = Ch. II.6
  | isbn = 0-12-079069-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*Define a distance function between any point ''x'' of ''M'' and any non-empty set ''Y'' of ''M'' by:

::&lt;math&gt;d(x,Y)=\inf \{ d(x,y) | y \in Y \}\ &lt;/math&gt;.

:For example, ''d''(1, {3,6}) = 2 and ''d''(7, {3,6}) = 1.

*Define a distance function between any two non-empty sets ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''M'' by:

::&lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)=\sup \{ d(x,Y) | x \in X \}\ &lt;/math&gt;.

:For example, ''d''({1,7}, {3,6}) = sup{''d''(1, {3,6}), d(7,{3,6})} = sup{d(1,3), d(7,6)} = 2.

*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are compact then ''d''(''X'',''Y'') will be finite; ''d''(''X'',''X'')=0; and ''d'' inherits the [[triangle inequality]] property from the distance function in ''M''. As it stands,  ''d''(''X'',''Y'') is ''not'' a metric because ''d''(''X'',''Y'') is not always symmetric, and {{nowrap|1=''d''(''X'',''Y'') = 0}} does not imply that {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''Y''}} (It does imply that  &lt;math&gt; X \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;). For example, {{nowrap|1=''d''({1,3,6,7}, {3,6}) = 2}}, but {{nowrap|1=''d''({3,6}, {1,3,6,7}) = 0}}. However, we can create a metric by defining the '''Hausdorff distance''' to be:

::&lt;math&gt;d_{\mathrm H}(X,Y) = \max\{d(X,Y),d(Y,X) \} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
In [[computer vision]], the Hausdorff distance can be used to find a given template in an arbitrary target image. The template and image are often pre-processed via an [[Edge detection|edge detector]] giving a [[binary image]]. Next, each 1 (activated) point in the binary image of the template is treated as a point in a set, the "shape" of the template. Similarly, an area of the binary target image is treated as a set of points. The algorithm then tries to minimize the Hausdorff distance between the template and some area of the target image. The area in the target image with the minimal Hausdorff distance to the template, can be considered the best candidate for locating the template in the target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/vision/hausdorff/hausmatch.html Hausdorff-Based Matching&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[computer graphics]] the Hausdorff distance is used to measure the difference between two different representations of the same 3D object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Cignoni |first2=C. |last2=Rocchini |first3=R. |last3=Scopigno |title=Metro: Measuring Error on Simplified Surfaces |journal=Computer Graphics Forum |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=167–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when generating [[level of detail]] for efficient display of complex 3D models.

==Related concepts==
A measure for the dissimilarity of two [[shapes]] is given by ''Hausdorff distance up to isometry'', denoted ''D''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Namely, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two compact figures in a metric space ''M'' (usually a [[Euclidean space]]); then ''D''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''Y'') is the infimum of ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''X''),''Y'') along all [[isometry|isometries]] ''I'' of the metric space ''M'' to itself. This distance measures how far the shapes ''X'' and ''Y'' are from being isometric.

The [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence]] is a related idea: we measure the distance of two metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' by taking the infimum of ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''M''),''J''(''N'')) along all isometric embeddings ''I'':''M''→''L'' and ''J'':''N''→''L'' into some common metric space ''L''.

== History ==
[[File:Hitachi old logo2.gif|thumb|Former Hitachi logo (1968–1992)]]
Hitachi was founded in 1910 by electrical engineer [[Namihei Odaira]] in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.hitachi-solutions.com/miraibio/blog/little-known-facts-about-hitachi|title=Little Known Facts About Hitachi|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's first product was Japan's first {{convert|5|hp|kW|order=flip|adj=on|0}} [[induction motor]], initially developed for use in [[copper mining]].  Odaira's company soon became the domestic leader in [[electric motor]]s and [[electric power industry]] infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitachi.com/about/corporate/history |title=History (1910–1959) : Hitachi Global |publisher=Hitachi.com |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began as an in-house venture of [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]]'s mining company in [[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]. Odaira moved headquarters to [[Tokyo]] in 1918. Long before that, he coined the company’s [[toponymic]] name by superimposing two ''[[kanji]]'' characters: '''''hi''''' meaning “sun” and '''''tachi''''' meaning “rise”. The young company's national aspirations were conveyed by its original brand mark, which evoked Japan's imperial [[rising sun flag]].

World War II and its aftermath devastated the company. Many of its factories were destroyed by Allied bombing raids, and after the war, American occupational forces tried to disband Hitachi altogether. Founder Odaira was removed from the company. Nevertheless, as a result of three years of negotiations, Hitachi was permitted to maintain all but 19 of its manufacturing plants.  The cost of such a production shutdown, though, compounded by a three-month labor strike in 1950, severely hindered Hitachi's reconstruction efforts.  Only the [[Korean War]] saved the company from complete collapse. Hitachi and many other struggling Japanese industrial firms benefited from defense contracts offered by the American military. Meanwhile, Hitachi went public in 1949.[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hitachi-ltd-history/]

Hitachi America, Ltd. was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/about/corporate/history/index.html|title=History (1910–1959)|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Hitachi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitachi Europe, Ltd. was established in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/about/corporate/history/1980.html|title=History (1980–1999)|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Hitachi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107035130/http://hitachi.com/about/corporate/history/1980.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Hitachi agreed to sell its [[hard disk drive]] subsidiary, [[HGST]], to [[Western Digital]] (WD) for a combination of cash and shares worth US$4.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2381551,00.asp|title=WD to Buy Hitachi's Drive Business for $4.3 Billion|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=PC Magazine| date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns of a duopoly of WD and [[Seagate Technology]] by the EU Commission and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], Hitachi's 3.5" HDD division was sold to [[Toshiba]].  The transaction was completed in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2186667/data-center/western-digital-closes-hitachi-gst-acquisition--to-operate-separate-subsidiaries.html|title=Western Digital Closes Hitachi GST Acquisition, to Operate Separate Subsidiaries|accessdate=2014-09-01|publisher=Network World| date=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yamate Works, the oldest of the three factories, was founded in 1910 by [[Namihei Odaira]] as an electrical equipment repair and manufacturing facility. This facility was named Hitachi, after the Hitachi Mine near [[Hitachi, Ibaraki]], and is regarded as the ancestral home of Hitachi, Ltd.

Many management trainees intern at Hitachi Works before being permanently assigned to other Hitachi divisions. Senior management personnel are often participants in [[job rotation|rotations]] at Hitachi Works for a few years as their career develops towards eventual head office stature. As a result, many of the senior managers of Hitachi Ltd have passed through Hitachi Works.

[[Corporate spin-off|Spin-off]] entities from Hitachi Works include [[Hitachi Cable]] (1956) and [[Hitachi Canadian Industries]] (1988).

Hitachi Printing Systems was established in 1980 and was acquired by [[Ricoh]] in 2004, becoming Ricoh Printing Systems, Ltd.

==== TELK (Transformers and Electricals Kerala Ltd.) ====
Hitachi had a joint venture with Kerala public sector company TELK from 1963 to 1989 for the production of electrical equipment. In collaboration with Hitachi, TELK was the first company to manufacture 400kV transformers in India. TELK transformers are well known for their quality and are in great demand for the Indian power system.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
In August 2011, it was announced that Hitachi would donate an electron microscope to each of five universities in Indonesia (the [[University of North Sumatra]] in [[Medan]], the [[Universitas Kristen Indonesia|Indonesian Christian University]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Padjadjaran University]] in [[Bandung]], [[Jenderal Soedirman University|General Soedirman University]] in [[Purwokerto]] and [[Muhammadiyah]] University in [[Malang]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/05/hitachi-grant-electron-microscopes.html|title=Hitachi to grant electron microscopes|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Pelosse, the United Arab Emirates, the host country of the IRENA, asked France to make her resign because she made a gender parity a priority of the IRENA. She also accused UAE authorities of intimidation by intruding into her home, bugging her phone and office, and searching her baggage.&lt;ref name=lemonde291010/&gt;&lt;ref name=vandegraaf&gt;

'''Linea Aeropostal Flight 253''' was being operated by a [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation]], registration YV-C-AMA, on an international scheduled passenger service that took off from [[Idlewild International Airport]] bound for [[Caracas International Airport]] on November 27, 1956. Flight 253, operated by a Constellation, named ''Jose Marti'' being piloted by a French Captain named Marcel Combalbert, crashed into a mountain near [[Caracas]] [[Venezuela]]. All 25 passengers and crew on board were killed.

==Crash== 

Flight 253 was flying through a rainstorm as it approached Caracas Airport. It was approximately 18 kilometers from the runway, when the aircraft struck the southern ridge of Cerro El Ávila at 6700 feet altitude.

Ten Americans were among those killed in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kTNQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DVYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6013,3163001|title=Ten Americans dead in crash|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|page=1|agency=AP|date=1956-11-28|location=Victoria, TX|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Charlie Peete]], his wife Nettie, and their three small children were among the victims. Peete was traveling to Venezuela in order to play winter ball there.

==Aftermath and cause==

Cable cars were used in the recovery of bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OwhHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n_IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2794,2872509|title=Recover all bodies from Caracas wreck|newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal|location=Lewiston-Auburn, ME|agency=AP|page=9|date=1956-11-28|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probable cause of the crash was determined to be: "The instrument flight training manuals show that the Linea Aeropostal Venezolana has approved a procedure for entering Maiquetia in semi-IFR conditions. This procedure consists in maintaining a minimum flight level of 10000ft as far as the station (Miq 292.5), then turning north over this pount and continuing on a 360deg heading for 4 minutes followed by a standard let-down to 1200ft above sea level until contact is established, and a return to the aerodrome under VFR. It is obvious that the pilot-in-command did not fully comply with this procedure, and, after accumulating errors in estimating his speed, endeavoured to make a direct approach which proved fatal because his altitude at the time of his last report was insufficient to cross the Avila mountain range against which the impact occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19561127-0|title=Lockheed L-749-79 Constellation YV-C-AMA Caracas Airport|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lubiprostone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]], marketed under the trade name '''Amitiza''' among others) is a [[medication]] used in the management of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[idiopathic]] [[constipation]], predominantly [[irritable bowel syndrome]]-associated constipation in women and [[opioid-induced constipation]].

It was initially approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2006 and recommended for use in the UK by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/1-gastro-intestinal-system/16-laxatives/167-other-drugs-used-in-constipation#PHP34865|title=Lubiprostone for treating chronic idiopathic constipation - Technology appraisal guidance [TA318]|last=|first=|date=23 July 2014|website=NICE|access-date=13 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expensive as of 2017, with the cost to the [[National Health Service|NHS]] being £29.68 per 24mg 28-cap pack as of April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/1-gastro-intestinal-system/16-laxatives/167-other-drugs-used-in-constipation/lubiprostone|title=LUBIPROSTONE - Other drugs used in constipation|last=|first=|date=2014|website=British National Formulary|access-date=13 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Lubiprostone is used for the treatment of chronic [[constipation]] of unknown cause in adults, as well as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] associated with constipation in women.&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Amitiza|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/amitiza.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubiprostone is approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults.

Lubiprostone is also approved to treat [[opioid]]-induced constipation, in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. The effectiveness of lubiprostone has not been established in patients who are taking a diphenylheptane opioid (e.g., methadone).

Lubiprostone is approved to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in women 18 years of age and older.

As of 12 November 2014, lubiprostone has not been studied in children. There is current research underway to determine the safety and efficacy in postoperative bowel dysfunction.

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials, the most common adverse event was [[nausea]] (31%). Other adverse events (≥5% of patients) included [[diarrhea]] (13%), [[headache]] (13%), [[Abdominal distension|abdominal distention]] (5%), [[abdominal pain]] (5%), [[flatulence]] (6%), [[sinusitis]] (5%) [[vomiting]] (5%) and [[fecal incontinence]] (1%).

===Contraindications===
There are no current data on use in people with liver or kidney complications. The effects on pregnancy have not been studied in humans but testing in Guinea pigs resulted in fetal loss. 
Amitiza is not approved for use in children.  Lubiprostone is contraindicated in patients exhibiting chronic [[diarrhea]], [[bowel obstruction]], or diarrhea-predominant [[irritable bowel syndrome]].

==Mechanism of action==
Lubiprostone is a bicyclic [[fatty acid]] derived from [[prostaglandin E1]] that acts by specifically activating [[CLCN2|ClC-2 chloride channels]] on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal [[epithelial]] cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).

Symptoms of constipation such as pain and bloating are usually improved within one week, and SBM may occur within one day.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Unlike many [[laxative]] products, lubiprostone does not show signs of [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[Chemical dependency|dependency]], or altered serum [[electrolyte]] concentration. There was no rebound effect following withdrawal of treatment, but a gradual return to pre-treatment bowel movement frequency should be expected.

Minimal distribution of the drug occurs beyond the immediate gastrointestinal tissues. Lubiprostone is rapidly metabolized by [[redox|reduction]]/[[oxidation]], mediated by [[carbonyl reductase]]. There is no metabolic involvement of the hepatic [[cytochrome P450]] system. The measurable metabolite, M3, exists in very low levels in plasma and makes up less than 10% of the total administered dose.

Data indicate that metabolism occurs locally in the [[stomach]] and [[jejunum]].

The '''magic angle''' is a particular value of the collection angle of an [[electron microscope]] at which the measured energy-loss spectrum "magically" becomes independent of the tilt angle of the sample with respect to the [[electron beam|beam]] direction. The magic angle is not uniquely defined for [[isotrope|isotropic]] samples, but the definition is unique in the (typical) case of small angle scattering on materials with a "c-axis", such as [[graphite]].

The "magic" angle depends on both the incoming electron energy (which is typically fixed) and the energy loss suffered by the [[electron]]. The [[ratio]] of the magic angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_M&lt;/math&gt; to the characteristic angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_E&lt;/math&gt; is roughly independent of the energy loss and roughly independent of the particular type of sample considered.

==Mathematical definition==
For the case of a [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] incident electron, the "magic" angle is defined by the equality of two different [[function (mathematics)|functions]]
(denoted below by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) of the collection angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
A(\alpha)=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\alpha^2}dx\frac{x}{(x+\theta_E^2{(1-\beta^2))}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;
C(\alpha)=\theta_E^2{(1-\beta^2)}^2\int_0^{\alpha^2}dx\frac{1}{{(x+\theta_E^2(1-\beta^2))}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the incoming electron divided by the [[speed of light]] (N.B., the symbol &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is also often used in the older literature to denote the collection angle instead of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

Of course, the above [[integral]]s may easily be evaluated in terms of [[elementary function]]s, but they are presented as above because in the above form it is easier to see that the former integral is due to [[momentum transfer]]s which are [[perpendicular]] to the beam direction, whereas the latter is due to momentum transfers [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the beam direction.

Using the above definition, it is then found that
&lt;math&gt;
\theta_M\approx 2\theta_E
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Marx generator''' is an [[electrical circuit]] first described by [[Erwin Otto Marx]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marx |first1=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Otto Marx |title=Versuche über die Prüfung von Isolatoren mit Spanningsstößen |language=de |trans-title=Experiments on the Testing of Insulators using High Voltage Pulses |journal=Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift |issn=0424-0200 &lt;!-- also 0948-7387 --&gt; |oclc=5797229 |date=1924 |volume=25 |issue= |pages=652–654}}. This reference is suspect: the year 1924 and volume 25 do not match; the year 1924 corresponds to volume 45; volume 25 would be too early for Marx. Volker Weiss says 1925 and volume 45 which would also be wrong. Electrical World https://books.google.com/books?id=o3FEAQAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en suggests Marx' Flashover testing article was June 11, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to generate a high-[[voltage]] pulse from a low-voltage DC supply. Marx generators are used in high-energy physics experiments, as well as to simulate the effects of lightning on [[Electric power transmission|power-line gear]] and aviation equipment. A bank of 36 Marx generators is used by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] to generate [[X-rays]] in their [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z Machine]].

==Principle of operation==
The circuit generates a high-voltage pulse by charging a number of capacitors in parallel, then suddenly connecting them in series. See the circuit above. At first, ''n'' [[capacitor]]s (''C'') are charged in parallel to a voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' by a high-voltage DC power supply through the resistors (''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[spark gap]]s used as switches have the voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' across them, but the gaps have a breakdown voltage greater than ''V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', so they all behave as open circuits while the capacitors charge. The last gap isolates the output of the generator from the load; without that gap, the load would prevent the capacitors from charging. To create the output pulse, the first spark gap is caused to break down (triggered); the breakdown effectively shorts the gap, placing the first two capacitors in series, applying a voltage of about 2''V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the second spark gap.&lt;ref&gt;Typical explanation; see, for example, http://www.kronjaeger.com/hv/hv/src/marx/index.html; the issue is more complicated.&lt;!-- body cap --&gt; Another site uses charging inductors instead of resistors: http://hibp.ecse.rpi.edu/~leij/febetron/marx.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the second gap breaks down to add the third capacitor to the "stack", and the process continues to sequentially break down all of the gaps. This process of the spark gaps connecting the capacitors in series to create the high voltage is called ''erection''. The last gap connects the output of the series "stack" of capacitors to the load. Ideally, the output voltage will be ''nV&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', the number of capacitors times the charging voltage, but in practice the value is less. Note that none of the charging resistors ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; are subjected to more than the charging voltage even when the capacitors have been erected. The charge available is limited to the charge on the capacitors, so the output is a brief pulse as the capacitors discharge through the load. At some point, the spark gaps stop conducting, and the high-voltage supply begins charging the capacitors again.

The principle of multiplying voltage by charging capacitors in parallel and discharging them in series is also used in the [[voltage multiplier]] circuit, used to produce high voltages for [[laser printer]]s and [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s, which has similarities to this circuit. The difference is that the voltage multiplier is powered with alternating current and produces a steady DC output voltage, whereas the Marx generator produces a pulse.

==Optimization==
[[Image:coaxial Marx generator.png|thumb|375px|To deliver 5 ns rise time pulses, the Marx generator is often built into a [[coaxial]] [[wave guide]]. The [[spark gap]]s are placed as close as possible together for maximum UV light exchange for minimum jitter. DC HV comes from underneath, pulsed HV leaves at the top into the coaxial line. The double line of spheres in the middle are the spark gaps, all other spheres are to avoid [[corona discharge]]. Blue=water [[capacitor]]. Grey=solid metal. Black= thin wire. The outer conductor also functions as a vessel, so that the gas and the pressure can be optimized.]]

Proper performance depends upon selection of [[capacitor]] and the timing of the discharge. Switching times can be improved by doping of the [[electrode]]s with [[radioactive]] [[isotopes]] [[caesium]] 137 or [[nickel]] 63, and by orienting the spark gaps so that [[ultraviolet]] light from a firing spark gap switch illuminates the remaining open spark gaps.&lt;ref&gt;E. Kuffel, W. S. Zaengl, J. Kuffel ''High voltage engineering: fundamentals'', Newnes, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7506-3634-3}}, pages 63, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Insulation of the high voltages produced is often accomplished by immersing the Marx generator in [[transformer oil]] or a high pressure [[dielectric gas]] such as [[SF6|sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that the less resistance there is between the capacitor and the charging power supply, the faster it will charge. Thus, in this design, those closer to the power supply will charge quicker than those farther away. If the generator is allowed to charge long enough, all capacitors will attain the same voltage.

In the ideal case, the closing of the switch closest to the charging power supply applies a voltage 2''V'' to the second switch. This switch will then close, applying a voltage 3''V'' to the third switch. This switch will then close, resulting in a cascade down the generator that produces ''nV'' at the generator output (again, only in the ideal case).

The first switch may be allowed to spontaneously break down (sometimes called a ''self break'') during charging if the absolute timing of the output pulse is unimportant. However, it is usually intentionally triggered once all the capacitors in the Marx bank have reached full charge, either by reducing the gap distance, by pulsing an additional trigger electrode (such as a [[Trigatron]]), by ionising the air in the gap using a pulsed [[laser]], or by reducing the air pressure within the gap.

The charging resistors, Rc, need to be properly sized for both charging and discharging. They are sometimes replaced with [[inductor]]s for improved efficiency and faster charging. In many generators the resistors are made from plastic or glass tubing filled with dilute [[copper sulfate]] solution. These [[liquid resistor]]s overcome many of the problems experienced by more-conventional solid resistive materials, which have a tendency to lower their resistance over time under high voltage conditions.

== Short pulses ==
The Marx generator is also used to generate short high-power pulses for [[Pockels cell]]s, driving a [[TEA laser]], ignition of the conventional explosive of a nuclear weapon, and radar pulses.

Shortness is relative, as the switching time of even high-speed versions is not less than 1 ns, and thus many low-power electronic devices are faster. In the design of high-speed circuits, electrodynamics is important, and the Marx generator supports this insofar as it uses short thick leads between its components, but the design is nevertheless essentially an electrostatic one. (In electrodynamic terms, when the first stage breaks down it creates a spherical electromagnetic wave whose electric field vector is opposed to the static high voltage. This moving electromagnetic field has the wrong orientation to trigger the next stage, and may even reach the load; such noise in front of the edge is undesirable in many switching applications. If the generator is inside a tube of (say) 1 m diameter, it requires around 10 wave reflections for the field to settle to static conditions, which restricts pulse leading edge width to 30 ns or more. Smaller devices are of course faster.) When the first gap breaks down, pure electrostatic theory predicts that the voltage across all stages rises. However, stages are coupled capacitively to ground and serially to each other, and thus each stage encounters a voltage rise that is increasingly weaker the further the stage is from the switching one; the adjacent stage to the switching one therefore encounters the largest voltage rise, and thus switches in turn. As more stages switch, the voltage rise to the remainder increases, which speeds up their operation. Thus a voltage rise fed into the first stage becomes amplified and steepened at the same time.

The speed of a switch is determined by the speed of the charge carriers, which gets higher with higher voltage, and by the current available to charge the inevitable parasitic capacity. In solid-state avalanche devices, a high voltage automatically leads to high current. Because the high voltage is applied only for a short time, solid-state switches will not heat up excessively. As compensation for the higher voltages encountered, the later stages have to carry lower charge too. Stage cooling and capacitor recharging also go well together.

==Stage variants==
[[Avalanche diode]]s can replace a spark gap for stage voltages less than 500 volts. The charge carriers easily leave the electrodes, so no extra ionisation is needed and jitter is low. The diodes also have a longer lifetime than spark gaps.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

A speedy switching device is an NPN [[avalanche transistor]] fitted with a coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.

== Applications ==
One application is so-called [[boxcar function|boxcar]] switching of a [[Pockels cell]]. Four Marx generators are used, each of the two electrodes of the Pockels cell being connected to a positive pulse generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the Pockels cell into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator. At the trailing edge of the boxcar, the two other generators are fired to "reverse" the cell.

Marx generators are used to provide high-voltage pulses for the testing of insulation of electrical apparatus such as large power [[transformer]]s, or insulators used for supporting power transmission lines. Voltages applied may exceed 2 million volts for high-voltage apparatus.

'''Diamond''' is the [[allotropes of carbon|allotrope of carbon]] in which the [[carbon]] atoms are arranged in the specific type of [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]] called [[diamond cubic]]. [[Diamond]] is an [[optical isotropy|optically isotropic]] [[crystal]] that is transparent to opaque. Diamond is the [[hardness|hardest]] naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's [[fracture toughness|toughness]] is only fair to good. The precise [[tensile strength]] of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] has been observed, and it could be as high as 90–225&amp;nbsp;GPa depending on the crystal orientation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The [[anisotropy]] of diamond hardness is carefully considered during [[diamond cutting]]. Diamond has a high [[refractive index]] (2.417) and moderate [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of [[crystallographic defect]]s present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's [[crystal structure]], and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in diamond. Most diamonds are [[electrical insulation|electrical insulator]]s but extremely efficient [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductor]]s. Unlike many other minerals, the [[specific gravity]] of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.

==Hardness and crystal structure==
Known to the ancient Greeks as ἀδάμας – ''adámas'' ("proper", "unalterable", "unbreakable")&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |last= Liddell |first= H.G. |last2= Scott |first2= R. |title= Adamas |work= A Greek–English Lexicon |url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%231145&amp;redirect=true |publisher= [[Perseus Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes called [[adamant]], diamond is the hardest known naturally occurring material, scoring 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Diamond is extremely strong owing to the structure of its carbon atoms, where each carbon atom has four neighbors joined to it with covalent bonds. The material [[boron nitride]], when in a form structurally identical to diamond ([[Zincblende (crystal structure)#Zincblende structure|zincblende structure]]), is nearly as hard as diamond; a currently hypothetical material, [[beta carbon nitride]], may also be as hard or harder in one form. It has been shown that some diamond [[aggregated diamond nanorod|aggregates]] having nanometer grain size are harder and tougher than conventional large diamond crystals, thus they perform better as abrasive material.&lt;ref name=blank/&gt;&lt;ref name=iri/&gt; Owing to the use of those new ultra-hard materials for diamond testing, more accurate values are now known for diamond hardness. A surface perpendicular to the [111] [[crystallography#Notation|crystallographic direction]] (that is the longest diagonal of a cube) of a pure (i.e., type IIa) diamond has a hardness value of 167&amp;nbsp;GPa when scratched with an [[aggregated diamond nanorod|nanodiamond]] tip, while the nanodiamond sample itself has a value of 310&amp;nbsp;GPa when tested with another nanodiamond tip. Because the test only works properly with a tip made of harder material than the sample being tested, the true value for nanodiamond is likely somewhat lower than 310&amp;nbsp;GPa.&lt;ref name=blank/&gt;

The precise [[tensile strength]] of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] has been observed, and it could be as high as 90–225&amp;nbsp;GPa depending on the perfection of diamond lattice and on its orientation: Tensile strength is the highest for the [[Miller index|[100] crystal direction]] (normal to the cubic face), smaller for the [110] and the smallest for the [111] axis (along the longest cube diagonal).&lt;ref name=Telling/&gt; Diamond also has one of the smallest [[compressibility|compressibilities]] of any material.

[[Cubic crystal system|Cubic]] diamonds have a perfect and easy [[octahedron|octahedral]] [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], which means that they only have four [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s—weak directions following the [[Face (geometry)|face]]s of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly ''directional'': the hardest direction is the diagonal on the [[cube]] face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The [[diamond cutting]] process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. [[cleavage (crystal)|Cleavage]] also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. [[Cullinan Diamond]]).&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

Diamonds crystallize in the diamond cubic [[crystal system]] ([[space group]] Fd{{overbar|3}}m) and consist of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]], covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called [[lonsdaleite]], with [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] symmetry, has also been found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in [[meteor]]ites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite is expected to be harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=PanZicheng/&gt; In terms of [[crystal habit]], diamonds occur most often as [[euhedral]] (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and [[crystal twinning|twinned]], flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that [[nitrogen]] impurities play an important role in the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

The faces of diamond octahedrons are highly [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]] owing to their hardness; triangular shaped growth defects (''trigons'') or ''etch pits'' are often present on the faces. A diamond's [[fracture]] may be step-like, [[conchoidal fracture|conchoidal]] (shell-like, similar to [[glass]]) or irregular. Diamonds which are nearly round, due to the formation of multiple steps on octahedral faces, are commonly coated in a gum-like skin (''nyf''). The combination of stepped faces, growth defects, and nyf produces a "scaly" or corrugated appearance. Many diamonds are so distorted that few crystal faces are discernible. Some diamonds found in [[Brazil]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] are [[cryptocrystal|polycrystalline]] and occur as opaque, darkly colored, spherical, radial masses of tiny crystals; these are known as [[ballas (diamond)|ballas]] and are important to industry as they lack the cleavage planes of single-crystal diamond. [[Carbonado]] is a similar opaque [[microcrystalline]] form which occurs in shapeless masses. Like ballas diamond, carbonado lacks cleavage planes and its specific gravity varies widely from 2.9 to 3.5. [[Bort]] diamonds, found in Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and [[Guyana]], are the most common type of industrial-grade diamond. They are also polycrystalline and often poorly crystallized; they are translucent and cleave easily.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

Because of its great hardness and strong molecular bonding, a cut diamond's [[facet]]s and facet edges appear the flattest and sharpest. A curious side effect of diamond's surface perfection is ''hydrophobia'' combined with ''lipophilia''. The former property means a drop of water placed on a diamond will form a coherent droplet, whereas in most other minerals the water would spread out to cover the surface. Similarly, diamond is unusually lipophilic, meaning [[petroleum|grease]] and [[oil]] readily collect on a diamond's surface. Whereas on other minerals oil would form coherent drops, on a diamond the oil would spread. This property is exploited in the use of so-called "grease pens," which apply a line of grease to the surface of a suspect [[diamond simulant]]. Diamond surfaces are [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] when the surface carbon atoms terminate with a hydrogen atom and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] when the surface atoms terminate with an oxygen atom or [[hydroxyl radical]]. Treatment with gases or [[chalcedony|plasma]]s containing the appropriate gas, at temperatures of 450&amp;nbsp;°C or higher, can change the surface property completely.&lt;ref name=HansenJ/&gt; Naturally occurring diamonds have a surface with less than a half monolayer coverage of oxygen, the balance being hydrogen and the behavior is moderately hydrophobic. This allows for separation from other minerals at the mine using the so-called "grease-belt".&lt;ref name=Harlow/&gt;

==Toughness==
[[File:Diamond blade very macro.jpg|thumb|Diamonds in an [[angle grinder]] blade]]
Unlike hardness, which denotes only resistance to scratching, diamond's [[Fracture toughness|toughness]] or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness relates to the ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.&lt;ref name=WeberMJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=FieldJE/&gt;

Ballas and carbonado diamond are exceptional, as they are polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications.&lt;ref name=Moriyoshi/&gt; Particular faceting shapes of diamonds are more prone to breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The [[diamond cut|brilliant cut]] of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

Solid foreign crystals are commonly present in diamond. They are mostly minerals, such as [[olivine]], [[garnet]]s, [[ruby]], and many others.&lt;ref name=IakoubovskiiFe/&gt; These and other inclusions, such as internal fractures or "feathers", can compromise the structural integrity of a diamond. Cut diamonds that have been [[diamond enhancement|enhanced]] to improve their [[diamond clarity|clarity]] via glass infilling of fractures or cavities are especially fragile, as the glass will not stand up to [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] cleaning or the rigors of the jeweler's torch. Fracture-filled diamonds may shatter if treated improperly.&lt;ref name=TaylorWR/&gt;

===Pressure resistance===
Used in so-called [[diamond anvil]] experiments to create high-pressure environments, diamonds are able to withstand crushing pressures in excess of 600 gigapascals (6 million [[atmospheres]]).&lt;ref name=DiamondAnvil/&gt;

===Color and its causes===
[[File:HPHTdiamonds2.JPG|thumb|Synthetic diamonds of various colors grown by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, the diamond size is ~2 mm]]
[[File:irrdiamond.jpg|thumb|Pure diamonds, before and after irradiation and annealing. Clockwise from left bottom: 1) initial (2×2&amp;nbsp;mm); 2–4) irradiated by different doses of 2&amp;nbsp;MeV electrons; 5–6) irradiated by different doses and annealed at 800&amp;nbsp;°C.]]
{{Main|Crystallographic defects in diamond}}

Diamonds occur in various colors: black, brown, yellow, gray, white, blue, orange, purple to pink and red. Colored diamonds contain [[crystallographic defect]]s, including substitutional impurities and structural defects, that cause the coloration. Theoretically, pure diamonds would be transparent and colorless. Diamonds are scientifically classed into two main ''types'' and several subtypes, according to the nature of defects present and how they affect light absorption:&lt;ref name= read/&gt;

Type I diamond has [[nitrogen]] (N) atoms as the main impurity, at a concentration of up to 1%. If the N atoms are in pairs or larger aggregates, they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type Ia. About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia: these diamonds belong to the ''Cape series'', named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as [[Cape Province]] in [[South Africa]], whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only ~0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is usually of type Ib. Type Ia and Ib diamonds absorb in both the [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from 320&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]. They also have a characteristic fluorescence and visible absorption spectrum (see [[#Optical properties|Optical properties]]).&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;

Type II diamonds have very few if any nitrogen impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through ''plastic deformation'' during crystal growth;&lt;ref name=Hounsome/&gt; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute a large percentage of Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, which account for ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also [[semiconductor]]s, unlike other diamond types (see [[#Electrical properties|Electrical properties]]). Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the [[Argyle diamond mine|Argyle mine]] of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain.&lt;ref name=argyle/&gt; Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225&amp;nbsp;nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;

Certain [[diamond enhancement]] techniques are commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve [[irradiation]], including [[proton]] bombardment via [[cyclotron]]s; [[neutron]] bombardment in the piles of [[nuclear reactor]]s; and [[electron]] bombardment by [[Van de Graaff generator]]s. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's [[crystal lattice]], knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing [[F-Center|color center]]s. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, and in some cases the diamond may be left [[radioactive]] to some degree.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;&lt;ref name=read2/&gt;

Some irradiated diamonds are completely natural; one famous example is the [[Dresden Green Diamond]].&lt;ref name=Harlow/&gt; In these natural stones the color is imparted by "radiation burns" (natural irradiation by [[alpha particle]]s originating from [[uranium ore]]) in the form of small patches, usually only [[micrometre|micrometers]] deep. Additionally, Type IIa diamonds can have their structural deformations "repaired" via a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) process, removing much or all of the diamond's color.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

===Luster===
[[File:Brillanten.jpg|thumb|left|A scattering of round-brilliant cut diamonds shows the many reflecting facets]]
The [[lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] of a diamond is described as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The [[refractive index]] of diamond (as measured via [[sodium light]], 589.3&amp;nbsp;nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also [[isotropic]]. Its high [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible ''fire'' of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of [[prism (optics)|prismatic]] colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of [[diamond cut]] and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.&lt;ref name= read2/&gt;

More than 20 other minerals have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for blue and red light) than diamond, such as [[titanite]] 0.051, [[andradite]] 0.057, [[cassiterite]] 0.071, [[strontium titanate]] 0.109, [[sphalerite]] 0.156, synthetic [[rutile]] 0.330, [[cinnabar]] 0.4, etc. (see [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]).&lt;ref name=Schumann/&gt; However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.

|caption2  = A photograph (top) and UV-excited photoluminescence image (bottom) from a plate cut from a synthetic diamond (width ~3&amp;nbsp;mm). Most of yellow color and green emission originate from [[nickel]] impurities.}}

Diamonds exhibit [[fluorescence]], that is, they emit light of various colors and intensities under long-wave ultraviolet light (365&amp;nbsp;nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also [[phosphorescence|phosphoresce]] yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb diamonds).&lt;ref name=phosph/&gt; In natural diamonds, there is typically little if any response to short-wave ultraviolet, but the reverse is true of synthetic diamonds. Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural diamonds, fluorescence under [[X-ray]]s is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some diamonds, particularly Canadian diamonds, show no fluorescence.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=read2/&gt;

The origin of the luminescence colors is often unclear and not unique. Blue emission from type IIa and IIb diamonds is reliably identified with dislocations by directly correlating the emission with dislocations in an [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=Hanley/&gt; However, blue emission in type Ia diamond could be either due to dislocations or the N3 defects (three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy).&lt;ref name=vanWyk/&gt; Green emission in natural diamond is usually due to the H3 center (two substitutional nitrogen atoms separated by a vacancy),&lt;ref name=H3/&gt; whereas in synthetic diamond it usually originates from [[nickel]] used as a catalyst (see figure).&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; Orange or red emission could be due to various reasons, one being the [[nitrogen-vacancy center]] which is present in sufficient quantities in all types of diamond, even type IIb.&lt;ref name=Freitas/&gt;

===Optical absorption===
Cape series (Ia) diamonds have a visible [[absorption spectrum]] (as seen through a direct-vision [[spectroscope]]) consisting of a fine line in the violet at 415.5&amp;nbsp;nm; however, this line is often invisible until the diamond has been cooled to very low temperatures. Associated with this are weaker lines at 478&amp;nbsp;nm, 465&amp;nbsp;nm, 452&amp;nbsp;nm, 435&amp;nbsp;nm, and 423&amp;nbsp;nm.
All those lines are labeled as N3 and N2 optical centers and associated with a defect consisting of three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy. Other stones show additional bands: brown, green, or yellow diamonds show a band in the green at 504&amp;nbsp;nm (H3 center, see above),&lt;ref name=H3/&gt; sometimes accompanied by two additional weak bands at 537&amp;nbsp;nm and 495&amp;nbsp;nm (H4 center, a large complex presumably involving 4 substitutional nitrogen atoms and 2 lattice vacancies).&lt;ref name=deSaES/&gt; Type IIb diamonds may absorb in the far red due to the substitutional boron, but otherwise show no observable visible absorption spectrum.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;

[[Gemology|Gemological]] laboratories make use of [[spectrophotometer]] machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-[[diamond enhancement|enhanced diamonds]]. The spectrophotometers analyze the [[infrared]], visible, and [[ultraviolet]] absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with [[liquid nitrogen]] to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally discernible.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;&lt;ref name=identification/&gt;

==Electrical properties==
Diamond is a good electrical [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], having a resistivity of 100&amp;nbsp;GΩ·m to 1&amp;nbsp;EΩ·m&lt;ref name=Fromentin/&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·m).  Most natural blue diamonds are an exception and are [[semiconductor]]s due to substitutional [[boron]] impurities replacing carbon atoms.  Natural blue or blue-gray diamonds, common for the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in [[Australia]], are rich in [[hydrogen]]; these diamonds are not semiconductors and it is unclear whether hydrogen is actually responsible for their blue-gray color.&lt;ref name="argyle"/&gt; Natural blue diamonds containing boron and synthetic diamonds [[dopant|doped]] with boron are [[p-type semiconductor]]s. [[n-type semiconductor|N-type]] diamond films are reproducibly synthesized by phosphorus doping during [[Chemical vapor deposition of diamond|chemical vapor deposition]].&lt;ref name=Koizumi2008/&gt; Diode [[p-n junction]]s and UV light emitting diodes ([[LED]]s, at 235&amp;nbsp;nm) have been produced by sequential deposition of p-type (boron-doped) and n-type (phosphorus-doped) layers.&lt;ref name=koizumi2001/&gt;

Diamond [[transistor]]s have been produced (for research purposes).&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite journal |title=Diamond transistor performance and fabrication |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=669 |year=1991 |doi=10.1109/5.90131|last1=Geis |first1=M.W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FET]]s with SiN dielectric layers, and [[surface channel MESFET|SC-FET]]s have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Diamond Based Field-Effect Transistors of Zr Gate with SiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; Dielectric Layers |journal=Journal of Nanomaterials |volume=2015 |pages=1 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283282236_Diamond_Based_Field-Effect_Transistors_of_Zr_Gate_with_S_i_N_x_Dielectric_Layers |doi=10.1155/2015/124640 |year=2015|last1=Wang |first1=W. |last2=Hu |first2=C. |last3=Li |first3=S. Y. |last4=Li |first4=F. N. |last5=Liu |first5=Z. C. |last6=Wang |first6=F. |last7=Fu |first7=J. |last8=Wang |first8=H. X. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, the journal &lt;cite&gt;[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;/cite&gt; reported that below the superconducting transition temperature 4&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], boron-doped diamond synthesized at high temperature and high pressure is a bulk superconductor.&lt;ref name=Ekimov/&gt; Superconductivity was later observed in heavily boron-doped films grown by various [[chemical vapor deposition of diamond|chemical vapor deposition]] techniques, and the highest reported transition temperature (by 2009) is 11.4&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Takano2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Takano2006/&gt; (See also [[Covalent superconductor#Diamond]])

Uncommon magnetic properties (spin glass state) were observed in diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium.&lt;ref name=Kozlov/&gt; Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.

==Thermal conductivity==
Unlike most electrical insulators, diamond is a good conductor of heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond was measured to be about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than [[copper]]. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond [[isotopically pure diamond|enriched to 99.9% the isotope &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any known solid at room temperature: 3320&amp;nbsp;W/(m·K).&lt;ref name=Anthony1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=PNU/&gt; Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent [[silicon]] and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000&amp;nbsp;W/(m·K) at 104&amp;nbsp;K (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched diamond).&lt;ref name=PNU/&gt;

Diamond's high thermal conductivity is used by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic ''thermal probe'' to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by [[moissanite]], a crystalline mineral form of [[silicon carbide]] introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=read/&gt;&lt;ref name=identification/&gt;

==Thermal stability==
[[File:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in structure.]]
Being a form of carbon, diamond oxidizes in air if heated over 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=JohnP/&gt; In absence of oxygen, e.g. in a flow of high-purity [[argon]] gas, diamond can be heated up to about 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Davies1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans1964/&gt; Its surface blackens, but can be recovered by re-polishing. At high pressure (~20&amp;nbsp;GPa) diamond can be heated up to 2500&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name=Evans1981/&gt; and a report published in 2009 suggests that diamond can withstand temperatures of 3000&amp;nbsp;°C and above.&lt;ref name=Shatskiy/&gt;

Diamonds are carbon [[crystal]]s that form deep within the Earth under high temperatures and extreme pressures. At surface air pressure (one atmosphere), diamonds are not as stable as [[graphite]], and so the decay of diamond is [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] favorable (δ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−2&amp;nbsp;kJ&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;mol).&lt;ref name= read2/&gt; So, contrary to [[De Beers]]' ad campaign extending from 1948 to at least 2013 under the slogan "A diamond is forever",&lt;ref name=Forever/&gt; diamonds are definitely not forever. However, owing to a very large [[kinetic energy]] barrier, diamonds are [[metastability in molecules|metastable]]; they will not decay into graphite under [[standard temperature and pressure|normal conditions]].&lt;ref name= read2/&gt;

General results presented in [[fictitious force]]s here are applied to observations of a moving particle as seen from several specific non-inertial frames, for example, a ''local'' frame (one tied to the moving particle so it appears stationary), and  a ''co-rotating'' frame (one with an arbitrarily located but fixed axis and a rate of rotation that makes the particle appear to have only radial motion and zero [[azimuth]]al motion). The Lagrangian approach to fictitious forces is introduced.

Unlike real [[force]]s such as [[electromagnetic force]]s, fictitious forces do not originate from physical interactions between objects.

==Analysis using fictitious forces==
The appearance of fictitious forces normally is associated with use of a [[non-inertial frame of reference]], and their absence with use of an [[inertial frame of reference]]. The connection between inertial frames and [[fictitious force]]s (also called ''inertial forces'' or ''pseudo-forces''), is expressed, for example, by Arnol'd:&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics |page=129 |author=V. I. Arnol'd |isbn=978-0-387-96890-2 |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=additional+terms+called+inertial+forces.+This+allows+us+to+detect+experimentally&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;lr=&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_sub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn=|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious forces do not appear in the [[Newton's laws of motion|equations of motion]] in an [[inertial frame of reference]]: in an inertial frame, the motion of an object is explained by the real impressed forces. In a non-inertial frame such as a rotating frame, however,  Newton's first and second laws still can be used to make accurate physical predictions provided fictitious forces are included along with the real forces. For solving problems of mechanics in non-inertial reference frames, the advice given in textbooks is to treat the fictitious forces like real forces and to pretend you are in an inertial frame.&lt;!--

It should be mentioned that "treating the fictitious forces like real forces" means, in particular, that fictitious forces as seen in a particular non-inertial frame transform as ''vectors'' under coordinate transformations made within that frame, that is, like real forces.

==Moving objects and observational frames of reference==
Next, it is observed that time varying coordinates are used in both inertial and non-inertial frames of reference, so the use of time varying coordinates should not be confounded with a change of observer, but is only a change of the observer's choice of description.  Elaboration of this point and some citations on the subject follow.

===Frame of reference and coordinate system===
The term [[frame of reference]] is used often in a very broad sense, but for the present discussion its meaning is restricted to refer to an observer's ''state of motion'', that is, to either an [[inertial frame]] of reference or a [[non-inertial frame]] of reference.

The term [[coordinate system]] is used to differentiate between different possible choices for a set of variables to describe motion, choices available to any observer, regardless of their state of motion. Examples are [[Cartesian coordinates]], [[polar coordinates]] and (more generally) [[curvilinear coordinates]].
 
Here are two quotes relating "state of motion" and "coordinate system":&lt;ref name=Lyle&gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1tEWQICZdsXeuLyfmH2PoLgZnMGA

{{Quotation|In traditional developments of special and general relativity it has been customary not to distinguish between two quite distinct ideas.

===Time varying coordinate systems===
In a general coordinate system, the basis vectors for the coordinates may vary in time at fixed positions, or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. It may be noted that coordinate systems attached to both inertial frames and non-inertial frames can have basis vectors that vary in time, space or both, for example the description of a trajectory in polar coordinates as seen from an inertial frame.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;See Moore and Stommel, Chapter 2, p. 26, which deals with polar coordinates in an inertial frame of reference (what these authors call a "Newtonian frame of reference"), {{cite book |page=26 |author1=Henry Stommel  |author2=Dennis W.

In discussion of a particle moving in a circular orbit,&lt;ref name=particle&gt;The term ''particle'' is used in mechanics to describe an object without reference to its orientation. The term [[rigid body]] is used when orientation is also a factor. Thus, the [[center of mass]] of a rigid body is a "particle".&lt;/ref&gt; in an inertial frame of reference one can identify the centripetal and tangential forces. It then seems to be no problem to switch hats, change perspective, and talk about the fictitious forces commonly called the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] and [[Euler force]]. But what underlies this switch in vocabulary is a change of observational frame of reference from the inertial frame where we started, where centripetal and tangential forces make sense, to a rotating frame of reference where the particle appears motionless and fictitious centrifugal and Euler forces have to be brought into play. That switch is unconscious, but real.

Suppose we sit on a particle in general planar motion (not just a circular orbit). What analysis underlies a switch of hats to introduce fictitious centrifugal and Euler forces?

To explore that question, begin in an inertial frame of reference. By using a coordinate system commonly used in planar motion, the so-called [[Centripetal force#Local coordinates|''local'' coordinate system]],&lt;ref name=observer&gt;Observational frames of reference and [[coordinate system]]s are independent ideas. A frame of reference is a physical notion related to the observer's state of motion. A coordinate system is a mathematical description, which can be chosen to suit the observations.  A change to a coordinate system that moves in time affects the description of the particle motion, but does not change the observer's state of motion. For more discussion, see [[Frame of reference]]&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]], it becomes easy to identify formulas for the centripetal inward force normal to the trajectory (in direction opposite to '''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' in [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]), and the tangential force parallel to the trajectory (in direction '''u&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''), as shown next.

To introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system shown in [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]], one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates in an inertial framework and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]], the [[arc length]] ''s'' is the distance the particle has traveled along its path in time ''t''.  The path '''r''' (''t'') with components ''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t'') in Cartesian coordinates is described using arc length ''s''(''t'') as:&lt;ref name=curvature&gt;The article on [[curvature]] treats a more general case where the curve is parametrized by an arbitrary variable (denoted ''t''), rather than by the arc length ''s''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ x(s),\ y(s) \right] \ . &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Skywriter.JPG|thumb |180px |The arc length ''s(t)'' measures distance along the skywriter's trail. Image from [http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/docs/cb/cb_343.pdf NASA ASRS]]]
One way to look at the use of ''s'' is to think of the path of the particle as sitting in space, like the trail left by a [[Skywriting|skywriter]], independent of time. Any position on this path is described by stating its distance ''s'' from some starting point on the path. Then an incremental displacement along the path ''ds'' is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ dx(s),\ dy(s) \right]=\left[ x'(s),\ y'(s) \right] ds  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to ''s''. The magnitude of this displacement is ''ds'', showing that:&lt;ref name=Shabana0&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroad Vehicle Dynamics: A Computational Approach |author1=Ahmed A. Shabana |author2=Khaled E. Zaazaa |author3=Hiroyuki Sugiyama |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgIDSQT0FaUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA207&amp;dq=%22generalized+coordinate%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U2tosoLUEAUNkGu2x8TTtuxLfeLGQ#PRA1-PA91,M1
|isbn=1-4200-4581-4 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2007   }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[ x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2 \right] = 1 \ . &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;{{anchor|Eq. 1}}(Eq. 1)
This displacement is necessarily tangent to the curve at ''s'', showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_t(s) = \left[ x'(s), \ y'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;
while the outward unit vector normal to the curve is 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_n(s) = \left[ y'(s),\ -x'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;
Orthogonality can be verified by showing the vector [[dot product]] is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]].

As an aside, notice that the use of unit vectors that are not aligned along the Cartesian ''xy''-axes does not mean we are no longer in an inertial frame. All it means is that we are using unit vectors that vary with ''s'' to describe the path, but still observe the motion from the inertial frame.

Using the tangent vector, the angle of the tangent to the curve, say θ, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta =\frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2+y'(s)^2}} = y'(s) \ ;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; and &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta =\frac{x'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2+y'(s)^2}} = x'(s) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
The radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{d\theta}{ds}\ . &lt;/math&gt;
The derivative of θ can be found from that for sin θ:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \sin\theta}{ds} = \cos \theta \frac {d\theta}{ds} = \frac{1}{\rho} \cos \theta \  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \frac{1}{\rho} x'(s)\ . &lt;/math&gt;
Now:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \sin \theta }{ds} = \frac{d}{ds} \frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2+y'(s)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \frac{y''(s)x'(s)^2-y'(s)x'(s)x''(s)} {\left(x'(s)^2+y'(s)^2\right)^{3/2}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
in which the denominator is unity according to [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\theta}{ds} = \frac{1}{\rho} = y''(s)x'(s) - y'(s)x''(s)\ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{y''(s)}{x'(s)} = -\frac{x''(s)}{y'(s)} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x'(s)x''(s) + y'(s)y''(s) = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;
Having set up the description of any position on the path in terms of its associated value for ''s'', and having found the properties of the path in terms of this description, motion of the particle is introduced by stating the particle position at any time ''t'' as the corresponding value ''s (t)''.

Using the above results for the path properties in terms of ''s'', the acceleration in the inertial reference frame as described in terms of the components normal and tangential to the path of the particle can be found in terms of the function ''s''(''t'') and its various time derivatives (as before, ''primes'' indicate differentiation with respect to ''s''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(s) = \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{v}(s) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{ds}{dt} \left( x'(s), \ y'(s) \right) \right]\  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_t(s) +\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right) ^2 \left(x''(s),\ y''(s) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_t(s) - \left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right) ^2 \frac{1}{\rho} \mathbf{u}_n(s) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
as can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') and  '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius ρ.  Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force.

Next, we change observational frames. Sitting on the particle, we adopt a non-inertial frame where the particle is at rest (zero velocity). This frame has a continuously changing origin, which at time ''t'' is the center of curvature (the center of the [[osculating circle]] in [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]) of the path at time ''t'', and whose rate of rotation is the angular rate of motion of the particle about that origin at time ''t''. This non-inertial frame also employs unit vectors normal to the trajectory and parallel to it.

The [[angular velocity]] of this frame is the angular velocity of the particle about the center of curvature at time ''t''.  The centripetal force of the inertial frame is interpreted  in the non-inertial frame where the body is at rest as a force necessary to overcome the centrifugal force. Likewise, the force causing any acceleration of speed along the path seen in the inertial frame becomes the force necessary to overcome the Euler force in the non-inertial frame where the particle is at rest. There is zero Coriolis force in the frame, because the particle has zero velocity in this frame. For a pilot in an airplane, for example, these fictitious forces are a matter of direct experience.&lt;ref name=Coriolis&gt;However, the pilot also will experience Coriolis force, because the pilot is not a ''particle''. When the pilot's head moves, for example, the head has a velocity in the non-inertial frame, and becomes subject to Coriolis force. This force causes pilot disorientation in a turn. See [[Coriolis effect (perception)]], {{cite book |title=Space biology and medicine |author=Arnauld E.

|isbn=1-4020-1598-4 |year=2003 |publisher=Springer}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these fictitious forces cannot be related to a simple observational frame of reference other than the particle itself, unless it is in a particularly simple path, like a circle.

That said, from a qualitative standpoint, the path of an airplane can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius. See article discussing [[Banked turn#Aviation|turning an airplane]].

Next, reference frames rotating about a fixed axis are discussed in more detail.

==Fictitious forces in polar coordinates==
{{main|polar coordinates}}
Description of particle motion often is simpler in non-Cartesian coordinate systems, for example, polar coordinates. When equations of motion are expressed in terms of any curvilinear coordinate system, extra terms appear that represent how the basis vectors change as the coordinates change. These terms arise automatically on transformation to polar (or cylindrical) coordinates and are thus not fictitious ''forces'', but rather are simply added ''terms'' in the acceleration in polar coordinates.&lt;ref name=Jakobsen&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemical Reactor Modeling |author=Hugo A Jakobsen |page=724 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrP6RNajRs0C&amp;pg=PA724&amp;dq=reactive+centrifugal&amp;lr= |isbn=3-540-25197-9 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two terminologies===
In a purely mathematical treatment, regardless of the frame that the coordinate system is associated with (inertial or non-inertial), extra terms appear in the acceleration of an observed particle when using curvilinear coordinates. For example, in polar coordinates the acceleration is given by (see below for details):
::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{a} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt} =\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = (\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2)\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + (r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r \dot\theta)\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
which contains not just double time derivatives of the coordinates but added terms. This example employs polar coordinates, but more generally the added terms depend upon which coordinate system is chosen (that is, polar, elliptic, or whatever).
Sometimes these coordinate-system dependent ''terms'' also are referred to as "fictitious forces", introducing a second meaning for "fictitious forces", despite the fact that these terms do not have the vector [[General covariance|transformation properties]] expected of forces. For example, see Shankar&lt;ref name=Shankar&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Quantum Mechanics |author=Ramamurti Shankar |edition=2nd |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zypV5EbKuIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Coriolis+%22polar+coordinates%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |year=1994 |isbn=0-306-44790-8 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hildebrand.&lt;ref name=Hildebrand&gt;{{cite book |author=Francis Begnaud Hildebrand |title=Methods of Applied Mathematics |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17EZkWPz_eQC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=absence+fictitious+force&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1rrR7AnDqhMl7XJkkOEMJLr8co2Q |isbn=0-486-67002-3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1992 |edition=Reprint of 2nd Edition of 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this terminology, fictitious forces are determined in part by the coordinate system itself, regardless of the frame it is attached to, that is, regardless of whether the coordinate system is attached to an inertial or a non-inertial frame of reference. In contrast, the fictitious forces defined in terms of the ''state of motion of the observer'' vanish in inertial frames of reference. To distinguish these two terminologies, the fictitious forces that vanish in an inertial frame of reference, the inertial forces of Newtonian mechanics, are called in this article the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces and those that originate in the interpretation of time derivatives in particular coordinate systems are called "coordinate" fictitious forces.&lt;ref name=terminology&gt;Although used in this article, these names are not in common use. Alternative names sometimes found are "Newtonian fictitious force" instead of "state-of-motion" fictitious force, and "generalized fictitious force" instead of "coordinate fictitious force". This last term originates in the Lagrangian formulation for mechanics using generalized coordinates. See {{cite book |author=Francis Begnaud Hildebrand |title=Methods of Applied Mathematics |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17EZkWPz_eQC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=absence+fictitious+force&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1rrR7AnDqhMl7XJkkOEMJLr8co2Q |isbn=0-486-67002-3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1992 |edition=Reprint of 2nd Edition of 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming it is clear that "state of motion" and "coordinate system" are ''different'', it follows that the dependence of centrifugal force (as in this article) upon "state of motion" and its independence from "coordinate system", which contrasts with the "coordinate" version with exactly the opposite dependencies, indicates that two different ideas are referred to by the terminology "fictitious force". The present article emphasizes one of these two ideas ("state-of-motion"), although the other also is described.

Below, polar coordinates are introduced for use in (first) an inertial frame of reference and then (second) in a rotating frame of reference. The two different uses of the term "fictitious force" are pointed out. First, however, follows a brief digression to explain further how the "coordinate" terminology for fictitious force has arisen.

====Lagrangian approach====
{{see also|Lagrangian mechanics}}

To motivate the introduction of "coordinate" inertial forces by more than a reference to "mathematical convenience", what follows is a digression to show these forces correspond to what are called by some authors "generalized" fictitious forces or "generalized inertia forces".&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced Dynamics |author= Donald T.

The only requirement on these coordinates is that they are necessary and sufficient to uniquely characterize the state of the system: they need not be (although they could be) the coordinates of the particles in the system. Instead, they could be the angles and extensions of links in a robot arm, for instance. If a mechanical system consists of ''N'' particles and there are ''m'' independent kinematical conditions imposed, it is possible to characterize the system uniquely by ''n'' = 3''N - m'' independent [[generalized coordinates]] {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}.&lt;ref name=Lanczos3&gt;{{cite book |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |author =Cornelius Lanczos |page=10 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=isbn:0486650677&amp;sig=ACfU3U2R5sLjGS22S-h8Z_j9RiPJnKcKZg#PPA7,M1 |publisher=Dover Publications |edition=1970 reprint of 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian is defined as the [[kinetic energy]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, of the system minus its [[potential energy]], &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lanczos4&gt;{{cite book |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |author =Cornelius Lanczos |pages=112–113 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=isbn:0486650677&amp;sig=ACfU3U2R5sLjGS22S-h8Z_j9RiPJnKcKZg#PPA7,M1 |publisher=Dover Publications |edition=Reprint of 1970 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols,

Under conditions that are given in [[Lagrangian mechanics]], if the Lagrangian of a system is known, then the [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] of the system may be obtained by a direct substitution of the expression for the Lagrangian into the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], a particular family of [[partial differential equation]]s.

It is not the purpose here to outline how Lagrangian mechanics works. The interested reader can look at other articles explaining this approach. For the moment, the goal is simply to show that  the Lagrangian approach can lead to "generalized fictitious forces" that ''do not vanish in inertial frames''. What is pertinent here is that in the case of a single particle, the Lagrangian approach can be arranged to capture exactly the "coordinate" fictitious forces just introduced.

To proceed, consider a single particle, and introduce the generalized coordinates as {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} = (''r, θ''). Then Hildebrand &lt;ref name=Hildebrand/&gt; shows in polar coordinates with the ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''(r, θ)'' the "generalized momenta" are:
::&lt;math&gt; p_r = m \dot r \ , \ p_{\theta} = mr^2 \dot{\theta}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
leading, for example, to the generalized force:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}p_r =Q_r + mr{\dot{ \theta}}^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;
with ''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' the impressed radial force. The connection between "generalized forces" and Newtonian forces varies with the choice of coordinates. This Lagrangian formulation introduces exactly the "coordinate" form of fictitious forces mentioned above that allows "fictitious" (generalized) forces in inertial frames, for example, the term &lt;span style="vertical-align:20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;mr { \dot{\theta}}^2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Careful reading of Hildebrand shows he doesn't discuss the role of "inertial frames of reference", and in fact, says "[The] presence or absence [of inertia forces] depends, not upon the particular problem at hand but ''upon the coordinate system chosen''." By coordinate system presumably is meant the choice of {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}. Later he says "If ''accelerations'' associated with generalized coordinates are to be of prime interest (as is usually the case), the [nonaccelerational] terms may be conveniently transferred to the right … and considered as additional (generalized) inertia forces. Such inertia forces are often said to be of the ''Coriolis'' type."

In short, the emphasis of some authors upon coordinates and their derivatives and their introduction of (generalized) fictitious forces that do not vanish in inertial frames of reference is an outgrowth of the use of [[generalized coordinates]] in [[Lagrangian mechanics]].

The terms involving Christoffel symbols therefore determine the "generalized centrifugal" and "generalized Coriolis" terms.

The introduction of ''generalized'' fictitious forces often is done without notification and without specifying the word "generalized".  This sloppy use of terminology leads to endless confusion because these ''generalized'' fictitious forces, unlike the standard "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, do not vanish in inertial frames of reference.

Below, the acceleration of a particle is derived as seen in an inertial frame using polar coordinates. There are no "state-of-motion" fictitious forces in an inertial frame, by definition. Following that presentation, the contrasting terminology of "coordinate" fictitious forces is presented and critiqued on the basis of the non-vectorial transformation behavior of these "forces".

In an inertial frame, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; be the position vector of a moving particle. Its Cartesian components (''x'', ''y'') are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} =(r\cos\theta,\  r\sin\theta)\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

with polar coordinates ''r'' and  θ depending on time ''t''.

Unit vectors are defined in the radially outward direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} = \frac{ \partial \mathbf{r}}{ \partial r} =  (\cos\theta,\ \sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

and in the direction at right angles to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} =\frac{\partial^2 {\mathbf{r}}}{\partial r \, \partial \theta}= (-\sin\theta\ ,\cos\theta) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

These unit vectors vary in direction with time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} = (-\sin\theta,\ \cos\theta)\frac{d \theta}{dt} = \frac{d \theta}{dt}\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} , &lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = (-\cos\theta,\ -\sin\theta)\frac{d \theta}{dt} =- \frac{d \theta}{dt}\hat{\boldsymbol r} . &lt;/math&gt;

Using these derivatives, the first and second derivatives of position are:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v} =\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \dot r\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + r\dot\theta\hat{\boldsymbol\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{a} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt} =\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = (\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2)\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + (r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r \dot\theta)\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where dot-overmarkings indicate time differentiation. With this form for the acceleration &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{a}&lt;/math&gt;, in an inertial frame of reference Newton's second law expressed in polar coordinates is:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = m \boldsymbol{a} = m(\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2)\hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + m(r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r \dot\theta)\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where '''''F''''' is the net real force on the particle. No fictitious forces appear because all fictitious forces are zero by definition in an inertial frame.

From a mathematical standpoint, however, it sometimes is handy to put only the second-order derivatives on the right side of this equation; that is we write the above equation by rearrangement of terms as:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} +m r\dot\theta^2\hat{\mathbf{r}} - m 2\dot r \dot\theta\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} = m \tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}= m\ddot r \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} +m r\ddot\theta\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where a "coordinate" version of the "acceleration" is introduced:
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}= \ddot r \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + r\ddot\theta\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
consisting of only second-order time derivatives of the coordinates ''r'' and θ. The terms moved to the force-side of the equation are now treated as ''extra'' "fictitious forces" and, confusingly, the resulting forces also are called the "centrifugal" and "Coriolis" force.

These newly defined "forces" are non-zero in an ''inertial frame'', and so certainly are not the same as the previously identified fictitious forces that are zero in an inertial frame and non-zero only in a non-inertial frame.&lt;ref name=Stommer4&gt;For a treatment using these terms as fictitious forces, see {{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Coriolis Force |author1=Henry Stommel |author2=Dennis W.

|isbn=0-231-06636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, these newly defined forces are called the "coordinate" centrifugal force and the "coordinate" Coriolis force to separate them from the "state-of-motion" forces.

Angular rate &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot \theta=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but   &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot \theta ' \ne 0 \ .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]

==== Change of origin ====

Here is an illustration showing the so-called "centrifugal term"  &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not transform as a true force, putting any reference to this term not just as a "term", but as a centrifugal ''force'', in a dubious light. Suppose in frame ''S'' a particle moves radially away from the origin at a constant velocity. See Figure 2. The force on the particle is zero by Newton's first law. Now we look at the same thing from frame ''S' '', which is the same, but displaced in origin. In ''S' '' the particle still is in straight line motion at constant speed, so again the force is zero.

What if we use polar coordinates in the two frames? In frame ''S'' the radial motion is constant and there is no angular motion. Hence, the acceleration is:
:::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol a  = \left(\ddot r -r {\dot \theta}^2 \right ) \hat{ \boldsymbol r} + \left(r \ddot \theta +2 \dot r \dot \theta \right) \hat {\boldsymbol \theta} = 0\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
and each term individually is zero because &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot \theta = 0, \ \ddot \theta =0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot r =0 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There is no force, including no &lt;span style="vertical-align:+22%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "force" in frame ''S''.
In frame ''S' '', however, we have:
:::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol a '   = \left( \ddot {r } ' -r '   \dot {\theta } ' ^2 \right)  \hat { \boldsymbol r } ' + \left( r ' \ddot \theta ' +2 \dot r ' \dot \theta ' \right) \hat {\boldsymbol \theta } ' \ &lt;/math&gt;
In this case the azimuthal term is zero, being the rate of change of angular momentum. To obtain zero acceleration in the radial direction, however, we require:
:::&lt;math&gt;\ddot r '= r ' \dot {\theta}' ^2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The right-hand side is non-zero, inasmuch as neither &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r'\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nor &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot \theta'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is zero. That is, we cannot obtain zero force (zero &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol a '\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) if we retain only &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot r'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the acceleration; we need both terms.

Despite the above facts, suppose we adopt polar coordinates, and wish to say that &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is "centrifugal force", and reinterpret &lt;span style="vertical-align:+10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as "acceleration" (without dwelling upon any possible justification). How does this decision fare when we consider that a proper formulation of physics is geometry and coordinate-independent? See the article on [[general covariance]].&lt;ref name=Atmanspacher&gt;For a rather abstract but complete discussion, see {{cite book |title=Recasting Reality: Wolfgang Pauli's Philosophical Ideas and Contemporary Science |author1=Harald Atmanspacher  |author2=Hans Primas  |lastauthoramp=yes |page=§2.2, p. 42 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_YOBo-lMS8C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=equivalence+%22covariant+law%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA43,M1 |isbn=3-540-85197-6 |publisher=Springer |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To attempt to form a covariant expression, this so-called centrifugal "force" can be put into vector notation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F_{\dot \theta}} = -\boldsymbol {\omega \times}\left(\boldsymbol{\omega \times r }\right)\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

with:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \omega =  \dot \theta  \boldsymbol{\hat k} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a unit vector normal to the plane of motion. Unfortunately, although this expression formally looks like a vector, when an observer changes origin the value of &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot \theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; changes (see Figure 2), so observers in the same frame of reference standing on different street corners see different "forces" even though the actual events they witness are identical.
How can a physical force (be it fictitious or real) be zero in one frame ''S'', but non-zero in another frame ''S' '' identical, but a few feet away?  Even for exactly the same particle behavior the expression &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is different in every frame of reference, even for very trivial distinctions between frames. In short, if we take &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as "centrifugal force", it does not have a universal significance: it is ''unphysical''.

Beyond this problem, the real impressed net force is zero. (There is no real impressed force in straight-line motion at constant speed). If we adopt polar coordinates, and wish to say that &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is "centrifugal force", and reinterpret &lt;span style="vertical-align:+10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as "acceleration", the oddity results in frame ''S' '' that [[straight-line motion]] at constant speed requires a net force in polar coordinates, but not in Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, this perplexity applies in frame ''S''{{'}}{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Should this be a Prime (symbol) instead of an apostrophe?}}, but not in frame ''S''.

The absurdity of the behavior of &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; indicates that one must say that  &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is ''not'' centrifugal ''force'', but simply one of two ''terms'' in the acceleration. This view, that the acceleration is composed of two terms, is frame-independent: there is zero centrifugal force in any and every inertial frame. It also is coordinate-system independent: we can use Cartesian, polar, or any other curvilinear system: they all produce zero.

Apart from the above physical arguments, of course, the derivation above, based upon application of the mathematical rules of differentiation, shows the radial acceleration does indeed consist of the two terms &lt;span style="vertical-align:+20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot r -r\dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

That said, the next subsection shows  there is a connection between these centrifugal and Coriolis ''terms'' and the fictitious ''forces'' that pertain to a particular ''rotating'' frame of reference (as distinct from an inertial frame).

In the case of planar motion of a particle, the "coordinate" centrifugal and Coriolis acceleration terms found above to be non-zero in an inertial frame can be shown to be the negatives of the "state-of-motion" centrifugal and Coriolis terms that appear in a very particular non-inertial ''co-rotating'' frame (see next subsection).&lt;ref name=Taylor40&gt;For the following discussion, see {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=shares+the+same+origin+O+and+is+rotating&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;lr=&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_sub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn= |author=John R Taylor |title=Classical Mechanics |quote=At the chosen instant ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', the frame ''S' '' and the particle are rotating at the same rate....In the inertial frame, the forces are simpler (no "fictitious" forces) but the accelerations are more complicated.; in the rotating frame, it is the other way round. |page=§9.10, pp. 358–359 |isbn=1-891389-22-X |publisher=University Science Books |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[#Figure 3|Figure 3]]. To define a co-rotating frame, first an origin is selected from which the distance ''r(t)'' to the particle is defined. An axis of rotation is set up that is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particle, and passing through this origin. Then, at the selected moment ''t'', the rate of rotation of the co-rotating frame Ω is made to match the rate of rotation of the particle about this axis, ''dθ/dt''. The co-rotating frame applies only for a moment, and must be continuously re-selected as the particle moves. For more detail, see [[Polar coordinate system#Centrifugal and Coriolis terms|Polar coordinates, centrifugal and Coriolis terms]].

===Polar coordinates in a rotating frame of reference===
Next, the same approach is used to find the fictitious forces of a (non-inertial) rotating frame. For example, if a rotating polar coordinate system is adopted for use in a rotating frame of observation, both rotating at the same constant counterclockwise rate Ω, we find the equations of motion in this frame as follows: the radial coordinate in the rotating frame is taken as ''r'', but the angle θ' in the rotating frame changes with time:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta ' = \theta - \Omega t \ . &lt;/math&gt;
Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;\dot\theta ' = \dot\theta  - \Omega \ . &lt;/math&gt;
Plugging this result into the acceleration using the unit vectors of the previous section:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = \left[ \ddot r - r \left( \dot\theta ' +\Omega\right) ^2 \right] \hat{\mathbf{r}} + \left[ r\ddot\theta ' + 2\dot r \left(\dot\theta ' + \Omega \right) \right]\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=(\ddot r - r\dot\theta '^2)\hat{\mathbf{r}} + (r\ddot\theta' + 2\dot r \dot\theta ')\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} - \left( 2 r \Omega \dot\theta ' + r \Omega^2 \right)\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \left( 2 \dot r  \Omega \right)  \hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \ .  &lt;/math&gt;
The leading two terms are the same form as those in the inertial frame, and they are the only terms if the frame is ''not'' rotating, that is, if Ω=0. However, in this rotating frame we have the extra terms:&lt;ref name=Stommel5&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Coriolis Force |author1=Henry Stommel  |author2=Dennis W. Moore  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989 |isbn=0-231-06636-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JQx_t3yGB4C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22an+additional+centrifugal+%22force%22%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U2rCWI1cSoAXXliJk_WyJxH8fQiSA |page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;- \left( 2 r \Omega \dot\theta ' + r \Omega^2 \right)\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \left( 2 \dot r  \Omega \right)  \hat{\boldsymbol\theta}  &lt;/math&gt;
The radial term Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''r'' is the centrifugal force per unit mass due to the system's rotation at rate Ω and the radial term &lt;span style="vertical-align:20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;2 r \Omega \dot\theta '&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the radial component of the Coriolis force per unit mass, where &lt;span style="vertical-align:20%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;r \dot\theta '&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the tangential component of the particle velocity as seen in the rotating frame. The term &lt;span style="vertical-align:10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;- \left( 2 \dot r  \Omega \right)  \hat{\boldsymbol\theta}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the so-called ''azimuthal'' component of the Coriolis force per unit mass. In fact, these extra terms can be used to ''measure'' Ω and provide a test to see whether or not the frame is rotating, just as explained in the example of [[Rotating spheres|rotating identical spheres]]. If the particle's motion can be described by the observer using Newton's laws of motion ''without'' these Ω-dependent terms, the observer is in an [[inertial frame of reference]] where Ω=0.

These "extra terms" in the acceleration of the particle are the "state of motion" fictitious forces for this rotating frame, the forces introduced by rotation of the frame at angular rate Ω.&lt;ref name=Stommel2&gt;This derivation can be found in {{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Coriolis Force |author1=Henry Stommel |author2=Dennis W. Moore |page= Chapter III, pp. 54 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JQx_t3yGB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coriolis+inauthor:Stommel&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U0gX4wrzVzo7bwD7I8HJ_bd24e2Rg#PPA54,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this rotating frame, what are the "coordinate" fictitious forces? As before, suppose we choose to put only the second-order time derivatives on the right side of Newton's law:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} +m r\dot\theta '^2\hat{\mathbf{r}} -m 2\dot r \dot\theta '\hat{\boldsymbol\theta} +m \left( 2 r \Omega \dot\theta ' + r \Omega^2 \right)\hat{\mathbf{r}} - m\left( 2 \dot r  \Omega \right)  \hat{\boldsymbol\theta} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= m\ddot r\hat{\mathbf{r}}+ m r\ddot\theta'\ \hat{\boldsymbol\theta} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= m\tilde{\boldsymbol{a} }   &lt;/math&gt;

If we choose for convenience to treat &lt;span style="vertical-align:10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as some so-called "acceleration", then the terms &lt;span style="vertical-align:10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt; (  m r\dot\theta '^2\hat{\mathbf{r}} -m 2\dot r \dot\theta '\hat{\boldsymbol\theta})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are added to the so-called "fictitious force", which are not "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, but are actually components of force that persist even when Ω=0, that is, they persist even in an inertial frame of reference. Because these extra terms are added, the "coordinate" fictitious force is not the same as the "state-of-motion" fictitious force. Because of these extra terms, the "coordinate" fictitious force is not zero even in an inertial frame of reference.

====More on the co-rotating frame====
Notice however, the case of a rotating frame that happens to have the same angular rate as the particle, so that Ω = ''dθ/dt'' at some particular moment (that is, the polar coordinates are set up in the instantaneous, non-inertial co-rotating frame of [[#Figure 3|Figure 3]]). In this case, at this moment, ''dθ'/dt = 0''. In this co-rotating non-inertial frame at this moment the "coordinate" fictitious forces are only those due to the motion of the frame, that is, they are the same as the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, as discussed in the remarks about the co-rotating frame of [[#Figure 3|Figure 3]] in the previous section.

==Fictitious forces in curvilinear coordinates==

To quote Bullo and Lewis: "Only in exceptional circumstances can the configuration of Lagrangian system be described by a vector in a vector space. In the natural mathematical setting, the system's configuration space is described loosely as a curved space, or more accurately as a [[differentiable manifold]]."&lt;ref name=Bullo&gt;{{cite book |title=Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems |author1=Francesco Bullo |author2=Andrew D. Lewis |publisher= Springer |year=2005 |isbn=0-387-22195-6 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jg7VumxOoe4C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Coriolis+%22polar+coordinates%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA3,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of [[Cartesian coordinates]], when equations of motion are expressed in a [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear coordinate]] system, [[Christoffel symbol]]s appear in the acceleration of a particle expressed in this coordinate system, as described below in more detail. Consider description of a particle motion from the viewpoint of an ''inertial frame of reference'' in curvilinear coordinates. Suppose the position of a point ''P'' in Cartesian coordinates is (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and in curvilinear coordinates is (''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. ''q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''). Then functions exist that relate these descriptions:
:&lt;math&gt;x = x(q_1,\ q_2,\ q_3)\ ;&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;\ q_1 = q_1(x,\ y, \ z) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and so forth. (The number of dimensions may be larger than three.) An important aspect of such coordinate systems is the element of arc length that allows distances to be determined. If the curvilinear coordinates form an [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal coordinate]] system, the element of arc length ''ds'' is expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{d} \left( h_{k}\right)^{2} \left( dq_{k} \right)^{2} \ ,  &lt;/math&gt;
where the quantities ''h&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are called ''scale factors''.&lt;ref name =Feshbach&gt;{{cite book |title=Methods of Mathematical Physics |author1=PM Morse  |author2=H Feshbach  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=McGraw Hill |page=25 |edition =First |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; A change ''dq&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' causes a displacement ''h&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; dq&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' along the coordinate line for ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. At a point ''P'', we place unit vectors '''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''  each tangent to a coordinate line of a variable ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then any vector can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors, for example, from an inertial frame of reference, the position vector of a moving particle '''r''' located at time ''t'' at position ''P'' becomes:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{r} =\sum_{k=1}^{d} q_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vector [[dot product]] of '''r''' and '''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''.
The velocity '''v''' of a particle at ''P'', can be expressed at ''P'' as:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v} =\sum_{k=1}^{d} v_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} \, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d}{dt}\boldsymbol {r} =\sum_{k=1}^{d} \dot q_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} + \sum_{k=1}^{d} q_k \  \dot{\boldsymbol{e_k}}  \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vector [[dot product]] of '''v''' and '''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''', and over dots indicate time differentiation.
The time derivatives of the basis vectors can be expressed in terms of the scale factors introduced above. for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial q_2} \boldsymbol {e_1} = -\boldsymbol{e}_2 \frac{1}{h_2}\frac{\partial h_1}{\partial q_2} -\boldsymbol{e}_3 \frac{1}{h_3}\frac{\partial h_1}{\partial q_3} \ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp;or, in general  &lt;math&gt; \frac { \partial \boldsymbol{e_j} } { \partial q_k} = \sum_{n=1}^{d} {\Gamma^n}_{kj}\boldsymbol{e_n} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
in which the coefficients of the unit vectors are the [[Christoffel symbols]] for the coordinate system. The general notation and formulas for the Christoffel symbols are:&lt;ref name =Feshbach2&gt;{{cite book |title=Methods of Mathematical Physics |author1=PM Morse  |author2=H Feshbach  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=McGraw Hill |pages=47–48 |edition =First |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite book |title=Continuum mechanics |author=I-Shih Liu |page= Appendix A2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gWqM4uMV6wC&amp;pg=PT307&amp;dq=CHristoffel+centrifugal&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1dNjYh273fApEPFhrIf5Y2r7_e4Q#PPT291,M1

::&lt;math&gt;=\sum_{k=1}^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} {\Gamma^k}_{ij}\dot q_i \boldsymbol{e_k}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
which allows all the time derivatives to be evaluated. For example, for the velocity:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v} =\frac{d}{dt}\boldsymbol {r} =\sum_{k=1}^{d} \dot q_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} + \sum_{k=1}^{d} q_k \  \dot{\boldsymbol{e_k}}   &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\sum_{k=1}^{d} \dot q_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} + \sum_{j=1}^{d} q_j \  \dot{\boldsymbol{e_j}}  , &lt;/math&gt;

with the Γ-notation for the Christoffel symbols replacing the curly bracket notation.
Using the same approach, the acceleration is then
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{a} = \frac{d}{dt} \boldsymbol{v} = \sum_{k=1}^{d} \dot v_k \  \boldsymbol{e_k} + \sum_{k=1}^{d} v_k \  \dot{\boldsymbol{e_k}}  \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Looking at the relation for acceleration, the first summation contains the time derivatives of velocity, which would be associated with acceleration if these were Cartesian coordinates, and the second summation (the one with Christoffel symbols) contains terms related to the way the unit vectors change with time.&lt;ref name=Silberstein2&gt;For application of the Christoffel symbols formalism to a rotating coordinate system, see {{cite book |author=Ludwik Silberstein |title=The Theory of General Relativity and Gravitation |pages=30–32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=C1SwFdj_kGUC&amp;dq=CHristoffel+centrifugal&amp;jtp=29#PRA1-PA30,M1

==="State-of-motion" &lt;span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:109%; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal;"&gt;versus&lt;/span&gt; "coordinate" fictitious forces===
[[#Fictitious_forces_in_polar_coordinates|Earlier]] in this article a distinction was introduced between two terminologies, the fictitious forces that vanish in an inertial frame of reference are called in this article the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces and those that originate from differentiation in a particular coordinate system are called "coordinate" fictitious forces. Using the expression for the acceleration above, Newton's law of motion in the inertial frame of reference becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol {F} =m\boldsymbol{a} =m  \sum_{k=1}^{d} \left(\dot v_k \   + \sum_{j=1}^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d}v_j{\Gamma^k}_{ij}\dot q_i    \right)\boldsymbol{e_k}  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where '''''F''''' is the net real force on the particle. No "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are present because the frame is inertial, and "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are zero in an inertial frame, by definition.

The "coordinate" approach to Newton's law above is to retain the second-order time derivatives of the coordinates {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} as the only terms on the right side of this equation, motivated more by mathematical convenience than by physics. To that end, the force law can be rewritten, taking the second summation to the force-side of the equation as:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol {F}   -m \sum_{j=1}^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d}v_j{\Gamma^k}_{ij}\dot q_i    \boldsymbol{e_k}  =m\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
with the convention that the "acceleration" &lt;span style="vertical-align:10%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is now:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}} = \sum_{k=1}^{d} \dot v_k\boldsymbol{e_k}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;
In the expression above, the summation added to the force-side of the equation now is treated as if added "forces" were present. These summation terms are customarily called fictitious forces within this "coordinate" approach, although in this inertial frame of reference all "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are identically zero. Moreover, these "forces" do not transform under coordinate transformations as ''vectors''. Thus, the designation of the terms of the summation as "fictitious forces" uses this terminology for contributions that are completely different from any real force, and from the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces. What adds to this confusion is that these "coordinate" fictitious forces are divided into two groups and given the ''same names'' as the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, that is, they are divided into "centrifugal" and "Coriolis" terms, despite their inclusion of terms that are not the "state-of-motion" centrifugal and Coriolis terms. For example, these "coordinate" centrifugal and Coriolis terms can be nonzero ''even in an inertial frame of reference'' where the "state-of-motion" centrifugal force (the subject of this article) and Coriolis force always are zero.&lt;ref name=Silberstein&gt;For a more extensive criticism of lumping together the two types of fictitious force, see {{cite book |author=Ludwik Silberstein |title=The Theory of General Relativity and Gravitation |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=C1SwFdj_kGUC&amp;dq=CHristoffel+centrifugal&amp;jtp=29#PRA1-PA29,M1
|publisher=D. Van Nostrand |year=1922  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the frame is not inertial, for example, in a rotating frame of reference, the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are included in the above "coordinate" fictitious force expression.&lt;ref name=note&gt;See Silberstein.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the "acceleration" expressed in terms of first-order time derivatives of the velocity happens to result in terms that are ''not'' simply second-order derivatives of the coordinates {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} in time, then these terms that are not second-order also are brought to the force-side of the equation and included with the fictitious forces. From the standpoint of a Lagrangian formulation, they can be called [[Generalized force|''generalized'']] fictitious forces. See Hildebrand,&lt;ref name=Hildebrand/&gt; for example.

Formulation of dynamics in terms of Christoffel symbols and the "coordinate" version of fictitious forces is used often in the design of [[robotics|robots]] in connection with a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian formulation]] of the equations of motion.&lt;ref name=Ge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;See {{cite book |title= Control of robot manipulators in joint space |author1=R.

The '''Monte Alto photovoltaic power plant''' in Spain has a generating capacity of 9.55 megawatts peak (MWp) and will generate 14 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per annum.  It cost 65 million euros [US$87 million].&lt;ref name="acc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=47844 |title=ACCIONA Inaugurates Solar Garden with 9.55 MWp Capacity |publisher=Renewableenergyaccess.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation covers an area of 51 hectares on agricultural land near the locality of Milagro ([[Navarre]]) and contains 889 solar structures, of which 864 are equipped with automated solar tracking. The rest are fixed structures adapted to the relief of the terrain.&lt;ref name="acc" /&gt;

In five years [[Acciona Energy]] has developed seven "solar gardens" in Navarre with a total capacity of 20 MWp, and another two are under construction in Castilla-La Mancha. Overall, the company's installed capacity is 23 megawatts (MW), through the approximately 3,000 automated solar monitoring structures, and represents a total investment of 177 million euros [US$236 million] shared among more than 2,000 owners. The yield from these investments is somewhere between 8 and 10% and the payback of the investment is estimated at around 10 years.&lt;ref name="acc" /&gt;

Many metal oxides and sulfides have non-stoichiometric examples; for example, stoichiometric iron(II) oxide, which is rare, has the formula FeO, whereas the more common material is nonstoichiometric, with the formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O. The type of equilibrium defects in non-stoichiometric compounds can vary with attendant variation in bulk properties of the material.&lt;ref name=geng&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geng |first1=Hua Y. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Anomalies in nonstoichiometric uranium dioxide induced by a pseudo phase transition of point defects |journal=[[Phys.

&lt;!--
However, transition metal oxides are not the only examples of deviations from stoichiometry. It is expected to be a general feature of crystalline compounds. Some examples are provided by eighty binary systems which form a single, essentially ordered, crystalline compound near fifty atomic percent in which the deviation from stoichiometry (a strict 50% composition) are important and clearly evident, but (with the exception of SnTe(c)) are well below one atomic percent. The temperature-atom fraction phase diagrams of these systems show what appears to be a line compound at 50% with the normal resolution used on the composition axis. These are N:(8-N) compounds such as I-VIIs(e.g. NaCl, KCl,etc.), the II-VIs(CdSe,CdTe), IIB-VIs(PbS,PbSe,PbTe), and III-Vs(GaAs,InAs,GaSb). At high temperatures, but below the compound melting point the AB(c) compound is in equilibrium with either an A-rich or B-rich liquid and a gas phase. In either case, at equilibrium the chemical potential of A must be the same in all three phases and similarly for element B. The difference in the chemical potential of say element B for the liquid phase in equilibrium with AB(c) at a given temperature would not appear to be remarkable because of the significant difference in composition of the liquids. It appears striking for AB(c) because of the narrow homogeneity range of AB(c). The partial pressures of diatomic selenium and of tellurium have been determined for a number of selenides and tellurides by measuring the UV-VIS absorption of the gas phase. The arsenic pressure over a number of arsenides has been measured also. The results are usually shown on a log pressure-reciprocal temperature plot and show a parabola-like three phase curve ending at the melting point on the high temperature side. Along this curve AB(c), the liquid and gas phases coexist. Sufficiently below the AB(c) melting point this loop is typically a few decades wide in pressure. Many of the compounds from the II-VI, IIB-VI, and II-V compounds are semiconductors whose electrical properties are significantly affected by the deviations from stoichiometry. The A-saturated compound is usually n-type indicating an excess of element A through the incorporation of vacant sites in the B sublattice or A atoms in interstitial sites acting as donors in the electronic energy band structure. Similarly the B saturated AB(c) is B rich and p-type through the incorporation of vacant sites in the A sublattice or B atoms in interstitial sites acting as acceptors. Control of the electrical properties requires not only control of the concentration of foreign atoms but also control of the deviation from stoichiometry through equilibration with vapor phase.

==Defects vs non-stoichiometry==
The cuprate superconductors highlight the concept of "defect" structures, which is related to non-stoichiometry.  YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; can be viewed as a variant of the [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite family]] of materials, which have idealized stoichiometry ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  For the cuprates, Y + Ba occupy "A sites" whereas Cu occupies the "B sites". The non-defect material would have the stoichiometry   YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.  Using this way of describing a structure, W&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;118&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be a defect variant of WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Iron oxides===
Nonstoichiometry is pervasive for [[metal]] [[oxides]], especially when the metal is not in its highest [[oxidation state]].&lt;ref name="GreenwoodEarnshaw12"&gt;N. N. Greenwood &amp; A. Earnshaw, 2012, "Chemistry of the Elements," 2nd Edn., Amsterdam, NH, NLD:Elsevier, {{ISBN|0080501095}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0080501095], accessed 8 July 2015. [Page numbers marked by superscript, inline.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|642–644}} For example, although [[wüstite]] ([[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous oxide]]) has an ideal ([[stoichiometric]]) formula FeO, the actual stoichiometry is closer to Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The non-stoichiometry reflect the ease of oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; effectively replacing a small portion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with two thirds their number of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus for every three "missing" Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the crystal contains two Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to balance the charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a continuous manner over a narrow range.  Thus, the formula for wüstite is written as Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;O, where ''x'' is a small number (0.05 in the previous example) representing the deviation from the "ideal" formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lesley E. Smart|title=Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction, 3rd edition|publisher= CRC Press|year= 2005|page= 214|isbn=978-0-7487-7516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonstoichiometry is especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate mistakes.  To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric.  But for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-stoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition.

===Iron sulfides===
[[File:Pyrrhotite Mexique.jpg|thumb|200px|Pyrrhotite, an example of a non-stoichiometric [[inorganic compound]], with formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;S (''x'' = 0 to 0.2).]]
The monosulfides of the transition metals are often nonstoichiometric. Best known perhaps is nominally iron(II) sulfide (the mineral [[pyrrhotite]]) with a composition Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;S (''x'' = 0 to 0.2). The rare stoichiometric FeS [[Endmember (mineralogy)|endmember]] is known as the mineral ''[[troilite]]''. Pyrrhotite is remarkable in that it has numerous [[polytypes]], i.e. crystalline forms differing in symmetry ([[monoclinic]] or [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]) and composition (Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and others). These materials are always iron-deficient owing to the presence of lattice defects, namely iron vacancies. Despite those defects, the composition is usually expressed as a ratio of large numbers and the crystals symmetry is relatively high. This means the iron vacancies are not randomly scattered over the crystal, but form certain regular configurations. Those vacancies strongly affect the magnetic properties of pyrrhotite: the magnetism increases with the concentration of vacancies and is absent for the stoichiometric FeS.&lt;ref name=structure&gt;{{cite book |pages=382–390 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy2_QnyojPYC&amp;pg=PA383 |title=Geochemistry of hydrothermal ore deposits |author=Hubert Lloyd Barnes |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-57144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palladium hydrides===
[[Palladium hydride]] is a nonstoichiometric material of the approximate composition PdH&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (0.02 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 0.58).  This solid conducts hydrogen by virtue of the mobility of the hydrogen atoms within the solid.

===Tungsten oxides===
It is sometimes difficult to determine if a material is non-stoichiometric or if the formula is best represented by large numbers.  The oxides of tungsten illustrate this situation.  Starting from the idealized material [[tungsten trioxide]], one can generate a series of related materials that are slightly deficient in oxygen.  These oxygen-deficient species can be described as WO&lt;sub&gt;3−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, but in fact they are stoichiometric species with large unit cells with the formulas W&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' = 20, 24, 25, 40.  Thus, the last species can be described with the stoichiometric formula W&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;118&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the non-stoichiometric description  WO&lt;sub&gt;2.95&lt;/sub&gt; implies a more random distribution of oxide vacancies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Other cases===
At high temperatures (1000&amp;nbsp;°C), [[titanium sulfide]]s present a series of non-stoichiometric compounds.&lt;ref name=GreenwoodEarnshaw12/&gt;{{rp|679}}

The [[coordination polymer]] [[Prussian blue]], nominally Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; and their analogs are well known to form in non-stoichiometric proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Metal-Organic and Organic Molecular Magnets {{Aut|Peter Day, Alan E Underhill}} Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007, {{ISBN|1847551394}}, {{ISBN|9781847551399}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|114}} The non-stoichiometric phases exhibit useful properties vis-à-vis their ability to bind [[caesium]] and [[thallium]] ions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Applications==

===Oxidation catalysis===
Many useful compounds are produced by the reactions of [[hydrocarbon]]s with [[oxygen]], a conversion that is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by metal oxides.  The process operates via the transfer of "lattice" oxygen to the hydrocarbon substrate, a step that temporarily generates a vacancy (or defect).  In a subsequent step, the missing oxygen is replenished by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Such catalysts rely on the ability of the metal oxide to form phases that are not stoichiometric.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;Atkins, P. W.; Overton, T. L.; Rourke, J. P.; Weller, M. T.; Armstrong, F. A., 2010, ''Shriver and Atkins' Inorganic Chemistry'' 5th Edn., pp.&amp;nbsp;65, 75, 99f, 268, 271, 277, 287, 356, 409, Oxford, OXF, GBR: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199236178}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199236178], accessed 8 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  An analogous sequence of events describes other kinds of atom-transfer reactions including [[hydrogenation]] and [[hydrodesulfurization]] catalysed by solid catalysts.  These considerations also highlight the fact that stoichiometry is determined by the interior of crystals: the surfaces of crystals often do not follow the stoichiometry of the bulk.  The complex structures on surfaces are described by the term "surface reconstruction".

===Ion conduction===
The migration of atoms within a solid is strongly influenced by the defects associated with non-stoichiometry.  These defect sites provide pathways for atoms and ions to migrate through the otherwise dense ensemble of atoms that form the crystals.  Oxygen sensors and solid state batteries  are two applications that rely on oxide vacancies.  One example is the [[Ceria|CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based]] sensor in automotive exhaust systems.  At low partial pressures of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the sensor allows the introduction of increased air to effect more thorough combustion.&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt;

===Superconductivity===
{{main|Cuprate superconductor}}
Many superconductors are non-stoichiometric. For example, [[yttrium barium copper oxide]], arguably the most notable [[high-temperature superconductor]], is a non-stoichiometric solid with the formula Y&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. The critical temperature of the superconductor depends on the exact value of ''x''.  The stoichiometric species has ''x'' = 0, but this value can be as great as 1.&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt;
&lt;!--
==Non-stoichiometry vs. inhomogeneity==
Non-stoichiometry, which is change in the composition at the atomic scale, should be distinguished from macroscopic sample inhomogeneity and associated measurement artifacts. The chemical composition of materials is often measured using high-energy particles (electrons, ions, X-rays, etc.) as the probes. Those particles have different penetration depths into the studied material and often have limited accuracy (~10%). When applied to a chemically reactive material, they can falsely evaluate it as non-stoichiometric. Let us consider a metal, such as aluminium. In air, it is covered by nanometer-thick natural oxide Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Surface sensitive techniques will detect stoichiometric Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Techniques probing beyond the oxide would detect a non-stoichiometric oxide, and the bulk analysis methods would yield (almost) pure aluminum. Because of such measurement problems, the composition of most thin films is measured as non-stoichiometric.

==History==

It was mainly through the work of [[Nikolai Semenovich Kurnakov]] and his students that Berthollet's opposition to [[Law of definite proportions|Proust's law]] was shown to have merit for many solid compounds. Kurnakov divided non-stoichiometric compounds into ''berthollides''  and ''daltonides'' depending on whether their properties showed monotonic behavior with respect to composition or not. The term berthollide was accepted by IUPAC in 1960.&lt;ref name="Khitarov"&gt;The Rare Earth Trifluorides, Part 2 Arxius de les Seccions de Ciències {{Aut|Dmitrii N. Khitarov, Boris Pavlovich Sobolev, Irina V. Alexeeva}}, Institut d'Estudis Catalans, 2000, p75ff. {{ISBN|847283610X}}, {{ISBN|9788472836105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names come from [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] and [[John Dalton]], respectively, who in the 19th century advocated rival theories of the composition of substances.  Although Dalton "won" for the most part, it was later recognized that the law of definite proportions had important exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|title=The Historical Background of Chemistry|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1971|page= 153|isbn=9780486610535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Power Systems''' designs, manufactures, and sells [[wind turbines]], and provides engineering development services and technology licenses for energy applications, into the global marketplace. The company was founded in 1974, and has since grown into a multinational corporation headquartered in [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]], with European headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland and a significant presence in the United Kingdom and Italy.

==History==
Today's Northern Power Systems was started in 1974 in [[Warren, Vermont]], as Northwind Power Company.&lt;ref name="mht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2009/10/19/daily57-Wind-Power-Holdings-raises-45M.html|title=Wind Power Holdings raises $45M|publisher=Mass High Tech|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders hitchhiked to Colorado, Minnesota, and North Dakota to buy secondhand Jacobs wind plants. They trucked the wind turbines to Vermont where they reconditioned them for resale as the North Wind “Eagle.”

In 1978, North Wind was awarded a U.S. Department of Energy contract to develop a high-reliability 2&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine for the growing telecommunications market. As a result of that work, North Wind developed its HR2 wind turbine, a three-bladed, horizontal axis up wind rotor configuration utilizing a slow-speed, direct-drive 2.2&amp;nbsp;kW alternator. This small wind turbine soon gained international market acceptance as one of the most rugged, high-reliability wind turbines available. Over 600 HR2 and its successor HR3 wind turbines were sold over approximately 20 years of production. Northern Power wind turbines have been installed in over 40 countries on all seven continents, with many still operational today.

In 1986, the team continued its DOE-sponsored research and development work, but also began to design, fabricate, and install high-reliability hybrid power systems for remote applications using gas- and diesel-fired reciprocating engine generators, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and battery banks for energy storage.

In the summer of 2008, the Vermont-based company was acquired by its current owners who have invested over $100 million into Northern Power Systems over the past several years (2008 – to date). Major shareholders include Rockport Capital, Allen &amp; Company and BeCapital.
Today Northern Power Systems continues plans for aggressive growth with support from some of the most trusted and well-known financial partners in the industry.

== Products ==

'''Petroleum-Gas University of Ploieşti''' (''Universitatea Petrol-Gaze'', ''UPG'') is a public university in Ploiești, [[Romania]]. Founded in 1948 under the name of Institute of Petroleum and Gas, in response to the increasing industrialization in Romania and the lack of high level education in the petroleum and gas fields, it gained fast the status of university, hence changing its name to the actual one in 1993 and extending with new faculties and departments in the field of economic sciences and humanities.

The UPG's academic structure includes 5 faculties: Faculty of Petroleum and Gas Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Petroleum Technology and Petrochemistry, Faculty of Economic Sciences and Faculty of Letters and Sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10517">A '''plasma afterglow'''  (also '''afterglow''') is the radiation emitted from a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] after the source of ionization is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmadictionary.llnl.gov/terms.lasso?-MaxRecords=1&amp;-SkipRecords=6&amp;-SortField=Term&amp;-SortOrder=ascending&amp;page=detail |title=Plasma Dictionary |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=2014-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817123607/http://plasmadictionary.llnl.gov/terms.lasso?-MaxRecords=1&amp;-SkipRecords=6&amp;-SortField=Term&amp;-SortOrder=ascending&amp;page=detail |archivedate=2014-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The external [[electromagnetic field]]s that sustained the plasma glow are absent or insufficient to maintain the discharge in the afterglow.  A plasma afterglow can either be a temporal, due to an interrupted (pulsed) plasma source, or spatial, due to a distant plasma source.  In the afterglow, plasma-generated species de-excite and participate in secondary chemical reactions that tend to form stable species. Depending on the gas composition, super-elastic collisions may continue to sustain the plasma in the afterglow for a while by releasing the energy stored in [[rovibronic excitation|rovibronic]] degrees of freedom of the atoms and molecules of the plasma. Especially in molecular gases, the plasma [[chemistry]] in the afterglow is significantly different from the plasma glow. The afterglow of a plasma is still a plasma and as thus retains most of the properties of a plasma.

== History ==
The first published pictures of plasma afterglow were taken in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1953-12-01|title=Electron Shadowgraphs and Afterglow Pictures of Gas Jets at Low Densities|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=24|issue=12|pages=1527–1528|doi=10.1063/1.1721218|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=1953JAP....24.1527G|last1=Grün|first1=A. E|last2=Schopper|first2=E|last3=Schumacher|first3=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helium afterglow, one of the most commonly used forms of afterglow, was first described in 1963 by  Arthur L. Schmeltekopf Jr. and  H. P. Broida.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1963-09-01|title=Short‐Duration Visible Afterglow in Helium|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1261–1268|doi=10.1063/1.1734425|issn=0021-9606|bibcode=1963JChPh..39.1261S|last1=Schmeltekopf|first1=Arthur L|last2=Broida|first2=H. P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flowing afterglow ionization studies began in the early 1960s in an effort to understand atmospheric ion chemistry. At the time stationary afterglow studies had already been done however this approach was limited by lack of versatility and lacked consistency as studies done prior to 1964 showed common atmospheric reactions to have drastically differing reaction rates between studies. [[Flowing-afterglow mass spectrometry|Flowing-afterglow]] was then used to more precisely describe the [[Reaction rate constant|rate constants]] of common atmospheric reactions

==  Remote plasma ==
[[File:B-pab-remoteplasmasystem.svg|thumb|Basic remote plasma diagram]]
A [[remote plasma]] refers to a plasma that is spatially separated from the external electromagnetic fields that initiate the discharge. An afterglow is a remote plasma if the plasma is channeled away from the original plasma source.

An advantage that remote plasma has over temporal plasma is that remote plasma can be used as a continuous plasma source and thus has more applications in supplying reagent ions for most systems.

Remote plasmas are often used in the field of analytical chemistry when a constant stream of ions is required. They are also very commonly used a method of cleaning complex vacuum systems without having to take them apart.

== Temporal plasma ==
A temporal plasma refers to an afterglow from a plasma source that is time delineated. Removing the source of excitation allows for an afterglow to be present in the same space that the initial plasma was excited for a short time.

An advantage that temporal plasma has over remote plasma is that it can be contained in a closed system and thus makes controlling the temperature and pressure is easier.

Temporal plasma is often used to replicate ionic reactions in atmospheric conditions in a controlled environment.

== Applications ==

=== Flowing afterglow  ===

=== Stationary afterglow ===
Stationary afterglow (SA) is a technique for studying remote plasma that consist of a gaseous mixture inside a bulb that is subjected to an ionizing pulse. After said ionizing pulse the ion composition of the mixture is measured as a function of time at the wall of the containing bulb.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1992" /&gt; Stationary afterglow methods are often used to study atmospheric reactions as they mimic atmospheric conditions in a controlled environment.

=== Sterilization ===
Plasma afterglow has shown to be an effective means of cleaning and sterilizing difficult to take apart machinery and glassware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-06-01|title=Treatment surfaces with atomic oxygen excited in dielectric barrier discharge plasma of O2 admixed to N2|journal=AIP Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=022157|doi=10.1063/1.4732120|bibcode=2012AIPA....2b2157S|last1=Shun'Ko|first1=E.

When oxygen is used as the carrier gas, ionized oxygen species react with heavier organic compounds to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO. These products are then easily vented from the system effectively removing organic contaminants from the system.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pizzi; K. L. Mittal (2003).

This plasma cleaning method is especially effective for [[chemical vapor deposition]] methods where cleanliness is a key part of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237127127|title=Advances in Remote Plasma Sources For Cleaning 300 mm and Flat Panel CVD Systems|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6318">'''Pulsed operation of lasers''' refers to any [[laser]] not classified as continuous wave, so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some [[Frequency|repetition rate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William T. Silfvast|Silfvast, William T.]] (1996). ''Laser Fundamentals'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-55617-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses a wide range of technologies addressing a number of different motivations. Some lasers are pulsed simply because they cannot be run in [[Laser#Continuous wave operation|continuous]] mode.

In other cases the application requires the production of pulses having as large an energy as possible. Since the pulse [[energy]] is equal to the average power divided by the repetition rate, this goal can sometimes be satisfied by lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between pulses. In [[laser ablation]] for example, a small volume of material at the surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time, whereas supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.

Other applications rely on the peak pulse power (rather than the energy in the pulse), especially in order to obtain [[nonlinear optical]] effects. For a given pulse energy, this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration utilizing techniques such as [[Q-switching]].

The optical [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[pulse (physics)|pulse]] cannot be narrower than the reciprocal of the pulse width. In the case of extremely short pulses, that implies lasing over a considerable bandwidth, quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of CW lasers. The lasing medium in some ''dye lasers'' and ''vibronic solid-state lasers'' produces optical gain over a wide bandwidth, making a laser possible which can thus generate pulses of light as short as a few [[femtoseconds]].

== Q-switching ==
{{Main article|Q-switching}}

In a Q-switched laser, the population inversion is allowed to build up by introducing loss inside the resonator which exceeds the gain of the medium; this can also be described as a reduction of the quality factor or 'Q' of the cavity. Then, after the pump energy stored in the laser medium has approached the maximum possible level, the introduced loss mechanism (often an electro- or acousto-optical element) is rapidly removed (or that occurs by itself in a passive device), allowing lasing to begin which rapidly obtains the stored energy in the gain medium. This results in a short pulse incorporating that energy, and thus a high peak power.

==Mode-locking==
{{Main article|Mode-locking}}
A mode-locked laser is capable of emitting extremely short pulses on the order of tens of [[picosecond]]s down to less than 10 [[femtoseconds]]. These pulses will repeat at the round trip time, that is, the time that it takes light to complete one round trip between the mirrors comprising the resonator. Due to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|Fourier limit]] (also known as energy-time [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty]]), a pulse of such short temporal length has a spectrum spread over a considerable bandwidth. Thus such a [[gain medium]] must have a gain bandwidth sufficiently broad to amplify those frequencies. An example of a suitable material is [[titanium]]-doped, artificially grown [[sapphire]] ([[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]) which has a very wide gain bandwidth and can thus produce pulses of only a few femtoseconds duration.

Such mode-locked lasers are a most versatile tool for researching processes occurring on extremely short time scales (known as femtosecond physics, [[femtosecond chemistry]] and [[ultrafast science]]), for maximizing the effect of [[nonlinear optics|nonlinearity]] in optical materials (e.g. in [[second-harmonic generation]], [[parametric down-conversion]], [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and the like) due to the large peak power, and in ablation applications.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Again, because of the extremely short pulse duration, such a laser will produce pulses which achieve an extremely high peak power.

==Pulsed pumping==
Another method of achieving pulsed laser operation is to pump the laser material with a source that is itself pulsed, either through electronic charging in the case of flash lamps, or another laser which is already pulsed. Pulsed pumping was historically used with dye lasers where the inverted population lifetime of a dye molecule was so short that a high energy, fast pump was needed. The way to overcome this problem was to charge up large [[capacitors]] which are then switched to discharge through [[flashlamp]]s, producing an intense flash. Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state. These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.

== Pulsed lasers in soft-tissue surgery ==
When a laser beam comes into contact with [[Soft tissue|soft-tissue]], one important factor is to not overheat surrounding tissue, so [[necrosis]] can be prevented.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Choi|first = B.|last2 = Welch|first2 = A.

A '''reverse vending machine''' is a device that accepts used (empty) [[beverage containers]] and returns money to the user. The machines are popular in places that have mandatory [[recycling]] laws or [[container deposit legislation]]. In some places, bottlers paid funds into a centralized pool to be disbursed to people who recycled the containers.  Any excess funds were to be used for general environmental cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bottlebill.com/ |title=Bottle Bill Resource Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=bottlebill.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, such as [[Norway]], the state mandated that a vendor pay for recycled bottles, but left the system in the hands of private industry.

==Operation==
[[File:Pantemaskin.webm|thumb|Video clip showing a reverse vending machine in Norway.]]
The recycler places the empty bottle or can into the receiving aperture; the horizontal in-feed system allows the user to insert containers one at a time. (An alternative system, found in many older machines, is one in which the user opens a door by hand and places the empty container in a pan. When the door is released and closed, the process continues.) The bottle or can is then automatically rotated; the bottle/can is then scanned by an omnidirectional [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] scanner, which scans the beverage container's [[Universal Product Code|UPC]].		
 	
Once a container is scanned, identified (matched to database) and determined to be a participating container, it is processed and typically crushed (for one-time-use containers) to reduce its size, to avoid spillages of liquid and to increase storage capacity. Refillable containers are collected and sorted by hand to be brought back to the bottling company.  The machines can use [[material recognition]] instead of/as well as a [[bar code scanner]] when needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reversevending.co.uk Description of use of a reverse vending machine from reVend, UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first patent for a "Bottle Return and Handling Machine" was filed in the United States in 1920.&lt;ref name="ReverseVending_About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reversevending.co.uk/About_Reverse_Vending.html |title=About Reverse Vending Machines |publisher=Reverse Vending |accessdate=2014-09-12 |quote=The first patent for a “Empty Container Return and Handling Machine” with a coin return mechanism was filed in America on 13th September 1920 by Elmer M Jones and Sue Walker Vance.

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''solar vehicle''' is an [[electric vehicle]] powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]]. Usually, [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]]. The term "solar vehicle" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. [[Solar power]] may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions.

Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and [[Electric boat|solar boats]] are available commercially.

===Solar cars===
{{Main|Solar car}}
 
Solar cars depend on PV cells to convert sunlight into electricity to drive electric motors. Unlike solar thermal energy which converts solar energy to heat, PV cells directly convert sunlight into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[Car Battery Charger+Solar Powered Charger"][http://www.solarpondaeration.com/gowe-100w-foldable-solar-panel12v-car-battery-chargersolar-powered/ http://www.solarpondaeration.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of a solar car is severely limited by the amount of energy input into the car. Solar cars are built for [[solar car racing|solar car races]] and also for public use  [[List of prototype solar-powered cars]]. Even the best solar cells can only collect limited power and energy over the area of a car's surface. This limits solar cars to ultralight composite bodies to save weight. Solar cars lack the safety and convenience features of conventional vehicles. The first solar family car was built in 2013 by students in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/06-02-2015-solar-team-eindhoven-wins-crunchie-in-san-francisco/ Solar Team Eindhoven wins Crunchie in San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle is capable of 550 miles on one charge during sunlight. It weighs 850 pounds and has a 1.5kw solar array.  Solar vehicles must be light and efficient.  3,000 pound or even 2,000 pound vehicles are less practical. [[Stella (solar vehicles)|Stella Lux]], the predecessor to Stella, broke a record with a 932 mile single charge range. The Dutch are trying to commercialize this technology. During racing Stella Lux is capable of 700 miles during daylight. At 45&amp;nbsp;mph Stella Lux has infinite range. This is again due to high efficiency including a [[Drag coefficient|Coefficient of drag]] of .16.  The average family who never drive more than 200 miles a day would never need to charge from the mains.  They would only plug in if they wanted to return energy to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/the-first-four-seater-solar-powered-vehicle-hits-the-u-s-road/ | title=The First Four-Seater, Solar-Powered Vehicle Hits the U.S. Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3BTzYhjYQ | title=Solar Team Eindhoven - 2013 year clip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarteameindhoven.nl/stella-lux/stella-2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127025453/http://solarteameindhoven.nl/stella-lux/stella-2013/ |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/10/20131013-stella-1.html | title=Eindhoven wins world championship for solar-powered family cars in World Solar Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Solar cars are often fitted with gauges and/or [[telemetry|wireless telemetry]], to carefully monitor the car's energy consumption, solar energy capture and other parameters. Wireless telemetry is typically preferred as it frees the driver to concentrate on driving, which can be dangerous in such a small, lightweight car. The Solar Electric Vehicle system was designed and engineered as an easy to install (2 to 3 hours) integrated accessory system with a custom molded low profile solar module, supplemental battery pack and a proven charge controlling system.

As an alternative, a battery-powered electric vehicle may use a solar array to recharge; the array may be connected to the general electrical distribution grid.

===Solar buses===
{{Main|Solar bus}}
Solar buses are propulsed by solar energy, all or part of which is collected from stationary solar panel installations. The [[Tindo]] bus is a 100% solar bus that operates as [[free public transport]] service in [[Adelaide]] City as an initiative of the City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |title=All-Electric, Solar-Powered, Free Bus!!! |publisher=Ecogeek.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908184215/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services which use [[electric bus]]es that are partially powered by solar panels installed on the bus roof, intended to reduce energy consumption and to prolong the life cycle of the rechargable battery of the electric bus, have been put in place in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |title=China Reveals New Solar Buses |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009112858/http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar buses are to be distinguished from conventional buses in which electric functions of the bus such as lighting, heating or air-conditioning, but not the propulsion itself, are fed by solar energy. Such systems are more widespread as they allow bus companies to meet specific regulations, for example the [[anti-idling]] laws that are in force in several of the US states, and can be retrofitted to existing vehicle batteries without changing the conventional engine.

===Single-track vehicles===
The first solar "cars" were actually tricycles or [[Quadracycle]]s built with bicycle technology. These were called solarmobiles at the first solar race, the [[Tour de Sol]] in Switzerland in 1985. With 72 participants, half used solar power exclusively while the other half used solar-human-powered hybrids. A few true solar bicycles were built, either with a large solar roof, a small rear panel, or a trailer with a solar panel. Later more practical solar bicycles were built with foldable panels to be set up only during parking. Even later the panels were left at home, feeding into the electric mains, and the bicycles charged from the mains. Today highly developed [[electric bicycles]] are available and these use so little power that it costs little to buy the equivalent amount of solar electricity. The "solar" has evolved from actual hardware to an indirect accounting system. The same system also works for electric motorcycles, which were also first developed for the [[Tour de Sol]].

===Applications===
The Venturi Astrolab in 2006 was the world's first commercial electro-solar hybrid car, and was originally due to be released in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetell.com/2006/10/the-first-commercial-solar-electric-hybrid-car/ |title=The first commercial solar-electric hybrid car |publisher=Gadgetell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 a partnership of Canadian companies led by Hymotion altered a [[Toyota Prius]] to use solar cells to generate up to 240 watts of electrical power in full sunshine. This is reported as permitting up to 15&amp;nbsp;km extra range on a sunny summer day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2007/16/c9889.html |title=Hymotion modified Prius using solar power |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while using only the electric motors.

An inventor from Michigan, USA built a street legal, licensed, insured, solar charged electric scooter in 2005. It had a top speed controlled at a bit over 30&amp;nbsp;mph, and used fold-out solar panels to charge the batteries while parked.&lt;ref name=scooter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/PV/pvscooter.htm |title=PVScooter |publisher=Builditsolar.com |date=2005-04-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auxiliary power===
Photovoltaic modules are used commercially as [[auxiliary power unit]]s on passenger cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410454/does-car-mounted-solar-make-sense/ | title=Does Car-Mounted Solar Make Sense?}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ventilate the car, reducing the temperature of the passenger compartment while it is parked in the sun. Vehicles such as the 2010 [[Toyota Prius#2009– (model ZVW30)|Prius]], [[Aptera 2 Series#Accessories and interior|Aptera 2]], [[Audi A8#D2|Audi A8]], and [[Mazda 929#1990|Mazda 929]] have had solar [[Sunroof#Sunroof Types|sunroof]] options for ventilation purposes.

The area of photovoltaic modules required to power a car with conventional design is too large to be carried on board. A prototype car and trailer has been built [http://www.solartaxi.com/ Solar Taxi]. According to the website, it is capable of 100&amp;nbsp;km/day using 6m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of standard crystalline silicon cells. Electricity is stored using a [[Molten salt battery#Zebra battery|nickel/salt battery]]. A stationary system such as a rooftop solar panel, however, can be used to charge conventional electric vehicles.

It is also possible to use solar panels to extend the range of a hybrid or electric car, as incorporated in the [[Fisker Karma]], available as an option on the [[Chevy Volt]], on the hood and roof of "Destiny 2000" modifications of [[Pontiac Fiero]]s, [[Italdesign Quaranta]], Free Drive EV [[Solar Bug]], and numerous other electric vehicles, both concept and production. In May 2007 a partnership of Canadian companies led by Hymotion added PV cells to a [[Toyota Prius]] to extend the range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2007/16/c9889.html Hymotion modified Prius using solar power] ''accessed 14 September 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110126042211/http://www.solarelectricalvehicles.com/ SEV] claims 20 miles per day from their combined 215W module mounted on the car roof and an additional 3kWh battery.

On 9 June 2008, the German and French Presidents announced a plan to offer a credit of 6-8g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for cars fitted with technologies "not yet taken into consideration during the standard measuring cycle of the emissions of a car".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elysee.fr/download/?mode=press&amp;filename=09.06_emissions_from_cars_version_anglaise.pdf''accessed {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609061451/http://www.elysee.fr/download/?mode=press&amp;filename=09.06_emissions_from_cars_version_anglaise.pdf |date=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has given rise to speculation that photovoltaic panels might be widely adopted on autos in the near future&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.systaic.com/press/press-release/systaic-ag-demand-for-car-solar-roofs-skyrockets.html ''accessed 28 September 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505004053/http://www.systaic.com/press/press-release/systaic-ag-demand-for-car-solar-roofs-skyrockets.html |date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also technically possible to use photovoltaic technology, (specifically [[thermophotovoltaic]] (TPV) technology) to provide motive power for a car. Fuel is used to heat an emitter. The infrared radiation generated is converted to electricity by a low band gap PV cell (e.g. GaSb). A prototype TPV hybrid car was even built. The "Viking 29"&lt;ref&gt;[http://vri.etec.wwu.edu/pdf%20files/v29paper.pdf Use of a Thermophotovoltaic Generator in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle, Seal et al., Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington University Bellingham, Washington 98225] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905071200/http://vri.etec.wwu.edu/pdf%20files/v29paper.pdf |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the World’s first thermophotovoltaic (TPV) powered automobile, designed and built by the Vehicle Research Institute (VRI) at Western Washington University. Efficiency would need to be increased and cost decreased to make TPV competitive with fuel cells or internal combustion engines.

===Personal rapid transit===
[[Image:070515SolarTrussTree610s.JPG|thumb|right|175px|JPods PRT concept with photovoltaic panels above guideways]]

Several [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT) concepts incorporate photovoltaic panels.

===Rail===

Railway presents a low rolling resistance option that would be beneficial of planned journeys and stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ases.conference-services.net/resources/252/2859/pdf/SOLAR2012_0039_full%20paper.pdf|title=A STUDY ON THE FEASIBILITY OF SOLAR POWERED RAILWAY SYSTEM FOR LIGHT WEIGHT URBAN TRANSPORT |publisher=Proc World Renewable Energy Forum |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; PV panels were tested as APUs on Italian rolling stock under EU project.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612125236/http://www.trenitalia.com/en/trenitalia/pvtrain/pvtrain_6/Newsletter1.html PVTRAIN]. Direct feed to a DC grids avoids losses through DC to AC conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114004778|title=The potential of solar powered transportation and the case for solar powered railway in Pakistan|accessdate=2013-05-22|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.025|volume=39|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|pages=270–276|year=2014|last1=Jaffery|first1=Syed Husain Imran|last2=Khan|first2=Mushtaq|last3=Ali|first3=Liaqat|last4=Khan|first4=Hassan Abbas|last5=Mufti|first5=Riaz Ahmad|last6=Khan|first6=Ashfaq|last7=Khan|first7=Nawar|last8=Jaffery|first8=Syed M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC grids are only to be found in electric powered transport: railways, trams and trolleybuses. Conversion of DC from PV panels to grid alternating current (AC) was estimated to cause around 3% of the electricity being wasted &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/15/solar-powered-trains-uk-india-renewables-tracks-electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

PVTrain concluded that the most interest for PV in rail transport was on freight cars where on board electrical power would allow new functionality:

*  GPS or other positioning devices, so as to improve its use in fleet management and efficiency.
*  Electric locks, a video monitor and remote control system for cars with sliding doors, so as to reduce the risk of robbery for valuable goods.
*  ABS brakes, which would raise the maximum velocity of freight cars to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h, improving productivity.

The Kismaros – Királyrét narrow-gauge line near Budapest has built a solar powered railcar called 'Vili'.  With a maximum speed of 25&amp;nbsp;km/h, 'Vili' is driven by two 7&amp;nbsp;kW motors capable of regenerative braking and powered by 9.9m2 of PV panels.  Electricity is stored in on-board batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/rolling-stock/solar-powered-rail-vehicle-ready-for-service.html?channel=542 |title=Solar-powered rail vehicle ready for service |publisher=International Railway Journal |date= May 20, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to on-board solar panels, there is the possibility to use stationary (off-board) panels to generate electricity specifically for use in transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114004778|title=The potential of solar powered transportation and the case for solar powered railway in Pakistan|accessdate=2013-05-22|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.025|volume=39|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|pages=270–276|year=2014|last1=Jaffery|first1=Syed Husain Imran|last2=Khan|first2=Mushtaq|last3=Ali|first3=Liaqat|last4=Khan|first4=Hassan Abbas|last5=Mufti|first5=Riaz Ahmad|last6=Khan|first6=Ashfaq|last7=Khan|first7=Nawar|last8=Jaffery|first8=Syed M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few pilot projects have also been built in the framework of the "Heliotram" project, such as the tram depots in Hannover Leinhausen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windwatt.ch/the-projects/48-heliotram.html  |title=Heliotram |publisher=Windwatt |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Geneva (Bachet de Pesay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotourisme.ch/site/7/site7.htm |title=site7: Transports Publiques Genevois |publisher=Ecotourisme.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 150&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Geneva site injected 600V DC directly into the tram/trolleybus electricity network provided about 1% of the electricity used by the Geneva transport network at its opening in 1999. On December 16, 2017 a fully solar-powered train was launched in New South Wales, Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/worlds-first-fully-solar-powered-train-left-station/|title=The world's first fully solar-powered train just left the station|date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The train is powered using onboard solar panels and onboard rechargeable batteries. It holds a capacity for 100 seated passenger for a 3 km journey.

Recently [[Imperial College London]] and the environmental charity [[10:10]] have announced the Renewable Traction Power project to investigate using track-side solar panels to power trains &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/energyfutureslab/newssummary/news_6-1-2017-9-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, Indian railways announced their intention to use on board PV to run air conditioning systems in railway coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sun-to-power-ac-coaches-in-trains/1/298080 |title=Sun to Power AC coaches in trains|publisher=India Today Online |date= August 5, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, Indian Railways announced it is to conduct a trial run by the end of May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/railways-to-start-trial-runs-of-solar-train-in-sunny-jodhpur-2798717|title=Indian Railways All Set For The Trial Run Of Its First Ever Solar Train!|publisher=India Times|date=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hopes that an average of 90,800 liters of diesel per train will be saved on an annual basis, which in turn results in reduction of 239 tones of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Tûranor PlanetSolar Rabat.JPG|thumb|[[Tûranor PlanetSolar|PlanetSolar]], the world's largest solar-powered boat and the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe (in  2012).]]

Solar powered boats have mainly been limited to rivers and canals, but in 2007 an experimental 14m catamaran, the Sun21 sailed the Atlantic from [[Seville]] to [[Miami]], and from there to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6509677.stm|title=Solar boat makes Atlantic history|date=30 March 2007|accessdate=2010-06-01 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first crossing of the Atlantic powered only by solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.transatlantic21.org/ | title=Transatlantic21: The world's first crossing of the Atlantic on a solar boat}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Japan's biggest shipping line Nippon Yusen KK and [[Nippon Oil Corporation]] said solar panels capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity would be placed on top of a 60,213 ton [[car carrier]] ship to be used by [[Toyota Motor Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/energy/article/38019 |title=Alternative Energy and Fuel News |publisher=Enn.com |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solardaily.com/reports/Japan_launches_first_solar_cargo_ship_999.html|title=Japan launches first solar cargo ship |publisher=Solardaily.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Solar-ship-sails-the-ocean-green/2005/03/14/1110649129813.html |title=Solar ship sails the ocean green - National |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Tûranor PlanetSolar]], a 30 metre long, 15.2 metre wide [[catamaran]] yacht powered by 470 square metres of solar panels, was unveiled. It is, so far, the largest solar-powered boat ever built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetsolar.org/news-actuelle.en.php "PlanetSolar News."]''PlanetSolar''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831081143/http://www.planetsolar.org/news-actuelle.en.php |date=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, PlanetSolar became the first ever solar electric vehicle to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe.&lt;ref name="Gieffers"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ankunft in Monaco: Solarboot schafft Weltumrundung in 584 Tagen |language=German | first=Hanna |last=Gieffers |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=4 May 2012 | accessdate=5 May 2012 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/planetsolar-solarboot-kehrt-von-weltreise-zurueck-a-831418.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various demonstration systems have been made. Curiously, none yet takes advantage of the huge power gain that water cooling would bring.

The low power density of current solar panels limits the use of solar propelled vessels, however boats that use sails (which do not generate electricity unlike combustion engines) rely on battery power for electrical appliances (such as refrigeration, lighting and communications). Here solar panels have become popular for recharging batteries as they do not create noise, require fuel and often can be seamlessly added to existing deck space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Solar Panels for Boats, Sailboats and Yachts|url=http://www.emarineinc.com/pages/Marine-Solar-Panels.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable military interest in [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs); solar power would enable these to stay aloft for months, becoming a much cheaper means of doing some tasks done today by satellites. In September 2007, the first successful flight for 48h under constant power of a UAV was reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6916309.stm] BBC News: Solar plane flies into the night ''accessed 10 September 07''&lt;/ref&gt;
This is likely to be the first commercial use for photovoltaics in flight.

==Space==

===Solar powered spacecraft===
[[Image:ISS on 20 August 2001.jpg|thumb|right|PV on the [[International Space Station]]]]
{{main |Solar panels on spacecraft}}
Solar energy is often used to supply power for satellites and spacecraft operating in the inner solar system since it can supply energy for a long time without excess fuel mass. A [[Communications satellite]] contains multiple radio transmitters which operate continually during its life. It would be uneconomic to operate such a vehicle (which may be on-orbit for years) from primary [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[fuel cell]]s, and refuelling in [[Geostationary orbit|orbit]] is not practical. Solar power is not generally used to adjust the satellite's position, however, and the useful life of a communications satellite will be limited by the on-board station-keeping fuel supply.

===Solar propelled spacecraft===
A few spacecraft operating within the orbit of [[Mars]] have used solar power as an energy source for their propulsion system.

All current solar powered spacecraft use [[solar panels]] in conjunction with [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]], typically [[ion thruster|ion drive]]s as this gives a very high exhaust velocity, and reduces the propellant over that of a [[rocket]] by more than a factor of ten. Since propellant is usually the biggest mass on many spacecraft, this reduces launch costs.

Other proposals for solar spacecraft include [[solar thermal]] heating of propellant, typically hydrogen or sometimes water is proposed. An [[electrodynamic tether]] can be used to change a satellite's orientation or adjust its orbit.

Another concept for solar propulsion in space is the [[light sail]]; this doesn't require conversion of light to electrical energy, instead relying directly on the tiny but persistent [[radiation pressure]] of light.

===Planetary exploration===
Perhaps the most successful solar-propelled vehicles have been the "rovers" used to explore surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The 1977 [[Lunokhod programme]] and the 1997 [[Mars Pathfinder]] used solar power to propel remote controlled vehicles. The operating life of these rovers far exceeded the limits of endurance that would have been imposed, had they been operated on conventional fuels.

==Electric vehicle with solar assist==
A Swiss project, called "Solartaxi", has circumnavigated the world. This is the first time in history an electric vehicle (not self sufficient solar vehicle) has gone around the world, covering 50000&amp;nbsp;km in 18 months and crossing 40 countries. It is a road-worthy electric vehicle hauling a trailer with solar panels, carrying a 6 m² sized solar array. The Solartaxi has [[Molten salt battery#Zebra battery|Zebra batteries]], which permit a range of 400&amp;nbsp;km without recharging. The car can also run for 200&amp;nbsp;km without the trailer. Its maximum speed is 90&amp;nbsp;km/h. The car weighs 500&amp;nbsp;kg and the trailer weighs 200&amp;nbsp;kg. According to initiator and tour director [[Louis Palmer]], the car in mass production could be produced for 16000 Euro. Solartaxi has toured the World from July 2007 till December 2008 to show that solutions to stop global warming are available and to encourage people in pursuing alternatives to [[fossil fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartaxi.com/ |title=Solar taxi |publisher=Solar taxi |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer suggests the most economical location for solar panels for an electric car is on building rooftops though,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartaxi.com/blog/2008/11/12/coventry/ |title=Around London and Coventry |publisher=Solartaxi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; likening it to putting money into a bank in one location and withdrawing it in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solartaxi.com/technology/energy-concept/ |title=Energy concept |publisher=Solartaxi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plug-in hybrid and solar vehicles===
An interesting variant of the electric vehicle is the triple hybrid vehicle—the [[Plug-in hybrid|PHEV]] that has solar panels as well to assist.

The 2010 [[Toyota Prius]] model has an option to mount solar panels on the roof. They power a ventilation system while parked to help provide cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Steve Almasy CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/01/28/solar.powered.cars/index.html |title=Solar cars still a way off |publisher=CNN.com |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many applications of '''photovoltaics in transport''' either for motive power or as [[auxiliary power unit]]s, particularly where fuel, maintenance, emissions or noise requirements preclude internal combustion engines or fuel cells. Due to the limited area available on each vehicle either speed or range or both are limited when used for motive power.

==Limitations==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2016}}
There are limits to using photovoltaic (PV) cells for vehicles:
* Power density: Power from a solar array is limited by the size of the vehicle and area that can be exposed to sunlight. This can also be overcome by adding a flatbed and connecting it to the car and this gives more area for panels for powering the car. While energy can be accumulated in batteries to lower peak demand on the array and provide operation in sunless conditions, the battery adds weight and cost to the vehicle. The power limit can be mitigated by use of conventional electric cars supplied by solar (or other) power, recharging from the electrical grid. 
* Cost: While sunlight is free, the creation of PV cells to capture that sunlight is expensive. Costs for solar panels are steadily declining (22% cost reduction per doubling of production volume).
* Design considerations: Even though sunlight has no lifespan, PV cells do. The lifetime of a solar module is approximately 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Reliab%20Res%20toward%2030-yr%20PV%20Mod%20-%20Kobe84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Standard photovoltaics often come with a warranty of 90% (from nominal power) after 10 years and 80% after 25 years. Mobile applications are unlikely to require lifetimes as long as building integrated PV and solar parks. Current PV panels are mostly designed for stationary installations. However, to be successful in mobile applications, PV panels need to be designed to withstand vibrations. Also, solar panels, especially those incorporating glass, have significant weight. In order for its addition to be of value, a solar panel must provide energy equivalent to or greater than the energy consumed to propel its weight.

'''Syngas to gasoline plus'''  (STG+) is a thermochemical process to convert [[natural gas]], other gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s or gasified [[biomass]] into drop-in fuels, such as gasoline, diesel fuel or jet fuel, and organic solvents.

== Process chemistry ==
[[File:STG+ Process.jpg|thumb|The STG+ Process]]

This process follows four principal steps in one continuous integrated loop, comprising four [[Packed bed|fixed bed reactors]] in a series in which a [[syngas]] is converted to synthetic fuels. The steps for producing high-octane synthetic gasoline are as follows:&lt;ref name="STG+ White Paper"&gt;[http://www.primusge.com/press-room/white-papers/ Introduction to STG+ Technology] ''Primus Green Energy'', February 2013. Retrieved: 5 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Methanol|Methanol Synthesis]]: Syngas is fed to Reactor 1, the first of four reactors, which converts most of the syngas to methanol when passing through the catalyst bed.
*:     CO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{overset|methanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH}}
* [[Dimethyl ether|Dimethyl Ether]] (DME) Synthesis: The methanol-rich gas from Reactor 1 is next fed to Reactor 2, the second STG+ reactor. The methanol is exposed to a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] and much of it is converted to DME, which involves a dehydration from methanol to form DME.
*:     2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Gasoline synthesis: The Reactor 2 product gas is next fed to Reactor 3, the third reactor containing the catalyst for conversion of DME to hydrocarbons including paraffins ([[alkane]]s), [[Aromaticity|aromatics]], naphthenes ([[cycloalkane]]s) and small amounts of olefins ([[alkene]]s), typically with the [[carbon number]] ranging from 6 to 10.
* Gasoline Treatment: The fourth reactor provides [[transalkylation]] and [[hydrogenation]] treatment to the products coming from Reactor 3.  The treatment reduces [[durene]]/[[isodurene]] ([[tetramethylbenzene]]s) and [[trimethylbenzene]] components that have high freezing points and must be minimized in gasoline.  As a result, the synthetic gasoline product has high octane and desirable viscometric properties.
* Separator: Finally, the mixture from Reactor 4 is condensed to obtain gasoline. The non-condensed gas and gasoline are separated in a conventional condenser/separator. Most of the non-condensed gas from the product separator becomes recycled gas and is sent back to the feed stream to Reactor 1, leaving the synthetic gasoline product composed of paraffins, aromatics and naphthenes.

=== Catalysts ===

The STG+ process uses standard catalysts similar to those used in other gas to liquids technologies, specifically in methanol to gasoline processes. Methanol to gasoline processes favor molecular size- and shape-selective [[zeolite]] catalysts,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dgmk.de/petrochemistry/abstracts_content16/Dathe.pdf H. Dathe, K.-F. Finger, A. Haas, P. Kolb, A. Sundermann and G. Wasserschaff. "High Throughput Catalyst Optimization Program for the GTL-Technologies MTG, HAS and FTS", DBMK/SCI/ÖGEW Conference, October, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the STG+ process also utilizes commercially available shape-selective catalysts, such as [[ZSM-5]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-022813-170709/unrestricted/Primus_Green_Energy_IQP.pdf D. Tocco, S. Miraglia and J. Giesecke. "Primus Green Energy", Worchester Polytechnic Institute, March, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process efficiency ===

According to Primus Green Energy, the STG+ process converts approximately one MMBtu of natural gas into more than five gallons of 90+-octane gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primusge.com/how-it-works/stg-plus/&lt;/ref&gt;  One gallon of gasoline contains 120000 to 125000 BTU, making this process about 60% efficient (40% loss of energy).

== Gasification ==

As is the case with other gas to liquids processes, STG+ utilizes syngas produced via other technologies as a feedstock. This syngas can be produced through several commercially available technologies and from a wide variety of feedstocks, including natural gas, biomass and [[municipal solid waste]].

Natural gas and other methane-rich gases, including those produced from municipal waste, are converted into syngas through [[Methane reformer|methane reforming]] technologies such as [[Steam reforming|steam methane reforming]] and [[autothermal reforming|auto-thermal reforming]].

Biomass gasification technologies are less established, though several systems being developed utilize fixed bed or [[fluidized bed]] reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=D. Peterson and S. Haase |date=July 2009 |title=Market Assessment of Biomass Gasification and Combustion Technology for Small- and Medium-Scale Applications |url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/pdfs/46190.pdf |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |page=9 |accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other GTL technologies ==

Other technologies for syngas to liquid fuels synthesis include the [[Fischer-Tropsch]] process and the methanol to gasoline processes.

Research conducted at Princeton University indicates that methanol to gasoline processes are consistently more cost-effective, both in capital cost and overall cost, than the Fischer-Tropsch process at small, medium and large scales.&lt;ref name=C&amp;CE&gt;Richard C. Baliban, Josephine A. Elia, Vern Weekman, and Christodoulos A. Floudas "Process Synthesis of Hybrid Coal, Biomass, and Natural Gas to Liquids via Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, ZSM-5 Catalytic Conversion, Methanol Syntehsis, Methanol-to-Gasoline, and Methanol-to-Olefins/Distillate Technologies" in Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering, 2012, Elsevier. {{DOI|10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary studies suggest that the STG+ process is more energetically efficient and the highest yielding methanol to gasoline process.&lt;ref name="Comparison WP"&gt;[http://www.primusge.com/press-room/white-papers/ Comparison of STG+ With Other GTL Technologies] ''Primus Green Energy'', April 2013. Retrieved: 29 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fischer-Tropsch ===

The primary difference between the Fischer-Tropsch process and methanol to gasoline processes such as STG+ are the catalysts used, product types and economics.

Generally, the Fischer-Tropsch process favors unselective [[cobalt]] and [[iron]] catalysts, while methanol to gasoline technologies favor molecular size- and shape-selective zeolites.&lt;ref name=CS&amp;T&gt;Eduardo Falabella Sousa-Aguiar, Fabio Bellot Noronha, and Arnaldo Faro, Jr. "The Main Catalytic Challenges in GTL (Gas-to-Liquids) Processes" in Catalysis Science &amp; Technology, 2011, RSC. {{DOI|10.1039/C1CY00116G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of product types, Fischer-Tropsch production has been limited to [[linear paraffins]],&lt;ref name=CS&amp;T/&gt; such as [[synthetic crude]] oil, whereas methanol to gasoline processes can produce aromatics, such as [[xylene]] and [[toluene]], and naphthenes and iso-paraffins, such as drop-in gasoline and jet fuel.

The main product of the Fischer-Tropsch process, synthetic crude oil, requires additional refining to produce fuel products such as diesel fuel or gasoline. This refining typically adds additional costs, causing some industry leaders to label the economics of commercial-scale Fischer-Tropsch processes as challenging.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Broder, John M. and Clifford Krauss.

=== Methanol to gasoline ===

The STG+ technology offers several differentiators that distinguish it from other methanol to gasoline processes. These differences include product flexibility, durene reduction, environmental footprint and capital cost.

Traditional methanol to gasoline technologies produce diesel, gasoline or [[liquefied petroleum gas]].&lt;ref name="ExxonMobil"&gt;[http://www.exxonmobil.com/Apps/RefiningTechnologies/files/sellsheet_09_mtg_brochure.pdf/ Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) Production of Clean Gasoline from Coal] ''ExxonMobil'', December 2009. Retrieved: 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; STG+ produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatics, depending on the catalysts used. The STG+ technology also incorporates durene reduction into its core process, meaning that the entire fuel production process requires only two steps: syngas production and gas to liquids synthesis.&lt;ref name="STG+ White Paper"/&gt; Other methanol to gasoline processes do not incorporate durene reduction into the core process, and they require the implementation of an additional refining step.&lt;ref name=ExxonMobil/&gt;

Due to the additional number of reactors, traditional methanol to gasoline processes include inefficiencies such as the additional cost and energy loss of condensing and evaporating the methanol prior to feeding it to the durene reduction unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=2009 |title=Liquid Transportation Fuels from Coal and Biomass: Technological Status, Costs, and Environmental Impacts |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12620&amp;page=206 |publisher=The National Academies Press |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies can lead to a greater capital cost and environmental footprint than methanol to gasoline processes that use fewer reactors, such as STG+. The STG+ process eliminates multiple condensation and evaporation, and the process converts syngas to liquid transportation fuels directly without producing intermediate liquids.&lt;ref name="Comparison WP" /&gt; This eliminates the need for storage of two products, including pressure storage for liquefied petroleum gas and storage of liquid methanol.

Simplifying a gas to liquids process by combining multiple steps into fewer reactors leads to increased yield and efficiency, enabling less expensive facilities that are more easily scaled.&lt;ref name=AICHE&gt;Richard C. Baliban, Josephine A. Elia, and Christodoulos A. Floudas "Novel Natural Gas to Liquids Processes: Process Synthesis and Global Optimization Strategies" in American Institute of Chemical Engineers Journal, 2013, AIChE. {{DOI|10.1002/aic.13996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercialization ==

The STG+ technology is currently operating at pre-commercial scale in Hillsborough, New Jersey at a plant owned by alternative fuels company Primus Green Energy. The plant produces approximately 100,000 gallons of high-quality, drop-in gasoline per year directly from natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primusge.com/?press-release=primus-green-energy-demonstration-plant-operating-results-confirm-compelling-performance-and-economics-according-to-independent-engineers-report&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the company announced the findings of an independent engineer’s report prepared by E3 Consulting, which found that STG+ system and catalyst performance exceeded expectations during plant operation. The pre-commercial demonstration plant has also achieved 720 hours of continuous operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e3co.com/tech5b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Primus Green Energy has announced plans to break ground on its first commercial STG+ plant in the second half of 2014, and the company has announced that this plant is expected to produce approximately 27.8 million gallons of fuel annually.&lt;ref name="primusge.com"&gt;http://www.primusge.com/?press-release=primus-green-energy-patent-application-for-gas-to-liquids-technology-allowed-by-uspto&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) allowed Primus Green Energy’s patent covering its single-loop STG+ technology.&lt;ref name="primusge.com"/&gt;

'''Techron''' is a patented fuel additive developed by the [[Chevron Corporation]], usually consisting of gasoline mixed with 400 ppm of [[polyetheramine]] (PEA).&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;Farmer, Robert F., Fuel Compositions Containing Estermines&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of Techron, Chevron [[gasoline]]s became designated as meeting [[Top Tier Detergent Gasoline|Top Tier standards]] for fuel cleanliness.  Chevron gasolines with Techron were some of the first gasolines to be named as a "Top Tier Detergent Gasoline".&lt;ref name="Upshaw"&gt;Upshaw, Lynn B. , Truth: new rules for marketing in a skeptical world, Amacom, 2007, pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt; "Top Tier Detergent Gasoline(s)" are agreed to lead to better performance in engines by BMW, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Audi.&lt;ref name="Upshaw" /&gt;

Techron had been first patented and introduced as a concentrate available at Chevron stations in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100103122026/http://www.chevron.com/products/techron/history/ The History of Techron, 2010, Chevron.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Techron was then marketed in all Chevron gasolines in May 1995, and the [[Chevron Cars]] made their debut to promote this introduction in advertising.

Techron is available at Chevron, Texaco, and Caltex stations in all three grades of gasoline.&lt;ref name="Techron"&gt;[http://www.techron.com/ Techron.com, 2010, Techron Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Techron is also available as a packaged concentrate, for use with gasoline that does not include Techron.

==Components==
Techron consists of five components:&lt;ref name="Techron Components"&gt;[https://cglapps.chevron.com/msdspds/MSDSDetailPage.aspx?docDataId=283264 Chevron.com, 2011, Material Safety Data Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, areas of [[tropical cyclone]] formation are divided into '''seven basins'''. These include the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], the eastern and western parts of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern [[Indian Ocean]]s, and the northern Indian Ocean ([[Arabian Sea]] and [[Bay of Bengal]]). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones, super typhoons, or major hurricanes (at least of [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] intensity).&lt;ref name="Landsea variability table"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Chris Landsea]] | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/climvari/table.html | title = Climate Variability table&amp;nbsp;— Tropical Cyclones|publisher = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | accessdate =October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast, [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean Islands]], and [[Bermuda]] are frequently affected by storms in this basin. Venezuela,  the 4 provinces of [[Atlantic Canada]], and Atlantic [[Macaronesia|Macaronesian islands]] also are occasionally affected.

The Northeastern Pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area. The [[List of Pacific hurricane seasons|hurricane season]] runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region.&lt;ref name="NOAA-EPac avg"&gt;{{cite web| author=Climate Prediction Center, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] | date=May 22, 2006| title=Background Information: East Pacific Hurricane Season | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | accessdate=May 24, 2006| url= http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971–2005 period, there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms, 9 [[hurricane]]s, and 4–5 major hurricanes (storms of [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 intensity]] or greater) annually in the basin.&lt;ref name="NOAA-EPac avg"/&gt;

Storms that form here often affect western [[Mexico]], and less commonly the [[Continental United States]] (in particular [[California]]), or northern [[Central America]]. No hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in California; however, historical records from 1858 speak of a [[1858 San Diego Hurricane|storm]] that brought [[San Diego]] winds over {{cvt|75|mph|kn km/h}} (marginal hurricane force), though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall.&lt;ref name="San Diego 1858"&gt;{{cite web | author = Chenoweth, Michael and [[Christopher Landsea]] | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/chenowethlandsea.pdf | title = The San Diego Hurricane of 2 October 1858 | accessdate = December 1, 2006 | date = November 2004 | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tropical storms in [[1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm|1939]], [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|1976]] and [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|1997]] brought gale-force winds to California.&lt;ref name="San Diego 1858"/&gt;

The [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]'s [[area of responsibility]] (AOR) begins at the boundary with the [[National Hurricane Center]]' AOR (at 140&amp;nbsp;[[longitude|°W]]), and ends at the International Date Line, where the Northwestern Pacific begins.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ F1"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What regions around the globe have tropical cyclones and who is responsible for forecasting there?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = July 25, 2006 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hurricane season in the North Central Pacific runs annually from June 1 to November 30;&lt;ref name="CPHC Climatology"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] | title = CPHC Climatology | accessdate = March 2, 2007 | url = http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/pages/climatology.php | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ F1"/&gt; The CPHC previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the [[Joint Hurricane Warning Center]]; today it is called the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]].

Central Pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually.&lt;ref name="CPHC Climatology"/&gt; As there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin, direct hits and [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]]s are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with [[Hurricane Iniki]] in 1992, which made landfall on [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref name="CPHC Iniki"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=1992|title=The 1992 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=March 2, 2007|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1992.php#Iniki}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hurricane Ioke]] in 2006, which made a direct hit on [[Johnston Atoll]].&lt;ref name="Ioke Atoll"&gt;{{cite news |author = Leone, Diana |title = Hawaiian-named storm hits Johnston Isle |url = http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/08/23/news/story01.html |publisher = Star Bulletin  |date = August 23, 2006 |accessdate = March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest Pacific Ocean is the most active basin on the planet, accounting for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity. Annually, an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire [[tropical storm]] strength or greater; also, an average of 16 [[typhoon]]s occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ E10"/&gt; The basin occupies all the territory north of the [[equator]] and west of the International Date Line, including the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ F1"/&gt; The basin sees activity year-round; however, tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March.&lt;ref name = "AOML FAQ G1"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = July 25, 2006 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical storms in this region often affect [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Vietnam]], plus numerous [[Oceania]]n islands such as [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas]] and [[Palau]].

===North Indian Ocean===
[[File:North Indian Ocean cyclone tracks 1980-2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northern [[Indian Ocean]] between 1980 and 2005]]
This basin is divided into two areas: the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]], with the Bay of Bengal dominating (5 to 6 times more activity). Still, this basin is the least active worldwide, with only 4 to 6 storms per year.

This basin’s season has a double peak: one in April and May, before the onset of [[monsoon of South Asia|the monsoon]], and another in October and November, just after.&lt;ref name="2003 ATCR"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] | url = http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/2003atcr/chapter1/chapter1_2.html | title = 1.2:  North Indian Tropical Cyclones | work = 2003 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report | year = 2004 | accessdate = November 29, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607054336/http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/2003atcr/chapter1/chapter1_2.html | archivedate = June 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This double peak occurs because powerful [[vertical wind shear]] in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwolt, Simon; ''Tropical climatology: an introduction to the climates of the low latitudes'', p. 82 {{ISBN|0471994065}}&lt;/ref&gt; High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the [[Red Sea]], which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the [[Arabian Peninsula]] or [[Somalia]]; however, [[Cyclone Gonu]] caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.

Although the North Indian Ocean is a relatively inactive basin, extremely high population densities in the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and [[Ayeyarwady River|Ayeyarwady]] Deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have formed here, including the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Pakistan]].

===Mediterranean Sea===

[[File:Mediterranean Hurricane 16 Jan 1995.jpg|right|thumb|Image of the January 1995 system]]
On rare occasions, tropical-like systems that can reach the intensity of hurricanes, occur over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Such a phenomenon is called a [[Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone|Medicane]] (Mediterranean-hurricane). Although the geographical dimensions of tropical [[ocean]]s and the [[Mediterranean]] Sea are clearly different, the precursor mechanisms of these perturbations, based on the air-sea thermodynamic imbalance, are similar.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;"[http://www.tethys.cat/node/331 Medicanes: cataloguing criteria and exploration of meteorological environments &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]". www.tethys.cat.&lt;/ref&gt; Their origins are typically non-tropical, and develop over open waters under strong, initially cold-core [[cyclone]]s, similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin, like [[Hurricane Karl (1980)|Karl (1980)]], [[Hurricane Vince (2005)|Vince (2005)]], [[Tropical Storm Grace (2009)|Grace (2009)]], [[Hurricane Chris (2012)|Chris (2012)]], or [[Hurricane Ophelia (2017)|Ophelia (2017)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copernicus.org/EGU/adgeo/2/adgeo-2-217.pdf|title=ADGEO - redirect|author=|date=|website=www.copernicus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sea surface temperatures in late-August and early-September are quite high over the basin (24/28&amp;nbsp;°C or 75/82&amp;nbsp;°F), though research indicates water temperatures of 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) are normally required for development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.isac.cnr.it/~eurainsat/publications/2001/Meneguzzo-Plinius2000.pdf Microsoft Word – EGS2000-Plinius-II-Meneguzzo.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030525111915/http://www.isac.cnr.it/~eurainsat/publications/2001/Meneguzzo-Plinius2000.pdf |date=May 25, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Hemisphere==
Within the [[Southern Hemisphere]] tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific. Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the [[World Meteorological Organization]] define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The United States [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] also monitors the whole region, but splits it at 135°E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean.

===South-West Indian Ocean===

[[File:Southwest Indian Ocean cyclone tracks 1980-2005.jpg|thumb|200px|Tracks of all tropical cyclones in the southwestern [[Indian Ocean]] between 1980 and 2005]]

The South-West Indian Ocean is located within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa's east coast and 90°E and is primarily monitored by the Meteo France's La Reunion RSMC, while the Mauritian, Australian Indonesian, and Malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it.&lt;ref name="WMO RSMC La Reunion"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[World Meteorological Organization]] | url = http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/RSMC-TCWC/RSMC-LaReunion.doc | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908114704/http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/RSMC-TCWC/RSMC-LaReunion.doc | archivedate=September 8, 2006 | title = Tropical Cyclone RSMC / South-West Indian Ocean | type= {{DOClink}} | accessdate = November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the start of the 1985–86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80°E, with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90E considered to be a part of the Australian region.&lt;ref name="SWIO bound"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/amm/docs/1986/kingston.pdf|page=103|journal=Australian Meteorology Magazine|volume=34|date=August 1986|author=G.

Cyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas, which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins.  Tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the [[South Atlantic]], and the only full-blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004's [[Hurricane Catarina]], which made landfall in [[Brazil]] and 2010's Tropical Storm Anita, which formed off the coast of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The South Atlantic Ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by the World Meteorological Organization and does not have a designated [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|regional specialized meteorological center (RSMC)]]. However, the [[Brazilian Navy]] Hydrographic Center has started in 2011 to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

The [[density of air]] is about 1.275&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which means that the air in the pores contributes significantly to the density of these materials in atmospheric conditions. They can be classified by production method as aerogels, stochastic foams, and structured cellular materials.

==Aerogels==
The first ultralight materials, aerogel was first created by Samuel Stephens Kistler in 1931.

==Stochastic foams==
Graphene foams and graphite foams are examples of stochastic foams.

==Structured cellular materials==
Structured cellular materials can be remarkably strong despite very low density. 

Reversibly assembled cellular composite materials enable tailorable composite materials properties, to the ideal linear specific stiffness scaling regime. Using projection microstereolithography, octet microlattices have also been fabricated from polymers, metals, and ceramics. 

The design of the high performing lattices mean that the individual struts making up the materials do not bend. The materials are therefore exceptionally stiff and strong for their weight.

[[File:ECC83 Glow.jpg|thumb|150px|An [[ECC83]] tube glowing inside a [[preamplifier|preamp]]]]

A '''valve amplifier''' or '''tube amplifier''' is a type of [[electronic amplifier]] that uses [[vacuum tubes]] to increase the  [[amplitude]] or power of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]]. Low to medium power valve amplifiers for frequencies below the [[microwaves]] were largely replaced by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] amplifiers during the 1960s and 1970s. Valve amplifiers are used for applications such as [[guitar amplifier]]s, [[satellite]] [[transponder]]s such as [[DirecTV]] and [[GPS]], audiophile stereo amplifiers, military applications (such as [[radar]]) and very high power [[radio]] and [[UHF]] [[television]] [[transmitter]]s.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Until the invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947, most practical high-frequency electronic amplifiers were made using [[thermionic valve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Solid state devices such as the [[cat's-whisker detector]], copper oxide rectifier, or crystal detector diode were known before the transistor, but were unable to amplify a signal. [[Magnetic amplifiers]] were limited to below roughly 200kHz. [[Hydraulic amplifier]]s were not directly useful as electronic devices.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest valve was invented by [[John Ambrose Fleming]] while working for the [[Marconi Company]] in London in 1904 and named the [[diode]], as it had two [[electrodes]]. The diode conducted [[electricity]] in one direction only and was used as a radio detector and a [[rectifier]].

In 1906 [[Lee De Forest]] added a third electrode and invented the first electronic amplifying device, the [[triode]], which he named the ''[[Audion]]''. This additional ''control grid'' modulates the current that flows between [[cathode]] and [[anode]]. The relationship between current flow and plate and grid voltage is often represented as a series of "characteristic curves" on a diagram. Depending on the other components in the circuit this modulated current flow can be used to provide current or [[voltage gain]].

The first application of valve amplification was in the regeneration of long distance [[telephony]] signals. Later, valve amplification was applied to the '[[wireless]]' market that began in the early thirties. In due course amplifiers for music and later [[television]] were also built using valves.

[[Image:Goc1.GIF|thumb|Circuit diagram of a [[single-ended triode]]]]
The overwhelmingly dominant circuit topology during this period was the [[single-ended triode]] gain stage, operating in class A, which gave very good sound (and reasonable measured [[distortion]] performance) despite extremely simple circuitry with very few components: important at a time when components were handmade and extremely expensive. Before [[World War II]], almost all valve amplifiers were of low gain and with linearity dependent entirely on the inherent linearity of the valve itself, typically 5% distortion at full power.

[[Negative feedback]] (NFB) was invented by [[Harold Stephen Black]] in 1927, but initially little used since at that time gain was at a premium. This technique allows amplifiers to trade gain for reduced distortion levels (and also gave other benefits such as reduced output impedance). The introduction of the [[Williamson amplifier]] in 1947, which was extremely advanced in many respects including very successful use of NFB, was a turning point in audio power amplifier design, operating a push-pull output circuit in class AB1 to give performance surpassing its contemporaries.

=== Post-war developments ===
[[World War II]] stimulated dramatic technical progress and industrial scale production economies. Increasing  affluence  after the war led to a substantial and expanding consumer market.  This enabled electronics manufacturers to build and market more advanced valve (tube) designs at affordable prices, with the result that the 1960s saw the increasing spread of electronic gramophone players, and ultimately the beginnings of ''[[high fidelity]]''. [[Hifi]] was able to drive full frequency range loudspeakers (for the first time, often with multiple drivers for different frequency bands) to significant volume levels. This, combined with the spread of TV, produced a 'golden age' in valve (tube) development and also in the development of the design of valve amplifier circuits.

A range of topologies with only minor variations (notably different [[phase splitter]] arrangements and the "[[Ultra-Linear]]" transformer connection for tetrodes) rapidly became widespread. This family of designs remains the dominant high power amplifier topology to this day for music application. This period also saw continued growth in civilian radio, with valves being used for both transmitters and receivers.

===Decline===
From the 1970s the silicon [[transistor]] became increasingly pervasive. Valve production was sharply decreased, with the notable exception of [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), and a reduced range of valves for amplifier applications. Popular low power tubes were [[dual triodes]] (ECCnn, 12Ax7 series) plus the EF86 pentode, and power valves were mostly being beam tetrode and pentodes (EL84, EL34, KT88 / 6550, 6L6), in both cases with indirect heating. This reduced set of types remains the core of valve production today.

The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] retained valves to a much greater extent than the West during the [[Cold War]], for the majority of their communications and military amplification requirements, in part due to valves' ability to withstand instantaneous overloads (notably [[Electromagnetic pulse|due to a nuclear detonation]]) that would destroy a transistor.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic reduction in size, power consumption, reduced [[distortion]] levels and above all cost of electronics products based on transistors has made valves [[obsolete]] for mainstream products since the 1970s. Valves remained in certain applications such as high power RF transmitters and the [[microwave oven]], and audio amplification equipment, particularly for the electric guitar, recording studios, and high-end home stereos.

===Audio usage ===
[[File:Blackheart Single ended Class AAmp chassis with the GZ34 rectifier valve installed.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A single-ended class 'A' guitar amplifier chassis, with additional GZ34 valve rectifier installed.]]
In audio applications, valves continue to be highly desired by most professional users, particularly in recording studios' equipment and guitar amplifiers. Among stereo enthusiasts, there is a subgroup of audio buffs who advocate the use of tube amplifiers for home listening; they argue that tube amplifiers produce a "warmer" or more "natural" [[valve sound]]. Companies in Asia and Eastern Europe continue to produce valves to cater to this market.

Many professional guitar players use 'tube amps' because of their renowned 'tone' {{citation needed|date=August 2011}}. 'Tone' in this usage is referring to timbre, or pitch color, and can be a very subjective quality to quantify. Most audio technicians and scientists theorize that the 'even harmonic distortion' produced by valve tubes sounds more pleasing to the ear than transistors, regardless of style. Many of the musicians who use solid state amplification technology do so for its portability, low cost and high reliability, not its 'tone'. It is the tonal characteristics of valve tubes that have sustained them as the industry standard for guitars and studio microphone pre-amplification.

Tube amplifiers respond differently from transistor amplifiers when signal levels approach and reach the point of [[clipping (audio)|clipping]]. In a tube amplifier, the transition from linear amplification to limiting is less abrupt than in a solid state unit, resulting in a less grating form of distortion at the onset of clipping.  For this reason, some guitarists prefer the sound of an all-tube amplifier; the aesthetic properties of tube versus solid state amps, though, are a topic of debate in the guitarist community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milbert.com/articles/tubes_vs_transistors Tubes vs Transistors – Is There An Audible Difference?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics  ==
Power valves typically operate at higher voltages and lower currents than transistors - although solid state operating voltages have steadily increased with modern device technologies. High RF power radio transmitters in use today operate in the kilovolt range, where there is still no other comparable technology available.  ([power = volts * amps], so high power requires: high volts, high amps, or both)

Many power valves have good linearity but modest gain or [[transconductance]]. Signal amplifiers using tubes are capable of very high frequency response ranges – up to [[radio frequency]]. Indeed, many of the directly heated single-ended triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers are in fact radio transmitting tubes designed to operate in the megahertz range. In practice, however, tube amplifier designs typically "couple" stages either capacitively, limiting bandwidth at the low end, or inductively with transformers, limiting the bandwidth at both ends.

===Advantages  ===

*Very linear (especially triodes) making it viable to use them in low distortion linear circuits with little or no negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milbert.com/articles/tube_transistor_feature_comparison Tubes vs Transistors Feature Comparison]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inherently suitable for high voltage circuits.
*Can be constructed on a scale that can dissipate large amounts of heat (some extreme devices even being water cooled). For this reason valves remained the only viable technology for very high power applications such as radio and TV transmitters long into the age when transistors had displaced valves in most other applications.
*Electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads for minutes, which would destroy [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]  systems in [[millisecond]]s
*Withstand very high transient peak voltages without damage, suiting them to certain military and industrial applications
*Generally operate at applied voltages well below their maximum capability, providing long life and reliability
*Softer clipping when overloading the circuit, which many audiophiles and musicians subjectively believe gives a more pleasant and more musically satisfying sound.

===Disadvantages  ===

*Tubes require a [[cathode heater]]. Heater power represents a significant heat loss and energy use. 
*Tubes require higher voltages for the anodes compared to solid state amplifiers of similar power rating.
*Tubes are significantly larger than equivalent solid-state devices
*High impedance and low current output is unsuitable for the direct drive of many real-world loads, notably various forms of [[electric motor]]s.
*Valves have a shorter working life than solid state parts due to various failure mechanisms (such as  heat, cathode poisoning, breakage, or internal short-circuits).
*Tubes are available in only a single polarity, whereas transistors are available in complementary polarities (e.g., NPN/PNP), making possible many circuit configurations that cannot be realized directly.
*Valve circuits  must avoid introduction of noise from ac heater supplies.
*[[Microphonics]] – valves may sometimes be sensitive to sound or vibration, inadvertently acting like a [[microphone]].

==Operation==
All amplifier circuits are classified by "class of operation" as A, B, AB and C etc. See [[power amplifier classes]]. Some significantly different circuit topologies exist compared to transistor designs.

*The grid (where the input signal is presented) needs to be biased substantially negative with respect to the cathode. This makes it extremely difficult to directly couple the output of one valve to the input of a following valve as is normally done in transistor designs.
*Valve stages are coupled with components rated to withstand several hundred volts, typically a capacitor, occasionally a coupling transformer. The phase shifts introduced by coupling networks can become problematic in circuits that have feedback.
*There is no valve analog of the complementary devices widely used in "totem pole" output stages of silicon circuits. Push-pull valve topologies therefore require a [[phase splitter]].
*The very high output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires matching transformers to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or cutting lathe heads.  The transformer is used as the load, in place of the resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps,  matching output transformers are required for  public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.
*The open loop linearity of valves, especially triodes, makes it possible to use little or no negative feedback in circuits whilst retaining acceptable or even excellent distortion performance (especially for small-signal circuits).

===Topologies===
*Linear small signal circuits almost invariably use a triode in the single ended gain stage topology (in class A), including the output stage.
*Broadband valve amplifiers typically use class A1 or AB1.
*Modern high power output stages are usually push pull, often necessitating some form of phase splitter to derive a differential/balanced drive signal from a single ended input, typically followed by a further gain stage (the "driver") prior to the output tubes. For example, a [[shunt regulated push-pull amplifier]])
*single ended power stages using very large valves exist and dominate in radio transmitter applications. A sidebar is the observation that the niche "DH-SET" topology favored by some audiophiles are extremely simple and typically constructed using valve types originally designed for use in radio transmitters
*more complex topologies (notably the use of active loads) can improve linearity and frequency response (by removing Miller capacitance effects).

===Output impedance===
The high output impedance of tube plate circuits is not well matched to low-impedance loads such as loudspeakers or antennas.  A matching network is required for efficient power transfer; this may be a transformer at audio frequencies, or various tuned networks at radio frequencies.

In a ''cathode follower'' or ''common-plate'' configuration, the output is taken from the cathode resistance. Because of negative feedback (the cathode-ground voltage cancels the grid-ground voltage) the voltage gain is close to unity and the output voltage ''follows'' the grid voltage.  Although the cathode resistor can be many kilohms (depending on biasing requirements), the small-signal output impedance is very low (see [[operational amplifier]]).

==Applications==

=== Audio frequency (AF) and broadband amplifiers ===
Valves remain in widespread use in guitar and [[high-end audio]] amplifiers due to the perceived sound quality they produce. They are largely obsolete elsewhere because of higher power consumption, distortion, costs, reliability, and weight in comparison to transistors.

====Telephony====
Telephony was the original, and for many years was a driving application for audio amplification.  A specific issue for the telecommunication industry was the technique of multiplexing many (up to a thousand) voice lines onto a single cable, at different frequencies.

The advantage of this is that a single valve "repeater" amplifier can amplify many calls at once, this being very cost effective. The problem is that the amplifiers need to be extremely linear, otherwise "[[intermodulation]] distortion" (IMD) will result in "crosstalk" between the multiplexed channels. This stimulated development emphasis towards low distortion far beyond the nominal needs of a single voice channel.

====Audio====
{{Main|Valve audio amplifiers}}

Today, the main application for valves is audio amplifiers for high-end hi-fi and musical performance use with [[electric guitar]]s, [[electric bass]]es, and [[Hammond organ]]s, although these applications have different requirements regarding distortion which result in different design compromises, although the same basic design techniques are generic and widely applicable to all broadband amplification applications, not only audio.

Post World War II, the majority of valve power amplifiers are of the Class AB-1 "push pull" ultralinear topology, or lower cost single ended i.e. 6BQ5/EL84 power tubes, but niche products using the DH-SET and even OTL topologies still exist in small numbers.

[[File:SE-300B-70W.jpg|thumb|right|A 300B preamp/solid state output 70Wrms/ch hybrid amp]]

==== Instrumentation amplifiers ====

The basic moving coil [[voltmeter]] and [[ammeter]] itself takes a small current and thus loads the circuit to which it is attached. This can significantly alter the operating conditions in the circuit being measured. The vacuum tube voltmeter (VTVM) uses the high input impedance of a valve to buffer the circuit being measured from the load of the ammeter.

Valve [[oscilloscope]]s share this very high input impedance and thus can be used to measure voltages even in very high impedance circuits. There may typically be 3 or 4 stages of amplification per display channel. In later oscilloscopes, a type of amplifier using a series of tubes connected at equal distances along [[transmission line]]s, known as a [[distributed amplifier]] was employed to amplify very high frequency vertical signals before application to the display tube. Valve oscilloscopes are now obsolete.

In the closing years of the valve era, valves were even used to make "[[operational amplifier]]s" – the building blocks of much modern linear electronics. An op-amp typically has a differential input stage and a totem pole output, the circuit usually having a minimum of five active devices. A number of "packages" were produced that integrated such circuits (typically using two or more glass envelopes) into a single module that could be plugged into a larger circuit (such as an analog computer). Such valve op-amps were very far from ideal and quickly became obsolete, being replaced with solid-state types.

=== Narrow band and radio frequency tuned amplifiers ===
{{Main|Valve RF Amplifier}}

Historically, pre-WWII "transmitting tubes" were among the most powerful tubes available. These usually had directly heated thoriated filament cathodes that glowed like light bulbs. Some tubes were capable of being driven so hard that the anode itself would glow cherry red; the anodes were machined from solid material (rather than fabricated from thin sheet) to withstand heat without distorting. Notable tubes of this type are the 845 and 211. Later tetrodes and pentodes such as 817 and (direct heated) 813 were also used in large numbers in (especially military) radio transmitters

RF circuits are significantly different from broadband amplifier circuits. The antenna or following circuit stage typically contains one or more adjustable capacitive or inductive component allowing the resonance of the stage to be accurately matched with carrier frequency in use, to optimize power transfer from and loading on the valve, a so-called "tuned circuit".

Broadband circuits require flat response over a wide range of frequencies. RF circuits by contrast are typically required to operate at high frequencies but often over a very narrow frequency range. For example, an RF device might be required to operate over the range 144 to 146&amp;nbsp;MHz (just 1.4%)

Today, radio transmitters are overwhelmingly silicon based, even at microwave frequencies. However, an ever-decreasing minority of high power radio frequency amplifiers continue to have valve construction.

'''Water content''' or '''moisture content''' is the quantity of [[water]] contained in a material, such as [[soil]] (called '''soil moisture'''), [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[ceramic]]s, [[crops]], or [[wood]]. Water content is used in a wide range of scientific and technical areas, and is expressed as a ratio, which can range from 0 (completely dry) to the value of the materials' [[porosity]] at saturation. It can be given on a volumetric or mass (gravimetric) basis.

==Definitions==

'''Volumetric water content''', θ, is defined mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{V_w}{V_\text{wet}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_w&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of water and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{wet} = V_s + V_w + V_a&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the total volume of the wet material, i.e. of the sum of the volume of solid host material (e.g., soil particles, vegetation tissue) &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt;, of water &lt;math&gt;V_w&lt;/math&gt;, and of air &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Gravimetric water content'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=T. William Lambe  |author2=Robert V. Whitman  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1969 |title=Soil Mechanics |chapter=Chapter 3: Description of an Assemblage of Particles |edition=First |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn= 0-471-51192-7 |page=553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is expressed by mass (weight) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{m_w}{m}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_w&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of water and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the substance. Normally the latter is taken before drying: 
:&lt;math&gt;u' = \frac{m_w}{m_\text{wet}}&lt;/math&gt;
except for [[woodworking]], [[geotechnical]] and [[soil science]] applications where oven-dried material is used instead:
:&lt;math&gt;u'' = \frac{m_w}{m_\text{dry}}&lt;/math&gt;

To convert gravimetric water content to volumetric water content, multiply the gravimetric water content by the bulk [[specific gravity]] &lt;math&gt;SG&lt;/math&gt; of the material:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = u \times SG&lt;/math&gt;.

===Derived quantities===
In [[soil mechanics]] and [[petroleum engineering]] the '''water saturation''' or '''degree of saturation''', &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;S_w = \frac{V_w}{V_v} = \frac{V_w}{V \phi} = \frac{\theta}{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi = V_v / V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[porosity]], in terms of the volume of void or pore space &lt;math&gt;V_v&lt;/math&gt; and the total volume of the substance &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.{{clarify|reason=Dry or wet total volume?|date=March 2016}} Values of ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' can range from 0 (dry) to 1 (saturated). In reality, ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' never reaches 0 or 1 - these are idealizations for engineering use.

The '''normalized water content''', &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, (also called '''effective saturation''' or &lt;math&gt;S_e&lt;/math&gt;) is a dimensionless value defined by van Genuchten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400050002x |last1=van Genuchten |first1=M.Th. |title=A closed-form equation for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils |journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal |year=1980 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=892–898|bibcode=1980SSASJ..44..892V }}&lt;/ref&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta = \frac{\theta - \theta_r}{\theta_s-\theta_r}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric water content; &lt;math&gt;\theta_r&lt;/math&gt; is the residual water content, defined as the water content for which the gradient &lt;math&gt;d\theta/dh&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero; and, &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturated water content, which is equivalent to porosity, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Measurement==

===Direct methods===

Water content can be directly measured using a known volume of the material, and a drying [[oven]]. Volumetric water content, θ, is calculated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dingman, S.L. |year=2002 |title=Physical Hydrology |chapter=Chapter 6, Water in soils: infiltration and redistribution |edition=Second |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=0-13-099695-5 |page=646}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the volume of water &lt;math&gt;V_w&lt;/math&gt; and the mass of water &lt;math&gt;m_w&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;V_w = \frac{m_w}{\rho_w} = \frac{m_{\text{wet}}-m_{\text{dry}}}{\rho_w}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\text{wet}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{dry}}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[mass]]es of the sample before and after drying in the oven;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density of water]]; and

For materials that change in volume with water content, such as [[coal]], the water content, ''u'', is expressed in terms of the mass of water per unit mass of the moist specimen: 
:&lt;math&gt;u' = \frac{m_{\text{wet}} - m_{\text{dry}}}{m_{\text{wet}}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, geotechnics requires the moisture content to be expressed with respect to the sample's dry weight (often as a percentage, i.e. % moisture content = ''u''×100%)
:&lt;math&gt;u''  = \frac{m_{\text{wet}} - m_{\text{dry}}}{m_{\text{dry}}}&lt;/math&gt;

For [[wood]], the convention is to report moisture content on oven-dry basis (i.e. generally drying sample in an oven set at 105 deg Celsius for 24 hours). In [[wood drying]], this is an important concept.

===Laboratory methods===
{{main|Moisture analysis}}

Other methods that determine water content of a sample include chemical [[titration]]s (for example the [[Karl Fischer titration]]),  determining mass loss on heating (perhaps in the presence of an inert gas), or after [[freeze drying]]. In the food industry the [[Dean-Stark apparatus|Dean-Stark method]] is also commonly used.

From the Annual Book of [[ASTM]] (American Society for Testing and Materials) Standards, the total evaporable moisture content in Aggregate (C 566) can be calculated with the formula: 
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{W-D}{W}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of total evaporable moisture content of sample, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the original sample, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is mass of dried sample.

===Geophysical methods===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensors}}

There are several [[Geophysics|geophysical]] methods available that can approximate ''in situ'' soil water content. These methods include: [[time-domain reflectometry]] (TDR), [[neutron probe]], [[frequency domain sensor]], [[capacitance probe]], [[Amplitude Domain Reflectometry (ADR)|amplitude domain reflectometry]], [[electrical resistivity tomography]], [[ground penetrating radar]] (GPR), and others that are sensitive to the [[Water (molecule)|physical properties of water]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Ozcep |author2=M. Asci |author3=O. Tezel |author4=T. Yas |author5=N. Alpaslan |author6=D. Gundogdu |title=Relationships Between Electrical Properties (in Situ) and Water Content (in the Laboratory) of Some Soils in Turkey|journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts |year=2005 |volume=7 |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/08470/EGU05-J-08470.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysical sensors are often used to monitor soil moisture continuously in agricultural and scientific applications.

===Satellite remote sensing method===
Satellite microwave remote sensing is used to estimate soil moisture based on the large contrast between the dielectric properties of wet and dry soil. The microwave radiation is not sensitive to atmospheric variables, and can penetrate through clouds.  Also, microwave signal can penetrate, to a certain extent, the vegetation canopy and retrieve information from ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/1/1/3/]&lt;/ref&gt; The data from microwave remote sensing satellites such as WindSat, AMSR-E, RADARSAT, ERS-1-2, Metop/ASCAT, and SMAP are used to estimate surface soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/rsbarc/RSofSM.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131729/http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/rsbarc/RSofSM.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and uses==

Moisture may be present as adsorbed moisture at internal surfaces and as capillary condensed water in small pores. At low relative humidities,  moisture consists mainly of adsorbed water. At higher relative humidities, liquid water becomes more and more important, depending or not depending on the pore size can also be an influence of volume. In wood-based materials, however, almost all water is adsorbed at humidities below 98% RH.

In biological applications there can also be a distinction between physisorbed water and "free" water — the physisorbed water being that closely associated with and relatively difficult to remove from a biological material. The method used to determine water content may affect whether water present in this form is accounted for. For a better indication of "free" and "bound" water, the [[water activity]] of a material should be considered.

Water molecules may also be present in materials closely associated with individual molecules, as "water of crystallization", or as water molecules which are static components of protein structure.

===Earth and agricultural sciences===

In [[soil science]], [[hydrology]] and [[agricultural science]]s, water content has an important role for [[groundwater recharge]], [[agriculture]], and [[soil chemistry]].  Many recent scientific research efforts have aimed toward a predictive-understanding of water content over space and time. Observations have revealed generally that spatial variance in water content tends to increase as overall wetness increases in semiarid regions, to decrease as overall wetness increases in humid regions, and to peak under intermediate wetness conditions in temperate regions .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lawrence, J. E. |author2=G. M. Hornberger  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil moisture variability across climate zones |journal=Geophys. Res. Lett. |year=2007 |volume=34 | issue=L20402 |doi=10.1029/2007GL031382 |pages=L20402 |bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3420402L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four standard water contents that are routinely measured and used, which are described in the following table:

{|class="wikitable"
! Name
! Notation
! Suction pressure&lt;br&gt;(J/kg or kPa)
! Typical water content&lt;br&gt;(vol/vol)
! Conditions
|-
| Saturated water content
|align="center"| θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
|align="right"| 0
|align="center"| 0.2–0.5
| Fully saturated soil, equivalent to [[effective porosity]]
|-
| [[Field capacity]]
|align="center"| θ&lt;sub&gt;fc&lt;/sub&gt;
|align="right"| −33
|align="center"| 0.1–0.35
| Soil moisture 2–3 days after a rain or irrigation
|-
| [[Permanent wilting point]]

|align="right"| −1500

|-
| Residual water content
|align="center"|θ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
|align="right"| −∞
|align="center"| 0.001–0.1
| Remaining water at high tension
|}

And lastly the [[Available water capacity|available water content]], θ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, which is equivalent to:
:θ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ θ&lt;sub&gt;fc&lt;/sub&gt; − θ&lt;sub&gt;pwp&lt;/sub&gt;
which can range between 0.1 in [[gravel]] and 0.3 in [[peat]].

====Agriculture====

When a soil becomes too dry, plant [[transpiration]] drops because the water is increasingly bound to the soil particles by suction. Below the [[wilting point]] plants are no longer able to extract water. At this point they wilt and cease transpiring altogether. Conditions where soil is too dry to maintain reliable plant growth is referred to as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[drought]], and is a particular focus of [[irrigation]] management. Such conditions are common in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] environments.

Some agriculture professionals are beginning to use environmental measurements such as soil moisture to schedule [[irrigation]]. This method is referred to as ''smart irrigation'' or ''soil cultivation''.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

====Groundwater====

In saturated [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]]s, all available [[Porosity|pore]] spaces are filled with water (volumetric water content = [[porosity]]). Above a [[capillary fringe]], pore spaces have air in them too.

Most soils have a water content less than porosity, which is the definition of unsaturated conditions, and they make up the subject of [[vadose zone]] hydrogeology.  The [[capillary fringe]] of the [[water table]] is the dividing line between [[Aquifer#Saturated versus unsaturated|saturated and unsaturated]] conditions. Water content in the capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance above the [[phreatic]] surface.

One of the main complications which arises in studying the vadose zone, is the fact that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the water content of the material.  As a material dries out, the connected wet pathways through the media become smaller, the hydraulic conductivity decreasing with lower water content in a very non-linear fashion.

A [[water retention curve]] is the relationship between volumetric water content and the [[water potential]] of the porous medium. It is characteristic for different types of porous medium. Due to [[hysteresis]], different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.

A History of the Ottawa Collegiate Institute, 1843-1903. 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; and, at a young age, began work in the timber industry at [[Thurso, Quebec|Thurso]], [[Quebec]]. He founded W.C. Edwards &amp; Company which built large [[sawmill]]s at [[Rockland, Ontario|Rockland]] and [[New Edinburgh]]. Up until 1920, Edwards' company also operated a sawmill on the [[Petite-Nation River]] in [[Quebec]] at North Nation Mills, north of [[Plaisance, Quebec|Plaisance]].&lt;ref name="morgan"/&gt;

In 1885, he married Catherine Wilson.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;

A [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], he was five times elected as a [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] representing the [[Ontario]] [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] of [[Russell (Ontario electoral district)|Russell]].  He was first elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1887|Canadian federal election of 1887]], and was re-elected in 1888, [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891]], [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1900|1900]]. On 17 March 1903 he was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]] upon the recommendation of Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]].

Prof '''William John Macquorn Rankine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|ŋ|k|ɪ|n}}) {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]]}} LLD  (5 July 1820 – 24 December 1872) was a Scottish mechanical engineer who also contributed to [[civil engineering]], physics and mathematics. He was a founding contributor, with [[Rudolf Clausius]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin), to the science of [[thermodynamics]], particularly focusing on the first of the three thermodynamic laws. He developed the '''[[Rankine scale]]''', an equivalent to the [[Kelvin scale]] of temperature, but in degrees Fahrenheit rather than centigrade.

Rankine developed a complete theory of the [[steam engine]] and indeed of all heat engines. His manuals of engineering science and practice were used for many decades after their publication in the 1850s and 1860s. He published several hundred papers and notes on science and engineering topics, from 1840 onwards, and his interests were extremely varied, including, in his youth, [[botany]], [[music theory]] and [[number theory]], and, in his mature years, most major branches of science, mathematics and engineering. 

He was an enthusiastic amateur singer, pianist and cellist who composed his own humorous songs.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] to Lt David Rankin  (sic), a civil engineer from a military background, who later worked on the Edinburgh to [[Dalkeith]] Railway (locally known as the Innocent Railway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/profile-rankine.html|title=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame|first=|last=themastertons@btinternet.com|website=www.engineeringhalloffame.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Barbara Grahame, of a prominent legal and banking family. 

His father moved around Scotland on various projects and the family moved with him. William was initially educated at home but he later attended [[Ayr Academy]] (1828–29) and then the [[High School of Glasgow]] (1830). Around 1830 the family moved to Edinburgh when the father got a post as Manager of the Edinburgh to Dalkeith Railway. The family then lived at 2 Arniston Place.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1831&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1834 he was sent to the Scottish Naval and Military Academy on Lothian Road in Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1830&lt;/ref&gt; with the mathematician George Lee. By that year William was already highly proficient in mathematics and received, as a gift from his uncle, [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''Principia'' (1687) in the original Latin.

In 1836, Rankine began to study a spectrum of scientific topics at the [[University of Edinburgh]], including [[natural history]] under [[Robert Jameson]] and [[natural philosophy]] under [[James David Forbes]]. Under Forbes he was awarded prizes for essays on methods of physical inquiry and on the [[undulatory theory of light|undulatory (or wave) theory of light]]. During vacations, he assisted his father who, from 1830, was manager and, later, effective treasurer and engineer of the [[Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway]] which brought coal into the growing city. He left the University of Edinburgh in 1838 without a degree (which was not then unusual) and, perhaps because of straitened family finances, became an [[apprentice]] to Sir [[John Benjamin Macneill]], who was at the time surveyor to the [[Irish Railway Commission]]. During his pupilage he developed a technique, later known as [[Rankine's method]], for laying out railway curves, fully exploiting the [[theodolite]] and making a substantial improvement in [[accuracy and precision|accuracy]] and productivity over existing methods. In fact, the technique was simultaneously in use by other engineers – and in the 1860s there was a minor dispute about Rankine's priority.

The year 1842 also marked Rankine's first attempt to reduce the phenomena of [[heat]] to a [[mathematics|mathematical]] form but he was frustrated by his lack of experimental data. At the time of Queen Victoria's visit to Scotland, later that year, he organised a large [[bonfire]] situated on [[Arthur's Seat]], constructed with radiating air passages under the fuel. The bonfire served as a beacon to initiate a chain of other bonfires across Scotland.

In 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his proposer being Prof [[James David Forbes]]. He won the Society's [[Keith Prize]] for the period 1851–53. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1871 to 1872.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

From 1855 he was Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at [[Glasgow University]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

He died at 59 St Vincent Street in central Glasgow on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1872, aged only 52. He was unmarried and had no children.

==Thermodynamics==
Undaunted,{{obscure|date=October 2018}} he returned to his youthful fascination with the mechanics of the [[heat engine]]. Though his theory of circulating streams of elastic vortices whose volumes spontaneously adapted to their environment sounds fanciful to scientists formed on a modern account, by 1849, he had succeeded in finding the relationship between [[saturation vapor pressure|saturated vapour pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The following year, he used his theory to establish relationships between the temperature, [[pressure]] and [[density]] of [[gas]]es, and expressions for the [[latent heat]] of [[evaporation]] of a [[liquid]]. He accurately predicted the surprising fact that the apparent [[specific heat]] of [[saturation (chemistry)#Physical_chemistry|saturated]] [[steam]] would be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rankine|first=William|title=On the Mechanical Action of Heat, especially in Gases and Vapours|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|year=1850|volume=20|pages=147–190|doi=10.1017/S008045680003307X|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/126047#page/177/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emboldened by his success, in 1851 he set out to calculate the efficiency of heat engines and used his theory as a basis to deduce the principle, that the maximum efficiency possible for any heat engine is a function only of the two temperatures between which it operates. Though a similar result had already been derived by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], Rankine claimed that his result rested upon his hypothesis of molecular vortices alone, rather than upon Carnot's theory or some other additional assumption. The work marked the first step on Rankine's journey to develop a more complete theory of heat.

Rankine later recast the results of his molecular theories in terms of a macroscopic account of [[energy]] and its transformations. He defined and distinguished between ''actual energy'' which was lost in dynamic processes and ''[[potential energy]]'' by which it was replaced. He assumed the sum of the two energies to be constant, an idea already, although surely not for very long, familiar in the law of [[conservation of energy]]. From 1854, he made wide use of his ''thermodynamic function'' which he later realised was identical to the [[entropy]] of Clausius. By 1855, Rankine had formulated a ''science of [[energetics]]'' which gave an account of dynamics in terms of energy and its transformations rather than [[force]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The theory was very influential in the 1890s. In 1859 he proposed the [[Rankine scale]] of temperature, an absolute or thermodynamic scale whose degree is equal to a [[Fahrenheit]] degree.

Energetics offered Rankine an alternative, and rather more mainstream, approach, to his science and, from the mid-1850s, he made rather less use of his molecular vortices. Yet he still claimed that Maxwell's work on electromagnetics was effectively an extension of his model. And, in 1864, he contended that the microscopic theories of heat proposed by Clausius and [[James Clerk Maxwell]], based on linear atomic motion, were inadequate. It was only in 1869 that Rankine admitted the success of these rival theories. By that time, his own model of the atom had become almost identical with that of Thomson.

As was his constant aim, especially as a teacher of engineering, he used his own theories to develop a number of practical results and to elucidate their physical principles including:

*The [[Rankine–Hugoniot equation]] for propagation of [[shock wave]]s, governs the behaviour of shock waves normal to the oncoming flow. It is named after physicists Rankine and the French engineer [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]];
*The [[Rankine cycle]], an analysis of an ideal heat-engine with a condensor. Like other thermodynamic cycles, the maximum efficiency of the Rankine cycle is given by calculating the maximum efficiency of the [[Carnot cycle]];
*Properties of steam, gases and vapours.

The history of [[rotordynamics]] is replete with the interplay of theory and practice. Rankine first performed an analysis of a [[spinning shaft]] in 1869, but his model was not adequate and he predicted that supercritical speeds could not be attained.

==Fatigue studies==
[[Image:Tender fatigued axle.JPG|thumbnail|right|Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle, 1843.]]
Rankine was one of the first engineers to recognise that [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the [[Versailles train crash]] of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a brittle crack from a shoulder or other [[stress concentration]] source on the shaft, such as a [[keyway]]. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by [[Joseph Glynn (engineer)|Joseph Glynn]], where the axles failed by slow growth of a brittle crack in a process now known as [[metal fatigue]]. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the [[Versailles train crash]] failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause "re-crystallisation" of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of [[William Fairbairn]] a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.

==Other work==
[[File:William Rankine 1870s.jpg|thumb|Rankine in the 1870s]]
He served as [[Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from November 1855 until his death in December 1872, pursuing engineering research along a number of lines in civil and [[mechanical engineering]].

Rankine was instrumental in the formation of the forerunner of [[Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities Officer Training Corps|Glasgow University Officer Training Corps]], the 2nd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Glasgow University in July 1859, becoming Major in 1860 after it was formed into the first company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps; he served until 1864, when he resigned due to pressure of work – much of it associated with Naval Architecture.

===Civil engineering===
The [[Rankine Lecture]]s, organised by the [[British Geotechnical Association]], are named in recognition of the significant contributions he made to:
*[[Structural analysis|Forces in frame structures]];
*[[Soil mechanics]]; most notably in [[lateral earth pressure theory]] and the stabilization of [[retaining wall]]s. The Rankine method of earth pressure analysis is named after him.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Naval architecture===
Rankine worked closely with Clyde shipbuilders, especially his friend and lifelong collaborator [[James Robert Napier (engineer)|James Robert Napier]], to make naval architecture into an engineering science. He was a founding member, and first President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iesis.org/presidents.html |title=Past Presidents of IESIS |work=iesis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Institution of Engineers &amp; Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1857. He was an early member of the [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects]] (founded 1860) and attended many of its annual meetings. With William Thomson and others, Rankine was a member of the board of enquiry into the controversial sinking of [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']].
