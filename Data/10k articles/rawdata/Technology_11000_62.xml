'''Furniture of the 1970s''' refers to the style of [[furniture]] popular in the 1970s. Often, the furniture would be laid with bold fabric patterns and colors.&lt;ref name=clairewalter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clairewalter.com/articles/design_real_estate/70sDecor-2006.htm |title=www.clairewalter.com |publisher=www.clairewalter.com |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bold designs and prints were also used profusely in other decor.&lt;ref name=clairewalter /&gt; Other design elements found in 1970s furniture and interior decorating included the use of the colors brown, purple, orange, and yellow (sometimes all in the same piece of fabric), [[Shag (fabric)|shag-pile carpet]], textured walls, [[lacquer]]ed furniture, gaudy [[lampshade]]s, [[lava lamp]]s, and molded plastic furniture.&lt;ref name=clairewalter /&gt;

Another major aspect of 1970s furniture is the use of [[teak wood]].&lt;ref name=retrowow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrowow.co.uk/retro_style/70s/70s_retro_furniture.html |title=70s Retro Furniture |publisher=Retrowow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of teak in fashionable furniture and [[panelling]] regained popularity in the 1960s and items became chunkier as it progressed into the 1970s. Because of the popularity of wood in homes, dark color palettes also became more widely used as the 1970s progressed. In the mid-to-late 1970s, [[pine wood]] began to replace teak wood, and color palettes became even darker.

The '''Advanced Message Queuing Protocol''' ('''AMQP''') is an [[open standard]] [[application layer]] protocol for [[message-oriented middleware]]. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, [[routing]] (including [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] and [[Publish–subscribe|publish-and-subscribe]]), reliability and security.&lt;ref name="acmqueue"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = O'Hara, J.
 | year = 2007
 | title = Toward a commodity enterprise middleware

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

AMQP mandates the behavior of the messaging provider and client to the extent that implementations from different vendors are [[interoperable]], in the same way as [[SMTP]], [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], etc. have created interoperable systems. Previous standardizations of [[middleware]] have happened at the API level (e.g. [[Java Message Service|JMS]]) and were focused on standardizing programmer interaction with different middleware implementations, rather than on providing interoperability between multiple implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume = 10

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike JMS, which defines an API and a set of behaviors that a messaging implementation must provide, AMQP is a [[Wire protocol|wire-level protocol]]. A wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a [[byte stream|stream]] of [[octet (computing)|byte]]s. Consequently, any tool that can create and interpret messages that conform to this data format can interoperate with any other compliant tool irrespective of implementation language.

== Overview ==
AMQP is a [[Binary protocol|binary]], application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns. It provides flow controlled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, sections 2.6.7-2.6.8|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-transport-v1.0.html#doc-flow-control|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as ''at-most-once'' (where each message is delivered once or never), ''at-least-once'' (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may do so multiple times) and ''exactly-once'' (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, sections 2.6.12-2.6.13|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-transport-v1.0.html#doc-idp489648|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authentication and/or encryption based on [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] and/or [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 5.1|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-security-v1.0.html#section-security-layers|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes an underlying reliable transport layer protocol such as [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 2.1|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-transport-v1.0.html#section-transport|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMQP specification is defined in several layers: (i) a type system, (ii) a symmetric, asynchronous protocol for the transfer of messages from one process to another, (iii) a standard, extensible message format and (iv) a set of standardised but extensible 'messaging capabilities.'

== History ==
AMQP was originated in 2003 by John O'Hara at [[JPMorgan Chase]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="acmqueue" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background to the AMQ Project, Authors|url=https://github.com/imatix/openamq/blob/master/website/doc_background.txt|last=Hintjens|first=Pieter|date=7 February 2006|publisher=iMatix Corporation|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMQP was conceived as a co-operative open effort. The initial design was by JPMorgan Chase from mid-2004 to mid-2006 and it contracted [[iMatix Corporation]] to develop a C broker and protocol documentation. In 2005 JPMorgan Chase approached other firms to form a working group that included [[Cisco Systems]], [[IONA Technologies]], iMatix, [[Red Hat]], and [[Transaction Workflow Innovation Standards Team]] (TWIST).  In the same year JPMorgan Chase partnered with Red Hat to create [[Apache Qpid]], initially in Java and soon after C++. Independently, [[RabbitMQ]] was developed in [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by Rabbit Technologies, followed later by the [[Microsoft]] and [[StormMQ]] implementations.

The working group grew to 23 companies including [[Bank of America]], [[Barclays]], Cisco Systems, [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Börse]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[HCL Technologies| HCL Technologies Ltd]], [[Progress Software]], [[IIT Software]], [[INETCO Systems Limited]], [[Informatica]] (including 29 West), JPMorgan Chase, [[Microsoft| Microsoft Corporation]], my-Channels, [[Novell]], [[Red Hat]], [[Software AG]], [[Solace systems|Solace Systems]], [[StormMQ]], [[Tervela| Tervela Inc.]], TWIST Process Innovations ltd, [[VMware]] (which acquired Rabbit Technologies) and [[WSO2]].

In August 2011, the AMQP working group announced its reorganization into an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] member section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amqp.org/node/54 AMQP Working Group Transitions to OASIS Member Section]&lt;/ref&gt;

AMQP 1.0 was released by the AMQP working group on 30 October 2011, at a conference in New York.  At the event Microsoft, Red Hat, [[VMware]], Apache, INETCO and IIT Software demonstrated software running the protocol in an interoperability demonstration. The next day, on 1 November 2011, the formation of an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Technical Committee was announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amqp.org/node/58 OASIS Forms AMQP Technical Committee to Advance Business Messaging Interoperability Within Middleware, Mobile, and Cloud Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; to advance this contributed AMQP version 1.0 through the international open standards process. The first draft from OASIS was released in February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30-day Public Review for OASIS AMQP Version 1.0|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/pr-30-day-public-review-for-oasis-amqp-version-1-0|accessdate=18 June 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the changes as compared to that published by the Working Group being restricted to edits for improved clarity (no functional changes). The second draft  was released for public review on 20 June (again with no functional changes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=15 day Public Review for OASIS AMQP Version 1.0|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/15-day-public-review-for-oasis-amqp-version-1-0|accessdate=20 June 2012|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AMQP was approved as an OASIS standard on 31 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AMQP 1.0 Becomes OASIS Standard|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/news/pr/amqp-1-0-approval|accessdate=1 November 2012|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OASIS AMQP was approved for release as an ISO and IEC International Standard in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information technology -- Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) v1.0 specification|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=64955|work=ISO/IEC 19464|publisher=ISO|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMQP 1.0 was balloted through the Joint Technical Committee on Information Technology (JTC1) of the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The approved OASIS AMQP submission has been given the designation, ISO/IEC 19464.

Previous versions of AMQP were 0-8, published in June 2006, 0-9, published in December 2006, 0-10 published in February 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMQP PMC Meeting Minutes 13th February, 2008|url=http://77.95.34.224/confluence/display/AMQP/PMC+Minutes+for+2008-02-13|work=AMQP PMC Minutes|publisher=AMQP Working Group|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 0-9-1, published in November 2008. These earlier releases are significantly different from the 1.0 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-8-to-0-9-1.html|title=RabbitMQ - AMQP 0-8 to 0-9-1|website=www.rabbitmq.com|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=rabbitmq-amqp1.0: AMQP 1.0 support for RabbitMQ|date=2017-12-17|url=https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0|publisher=RabbitMQ|accessdate=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst AMQP originated in the financial services industry, it has general applicability to a broad range of [[middleware]] problems.

== Description of AMQP 1.0 ==

=== Type system ===

AMQP defines a [[self-describing]] encoding scheme allowing interoperable representation of a wide range of commonly used types. It also allows typed data to be [[semantic annotation|annotated]] with additional meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 1.1|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-types-v1.0.html#section-types|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example a particular string value might be annotated so that it could be understood as a [[URL]]. Likewise a map value containing key-value pairs for 'name', 'address' etc., might be annotated as being a representation of a 'customer' type.

The type-system is used to define a message format allowing standard and extended meta-data to be expressed and understood by processing entities. It is also used to define the communication primitives through which messages are exchanged between such entities, i.e. the AMQP ''frame bodies''.

=== Performatives and the link protocol ===

The basic unit of data in AMQP is a ''frame''. There are nine AMQP frame bodies defined that are used to initiate, control and tear down the transfer of messages between two peers. These are:

* open (the ''connection'')
* begin (the ''session'')
* attach (the ''link'')
* transfer
* flow
* disposition
* detach (the ''link'')
* end (the ''session'')
* close (the ''connection'')

The ''link protocol'' is at the heart of AMQP.

An ''attach'' frame body is sent to initiate a new link; a ''detach'' to tear down a link. Links may be established in order to receive or send messages.

Messages are sent over an established ''link'' using the ''transfer'' frame. Messages on a link flow in only one direction.

Transfers are subject to a credit based flow control scheme, managed using ''flow'' frames. This allows a process to protect itself from being overwhelmed by too large a volume of messages or more
simply to allow a subscribing link to pull messages as and when desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 2.6.7-2.6.9|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-transport-v1.0.html#doc-flow-control|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each transferred message must eventually be ''settled''. Settlement ensures that the sender and receiver agree on the state of the transfer, providing reliability guarantees. Changes in state and settlement for a transfer (or set of transfers) are communicated between the peers using the ''disposition'' frame. Various reliability guarantees can be enforced this way: at-most-once, at-least-once and exactly-once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 2.6.12-2.6.14|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-transport-v1.0.html#doc-idp489648|publisher=AMQP WorkingGroup|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple links, in both directions, can be grouped together in a ''session''. A session is a bidirectional, sequential conversation between two peers that is initiated with a ''begin'' frame and
terminated with an ''end'' frame. A connection between two peers can have multiple sessions multiplexed over it, each logically independent. Connections are initiated with an ''open'' frame in which
the sending peer's capabilities are expressed, and terminated with a ''close'' frame.

=== Message format ===

AMQP defines as the ''bare message'', that part of the message that is created by the sending application. This is considered immutable as the message is transferred between one or more processes.

Ensuring the message as sent by the application is immutable allows for end-to-end message signing and/or [[end-to-end encryption|encryption]] and ensures that any integrity checks (e.g. hashes or [[Cryptographic hash function|digests]]) remain valid. The message can be annotated by intermediaries during transit, but any such annotations are kept distinct from the immutable ''bare message''. Annotations may be added before or after the bare message.

The ''header'' is a standard set of delivery-related annotations that can be requested or indicated for a message and includes time to live, durability, priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.2.1|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#type-header|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bare message itself is structured as an optional list of standard properties (message id, user id, creation time, reply to, subject, correlation id, group id etc.), an optional list of
application-specific properties (i.e., extended properties) and a body, which AMQP refers to as application data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.2|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#section-message-format|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties are specified in the AMQP type system, as are annotations. The application data can be of any form, and in any encoding the application chooses. One option is to use the AMQP type system to send structured, self-describing data.

=== Messaging capabilities ===

The link protocol transfers messages between two ''nodes'' but assumes very little as to what those nodes are or how they are implemented.

A key category is those nodes used as a ''rendezvous point'' between senders and receivers of messages (e.g.  ''queues'' or ''topics''). The AMQP specification calls such nodes ''distribution nodes'' and codifies some common behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.3|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#section-distribution-nodes|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* some standard outcomes for transfers, through which receivers of messages can for example accept or reject messages &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.4|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#section-delivery-state|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a mechanism for indicating or requesting one of the two basic distribution patterns, competing- and non-competing- consumers, through the ''distribution modes'' ''move'' and ''copy'' respectively &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.5.2|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#doc-idp383328|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ability to create nodes on-demand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.5.3|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#type-source|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.5.4|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#type-target|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. for temporary response queues
* the ability to refine the set of message of interest to a receiver through filters &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS AMQP version 1.0, section 3.5.1|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0.html#doc-idp381376|publisher=OASIS AMQP Technical Committee|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though AMQP can be used in simple peer-to-peer systems, defining this framework for messaging capabilities additionally enables interoperability with messaging intermediaries (brokers, bridges etc.)
in larger, richer messaging networks. The framework specified covers basic behaviors but allows for extensions to evolve that can be further codified and standardised.

== Implementations ==

=== AMQP 1.0 broker implementations ===
* [[Apache Qpid]], an [[open-source software|open-source]] project at the [[Apache Foundation]]
* [[Apache ActiveMQ]], an [[open-source software|open-source]] project at the [[Apache Foundation]]

=== Pre-1.0 AMQP broker implementations ===
* [[JORAM]], a Java [[open-source software|open-source]] implementation from the [[OW2 Consortium]].
* [[Apache Qpid]] maintains support for multiple AMQP versions&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130914045254/http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.22/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[StormMQ]], a hosted [[message queuing service]] using AMQP. It is offered as a commercial [[managed services|managed service]].
* [[RabbitMQ]], an [[open-source software|open-source]] project sponsored by [[GoPivotal|Pivotal]], primarily supports AMQP 0-9-1, with 1.0 via experimental plugin

== Specification ==

AMQP protocol version 1.0 is the current specification version. It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale.  It contains less explicit routing than previous versions because core functionality is the first to be rigorously standardized.  AMQP 1.0 interoperability has been more extensively tested with more implementors than prior versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of Pre-1.0 Versions of AMQP|url=http://www.amqp.org/resources/download|publisher=AMQP site|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMQP website contains the [http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html OASIS specification for version 1.0].

Earlier versions of AMQP, published prior to the release of 1.0 (see History above) and significantly different from it, include:
* [http://www.amqp.org/specification/0-9-1/amqp-org-download AMQP 0-9-1], which has clients available "for many popular programming languages and platforms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMQP 0-9-1 Model Explained|url=http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html|publisher=VMWare, Inc.|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.amqp.org/specification/0-10/amqp-org-download AMQP 0-10]

== Comparable specifications ==
These are the known open protocol specifications that cover the same or similar space as AMQP:
* [[Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol]] (STOMP), a text-based protocol developed at Codehaus; uses the JMS-like semantics of 'destination'.
* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP), the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol.
* [[MQTT]], a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol.
* [[OpenWire (binary protocol)|OpenWire]] as used by [[ActiveMQ]].

[[Java Message Service]] (JMS), is often compared to AMQP. However, JMS is an API specification (part of the [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] specification) that defines how message producers and consumers are implemented. JMS does not guarantee interoperability between implementations, and the JMS-compliant [[Enterprise messaging system|messaging system]] in use may need to be deployed on both client and server. On the other hand, AMQP is a wire-level protocol specification. In theory AMQP provides interoperability as different AMQP-compliant software can be deployed on the client and server sides. Note that, like [[HTTP]] and [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]], AMQP does not have a standard API.

'''Alexander Duckham''' (11 March 1877 – 1 February 1945) was an English [[chemist]] and businessman, best known for the development of machine [[lubricant]]s. The son of an engineer, after university he specialised in lubrication, working briefly for Fleming's Oil Company before founding his own company, Alexander Duckham &amp; Co, in Millwall in 1899.

By the outbreak of World War I, he was an authority on technological problems relating to lubrication, and the company went public in about 1920, relocating from Millwall to Hammersmith. By the time he died in 1945, Duckhams had assumed a dominant position for the supply of lubricants and corrosion inhibitors to the motor industry in Britain and other markets. A new manufacturing plant was opened in Staffordshire in 1968, and soon thereafter the company was taken over by [[BP]].

==Early career==
Duckham was born in [[Blackheath, London]],&lt;ref name="Grace's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Duckham|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alexander_Duckham|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of a [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]-born mechanical and civil engineer, Frederic Eliot Duckham (1841 - died 13 January 1918 in Blackheath), who had patented improvements in governors for marine engines and invented a 'Hydrostatic Weighing Machine'.&lt;ref name="Grace's2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederic Eliot Duckham|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederic_Eliot_Duckham|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Maud Mary McDougall (1849-1921), sister of [[John McDougall (British politician)|John McDougall]] of the flour-making family, which had a mill at [[Millwall Dock]]. His younger brother, [[Arthur Duckham]], became one of the founders of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]], and its first President.

Upon leaving university in 1899, Alexander Duckham, who had worked briefly for Fleming's Oil Company,&lt;ref name="Grace's4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Duckham and Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alexander_Duckham_and_Co|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was encouraged by engineer Sir [[Alfred Yarrow]], who lived nearby (Yarrow occupied [[Woodlands House]] in Mycenae Road, [[Westcombe Park]] for some years from 1896, close to the Duckham family home in Dartmouth Grove, Blackheath) to specialise in the study of [[lubrication]], and was introduced to engineering firms with lubrication problems.&lt;ref name="Grace's" /&gt; Duckham established Alexander Duckham &amp; Co in [[Millwall]] in 1899,&lt;ref name="Grace's4" /&gt; and gradually assembled a team of engineers and chemists to whom he could delegate research work, freeing him to focus on lubricant production.&lt;ref name="Grace's3"&gt;{{cite web|title=1930 Industrial Britain: Alexander Duckham and Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/1930_Industrial_Britain:_Alexander_Duckham_and_Co|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early customers included car dealer and racing driver [[Selwyn Edge]] who called weekly at Duckham's Millwall works for an oil change; Duckham, who bought his first car in 1899, also used to accompany Edge to [[Brooklands]].&lt;ref name="Motorsport"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil!|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1952/39/oil|accessdate=18 June 2016|work=Motorsport|date=June 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yarrow and [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Lord Fisher]] subsequently encouraged Duckham to focus on sourcing raw materials for lubricants. From 1905 he helped pioneer the development of the [[Trinidad]] oil fields, including a deposit near [[Tabaquite]]&lt;ref name="TTNalis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tabaquite |url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/TownsandVillages/TownsandVillagesSZ/tabid/172/Default.aspx?PageContentID=158 |website=Trinidad and Tobago NALIS |accessdate=18 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710194338/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/TownsandVillages/TownsandVillagesSZ/tabid/172/Default.aspx?PageContentID=158 |archivedate=10 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of high-class [[Petroleum|crude oil]] suitable as a base for the preparation of lubricants,&lt;ref name="Grace's"/&gt; establishing a private company, Trinidad Central Oilfields, in 1911.&lt;ref name="GSTT"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Trinidad’s Oil|url=http://www.thegstt.com/education/history-of-trinidads-oil/|website=The Geological Society of Trinidad and Tobago|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery and development of such lubricants was timely, coinciding with the evolution of [[internal combustion engine]]s which demanded more advanced lubrication.&lt;ref name="Grace's4" /&gt;

As well as being a successful businessman, Duckham was an early aviation pioneer and close friend of cross-channel aviator [[Louis Blériot]] – he paid for the stone memorial in [[Dover]] marking the place where Blériot landed in 1909 to complete the first flight across the [[English Channel]] in a heavier-than-air aircraft,&lt;ref name="ADMST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellfire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dover, Louis Blériot and the Royal Flying Corps|url=http://www.hellfirecorner.co.uk/bleriot.htm|website=Hellfire Corner|accessdate=18 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316142926/http://www.hellfirecorner.co.uk/bleriot.htm|archivedate=16 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoverMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Bleriot Landing in Dover|url=http://www.dovermuseum.co.uk/Information-Resources/The-Collection/Louis-Bleriot-Landing.aspx|website=Dover Museum|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The first flight across the English Channel was made in 1785 using a hydrogen balloon.|group=Note}} and 25 years later hosted a dinner at London's [[Savoy Hotel]] marking the anniversary of the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinner given by Alexander Duckham at the Savoy Hotel|url=http://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-dinner-given-by-alexander-duckham-at-the-savoy-hotel-image18096243.html|website=Diomedia|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duckhams==
[[File:Enamel advert, Duckham's 20-50 motor oil.JPG|thumb|Thermometer with an enamel backing, featuring an advert for Duckham's 20–50 motor oil]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 heightened the focus on mechanical efficiency, and the Duckham company was already established as the highest authority on technological problems in matters of lubrication.&lt;ref name="Grace's3" /&gt; The company went public (c. 1920) soon after the war finished,&lt;ref name="Grace's4" /&gt; and relocated from Millwall to [[Hammersmith]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Grace's5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duckhams|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Duckhams|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time, Alexander Duckham died in 1945 (being succeeded as company chairman by his son Jack), Duckhams had assumed a dominant position in supply of lubricants and corrosion inhibitors to the motor industry and other markets. Behind [[Castrol]], by 1967, it was regarded as the largest independent lubricating oil company in the UK and the third largest supplier of engine oil to motorists, producing the first multigrade oil for motorists.&lt;ref name="Wager"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wager|first1=Robin|title=The Duckham's Story: A Century of Fighting Friction|date=1999|publisher=J H Haynes &amp; Co Ltd|isbn=9781859606391}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cope with demand, a new manufacturing plant was opened in [[Aldridge]], [[Staffordshire]] in 1968, shortly before the company was acquired by [[BP]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Grace's5" /&gt; Duckhams' Hammersmith site closed in 1979, was acquired by [[Richard Rogers]]' architects practice (today [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]]) in 1983, and was redeveloped to become the [[Thames Wharf Studios]] and [[The River Café (London)|the River Café]].&lt;ref name="Hopkirk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopkirk|first1=Elizabeth|title=Visitors flock to see Rogers' office for last time|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/visitors-flock-to-see-rogers-office-for-last-time/5077697.article|accessdate=21 June 2016|work=BDonline|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culbertson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Culbertson|first1=Alix|title=A sad farewell from Hammersmith as famous Richard Rogers architects to leave after 30 years|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/sad-farewell-hammersmith-famous-richard-8444295|accessdate=21 June 2016|work=GetWestLondon|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thames Wharf Studios|url=http://www.rsh-p.com/projects/thames-wharf-studios/|website=Rogers Stirk Harbour &amp; Partners|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Violet Ethel Narraway in 1902, and they had five children, all born in Greenwich: Alec Narraway Duckham (born c. 1904); Millicent A. M. Duckham (c. 1905); Joan Ethel Duckham (c. 1906); Jack Eliot Duckham (c. 1908);&lt;ref name="Grace's" /&gt; and Ruth Edith
Duckham (born 1918).

The family lived for some years from 1907 in [[Vanbrugh Castle]], close to [[Greenwich Park]]. In 1920, Duckham donated the house (and another property, Rooks Hill House in [[Sevenoaks]]) to the [[RAF Benevolent Fund]] to be used as a school for the children of [[RAF]] personnel killed in service. Vanbrugh Castle was later sold after the number of pupils declined; sale proceeds were used to educate RAF children, with funds later (1997) transferred to a charitable trust, the Alexander Duckham Memorial Schools Trust.&lt;ref name="ADMST"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.admst.org.uk/#/history/4551941354|website=Alexander Duckham Memorial Schools Trust|publisher=ADMST|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Biological Resource Centre''' ('''BRC''') is considered to be one of the key elements for sustainable international scientific infrastructure, which is necessary to underpin successful delivery of the benefits of [[biotechnology]], whether within the [[health sector]], the [[industrial sector]] or other sectors, and in turn ensure that these advances help drive growth.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==Definition==
The [[OECD]] defines BRCs as follows:

"Biological Resource Centres are an essential part of the infrastructure underpinning biotechnology. They consist of service providers and repositories of the living cells, genomes of organisms, and information relating to heredity and the functions of biological systems. BRCs contain collections of culturable organisms (e.g. [[micro-organisms]], [[plant]], [[animal]] and [[human cells]]), replicable parts of these (e.g. [[genomes]], [[plasmids]], [[viruses]], [[cDNAs]]), viable but not yet culturable [[organisms]], [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], as well as databases containing [[molecular]], [[physiological]] and structural information relevant to these collections and related [[bioinformatics]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.oecd.org/sti/biotech/23547743.pdf OECD BRC Guidelines]''&lt;/ref&gt;

BRCs retain collections of biological material and associated information to facilitate access to ex situ biological resources and to ensure that they remain available for sustainable use.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

Biological resource collections are entities compliant with appropriate national law, regulations, and policies and have been constituted to fulfil many crucial roles, which include:{{fact|date=October 2016}}


* Preservation and supply of biological resources for scientific, industrial, agricultural, environmental and medical R&amp;D and biotechnological processes.
* Performance of R&amp;D on these biological resources.
* Conservation of biodiversity.
* Repositories of biological resources for protection of intellectual property.
* Resources for public information and policy formulation.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Newport-zero-mini-butane-torch-lighter-silver.jpg|thumb|A small butane torch made for kitchen use]]
A '''butane torch''' is a tool which creates an intensely hot [[flame]] using [[butane]], a flammable [[gas]].

Consumer air butane torches are often claimed to develop flame temperatures up to approximately {{convert|1430|C}}. This temperature is high enough to melt many common metals, such as [[aluminum]] and [[copper]], and hot enough to vaporize many [[Organic chemistry|organic]] compounds as well.

==Applications==

'''Brazing, soldering, plumbing'''
Often used as daily task tools, butane torches work great for home improvement and work to solve problems with plumbing, soldering and brazing. Most of the times copper, silver and other metals are used for home repairs of tubes and other house things.

===Culinary===
[[File:Creme Brulee Torch.jpg|thumb|Using a torch to caramelize a crème brûlée]]
Butane torches are frequently employed as [[kitchen gadget]]s to [[caramelize]] sugar in cooking, such as when making [[crème brûlée]].&lt;ref name=Lauterbach&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauterbach|first=Barbara|title=The Splendid Spoonful: From Custard to Crème Brûleé|year=2005|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0811845028|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may be marketed as kitchen torches, cooking torches, or culinary torches.  Use of the butane torch in the kitchen is not limited to caramelizing sugar; it can be used to melt or brown toppings on casseroles or soups, to melt cheese, and to roast or char vegetables such as peppers.&lt;ref&gt;Blowtorches. CooksInfo.com. Published 02/22/2007. Updated 12/02/2007. Web. Retrieved 11/25/2012 from http://www.cooksinfo.com/blowtorches&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cigars===
Pocket butane torches are commonly used as lighters for [[cigars]], capitalizing on the intensity of the flame to light quickly and evenly the large, relatively damp, burning surface of a cigar.

=== Bartender ===
Many [[Bartender|bartenders]] and [[mixologists]] use butane torches in their recipes. Smoked and flaming [[Cocktail|cocktails]] are now a [[Fad|trend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://drinkwire.liquor.com/post/10-holiday-gift-ideas-from-your-favorite-mixologists#gs.5jBhlMc|title=10 Last Minute Gift Ideas For The Mixologist in All of Us|work=DrinkWire|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug use===
Butane torches are sometimes used in vaporizing cocaine free base ([[Crack cocaine|crack]]), methamphetamine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Gregory D.|title=Global Drug Enforcement: Practical Investigative Techniques|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-20348-898-0|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hash oil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breathes |first=William |title=Crazy High Times: The Rise of Hash Oil |website=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/crazy-high-times-the-rise-of-hash-oil-20130610 |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for inhalation.

[[File:Casas populares.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Casa montañesa between medians in [[Viérnoles]]. Note the masonry walls, supporting the balcony and framing a porch.]]

The type of architecture referred to as '''Casa montañesa''' is a form of [[folk architecture|traditional construction]] of [[La Montaña]] and the communities of [[Cantabria]], east of [[Asturias]] and northern [[Castile and León]] in northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;It should not be confused with casona montañesa, which differs due to its grander style and incorporation of other features.&lt;/ref&gt;

This housing style developed from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries and becoming widely seen by the end of the nineteenth century, when it was popularized by the Spanish architect Leonardo Rucabado. It was widely seen across Cantabria.

==Features==
This type of traditional country house is the most characteristic of Cantabria. It highlights the south façade, open to the sun, with the other walls made of thick rough [[masonry]]. The corners are usually of [[ashlar]]s with re-enclosure at all the [[span (architecture)|span]]s. The entrance is through a gate of one or two [[arc (architecture)|arc]]s, sufficient to allow passage of a cart into an entryway, leading to the kitchen (although in some houses the kitchen is on the upper level), stables, wine cellar, pantry and stairs to the upper floor. In some areas, there are passageways to enter the upper floor from the outside.

The upper floor contains the bedrooms, two of which face the balcony. The interior walls originally are usually made of wood, although in recent times have been replaced by brick.

The sun area is the most typical element of this construction. It is a [[balcony]] run with wood [[handrail|rail]] protected from wind and rain by the overhanging roof and the projecting sidewalls.

The walls are usually topped by wooden [[Molding (decorative)|trim pieces]] rough but of classic profiles, serving to support [[beam (structure)|beam]]s of the edge as securing the [[Can (architecture)|canes]] that form the [[Cover (construction)|overhang]]. The wood is usually painted dark brown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2957">Closed User group (CUG) is a [[GSM_services#Supplementary_Services| supplementary service]] provided by the [[Mobile_network_operator|mobile operators]] to mobile subscriber’s who can make and receive calls from any member associated within the group. This service is applicable for [[SMS]] also. There will be administrative owner who will be responsible for [[Invoice|invoicing]]. Irrespective of this a CUG member can make and receive  calls to and from other networks outside the CUG group too; although calls outside a CUG group may not be [[Invoice|invoiced]] by the administrative owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telecoedge.com/2010/10/27/closed-user-group-cug/|title=Closed User Group (CUG) Telecomconcepts|website=Telecoedge|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subscriber may:

# be a member of more than one but not more than ten closed user groups;
# be permitted to make calls outside of the closed user group (outgoing access);
# be permitted to receive calls from outside of the closed user group (incoming access);
# be allowed to make [[Emergency telephone number|emergency calls]] irrespective of the group subscription.

If the user is a member of multiple closed user groups there will be a preferred CUG assigned by the [[Cellular network|network]] that will be used by default. However, it is possible on a per-call basis to specify a different closed user group (of which the user is a member) for the call. It is also possible on a per-call basis to suppress the use of the preferred CUG, i.e. act as if the user is not a member of the closed user group, and to suppress the outgoing access permission, i.e. to insist that the call only go through if the destination is a member of the CUG.

When an incoming call is received it is possible for the network to indicate the closed user group that is being applied to the call to the called user.

For example:

Mr Rao, a senior member at a [[pizza delivery]] outlet, could be a member of two closed user groups:

* his own team of pizza delivery agents;
* his peer group of senior pizza delivery executives.

Mr Rao's preferred CUG would be that of his team. But based on whom Mr. Rao is calling, he can either suppress or enable the preferred CUG. Also, when Mr. Rao receives a call, the network would indicate which user group the call originated from.

As can be seen, this [[Supplementary service codes|supplementary service]] is restricted in use only by organizations, and is not for use by the general public. However, there are handsets that support closed user group applications.

'''Cognitive engineering''' is a method of study using [[cognitive psychology]] to design &amp; develop engineering systems to support the cognitive processes of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1204/abstract|title=Cognitive engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiley Online Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was an engineering method used in the 1970s at [[Bell Labs]], focused on how people form a [[cognitive model]] of a system based upon common metaphors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/condon.htm|title=Interview with Joseph H.

You present them with some instruments, tools, like a faucet, electric stove or something like that and demonstrate how it works. They then form in their heads a model that shows how it works inside to help them remember how to use it in the future. It may be a totally erroneous model of what is going on inside the black box."}}

According to Condon, the ideas of cognitive engineering were developed later than, and independent from, the early work on the [[Unix]] operating system.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/condon.htm|title=Joseph H. Condon|publisher=[[Princeton University]] History of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Norman]] cited principles of cognitive engineering in his 1981 article, "The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid." Norman criticized the [[user interface]] of Unix as being "a disaster for the casual user."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Norman | first1 = Don | title = The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid | url = http://www.bradleymonk.com/File:The_truth_about_Unix_Don_Norman.pdf | work = Datamation | issue = 27(12) | date = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer architecture simulator''' is a [[Computer program|program]] that simulates the [[Execution (computing)|execution]] of [[computer architecture]].

Computer architecture simulators are used for the following purposes:
* Lowering cost by evaluating hardware designs without building physical hardware systems.
* Enabling access to unobtainable hardware.
* Increasing the precision and volume of computer performance data.
* Introducing abilities that are not normally possible on real hardware such as running code backwards when an error is detected or running in faster-than-[[Real-time computing|real time]].

==Categories==

Computer architecture simulators can be classified into many different categories depending on the context.
* '''Scope''': [[Microarchitecture simulation|Microarchitecture simulators]] model the [[microprocessor]] and its components. [[Computer architecture simulator#Full-system simulator|Full-system simulators]] also model the processor, memory systems, and I/O devices.
* '''Detail''': Functional simulators, such as [[instruction set simulator]]s, achieve the same function as modeled components. They can be simulated faster if timing is not considered. Timing simulators are functional simulators that also reproduce timing. Timing simulators can be further categorized into digital cycle-accurate and analog sub-cycle simulators.
* '''Workload''': Trace-driven simulators (also called event-driven simulators) react to pre-recorded streams of instructions with some fixed input. Execution-driven simulators allow dynamic change of instructions to be executed depending on different input data.

===Full-system simulators===

A '''full-system simulator''' is execution-driven architecture simulation at such a level of detail that complete software stacks from real systems can run on the simulator without any modification. A full system simulator provides virtual hardware that is independent of the nature of the host computer. The full-system model typically includes [[processor core]]s, [[peripheral device]]s, [[computer memory|memories]], interconnection buses, and [[computer networking|network]] connections. [[Emulator]]s are full system simulators that imitate obsolete hardware instead of under development hardware.

The defining property of full-system simulation compared to an [[Instruction Set Simulator|instruction set simulator]] is that the model allows real [[Device driver wrapper|device drivers]] and [[operating system]]s to be run, not just single programs.  Thus, full-system simulation makes it possible to simulate individual computers and networked computer nodes with all their [[software]], from network device drivers to operating systems, [[network stack]]s, [[middleware]], [[Server (computing)|server]]s, and [[application program]]s.

Full system simulation can speed the system development process by making it easier to detect, recreate and repair flaws. The use of [[multi-core processor]]s is driving the need for full system simulation, because it can be extremely difficult and time-consuming to recreate and debug errors without the controlled environment provided by virtual hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddj.com/184406408 Debugging and Full System Simulation]&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows the software development to take place before the hardware is ready,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|author=Vania Joloboff|url=http://www.irisa.fr/archi09/joloboff.pdf|title=Full System Simulation of Embedded Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus helping to validate design decisions.

===Cycle-accurate simulator===

A '''cycle-accurate simulator''' is a computer program that simulates a [[microarchitecture]] on a cycle-by-cycle basis. In contrast an [[instruction set simulator]] simulates an [[instruction set architecture]] usually faster but not cycle-accurate to a specific implementation of this architecture; they are often used when emulating older hardware, where time precisions are very important from legacy reasons. Often, a cycle-accurate simulator is used when designing new microprocessors{{spaced ndash}}they can be tested, and benchmarked accurately (including running full operating system, or compilers) without actually building a physical chip, and easily change design many times to meet expected plan.

Cycle-accurate simulators must ensure that all operations are executed in the proper virtual (or real if it is possible) time{{spaced ndash}}branch prediction, cache misses, fetches, pipeline stalls, thread context switching, and many other subtle aspects of microprocessors.

'''''Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers''''' or simply '''''Crossing the Chasm''''' (1991, revised 1999 and 2014),  is a marketing book by [[Geoffrey Moore|Geoffrey A. Moore]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoffreyamoore.com&lt;/ref&gt; that focuses on the specifics of marketing [[high tech]] products during the early [[startup company|start up]] period. Moore's exploration and expansion of the [[diffusions of innovations]] model has had a significant and lasting impact on high tech [[entrepreneurship]]. In 2006, [[Tom Byers (professor)|Tom Byers]], director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, described it as "still the bible for entrepreneurial marketing 15 years later".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edcorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=1563 Educators Corner: Tom Byers, Stanford Technology Ventures Program - Ten Enduring Success Factors for High Technology Entrepreneurship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success has led to a series of follow-up books and a consulting company, The Chasm Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chasmgroup.com/ The Chasm Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In ''Crossing the Chasm'', Moore begins with the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory from [[Everett Rogers]], and argues there is a chasm between the early adopters of the [[Product (business)|product]] (the [[technology]] enthusiasts and visionaries) and the early majority (the pragmatists). Moore believes visionaries and pragmatists have very different expectations, and he attempts to explore those differences and suggest techniques to successfully cross the "chasm," including choosing a [[target market]], understanding the [[whole product]] concept, [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] the product, building a [[marketing strategies|marketing strategy]], choosing the most appropriate [[distribution (business)|distribution channel]] and [[pricing]].

''Crossing the Chasm'' is closely related to the [[technology adoption lifecycle]] where five main segments are recognized: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards.  According to Moore, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. If a successful firm can create a bandwagon effect in which enough momentum builds, then the product becomes a de facto standard. However, Moore's theories are only applicable for disruptive or discontinuous innovations.  Adoption of continuous innovations (that do not force a significant change of behavior by the customer) are still best described by the original technology adoption lifecycle.

==Pre-chasm==
Pre-chasm, in [[entrepreneurship|technology entrepreneurship]], describes the phase prior to ''Crossing the Chasm'' that focuses on the specifics of marketing high-tech products during the early start-up period. Pre-chasm was suggested as an extension to Moore's model, arguing that the phase prior to the "chasm" is left unintended and that it, driven by technology [[commoditization]] and [[lean startup]] principles, requires an ambidextrous{{huh|date=August 2017}} approach to [[product development]] alongside [[marketing]] to achieve [[product-market fit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torgronsund.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/whats-in-a-startup-methodology/|title=What's in a Startup Methodology? |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sales figures ==
Moore and his publisher originally thought that the book would sell around 5,000 copies. By 2002, ten years after the first publication, more than 300,000 copies had been sold. Moore attributes this to word-of-mouth marketing, resonating initially with high-tech managers, then to engineers, venture capitalists and finally business schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Digital Chart of the World''' (DCW) is a comprehensive digital map of Earth.  It is the most comprehensive [[geographical information system]] (GIS) global database that is freely available as of 2006, although it has not been updated since 1992.

== Origin ==
The primary source for this database is the United States [[Defense Mapping Agency]]'s (DMA) [[operational navigation chart]] (ONC) 1:1,000,000 scale paper map series produced by the US, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These charts were designed to meet the needs of pilots and air crews in medium-and low-altitude ''en route'' navigation and to support military operational planning, intelligence briefings, and other needs.

== Data structure ==
The data is divided into 2,094 tiles that represent 5 × 5-degree areas of the globe, except data obtained from [[Penn State]] which is broken up by pre-1992 national boundaries, and data from the [[National Imagery and Mapping Agency]] (NIMA) which is broken into just five tiles.  The data currency varies from place to place, ranging from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s.

The thematic layers of the Digital Chart of the World are:
* Political/ocean (country boundaries)
* Populated places (urbanized areas and points)
* Roads
* Railroads
* Aeronautical structures
* Utilities (electrical, telephone, [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s)
* Drainage system
* [[Hypsography|Hypsographic data]]
* Land cover
* Ocean features
* [[Physiography]]
* Cultural landmarks
* Transportation structure
* Vegetation
* Data location

'''Dokorder''' was a brand of [[tape recorder]] from [[Japan]]ese electronics company {{illm|Denki Onkyo|ja|電気音響}}, located in [[Ōta, Tokyo]] (not related to the [[Onkyo]] audio company of [[Osaka]], neither to [[Denon]]) that included a four-reel transport system called "Dub-A-Tape" capable of feeding two different tapes through the same [[tape head]] assembly and, in the process, recording a duplicate of a tape.  (The master and blank tapes passed through the same [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]], but through different [[tape head]] areas, yielding a Y-shaped tape path reflected in the slots built into the head assembly. Denki Onkyo also supplied a consumer and semi-pro line of reel to reel recorders (including 4 track multitracks) that competed with Tascam/Teac and Sony but ultimately its products were found to be less durable than the competition.


In 1982, [[Murata Manufacturing]] acquired 55% shares of Denki Onkyo, and in 1999, the company has been fully merged into Murata.

{{no footnotes|date=July 2018}}
'''Enfleurage''' is a process that uses odorless fats that are solid at room temperature to capture the [[fragrance | fragrant]] compounds exuded by [[plants]]. The process can be "cold" enfleurage or "hot" enfleurage.

== Process ==
There are two types of processes:
*In '''cold enfleurage''', a large framed plate of glass, called a chassis, is smeared with a layer of animal fat, usually [[lard]] or [[tallow]] (from [[pork]] or [[beef]], respectively), and allowed to set. Botanical matter, usually [[petals]] or whole [[flower]]s, is then placed on the fat and its scent is allowed to diffuse into the fat over the course of 1–3 days. The process is then repeated by replacing the spent botanicals with fresh ones until the fat has reached a desired degree of fragrance saturation. This procedure was developed in southern France in the 18th century for the production of high-grade concentrates.
*In '''hot enfleurage''', solid fats are heated and botanical matter is stirred into the fat. Spent botanicals are repeatedly strained from the fat and replaced with fresh material until the fat is saturated with fragrance. This method is considered the oldest known procedure for preserving plant fragrance substances.

In both instances, once the fat is saturated with fragrance, it is then called the "enfleurage [[pomade]]".  The enfleurage pomade was either sold as it was, or it could be further washed or soaked in [[ethyl alcohol]] to draw the fragrant molecules into the alcohol.  The alcohol is then separated from the fat and allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the [[Absolute (fragrance)|absolute]] of the botanical matter. The spent fat is usually used to make [[soaps]] since it is still relatively fragrant.

== Other fragrance extraction methods ==
{{See also|Fragrance extraction}}
The enfleurage fragrance extraction method is one of the oldest. It is also highly inefficient and costly but was the sole method of extracting the fragrant compounds in delicate flowers such as [[jasmine]] and [[tuberose]], which would be destroyed or [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by the high temperatures required by methods of fragrance extraction such as [[steam distillation]]. The method is now superseded by more efficient techniques such as [[solvent extraction]] or [[supercritical fluid extraction]] using liquid [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or similar compressed gases.

[[Image:English_Electric_Canberra_(book).jpg|thumb|right|''English Electric Canberra'']]
The '''''English Electric Canberra''''' subtitled ''The History and Development of a Classic Jet'' ({{ISBN|978-1844152421}}) is a book by British [[military historian]] and [[author]] [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny]] about the [[English Electric Canberra]].&lt;ref name=LE-Aug-9-05 &gt;''Book Review'' - [[Lincolnshire Echo]] - August 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated throughout, the book includes interviews with Wing Commander K H [[Ken Wallis|Wallis]], the man Halpenny attributes as having "saved the Canberra".&lt;ref name= "LE-Aug-9-05"/&gt;

The book looks at the development of the aircraft during the early days of jet power and beyond.&lt;ref name=Flypast &gt;''Aviation Showcase'' - ''[[FlyPast]] Magazine'' - 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the many marks and variants are described.&lt;ref name= "Flypast"/&gt; The type's record of service with [[RAF]] Squadrons is given together with descriptions of the many experimental models.&lt;ref name= "Flypast"/&gt;

In the introduction, the author states, “it was a matter of producing either a technical book, or one that would appeal to a wider readership, setting out the true Canberra story: marks, variants, overseas orders, squadrons, records, experimental Canberras, camouflage, markings, and most importantly, the truth about bombing up the aircraft; also serious problems with which the Canberra was sent out to operational R.A.F. stations."&lt;ref name=Eagle-MD-05 &gt;''The Eagle'' - Book reviews - Squadron Leader Mike Dobson A.F.C. (former Canberra pilot) - 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the latter and the finished article is an "outstanding"&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt; tribute to a remarkable aeroplane,&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt; though those that were deep aviation fans were unhappy that it was not a technical book. A case that the author could not satisfy everyone.

The book took 18 years to complete and the acknowledgments cover two full pages - a testimony to the thoroughness of Halpenny's research.&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt; Among the many firms and names mentioned, one in particular comes in for special mention. W/Cdr. K H Wallis, who saved the life of the Canberra by inventing the system of loading bombs for as late at 1951 at R.A.F. Binbrook, not a single aircraft was capable of delivering bombs, simply because the fuselage was too low to the ground!&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt; 

With Canberra's introduction came the early [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls Royce Axial Flow Avon engine]], a full description of which, its history and development is given in Chapter 2 - the author even tells us how a [[jet engine]] delivers its thrust.&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt; 

The book displays a collection of photographs - some never seen before, also the history and deployment of no less than 81 Squadrons each of which flies the Canberra in its various marks and roles.&lt;ref name= "Eagle-MD-05"/&gt;

'''''Freedom Machines''''' is a 2004 [[PBS]]/[[P.O.V.]] documentary that looks at disability in the age of [[technology]], presenting intimate stories of people ages 8–93, whose talents and independence are being unleashed by access to modern, enabling technologies. Nearly twenty years after the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], the film reflects on the gaps between its promise and the realities for our largest minority group – 54,000,000 [[Americans with disabilities]]. Whether mainstream tools or inventions such as a stair climbing wheelchair ([[iBOT]]), ''Freedom Machines'' examines the power of technology to change lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160901123724/http://www.pbs.org/pov/freedommachines/ |archivedate=September 1, 2016 |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/freedommachines/|title=Freedom Machines|date=September 14, 2004|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=September 27, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film content==
''Freedom Machines'' a public television program and national outreach campaign, looks at our beliefs about disability through the lens of [[assistive technology]]. The program 
explores how human experience and technological innovations are outpacing social policies and the perceptions that have guided them.

In ''Freedom Machines'', viewers will meet a cross-section of America's population a few of the 54 million Americans with disabilities whose lives are being transformed with the help of new technologies. Despite its promise, statistics indicate that fewer than 25% of [[disability|people with disabilities]] who could be helped by assistive technology are using it. A 1999 study commissioned by [[The California Endowment]] and conducted by the [http://www.ataccess.org Alliance for Technology Access] found that people with disabilities "make do" without vital technology because they are not aware that it is available to them and don't know how to obtain it. Furthermore, the people they most often turn to for information and referrals medical care providers, educators, and community technology centers have inadequate or outdated knowledge themselves.  The hardest hit are the poor, those who speak English as a second language, minorities, and the rural poor.

What makes this situation unusual is the existence of tangible solutions and the possibility that they can be widely applied. ''Freedom Machines'' weaves together the stories of a group of people in a dozen locations around the [[United States]]. It shows what is now possible, what will soon be possible, and why those who could and should benefit are not doing so.

==Synopsis==
''Freedom Machines'' studies the concept of diversity through the intimate stories of adults and children with disabilities who are using modern technologies to change their lives. Among them are Susanna who is beginning her college career, 38-year-old Floyd Stewart who was paralyzed in mid-life while raising four children; 92-year-old Gladys who is determined to overcome a hearing loss; and high school student Latoya Nesmith who dreams of becoming a translator at the [[United Nations]]. Fifteen years after passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], ''Freedom Machines'' is a reflection on the status of life of America's largest minority group: 54 million people with disabilities.

A '''GeoPackage (GPKG)''' is an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent and standards-based [[GIS file formats|data format for geographic information system]] implemented as a [[SQLite]] database container. Defined by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geopackage|title=GeoPackage Encoding Standard - OGC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the backing of the US military&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4isrnet.com/story/military-tech/geoint/2015/08/13/edge-pushing-geo-data-disadvantaged-troops/31547355/|title=edge-pushing-geo-data-disadvantaged-troops|first=|last=C4ISRNET|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2014, GeoPackage has seen wide widespread support from [http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/byspec/?specid=632 various government, commercial, and open source organizations].

==Origin==
Despite dozens of file formats and services for exchanging geospatial data, there was not an open format which could support both raster and vector data, while being efficiently decodable by software, particularly in mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GeoPackage as Future Ubiquitous GIS Data Format: A Review|url = http://www.jurnalteknologi.utm.my/index.php/jurnalteknologi/article/view/4319|website = www.jurnalteknologi.utm.my|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emerging Geospatial Sharing Technologies in Earth and Space Science Informatics|bibcode = 2013AGUFMIN33C..08S|journal = AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|date = 2013-12-01|pages = 08|volume = 33|first = R.|last = Singh|first2 = L. E.|last2 = Bermudez}}&lt;/ref&gt; This need was formally expressed at the OGC in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/node/1699 The OGC Forms GeoPackage Standards Working Group] - OGC Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate standard was approved by OGC in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1964 OGC adopts important GeoPackage Standard for Mobile] - OGC Press release&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A GeoPackage is built up as an extended [[SQLite]] 3 database file (*.gpkg)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geopackage.org/spec/|title=OGC® GeoPackage Encoding Standard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing data &amp; metadata tables with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content constraints.
The GeoPackage standard describes a set of conventions (requirements) for storing vector features, tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales, schema and metadata. 
A GeoPackage can be extended by using the extension rules as defined in clause 2.3 of the standard. The OGC GeoPackage standard specifies a set of OGC member approved extensions in Annex F. While additional (vendor specific) extensions may also be added by following the rules for GeoPackage extensions, beware that doing so can impact interoperability.

GeoPackage was designed to be as lightweight as possible and be contained in one ready-to-use single file. This makes it suitable for mobile applications in disconnected mode&lt;ref&gt;[http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2013/12/ogcs-geopackage-standard-enables-data-sharing-for-mobile-devices.html OGC's Geopackage standard enables geospatial data sharing for mobile devices] - Between the Poles&lt;/ref&gt; and rapid sharing on [[cloud storage]], USB drives, etc. The GeoPackage extension F.3 RTree Spatial Indexes specifies how to use SQLite [[Spatial database#Spatial index|spatial indexes]] in order to speed up performance on spatial queries compared to traditional geospatial files formats.

==Limitations==
* GeoPackage only supports one geometry column per table.

Grasscycling can provide 15 to 20% or more of a lawn's yearly nitrogen requirements.&lt;ref name="reel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelmowersetc.com/grasscycle!.htm|title=Grasscycle!|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ciwmb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/GrassCycling/default.htm|title=California Integrated Waste Management Board -  What is grasscycling?|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also note that grasscycling reduces the use of plastic bags for collecting yard waste and reduces trips to the curb or landfill to haul waste.&lt;ref name="kings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrokc.gov/procure/green/rjcgrass.htm|title=King County Experience: Grasscycling|accessdate=2007-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991105152701/http://www.metrokc.gov/procure/green/rjcgrass.htm|archivedate=1999-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal grasscycle techniques include:&lt;ref name="rivanna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baydelta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/grass/grasstips.html|title=Bay Delta Grass Recycling Campaign|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cutting no more than 1/3 the length of the grass, this means when lawns are growing fast, mowing about twice a week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

* Cutting when the grass is dry to the touch
* Cutting when the height is between 3 and 4 inches (7 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm), once per week.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Ensuring that the mower blade is sharp

Although a [[mulching mower]] can make grass clippings smaller, one is not necessary for grasscycling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4972">'''IP-XACT''' is an [[XML]] format that defines and describes individual, re-usable [[circuit design|electronic circuit design]]s (individual pieces of intellectual property, or IPs) to facilitate their use in creating [[integrated circuits]] (i.e. ''microchips''). IP-XACT was created by the [[SPIRIT Consortium]] as a standard to enable automated configuration and integration through tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accellera.org/activities/working-groups/ip-xact/ IP-XACT Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the standard are
* to ensure delivery of compatible component descriptions from multiple component vendors,
* to enable exchanging complex component libraries between [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) tools for [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]] design (design environments),
* to describe configurable components using [[metadata]], and
* to enable the provision of EDA vendor-neutral scripts for component creation and configuration (generators, configurators).

Approved as [[IEEE]] 1685-2009 on December 9, 2009, published on February 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 1685-2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7381-6160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Superseded by [[IEEE]] 1685-2014. IEEE 1685-2009 was adopted as IEC 62014-4:2015.

== Overview ==

All documents will have the following basic titular attributes spirit:vendor, spirit:library, spirit:name, spirit:version.

A document typically represents one of:
* bus specification, giving its signals and protocol etc.;
* leaf IP block data sheet;
* or a hierarchic component wiring diagram that describes a sub-system by connecting up or abstracting other components made up of spirit:componentInstance and spirit:interconnection elements.

For each port of a component there will be a spirit:busInterface element in the document.  This may have a spirit:signalMap
that gives the mapping of the formal net names in the interface to the names used in a corresponding formal specification of the port.
A simple wiring tool will use the signal map to know which net on one interface to connect to which net on another instance
of the same formal port on another component.

There may be various versions of a component referenced in the document, each as a spirit:view element, relating to different versions of a design: typical levels are gate-level, RTL and TLM.
Each view typically contains a list of filenames as a spirit:fileSet that implement the design at that level of abstraction in appropriate language, like Verilog,
C++ or PSL.

Non-functional data present includes the programmer's view with a list of spirit:register declarations inside a spirit:memoryMap or spirit:addressBlock.

'''Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association (IEEMA)''' is a national representative organization of manufacturers of electrical, industrial electronics and allied equipment in [[India]]. As a representative of the electrical industry, IEEMA maintains the dialogue with the government of India, its departments, electric utilities,  users, standardization bodies, educational institutions, research, development and testing agencies. Mr. Shreegopal Kabra is the president of IEEMA for the year 2017 -18, while Mr. Harish Agarwal and Mr. R K Chugh are the two vice presidents.  Mr. [[Sunil Misra]] is the Director General of IEEMA.

==History==
Indian Electrical &amp; Electronics Manufacturers' Association (IEEMA) was established in 1948 when eight Indian companies decided to create a platform for the promotion of Indian Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (IEMA). The original signatories to the Memorandum of Articles of Association were:
* Mr. N.W. Gurjar- Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd
* Mr. B.K. Rohatgi – India Electric Works Ltd
* Mr. C.M. Shaw- General Electric Co. (India) Ltd
* Mr. Kishenchand- Kaycee Industries Ltd
* Mr. C.G. Gorton- National Insulated Cable Co of India Ltd
* Mr. C.M. Humfrey- Associated Electrical Industries Mfg. Co. Ltd
* Mr. P.H. Bolland – Crompton Parkinson Works Ltd
* Mr. L.P. Shah- Electric Construction &amp; Equipment Co Ltd
The establishment of the [[Trade association|Association]] synchronized with attaining of independence by India reflecting the faith of Indian industrialists in the growth of various individual sectors of the economy in the atmosphere of freedom. In those years, universally, electronics had not attained the status it enjoys today and was mainly restricted to audio, broadcasting, telephonic and telegraphic communication. Telephones were still considered a luxury, affordable by elite class only. Others areas of [[electronics]] were defence oriented. Development of civilian industries in this sector was restricted. In General, electronics was considered as a part of the electrical industry.

In 1965, Mr. PR Deshpande, the dynamic doyen of the industry was elected as the President of IEMA (the then Indian Electrical Manufacturers Association). In the year 1969, the Head Office and active work were shifted to Mumbai in view of the fact that electrical industry was situated prominently in western and southern regions of the Country. In 1986, "Electronics" was added to IEMA and since then it is known as IEEMA.

In the year 2013, the president and the executive committee of IEEMA realized the need for strengthening the New Delhi office for effective advocacy and influencing public policy. To effectively meet this objective, the newly appointed Director General of IEEMA was located in New Delhi. In the past, many national industry associations, have at some point in time moved from the traditional centres of industry concentration, such as [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolkata]], to the country’s capital, [[New Delhi]] to meet similar objectives. The registered office of IEEMA continues to be in Mumbai, with a strengthened secretariat at New Delhi.

==Activities and services==
IEEMA's major activities are disseminating information about government policy changes and statistics, representing views of the industry to the government, evolving price variation clauses covering a wide range of products and circulating price indices for the same, and formulating industry standards.

IEEMA conducts technical activities where members meet and discuss issues concerning the industry and its growth opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;http://events.ieema.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

IEEMA organizes [[Elecrama]] exhibitions dedicated to the electrical T&amp;D sector, international seminars, workshops and training programs, and publishes a monthly IEEMA Journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieema.org/industry-intelligence/ieema-journal/&lt;/ref&gt;

As the representative organization of the electrical and industrial electronics industry in India, IEEMA is a part of councils and committees constituted by the government of India.

== Voice of the Indian electrical equipment industry ==
IEEMA as a voice of Indian electrical industry plays a crucial policy advocacy role with central and state government and its agencies. IEEMA is invited by various central and state ministries, central PSU’s, State Utilities to provide its inputs and to play an increasing role as a "Partner of Choice" in policy formulation.

IEEMA works closely with standardisation bodies, R&amp;D organisations, testing institutes, other apex industry bodies, autonomous institutions, trade bodies and sectoral &amp; regional associations.

'''''Jenny's Journeys''''' is a single-player educational video game by [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] (MECC) which was released on the [[Apple II]] in 1984. The game is intended for users age 10 and up. In the game, players use a map and a compass to navigate from Jenny's car to her destination.

==Production==
This game was part of a group of video game titles with which MECC entered the "home software market" in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mecc.co/history/mecc_timeline/1984-1986.html |title=1984-1986 &amp;#124; Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium |publisher=Mecc.co |date=2015-02-25 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of ''Jenny's Journeys'' is to provide a real-world context for children to apply their map-reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mecc.co/catalogs/mecc_home_software_library.pdf |format=PDF |title=How To Expand Your Child's Library Without Buying a Single Book |website=Mecc.co |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[InCider]], it is explained that this type of "role-play simulation" video game specializes in teaching kids how to follow instructions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmpRAAAAYAAJ|title=InCider|date=1 July 1990|publisher=W. Green|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The main character is a woman named Aunt Jenny. She needs help on a trip to Lake City.  Players control a car and direct where the car will travel to next, allowing them to reach the destination successfully. The game has three levels of difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jenny's Journeys|url=https://archive.org/details/a2_Jennys_Journeys_v1.0_1984_MECC_US|publisher=archive.org|date=1 January 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQxJAAAAYAAJ|title=Teaching and Computers|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Scholastic|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and legacy==
The ''Jenny's Journeys'' video game received generally favorable reviews from users, with praise given for the game's educational content in terms of geography and orientation, as well as for the realistic-for-the-time computer simulations on screen.

Regarding the educational content, ''Curriculum Review'' said the game has a "sound educational purpose and efficient method of operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QO_jAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Jenny%27s+Journeys%22&amp;dq=%22Jenny%27s+Journeys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiowZbQmfPMAhUFhqYKHQRfAB0Q6AEIMjAF |title=Curriculum Review - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' wrote that the game "reinforces map reading and cognitive skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83MqAAAAMAAJ|title=Creative Computing|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Creative Computing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was used in schools to teach children about maps and compasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=P.O. Box 6800 |url=http://www.wap.org/journal/outofretirement/ |title=Out of Retirement - And Going Strong |publisher=Wap.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Computers, Thinking, and Social Studies,'' Gene Rooze wrote that the game is appropriate for social studies classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnDmAAAAMAAJ|title=Computers, Thinking, and Social Studies|first1=Gene Edward|last1=Rooze|first2=Terry|last2=Northup|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Teacher Ideas Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Educational Resources for Microcomputers'' found that the game "makes good use of the computer's ability to create simulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=U69bAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Jenny%27s+Journeys%22&amp;dq=%22Jenny%27s+Journeys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiowZbQmfPMAhUFhqYKHQRfAB0Q6AEILjAE |title=Educational Resources for Microcomputers - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jenny's Journeys'' ranked 7th in “Top Ten” Software Products for 1984–85 School Year (units sold) by that specific publisher.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1984"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Laser color television''' ( '''laser TV'''), or '''laser''' color '''video display''' utilizes two or more individually modulated optical (laser) rays of different colors to produce a combined spot that is scanned and projected across the image plane by a polygon-mirror system or less effectively by optoelectronic means to produce a color-television display. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a [[cathode ray tube]], or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated in much the same way as with [[digital light processing]] (DLP).

The special case of one ray reduces the system to a monochromatic display as, for example, in black-and-white television. This principle applies to a display as well as to a (front or rear) '''projection technique''' with lasers (a '''laser video projector''').

==History==

The '''laser source for television''' or [[video display]] was originally proposed by Helmut K.V. Lotsch in the German Patent 1 193 844.&lt;ref&gt;
German Patent 1 193 844 entitled "Optischer Sender fuer mindestens zwei Farbkomponeneten" was filed on October 26, 1963 by - and awarded on January 20, 1966 to - the German company Telefunken. Helmut K.V. Lotsch  has explicitly been named the inventor.
&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1977 H.K.V. Lotsch and F. Schroeter explained laser color television for conventional as well as projection-type systems and gave examples of potential applications.&lt;ref&gt;
H.K.V. Lotsch, F. Schroeter: ''Das Laser Farb-Fernsehen'', LASER 2 (December 1977) 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt; 18 years later the German-based company Schneider AG presented a functional laser-TV prototype at IFA'95 in Berlin/Germany. Due to bankruptcy of Schneider AG, however, the prototype was never developed further to a market-ready product.

Proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;

LG introduced a front projected laser TV in 2013&lt;ref&gt;

as a [[consumer product]] that displays images and videos measuring 100 inches (254 centimeters) with a [[1080p|full high-definition]] resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. It can project images onto the screen at a distance of 22 inches (56 centimeters).

==Technology==
Lasers may become an ideal replacement for the [[UHP (lamp)|UHP lamps]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.novalux.com/iframe/display.php|title=The Technology Behind the Display|publisher=Novalux|accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are currently in use in projection display devices such as [[rear projection TV]] and front projectors. LG claims a lifetime of 25,000 hours&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
|url=http://www.lg.com/au/tvs/lg-HECTO-Laser-Display
|title=LG Laser Display Specifications
|publisher=[[LG Electronics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for their laser projector, compared to 10,000 hours for a UHP.
Current televisions are capable of displaying only 40% of the [[color gamut]] that humans can potentially perceive.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-jan07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgenstern|first=Steve|title=Laser-Sharp Color|journal=Popular Science|volume=270 |issue=1|date=2007|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Laser TV requires lasers in three distinct [[wavelengths]]—red, green, and blue. While red laser diodes are commercially available, there are no commercially available green laser diodes which can provide the required power at room temperature with an adequate lifetime. Instead, [[frequency doubling]] can be used to provide the green wavelengths. Several types of lasers can be used as the frequency doubled sources: fibre lasers, inter-cavity doubled lasers, external cavity doubled lasers, eVCSELs, and OPSLs (Optically Pumped Semiconductor Lasers). Among the inter-cavity doubled lasers, VCSELs have shown much promise and potential to be the basis for a mass-produced frequency doubled laser.

The blue laser diodes became openly available around 2010.

A [[VECSEL]] is a vertical cavity, and is composed of two mirrors. On top of one of them is a diode as the active medium. These lasers combine high overall efficiency with good beam quality. The light from the high power [[infrared|IR]]-laser diodes is converted into visible light by means of extra-cavity waveguided [[second harmonic generation]]. Laser-pulses with about 10&amp;nbsp;kHz repetition rate and various lengths are sent to a [[digital micromirror device]] where each mirror directs the pulse either onto screen or into the dump. Because the wavelengths are known all coatings can be [[dielectric mirror|optimized]] to reduce reflections and therefore speckle.

==Assembly==

===Laser signal modulation===
The [[video]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is introduced to the laser beam by an [[acousto-optic modulator]] (AOM) that uses a [[photorefractive effect|photorefractive]] crystal to separate the beam at distinct diffraction angles. The beam must enter the crystal at the specific [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg angle]] of that AOM crystal. A [[piezoelectric]] element transforms the video signal into vibrations in the crystal to create an image.

===Horizontal and vertical refresh===
A rapidly rotating polygonal mirror gives the laser beam the horizontal refresh modulation. It reflects off of a curved mirror onto a [[galvanometer]]-mounted mirror which provides the [[refresh rate|vertical refresh]]. Another way is to optically spread the beam and modulate each entire line at once, much like in a DLP, reducing the peak power needed in the laser and keeping power consumption constant.

===Display characteristics===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
* Maintain full power output for the lifespan of the laser; the picture quality will not degrade
* Have a very wide color [[gamut]], which can produce up to 90% of the colors a human eye can perceive by adjusting the wavelength of the laser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Yunfei|last2=Liu|first2=Xaodong|last3=Wang|first3=Lipo|last4=Ji|first4=Chunlei|last5=Sun|first5=Qiang|last6=Ren|first6=Yuan|last7=Wang|first7=Xin|title=Systems and Computer Technology|date=November 2014|publisher=CRC Press|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNGYCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Capable of displaying 3D stereoscopic video
* Can be projected onto any depth or shape surface while maintaining focus.

==Applications==
There are several realizations of laser projectors, one example being based on the principle of a flying light spot writing the image directly onto a screen. A laser projector of this type consists of three main components&amp;nbsp;— a laser source uses the video signal to provide modulated light composed of the three sharp spectral colors&amp;nbsp;— red, green, and blue&amp;nbsp;— which a flexible, fiber-optic waveguide then transports to a relatively small projection head.  The projection head deflects the beam according to the pixel clock and emits it onto a screen at an arbitrary distance.  Such laser projection techniques are used in [[handheld projector]]s, planetariums, and for flight simulators and other virtual reality applications.

Due to the special features of laser projectors, such as a high [[depth of field]], it is possible to project images or data onto any kind of projection surface, even non-flat. Typically, the sharpness, color space, and contrast ratio are higher than those of other projection technologies. For example, the on-off contrast of a laser projector is typically 50,000:1 and higher, while modern DLP and [[LCD projector]]s range from 1000:1 to 40,000:1. In comparison to conventional projectors, laser projectors provide a lower luminous flux output, but because of the extremely high contrast the brightness actually appears to be greater.

'''Leah H. Jamieson''' (born August 27, 1949, in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton, NJ, USA]]) is an American engineering educator serving at present as the John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [[Purdue University]]. She is a member of the US [[National Academy of Engineering]] and served as the 2007 President and CEO of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE).

Jamieson was a founder of the Engineering Projects in Community Service program (EPICS), a multi-university engineering design program that operates in a [[service-learning]] context.  She is a recipient of the [[Gordon Prize]].

==Biography==
Jamieson was born in 1949 and grew up in New Jersey, USA.  She received the B.S. degree in [[mathematics]] in 1972 from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). She received M.A. and M.S.E. degrees in 1974 and a Ph.D. in 1977, all three from [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="IEEE Transactions on Computers"&gt;{{Cite news|date=November 1984|title=Guest Editors Introduction, Parallel Processing|periodical=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=33|pages=949–951|doi=10.1109/TC.1984.1676367|author=Segel,|issue=11|last2=Jamieson|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamieson worked as [[Professor]] of Engineering at [[Purdue University]] since 1976. Her research interests include [[speech signal processing|speech analysis]] and [[speech recognition|recognition]]; the design and analysis of parallel processing algorithms; and the application of [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] to the areas of digital speech, [[image processing|image]], and [[signal processing]].  She has authored over 160 journal and conference papers in these areas and has co-edited books on algorithmically specialized parallel computers (Academic Press, 1985) and the characteristics of parallel algorithms (MIT Press,1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~lhj/biosketch.htm|title=Leah H. Jamieson|accessdate=2008-07-04|publisher=[[Purdue University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served Purdue as Director of the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (1990–94), Director of Graduate Admissions (1994–96), Interim Head of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (2002), and Associate Dean of Engineering for Undergraduate Education (2004–06).  At present she is serving as the John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

==Engineering Projects in Community Service==

In Fall 1995 Jamieson and her Purdue colleague Edward J. Coyle founded ''Engineering Projects in Community Service'', an academic engineering design program that operates in a [[service-learning]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epics.ecn.purdue.edu/about/papers/design.php|title=EPICS: Service Learning by Design|accessdate=2008-07-04|publisher=[[Purdue University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The program, which was initially offered only at Purdue, is available at present in 18 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epicsnational.ecn.purdue.edu/public/sites/current_sites.php|title=Current EPICS sites and affiliates|accessdate=2008-07-04|publisher=[[Purdue University]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413032230/http://epicsnational.ecn.purdue.edu/public/sites/current_sites.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers students from multiple disciplines with the opportunity to be part of engineering project design teams that work with nonprofit community organizations.  The teams provide technological solutions to challenges faced by the community organizations and their target audiences.  Examples of EPICS projects include the ''Spanish In Action'' Project at [[Butler University]], which provides students with a web-based computer game that helps them learn Spanish vocabulary; and the ''Sensor Network Air Pollution Monitoring'' project at [[Drexel University]] that allows measurement of diesel particulate concentration in Philadelphia’s neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Frontiers in Education"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sorenson|first=J.P.|date=October 2005|title=EPICS: A Service Learning Program at Butler University|periodical=Proceedings of the 35th Conference on Frontiers in Education|pages=F2F21–F2F25|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/10731/33854/01612059.pdf?arnumber=1612059|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For founding and administering EPICS, Jamieson has received in 2005 the [[Gordon Prize|Bernard M. Gordon Prize for Innovation in Engineering and Technology]] (with colleagues Edward J. Coyle and William C. Oakes). 
In 2008 the EPICS program has announced ''EPICS High'', an extension of the program’s scope to integrate high school students in the design teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epics-high.ecn.purdue.edu/|title=EPICS High|accessdate=2008-07-04|publisher=[[Purdue University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Presidency of IEEE==

In November 2005 Jamieson was elected 2006 President-elect by members of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). IEEE the world's largest technical professional society, focused on [[electrical engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[computer science]] and the related arts and sciences.  The other candidates in the 2005 elections were Gerald Peterson and James M. Tien.

Jamieson served as President and CEO of IEEE in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/newsinfo/elections05.html |title=IEEE Members Select Leah H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="179431">The following is a list of [[mobile telephony|mobile telecommunications]] networks using [[3G|third-generation]] '''[[UMTS|Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]]''' (UMTS) technology. This list does not aim to cover all networks, but instead focuses on networks deployed on frequencies other than 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz which is commonly deployed around the globe and on Multiband deployments.

{{TOClimit|limit=3}}

== General information ==
* For technical details on [[UMTS]] and a list of its designated operating frequencies, bands, and their common names, see [[UMTS frequency bands]].
* '''Networks on the global UMTS-bands 1 and 8 are suitable for global roaming in [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU Regions]] 1, 2 (some countries) and 3.'''
* Networks on UMTS-bands 2 and 4 allow roaming in ITU Region 2 (Americas) only.

== Africa &amp; Middle East ==

=== 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz (Band 1) only networks ===

As ''[[John Gillespie Magee, Jr.#"High Flight"|High Flight]]'' is for fixed-wing pilots, '''''Low Flight''''' is the poem for [[helicopter]] pilots.  Written in 1972, it is the unofficial poem of Army Aviation and USMC helicopter pilots. "Low Flight" reverses the perspective from the soaring airplane pilot to the 50 foot [[Above ground level|AGL]] helicopter pilot.  Its author is unknown.&lt;ref name="usmc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss"/&gt;

==The poem==
;LOW FLIGHT

Oh, I've slipped the surly bonds of earth&lt;br&gt;
And hovered out of ground effect on semi-rigid blades;&lt;br&gt;
Earthward I've auto'ed and met the rising brush of
non-paved terrain&lt;br&gt;
And done a thousand things you would never care to&lt;br&gt;
Skidded and dropped and flared&lt;br&gt;
Low in the heat soaked roar.&lt;br&gt;
Confined there, I've chased the earthbound traffic&lt;br&gt;
And lost the race to insignificant
headwinds;&lt;br&gt;
Forward and up a little in [[ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]]&lt;br&gt;
I've topped the General's hedge with drooping turns&lt;br&gt;
Where never [[McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] or even [[F-4 Phantom|Phantom]] flew.&lt;br&gt;
Shaking and pulling collective,&lt;br&gt; I've lumbered
The low untresspassed halls of victor airways,&lt;br&gt;
Put out my hand and touched a tree.

—Anonymous&lt;ref name="kiss"/&gt;

==Alternate versions==
Another version, dedicated to those who fly close air support for ground forces - REALLY close air, the following is from the prospective of flying 50 feet [[Above ground level|AGL]] at 400 KIAS (knots [[indicated airspeed]]).

;LOW FLIGHT

Oh, I've slipped the swirling clouds of dust&lt;br&gt;
A few feet from the dirt.&lt;br&gt;
I have flown my plane low enough&lt;br&gt;
To make my bottom hurt.&lt;br&gt;
I've raced over desert, hills, through valleys,&lt;br&gt;
And mountain passes too.&lt;br&gt;
Frolicked in the trees&lt;br&gt;
Where only gray squirrels flew.

Chasing cows along the way,&lt;br&gt;
Disturbing ram and ewe.&lt;br&gt;
I've done a hundred other things&lt;br&gt;
You damned well shouldn't do.&lt;br&gt;
I have smacked the tiny sparrow,&lt;br&gt;
Bluebird, robin, and the rest.&lt;br&gt;
Dragged vorticies through branches&lt;br&gt;
Throwing eggs out of their nests.

I've hurled through total darkness&lt;br&gt;
Just as blind as I could be,&lt;br&gt;
And spent the night in terror&lt;br&gt;
Of things I could not see.&lt;br&gt;
I've turned my eyes to heaven&lt;br&gt;
Sweating bullets through the flight,&lt;br&gt;
Reached out my hand and pressed-to-test&lt;br&gt;
—the Master Caution light.

;C-130 Version
''Low Flight'' 

Oh, I have slipped through&lt;br&gt;
swirling clouds of dust, &lt;br&gt;
A few feet from the dirt,&lt;br&gt;
I've flown the C-130 low enough,&lt;br&gt;
To make my bottom hurt.

I've flown in the desert, hills and valleys,&lt;br&gt;
Mountains too, &lt;br&gt;
Frolicked in the trees, &lt;br&gt;
Where only flying squirrels flew. 

Chased the frightened cows along, &lt;br&gt;
Disturbed the ram and ewe, &lt;br&gt;
And done a hundred other things &lt;br&gt;
That you'd not care to do. 

I've smacked the tiny sparrow, &lt;br&gt;
Bluebird, robin, all the rest, &lt;br&gt;
I've ingested baby eagles, &lt;br&gt;
Simply sucked them from their nest. 

I've streaked through total darkness, &lt;br&gt;
Just the other guys and me, &lt;br&gt;
And spent the night in terror of &lt;br&gt;
Things I could not see. 

I turned my eyes to heaven, &lt;br&gt;
As I sweated through the flight, &lt;br&gt;
Put out my hand and touched, &lt;br&gt;
The Fire Warning Light.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''Mapping controversies''' (MC) is an academic course taught in [[science studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Hess, DJ. Science Studies: An Advanced Introduction. NYU Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from the writings of the French sociologist and philosopher [[Bruno Latour]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; MC focuses exclusively on the [[scientific controversy|controversies surrounding scientific knowledge]] rather than the established scientific facts or outcomes. Thus, it helps sociologists, anthropologists and other social scientists get insights not into scientific knowledge ''per se'', but rather into ''the process of gaining knowledge''. Thus, MC sheds light on those intermediate stages corresponding to the actual research process and pinpoints the connections between scientific work and other types of activities.

==History==
The term "mapping controversies"  was first suggested in relation to analysis of scientific and technological controversies,&lt;ref&gt;Latour., B. Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and then lately re-affirmed as a widely applicable methodological approach going beyond the boundaries of Science Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used for the methodology that identifies and tracks down the polemics or debate surrounding a scientific fact, and utilises various visualisation tools to present the problem in its complexity.

Recently Latour initiated the project "Mapping Controversies on Science for Politics (MACOSPOL)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macospol.eu MACOSPOL] www.macospol.eu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; The showcase website is mappingcontroversies.net &lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.net/Home/AboutMacospol www.mappingcontroversies.net  Retrieved on 2009-12-21 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008-2009 several universities in Europe and USA started teaching "Mapping Controversies" courses for students in political sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/projets/teaching-controversy-mapping/ Média Lab Sciences Po] sciences-po.fr Retrieved on 2017-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier attempt to stage controversies in museum settings took place at the [http://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2005/forum2005/docs/mapping_controversies_report.pdf Gallery of Research] in Vienna in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Yaneva, A., Rabesandratana, T., Greiner, B. Staging Scientific Controversies: a Gallery Test on Science Museums’ Interactivity, Public Understanding of Science 2009, 18(1): [http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/0963662507077512v1 79-90].&lt;/ref&gt;

Westview Instruments, Inc.|517|370|1996}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case on whether the interpretation of [[claim (patent)|patent claims]] is a matter of law or a question of fact. An issue designated as a matter of law is resolved by the judge, and an issue construed as a question of fact is determined by the jury. 

== Background ==
Herbert Markman patented a system to track clothes through the [[dry cleaning]] process using [[barcode]] to generate receipts and track inventory.

The [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|7th Amendment]] guarantees the right to a jury trial in patent infringement cases.  The 7th Amendment preserves the right to jury trial as it existed in 1791.  There is no dispute that infringement cases today must be tried by a jury as their predecessors were in 1791.  However, the court held that the construction of the patent, including the terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the province of the court.  

In general, the effectiveness of a particular patent depends on its potential at blocking competitors. The key for a patent holder is getting the proper definition of words used in the patent to allow blocking of the particular troublesome competitive product. Prior to this decision, juries had the responsibility of deciding what the words used in patent claims meant. Opposing results in cases with similar facts were common, and a perception arose that the outcome of such trials was somewhat arbitrary. In ''Markman'', the Court held that judges, not juries, would evaluate and decide the meaning of the words used in patent claims. Judges were to look at four sources for definitions in order of priority: 
# The written description accompanying the patent claims is most relevant; 
# The documentation of the history of the patent as it went through the application;
# Standard dictionaries of English; 
# Finally, if all else fails, expert testimony from experts "skilled in the art" at issue.

This case has had a significant impact on the patent litigation process in the United States.  Many jurisdictions now hold [[Markman hearing]]s to construe patent claims prior to the start of the actual trial.  Patent infringement suits now often settle after this stage of the litigation process.

==Supreme Court decision==
In a unanimous ruling written by Justice [[David Souter]], the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that:

: ''The construction of a patent, including terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the province of the court.''

==Law firms involved==
Markman was represented in the original trial by the law firm of [[Duane Morris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duanemorris.com/relatedmatters?practice=109 Represented clients in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., Duane Morris]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the law firm of [[Eckert Seamans]] on appeal. Defendants were represented by the law firm of Gollatz, Griffin, Ewing &amp; McCarthy (now [[Flaster Greenberg]]) on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10285146068541901213&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr Summary of Federal Circuit case and decision], April 5, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media Intelligence''' uses data mining and [[data science]] to analyze public [[social content|social]] and editorial [[media content]]. It refers to marketing systems that synthesize billions of [[online conversation]]s into relevant information that allow organizations to measure and manage content performance, understand trends, and drive communications and [[business strategy]].

Media intelligence can include [[software as a service]] using [[big data]] terminology.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web |title= Digital Breadcrumbs and the New Media Intelligence |author= Leslie Nuccio |date= January 19, 2015  |url=http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/digital-breadcrumbs-and-new-media-intelligence |publisher=Social Media Today |access-date= March 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes questions about messaging efficiency, [[share of voice]], audience geographical distribution, message amplification, [[influencer]] strategy, journalist outreach, creative resonance, and competitor performance in all these areas.

Media intelligence differs from [[business intelligence]] in that it uses and analyzes data outside company [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s.  Examples of that data are [[user-generated content]] on social media sites, [[blog]]s, comment fields, and wikis etc.  It may also include other public data sources like [[press release]]s, news, blogs, legal filings, reviews and job postings.

Media Intelligence may also include competitive intelligence, wherein information that is gathered from publicly available sources such as social media, press releases, and news announcements are used to better understand the strategies and tactics being deployed by competing businesses. 

Media Intelligence is enhanced by means of emerging technologies like [[semantic tagging]], [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]], [[sentiment analysis]] and [[machine translation]]. 

==Technologies used==
Different media intelligence platforms use different technologies for [[Internet surveillance|monitoring]], curating content, engaging with content, data analysis and measurement of communications and marketing campaign success. These technology providers, such as [https://www.buzzcovery.com BuzzCovery] [[Meltwater (company)|Meltwater]], [http://www.synoptos.com Synoptos], [[Salesforce.com|Radian 6]], or Sysomos may obtain content by scraping content directly from websites or by connecting to the API provided by social media or other content platforms that are created for 3rd party developers to develop their own applications and services that access data. [[Facebook Graph Search|Facebook's Graph API]] is one such API that social media monitoring solution products would connect to pull data from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api |title=Graph API |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology companies may also get '''data from a data reseller,''' such as DataSift (acquired by Meltwater), Gnip (acquired by [[Twitter]]), LexisNexis, or Dow Jones/Factiva.

Some social media monitoring and analytics companies use calls to data providers each time an end-user develops a query. Others archive and index social media posts to provide end users with on-demand access to historical data and enable methodologies and technologies leveraging network and relational data.  Additional monitoring companies use crawlers and spidering technology to find keyword references, known as [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] or [[natural language processing]]. Basic implementation involves curating data from social media on a large scale and analyzing the results to make sense out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De |first1=Shaunak |last2=Maity |first2=Abhishek |last3=Goel |first3=Vritti |last4=Shitole |first4=Sanjay |last5=Bhattacharya |first5=Avik |title=Predicting the popularity of instagram posts for a lifestyle magazine using deep learning |journal=2nd IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems, Computing and IT Applications (CSCITA) |date=2017 |page=174-177 |doi=10.1109/CSCITA.2017.8066548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research''' (NICBR, pronounced "Nick Burr") is a [[biotechnology]] and [[biodefense]] partnership and collaborative environment of eight U.S. Federal government agencies at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;Public Affairs and Community Relations Subcommittee, ''[[Fort Detrick Standard]]'' [Special to the Standard: Thursday, Jan 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the NICBR, created in 200?, are to enhance mission effectiveness of mission partners, to optimize NICBR as a sustainable community of scientific excellence while enhancing public trust and support, and to optimize governance to enhance performance. The NICBR Vision is "Federal partners working in synergy to achieve a healthier and more secure nation."  In support of these goals, subcommittees and working groups foster interagency collaboration, maximize safety and productivity of biological research and technology development, and minimize duplication of effort, technology, and facilities among the signatories.

Four federal [[United States federal executive departments|cabinet level departments]] are represented in the NICBR: The [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] (2 agencies), the [[DHHS]] (4), the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] (1) and the [[USDA]] (1). The NICBR agencies are:
* [[U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (USAMRMC), DoD
* [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]  (NIAID), DHHS
* [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), DHHS
* [[Agricultural Research Service]], USDA
* [[DHS Science and Technology Directorate]], DHS
* [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), DHHS
* [[Naval Medical Research Center]] (NMRC), DoD
* U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), DHHS

Some NICBR laboratories are physically consolidated on the [[National Interagency Biodefense Campus]] (NIBC) which includes all NICBR partners except NCI, which maintains its own campus on the Rosemont Avenue side of Fort Detrick. The Fort Detrick Interagency Coordinating Committee (FDICC) is the central hub of the NICBR governance structure, which is chaired by the Fort Detrick U.S. Army garrison commander.  It is composed of all NICBR partner representatives.

The FDICC meets twice a month and reports to the Executive Steering Committee (ESC), which is chaired by the commander, U. S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and is composed of equivalents across the partner agencies. The ESC reports to the NICBR Board of Directors (BOD), consisting of the chair, currently Army Surgeon General, and her equivalents across the partnership.  Collectively, the NICBR governance bodies provide strategic direction and oversight to ensure that the NICBR Mission, "to develop unique knowledge, tools, and products by leveraging advanced technologies and innovative discoveries to secure and defend the health of the American people," is carried out. Members of the NICBR embrace the core philosophy of "Trust and Teamwork”.

Reporting to the FDICC are seven subcommittees and three working groups:

*The Sustainment Subcommittee
*The Financial and Business Planning Subcommittee
*The Public Affairs and Community Relations Subcommittee (PACRS)
**The Educational Outreach Working Group (reporting through the PACRS) 
*The Security Subcommittee
*The Information Management &amp; Information Technology Subcommittee
*The Safety &amp; Occupational Health Subcommittee (SOH)
**The Medical Directors Working Group (reporting through the SOH)
*The Scientific Interaction Subcommittee (SIS)
**The Select Agent Program Working Group (reporting through the SIS)

The NICBR Partnership Office (NPO) provides a staffing function and coordinating center for and under the direction of the FDICC. The NPO works closely with the subcommittees and working groups to facilitate execution of their individual charters and action items handed down by the governance bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5834">A '''noise figure meter''' is an instrument for measuring the [[noise figure]] of an [[amplifier]], [[Frequency mixer|mixer]], or similar device. An example instrument is the 1983-era [[Agilent]] 8970A.

== Measurement methods ==

One way to perform the measurement is described on the [[Y-factor]] page. A noise-figure meter could automate that procedure as follows: A gated broadband noise source (such as an [[avalanche diode]]) drives the device under test. A measurement is made with the noise source on; another measurement with the noise source off. From those measurements and the characteristics of the noise source, the noise figure can be calculated.

==Noise source==
Some noise figure meters need a calibrated broadband noise source -- a [[noise generator]]. Several methods are used to generate broadband noise. Some methods require two sources: a "hot" and "cold" source. For high frequency measurements, the noise source will be embedded in a [[transmission line]].

===Thermal noise===
[[Noise (electronics)#Thermal noise]]

Thermal noise in a resistor. Resistor in liquid nitrogen. Resistor in boiling water.

===Shot noise===
[[Noise (electronics)#Shot noise]]

Electrons crossing a gap make discrete arrivals. Impulse. White noise. Compare to thermal electrons.

{{Harvtxt|Motchenbacher|Fitchen|1973|p=292}} describe using a forward biased diode as a calibrated noise source. They also describe a generator made from a low-noise amplifier with a shorted input. Its noise voltage is determined by the shot noise of the amplifier's input transistor.

===Vacuum tube===
{{Main|Noise generator}}
Random noise generators can be made from temperature-limited vacuum tube diodes. {{Harv|Motchenbacher|Fitchen|1973|pp=289&amp;ndash;291}} The vacuum tube's anode (plate) is high enough to collect all the electrons [[Thermionic emission|emitted]] from the hot cathode. The operating conditions are set to avoid a [[space charge]] around the filament/cathode that would affect the electron emission. The anode current exhibits shot noise.

The noise current is set by the filament temperature. The current is an exponential function of filament temperature.

At low frequencies, there is 1/''f'' noise. At high frequencies, the transit time of the electron becomes an issue.

{{Harvtxt|Ott|1976|pp=218&amp;ndash;219}} describes using a noise diode to measure noise factor.

===Zener and avalanche diodes===
Voltage breakdown diodes are often used as noise generators. {{Harv|Motchenbacher|Fitchen|1973|pp=180&amp;ndash;182}} There are two breakdown mechanisms: Zener and avalanche. Diodes with the corresponding effects are known as [[Zener diode]]s and [[avalanche diode]]s. The two mechanisms have different noise behaviors.

The Zener effect (or internal field emission effect) dominates below 7 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Motchenbacher|Fitchen|1973|p=182}} graphs noise voltage versus diode breakdown voltage at 250&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;A for a family of diodes. At 3&amp;nbsp;V, the noise volage is about 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;V per root Hz. At 7&amp;nbsp;V, the noise is about 28&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;V per root Hz.&lt;/ref&gt; The junction is thin, and the electric field is large enough that electrons jump the energy gap. The primary noise is shot noise. There is little other noise (excess noise).

[[Avalanche breakdown]] is noisier. A carrier traversing the semiconductor junction is accelerated by the reverse-bias field, and it can generate new electron-hole pairs in a collision. Those new carriers can also generate more carriers in a subsequent collisions. The carriers don't arrive singly but rather in bunches. The result is [[avalanche multiplication]] of what would have been just shot noise. The spectrum, like shot noise, is white.

Avalanche breakdown can also exhibit multi-state noise. The generated output noise appears to switch between two or more distinct levels. This noise has a 1/''f'' characteristic. The effect can be minimized.

{{Harvtxt|Motchenbacher|Fitchen|1973|pp=291&amp;ndash;292}} describe a noise source using a Zener diode (and also suitable for an avalanche diode).

Some commercial microwave noise generators use avalanche diodes to create a large excess noise figure that can be turned off and on. The impedance of the diode is different during the two states, so an output attenuator is used. The attenuator reduces the noise source output, but it minimizes [[mismatch loss]]. {{Harv|Swain|Cox|1983|p=26}}

An '''optical fiber cable''', also known as a '''fiber optic cable''', is an assembly similar to an [[electrical cable]], but containing one or more [[optical fiber]]s that are used to carry light. The optical fiber elements are typically individually coated with plastic layers and contained in a protective tube suitable for the environment where the cable will be deployed. Different types of cable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfcl.com/optical-fiber-cables/ |title=different types of fiber optic cables |publisher=HFCL |first=Mariddetta |last=Posinna |date=Apr 1, 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420184733/http://www.hfcl.com/optical-fiber-cables |archivedate=2016-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are used for different applications, for example long distance [[telecommunication]], or providing a high-speed data connection between different parts of a building.

==Design==
[[Image:Optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|right|A multi-fiber cable]]
Optical fiber consists of a [[Core (optical fiber)|core]] and a [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] layer, selected for [[total internal reflection]] due to the difference in the [[refractive index]] between the two. In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a layer of [[acrylate polymer]] or [[polyimide]]. This coating protects the fiber from damage but does not contribute to its [[optical waveguide]] properties. Individual coated fibers (or fibers formed into ribbons or bundles) then have a tough [[resin]] [[Buffer (optical fiber)|buffer]] layer or core tube(s) extruded around them to form the cable core. Several layers of protective sheathing, depending on the application, are added to form the cable. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces [[cross-talk]] between the fibers, or reduces [[Lens flare|flare]] in fiber bundle imaging applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ni.com/white-paper/14802/en/| title=Light collection and propagation| work=National Instruments' Developer Zone| accessdate=2015-10-08| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222123547/http://www.ni.com/white-paper/14802/en/| archivedate=2015-12-22| df=}}&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Lc-sc-fiber-connectors.jpg|thumb|Left: [[Optical fiber connector#Types|LC/PC]] connectors&lt;br/&gt;Right: SC/PC connectors&lt;br/&gt;All four connectors have white caps covering the [[ferrule]]s.]]

For indoor applications, the jacketed fiber is generally enclosed, with a bundle of flexible fibrous [[polymer]] ''strength members'' like [[aramid]] (e.g. [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]), in a lightweight plastic cover to form a simple cable. Each end of the cable may be [[Fiber cable termination|terminated]] with a specialized [[optical fiber connector]] to allow it to be easily connected and disconnected from transmitting and receiving equipment.

[[Image:Optical breakout cable.jpg|thumb|right|An optical fiber breakout cable]]
For use in more strenuous environments, a much more robust cable construction is required. In ''loose-tube construction'' the fiber is laid [[helix|helically]] into semi-rigid tubes, allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. Loose-tube fiber may be "dry block" or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a loose tube, the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called "tight buffer" construction. Tight buffer cables are offered for a variety of applications, but the two most common are "[[Breakout cable|Breakout]]" and "[[Distribution cable|Distribution]]". Breakout cables normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3&amp;nbsp;mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-031/_4623.htm |title=Definition: rip cord |publisher=Its.bldrdoc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120012514/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-031/_4623.htm |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These ''fiber units'' are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.

A critical concern in outdoor cabling is to protect the fiber from contamination by water. This is accomplished by use of solid barriers such as copper tubes, and water-repellent jelly or water-absorbing powder surrounding the fiber.

Finally, the cable may be armored to protect it from environmental hazards, such as construction work or gnawing animals. Undersea cables are more heavily armored in their near-shore portions to protect them from boat anchors, fishing gear, and even [[shark]]s, which may be attracted to the electrical power that is carried to power amplifiers or repeaters in the cable.

Modern cables come in a wide variety of sheathings and armor, designed for applications such as direct burial in trenches, dual use as power lines, installation in conduit, lashing to aerial telephone poles, [[Submarine communications cable|submarine installation]], and insertion in paved streets.

==Capacity and market==
In September 2012, NTT Japan demonstrated a single fiber cable that was able to transfer 1 [[petabit]] per second ({{gaps|10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;|bits/s}}) over a distance of 50 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/23/ntt_petabit_fibre/ |title=NTT demos petabit transmission on single fibre |publisher=The Register |first=Richard |last=Chirgwin |date=Sep 23, 2012 |accessdate=2014-02-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221184507/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/23/ntt_petabit_fibre/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern fiber cables can contain up to a thousand fibers in a single cable, with potential bandwidth in the terabytes per second. In some cases, only a small fraction of the fibers in a cable may be actually "lit". Companies can lease or sell the unused fiber to other providers who are looking for service in or through an area. Companies may "overbuild" their networks for the specific purpose of having a large network of [[dark fiber]] for sale, reducing the overall need for trenching and municipal permitting.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} They may also deliberately under-invest to prevent their rivals from profiting from their investment.

The highest strand-count singlemode fiber cable commonly manufactured is the 864-count, consisting of 36 ribbons each containing 24 strands of fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fiber-optic-catalog.ofsoptics.com/Asset/AccuRibbonDuctSaver-web-.pdf|title=OFS 864-strand singlemode fiber cable datasheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425045528/http://fiber-optic-catalog.ofsoptics.com/Asset/AccuRibbonDuctSaver-web-.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability and quality==
Optical fibers are very strong, but the strength is drastically reduced by unavoidable microscopic surface flaws inherent in the manufacturing process. The initial fiber strength, as well as its change with time, must be considered relative to the stress imposed on the fiber during handling, cabling, and installation for a given set of environmental conditions. There are three basic scenarios that can lead to strength degradation and failure by inducing flaw growth: dynamic fatigue, static fatigues, and zero-stress aging.

Telcordia GR-20, ''Generic Requirements for Optical Fiber and Optical Fiber Cable'', contains reliability and quality criteria to protect optical fiber in all operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-20&amp;DATE=&amp;CLASS=&amp;COUNT=1000 |title=GR-20, Generic Requirements for Optical Fiber and Optical Fiber Cable |publisher=Telcordia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120140345/http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-20&amp;DATE=&amp;CLASS=&amp;COUNT=1000 |archivedate=2016-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria concentrate on conditions in an outside plant (OSP) environment. For the indoor plant, similar criteria are in Telcordia GR-409, ''Generic Requirements for Indoor Fiber Optic Cable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-409&amp; |title=GR-409, Generic Requirements for Indoor Fiber Optic Cable |publisher=Telcordia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930165841/http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-409&amp; |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacket material==
The jacket material is application specific. The material determines the mechanical robustness, chemical and UV radiation resistance, and so on. Some common jacket materials are [[Low smoke zero halogen|LSZH]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene]], [[polyurethane]], [[polybutylene terephthalate]], and [[polyamide]].

==Fiber material==
There are two main types of material used for optical fibers: glass and plastic. They offer widely different characteristics and find uses in very different applications. Generally, [[plastic optical fiber|plastic fiber]] is used for very short range and consumer applications, glass fiber is used for short/medium range ([[multi-mode optical fiber|multi-mode]]) and long range ([[single-mode optical fiber|single-mode]]) telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fiberstore.com/Single-Mode-VS.-Multimode-Fiber-Cable-aid-340.html| title=Single-Mode VS.

==&lt;!-- [[Web colors#X11 color names]] --&gt;Color coding==

===Patch cords===
The buffer or jacket on patchcords is often color-coded to indicate the type of fiber used. The strain relief "boot" that protects the fiber from bending at a connector is color-coded to indicate the type of connection. Connectors with a plastic shell (such as [[SC connector]]s) typically use a color-coded shell. Standard color codings for jackets (or buffers) and boots (or connector shells) are shown below:

Remark: It is also possible that a small part of a connector is additionally color-coded, e.g. the lever of an E-2000 connector or a frame of an adapter. This additional colour coding indicates the correct port for a patchcord, if many patchcords are installed at one point.

===Multi-fiber cables===
Individual fibers in a multi-fiber cable are often distinguished from one another by color-coded jackets or buffers on each fiber. The identification scheme used by [[Corning Cable Systems]] is based on EIA/TIA-598, "Optical Fiber Cable Color Coding." EIA/TIA-598 defines identification schemes for fibers, buffered fibers, fiber units, and groups of fiber units within outside plant and premises optical fiber cables. This standard allows for fiber units to be identified by means of a printed legend. This method can be used for identification of fiber ribbons and fiber subunits. The legend will contain a corresponding printed numerical position number or color for use in identification.&lt;ref name="interfacebus"&gt;{{cite web

The colour code used above resembles PE copper cables used in standard telephone wiring.

In the UK the colour codes for COF200 and 201 are different. Each 12 fibre bundle or element within a Cable Optical Fibre 200/201 cable is coloured as follows:

{{div col|colwidth=13em}}
*Blue
*Orange
*Green
*Red
*Grey
*Yellow
*Brown
*Violet
*Black
*White
*Pink
*Turquoise
{{div col end}}

Each element is in a tube within the cable (not a blown fibre tube) The cable elements start with the red tube and are counted around the cable to the green tube. Active elements are in white tubes and yellow fillers or dummies are laid in the cable to fill it out depending on how many fibres and units exists – can be up to 276 fibres or 23 elements for external cable and 144 fibres or 12 elements for internal. The cable has a central strength member normally made from fiberglass or plastic. There is also a copper conductor in external cables.

==Propagation speed and delay==
Optical cables transfer data at the [[speed of light]] in glass.  This is the speed of light in vacuum divided by the [[refractive index]] of the glass used,  typically around 180,000 to 200,000&amp;nbsp;km/s, resulting in 5.0 to 5.5 microseconds of latency per km. Thus the round-trip delay time for 1000&amp;nbsp;km is around 11 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkcabling.co.za/latency_and_jitter_1/ ''Latency and Jitter''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427151725/http://www.networkcabling.co.za/latency_and_jitter_1/ |date=2016-04-27 }} Retrieved 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses==
{{technical|date=April 2012}}
Typical modern multimode graded-index fibers have 3&amp;nbsp;dB/km of attenuation loss (50% loss per km) at a wavelength of 850&amp;nbsp;nm, and 1&amp;nbsp;dB/km at 1300&amp;nbsp;nm. Singlemode 9/125 loses 0.4&amp;nbsp;dB/km at 1310&amp;nbsp;nm and 0.25&amp;nbsp;dB/km at 1550&amp;nbsp;nm. Very high quality singlemode fiber intended for long distance applications is specified at a loss of 0.19&amp;nbsp;dB/km at 1550&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corning.com/media/worldwide/coc/documents/Fiber/LEAF%20optical%20fiber.pdf|title=Corning LEAF G.655 type singlemode fiber datasheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203093501/http://www.corning.com/media/worldwide/coc/documents/Fiber/LEAF%20optical%20fiber.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; POF ([[plastic optical fiber]]) loses much more: 1&amp;nbsp;dB/m at 650&amp;nbsp;nm. Plastic optical fiber is large core (about 1 mm) fiber suitable only for short, low speed networks such as within cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanshack.com/fiber-optic-tutorial-fiber.aspx ''Optical Fiber''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812190022/http://www.lanshack.com/fiber-optic-tutorial-fiber.aspx |date=2010-08-12 }} (tutorial at lanshack.com) Retrieved 2010-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each connection made adds about 0.6&amp;nbsp;dB of average loss, and each joint (splice) adds about 0.1&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/optical/ps2006/products_tech_note09186a00800e6eeb.shtml ''Calculating the Maximum Attenuation for Optical Fiber Links''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609014426/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/optical/ps2006/products_tech_note09186a00800e6eeb.shtml |date=2011-06-09 }}. [[Cisco]] document 27042. Retrieved 2010-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the transmitter power and the sensitivity of the receiver, if the total loss is too large the link will not function reliably.

Invisible infrared light is used in commercial glass fiber communications because it has lower attenuation in such materials than visible light.  However, the glass fibers will transmit visible light somewhat, which is convenient for simple testing of the fibers without requiring expensive equipment.  Splices can be inspected visually, and adjusted for minimal light leakage at the joint, which maximizes light transmission between the ends of the fibers being joined.

==Safety==
The infrared light used in telecommunications cannot be seen, so there is a potential [[laser safety]] hazard to technicians. The eye's natural defense against sudden exposure to bright light is the [[blink reflex]], which is not triggered by infrared sources. In some cases the power levels are high enough to damage eyes, particularly when lenses or microscopes are used to inspect fibers that are emitting invisible infrared light. Inspection microscopes with optical safety filters are available to guard against this. More recently indirect viewing aids are used, which can comprise a camera mounted within a handheld device, which has an opening for the connectorized fiber and a USB output for connection to a display device such as a laptop. This makes the activity of looking for damage or dirt on the connector face much safer.

Small glass fragments can also be a problem if they get under someone's skin, so care is needed to ensure that fragments produced when [[Cleave (fiber)|cleaving]] fiber are properly collected and disposed of appropriately.

==Hybrid cables==

There are hybrid optical and electrical cables that are used in wireless outdoor Fiber To The Antenna (FTTA) applications.  In these cables, the optical fibers carry information, and the electrical conductors are used to transmit power. These cables can be placed in several environments to serve antennas mounted on poles, towers, and other structures.

According to [[Telcordia]] [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3173&amp; GR-3173,] ''Generic Requirements for Hybrid Optical and Electrical Cables for Use in Wireless Outdoor Fiber To The Antenna (FTTA) Applications,'' these hybrid cables have optical fibers, twisted pair/quad elements, coaxial cables or current-carrying electrical conductors under a common outer jacket. The power conductors used in these hybrid cables are for directly powering an antenna or for powering tower-mounted electronics exclusively serving an antenna. They have a nominal voltage normally less than 60&amp;nbsp;VDC or 108/120&amp;nbsp;VAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3173&amp; GR-3173, ''Generic Requirements for Hybrid Optical and Electrical Cables for Use in Wireless Outdoor Fiber To The Antenna (FTTA) Applications''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120140345/http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3173&amp; |date=2016-01-20 }}. Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; Other voltages may be present depending on the application and the relevant National Electrical Code (NEC).

These types of hybrid cables may also be useful in other environments such as Distributed Antenna System (DAS) plants where they will serve antennas in indoor, outdoor, and roof-top locations. Considerations such as fire resistance, Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Listings, placement in vertical shafts, and other performance-related issues need to be fully addressed for these environments.

Since the voltage levels and power levels used within these hybrid cables vary, electrical safety codes consider the hybrid cable to be a power cable, which needs to comply with rules on clearance, separation, etc.

==Innerducts==
Innerducts are installed in existing underground conduit systems to provide clean, continuous, low-friction paths for placing optical cables that have relatively low pulling tension limits. They provide a means for subdividing conventional [[electrical conduit|conduit]] that was originally designed for single, large-diameter metallic conductor cables into multiple channels for smaller optical cables.

===Types===
Innerducts are typically small-diameter, semi-flexible subducts. According to [[Telcordia]] [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-356&amp; GR-356], there are three basic types of innerduct: smoothwall, corrugated, and ribbed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-356&amp; GR-356, ''Generic Requirements for Optical Cable Innerduct, Associated Conduit, and Accessories''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120140345/http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-356&amp; |date=2016-01-20 }}. Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; These various designs are based on the profile of the inside and outside diameters of the innerduct. The need for a specific characteristic or combination of characteristics, such as pulling strength, flexibility, or the lowest coefficient of friction, dictates the type of innerduct required.

Beyond the basic profiles or contours (smoothwall, corrugated, or ribbed), innerduct is also available in an increasing variety of multiduct designs. Multiduct may be either a composite unit consisting of up to four or six individual innerducts that are held together by some mechanical means, or a single extruded product having multiple channels through which to pull several cables. In either case, the multiduct is coilable, and can be pulled into existing conduit in a manner similar to that of conventional innerduct.

===Placement===
Innerducts are primarily installed in underground conduit systems that provide connecting paths between [[manhole]] locations. In addition to placement in conduit, innerduct can be directly buried, or aerially installed by lashing the innerduct to a steel suspension strand.

As stated in GR-356, cable is typically placed into innerduct in one of three ways. It may be

# Pre-installed by the innerduct manufacturer during the extrusion process,
# Pulled into the innerduct using a mechanically assisted pull line, or
# Blown into the innerduct using a high air volume cable blowing apparatus.

'''Palm kernel oil''' is an edible [[Vegetable fats and oils|plant oil]] derived from the [[Palm kernel|kernel]] of the oil palm ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Origin of oil palm |chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/y4355e/y4355e03.htm |title=Small-Scale Palm Oil Processing in Africa |first=Kwasi |last=Poku |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |series=FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin 148 |year=2002 |isbn=92-5-104859-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the other two edible oils derived from palm fruits: [[palm oil]], extracted from the pulp of the oil palm fruit, and [[coconut oil]], extracted from the kernel of the coconut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reeves |first1=James B. |last2=Weihrauch |first2=John L. |author3=Consumer and Food Economics Institute |title=Composition of foods: fats and oils |series=Agriculture handbook 8-4 |year=1979 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Science and Education Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=5301713 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm kernel oil, palm oil, and coconut oil are three of the few highly [[saturated fats|saturated]] vegetable fats; these oils give the name to the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid [[palmitic acid]] that they contain.

Palm kernel oil, which is semi-solid at [[room temperature]], is more saturated than palm oil and comparable to coconut oil.
==History==
[[Image:Elaeis guineensis MS 3467.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oil palm]] tree (''Elaeis guineensis'')]]
{{See also|Elaeis|l1=Oil palm}}

Oil from the African oil palm ''Elaeis guineensis'' has long been recognized in [[West Africa]]n countries. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use in [[Europe]], but palm kernel oil remained rare outside West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=S.O.

==Research institutions==
In the 1960s, research and development (R&amp;D) in oil palm breeding began to expand after Malaysia's Department of Agriculture established an exchange program with West African economies and four private plantations formed the Oil Palm Genetics Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, C. W. S. (1988). The Oil Palm, 3rd edn. Longman Scientific and Technical, Harlow, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian government also established Kolej Serdang, which became the Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) in the 1970s to train agricultural and agroindustrial engineers and agribusiness graduates to conduct research in the field.

In 1979 with support from the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) and UPM, the government set up the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (Porim),&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.dstcentre.com/Development%20of%20Palm%20Oil%20and%20Related%20Products%20in%20Malaysia%20and%20Indonesia%20By%20Rajah%20Rasiah%20&amp;%20Azmi%20Shahrin.pdf Development of Palm Oil and Related Products in Malaysia and Indonesia] Rajah Rasiah &amp; Azmi Shahrin, Universiti Malaya, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; a public-and-private-coordinated institution.{{clarify|what does that mean?|date=September 2012}} [[B.C. Sekhar]] was appointed founder and chairman. Porim's scientists work in oil palm tree breeding, palm oil nutrition and potential [[oleochemical]] use. Porim was renamed [[Malaysian Palm Oil Board]] in 2000.

==Nutrition==

Palm kernel oil, similarly to [[coconut oil]], is high in [[saturated fats]] and is more saturated than [[palm oil]].&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fatty Acids in Foods and their Health Implications, Third Edition |last=Chow |first=Ching Kuang |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location= |isbn= |page=241 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hcl0fkcrfbEC&amp;pg=PA241 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palm kernel oil is high in [[lauric acid]] which has been shown to raise blood cholesterol levels, both as LDL-C (cholesterol contained in [[low-density lipoprotein]]) and HDL-C (cholesterol contained in [[high-density lipoprotein]]).&lt;ref name="Rakel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Integrative Medicine |last=Rakel |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |location= |isbn= |page=381 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlVtJzBwAcEC&amp;pg=PA381 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the raise in total cholesterol concentration is partly due to more HDL-C than LDL-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8644684 |title=Comparison of the effects of diets enriched in lauric, palmitic, or oleic acids on serum lipids and lipoproteins in healthy women and men. |author=Department of Human Biology, University of Limburg, Maastricht, Netherlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Palm kernel oil does not contain cholesterol or [[trans fat|trans fatty acids]].&lt;ref name="H&amp;K"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hudsonandknight.co.za/index.php?page=palm_kernel_oil |title=Palm Kernel oil |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=hudsonandknight.co.za |publisher=Hudson &amp; Knight |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm kernel oil is commonly used in commercial cooking because it is lower in cost than other oils and remains stable at high cooking temperatures. The oil can also be stored longer than other vegetable oils.&lt;ref name="H&amp;K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bjorklund"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/314809-what-are-the-benefits-of-palm-kernel-oil/ |title=What are the benefits of palm kernel oil? |last1=Bjorklund |first1=Chad |last2= |first2= |date=22 November 2010 |work=livestrong.com |publisher=The Lance Armstrong Foundation |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Splitting of oils and fats by [[hydrolysis]], or under basic conditions [[saponification]], yields fatty acids, with glycerin (glycerol) as a byproduct. The split-off fatty acids are a mixture ranging from C4 to C18, depending on the type of oil or fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/apj.25 |title=Advanced fractionation technology for the oleochemical industry |year=2007 |last1=Faessler |first1=Peter |last2=Kolmetz |last3=Seang |last4=Lee |journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering |volume=2 |pages=315 |first2=Karl |first3=Kek Wan |first4=Siang Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/compounds-fatty.html|title=Free Fatty Acids : Butter|author=|date=|website=www.webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resembling coconut oil, palm kernel oil is packed with [[myristic acid|myristic]] and [[lauric acid|lauric]] fatty acids and therefore suitable for the manufacture of [[soap]]s, washing powders and personal care products. Lauric acid is important in soap making: a good soap must contain at least 15 per cent laurate for quick [[foam|lathering]], while soap made for use in sea water is based on virtually 100 per cent laurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://lejpt.academicdirect.org/A14/107_114.pdf |title=Evaluation of the Lubricating Properties of Palm Kernel Oil |first=John J. |last=Musa |journal=Leonardo Electronic Journal of Practices and Technologies |issue=14 |date=January–June 2009 |pages=107–114 |issn=1583-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derivatives of palmitic acid were used in combination with [[naphtha]] during [[World War II]] to produce [[napalm]] (aluminum '''''na'''''phthenate and aluminum '''''palm'''''itate).&lt;ref name="GS Napalm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/napalm.htm|title=Napalm|first=John|last=Pike|date=|website=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|right|Single-shot [[caplock]] pistol used to assassinate [[Abraham Lincoln]]. This type of small handgun is known as a [[Derringer]].]]
The '''percussion cap''', introduced circa 1820, is a type of single-use ignition device used on [[muzzleloading]] firearms that enabled them to fire reliably in any weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Fadala2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadala|first=Sam|title=The Complete Blackpowder Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dzxyneq43AEC&amp;pg=PA160|date=17 November 2006|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89689-390-1|pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crucial invention gave rise to the [[caplock]] or [[percussion rifle|percussion lock]] system.

Before this development, firearms used [[flintlock mechanism|flintlock]] ignition systems that produced [[flint]]-on-[[steel]] sparks to ignite a pan of priming powder and thereby fire the gun's main powder charge (the flintlock mechanism replaced older ignition systems such as the [[matchlock]] and [[wheellock]]).  Flintlocks were prone to misfire in wet weather, and many flintlock firearms were later converted to the more reliable percussion system.

==Description==
The percussion cap is a small cylinder of [[copper]] or [[brass]] with one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a [[explosive material#Primary explosive|shock-sensitive explosive]] material such as [[fulminate of mercury]]. The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal "nipple" at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer that strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. Percussion caps were, and still are, made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.&lt;ref name="Fadala2006"/&gt;

While the metal percussion cap was the most popular and widely used type of primer, their small size made them difficult to handle under the stress of combat or while riding a horse. Accordingly, several manufacturers developed alternative, "auto-priming" systems. The "[[Maynard tape primer]]", for example, used a roll of paper "caps" much like today's toy [[cap gun]]. The Maynard tape primer was fitted to some firearms used in the mid-nineteenth century and a few saw brief use in the [[American Civil War]]. Other disc or pellet-type primers held a supply of tiny fulminate detonator discs in a small magazine. Cocking the hammer automatically advanced a disc into position.  However, these automatic feed systems were difficult to make with the manufacturing systems in the early and mid-nineteenth century and generated more problems than they solved.  They were quickly shelved in favor of a single percussion cap that, while awkward to handle in some conditions, could be carried in sufficient quantities to make up for occasionally dropping one while a jammed tape primer system reduced the rifle to an awkward club.&lt;ref name="Fadala2006"/&gt;

The first practical solution for the problem of handling percussion caps in battle was the Prussian 1841 ([[Dreyse needle gun]]), which used a long needle to penetrate a paper cartridge filled with black powder and strike the percussion cap that was fastened to the base of the bullet.  While it had a number of problems, it was widely used by the Prussians and other German states in the mid-nineteenth century and was a major factor in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]].

In the 1850s, the percussion cap was first integrated into a metallic [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which contained the [[bullet]], powder charge and [[Primer (firearm)|primer]]. By the late 1 use [[primer (firearm)|shotshell primers]] instead of caps). Most percussion caps now use non-corrosive compounds such as [[lead styphnate]].&lt;ref name="Fadala2006"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pistolet à percussion inversée IMG 3074.jpg|thumb|Inverted percussion pistol, 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm; made by gunsmith Correvon, [[Morges]], 1854. On display at Morges military museum.]]
The percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel "[[frizzen]]", and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism. It was only generally applied to the British military musket (the [[Brown Bess]]) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The first percussion firearm produced for the US military was the percussion carbine version (c.1833) of the [[M1819 Hall rifle]].

The discovery of [[fulminate]]s was made by [[Edward Charles Howard]] (1774–1816) in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Edward (1800) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dlFFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On a New Fulminating Mercury,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' '''90''' (1): 204–238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp02292 Edward Charles Howard] at National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; The invention that made the percussion cap possible using the recently discovered [[fulminate]]s was patented by the [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Alexander John Forsyth]] of Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland in 1807.&lt;ref name="Fadala2006"/&gt;

This early system coined "Percussion Lock" operated in a near identical fashion to flintlock firearms and utilized fulminating primer made of [[fulminate of mercury]], [[chlorate of potash]], [[sulfur|sulphur]], and [[charcoal]], which was ignited by concussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/technology/percussion-lock Percussion lock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Parkes (chemist)|Samuel Parkes]], ''The chemical catechism : with notes, illustrations, and experiments'', New York : Collins and Co., 1818, page 494 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQ0NAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=related%3AISBN0714611476&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA494#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (page 494 online, see “LVI. A New Kind of Gunpowder.”)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was an invention born of necessity: Rev. Forsyth had noticed that sitting birds would startle when smoke puffed from the powder pan of his [[flintlock]] [[shotgun]], giving them sufficient warning to escape the shot. His invention of a fulminate-primed firing mechanism deprived the birds of their early warning system, both by avoiding the initial puff of smoke from the flintlock powder pan, as well as shortening the interval between the trigger pull and the shot leaving the muzzle.

Fulminate-primed guns were also less likely to misfire than flintlock guns. However, it was not until after Forsyth's patents expired that the conventional percussion cap system was developed. The percussion cap helped lead to the self-contained cartridge, where the bullet is held in by the casing, the casing is filled with gunpowder, and a [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] is at the end.

[[Joshua Shaw]], an English-born American, is sometimes credited with the development of the first metallic percussion cap in 1814, but his claim remains clouded with controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822. Furthermore, according to Lewis Winant, the US government's decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention was actually a mistake. Congress believed Shaw's patent was the earliest and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief. However, a claim for the percussion cap was filed in 1819 and granted in 1820 as an addition to an 1818 patent by Francois Prelat, two years before Shaw's patent. This doesn't necessarily make Prelat the inventor however, as he made a habit of copying English patents and inventions at the time and the mode of operation he describes is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjWpnQEACAAJ&amp;dq=Early+Percussion+Firearms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIhcKjt_G2xwIVaSPbCh1FmgQo|title=Early Percussion Firearms|publisher=Spring Books |date=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Sidney James Gooding, the most likely inventor of the percussion cap is Joseph Egg, around 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armscollecting.com/canadian-journal.asp|title=Canadian Journal of Arms Collecting, Vol. 36, No. 3|publisher=Arms Collecting Publications, Inc. |date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw's percussion caps used a mixture of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, and ground glass contained in a small metallic cup. Other possible claimants include [[Joseph Manton]] and Col. [[Peter Hawker]].

This invention was gradually improved, and came to be used, first in a steel cap, and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later.

The alteration of the military [[flintlock]] to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan and steel "frizzen" with a nipple, and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint by a smaller hammer formed with a hollow made to fit around the nipple when released by the trigger. On the nipple was placed the copper cap containing the detonating composition, now made of three parts of chlorate of potash, two of fulminate of mercury and one of powdered glass. The hollow in the hammer contained the fragments of the cap if it fragmented, reducing the risk of injury to the firer's eyes.

The detonating cap, thus invented and adopted, brought about the invention of the modern [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols.

Caps are used in [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]]s, [[grenade]]s, [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s, and [[Flare|rescue flares]]. Percussion caps are also used in [[land mine]] [[fuze]]s, [[boobytrap]] firing devices and [[anti-handling device]]s.

===Firing devices and fuze mechanisms===
As a rule, most purpose-made military [[booby-trap]] firing devices contain some form of [[spring-loaded]] [[firing pin]] designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a [[detonator]] at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge—e.g., [[C4 explosive|C4]] or a block of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g., by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked [[firing pin]] that flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing both it and the attached detonator. The resulting shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.

'''Programmed Airline Reservations System''' ('''PARS''') is an [[IBM]] proprietary large scale [[Airline Reservations System|airline reservation application]], a [[computer reservations system]], executing under the control of [[IBM Airline Control Program]] (ACP) (and later its successor, [[Transaction Processing Facility]] (TPF)). Its international version was known as ''IPARS''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hobson S.J. "ALCS — A high-performance high-availability DB/DC monitor", 1989. {{ISBN|3-540-51085-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, with the [[American Airlines]] [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]] reservations system up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed [[Deltamatic]] for [[Delta Air Lines]] on the [[IBM 7074]], and [[PANAMAC]] for [[Pan American World Airways]] using an [[IBM 7080]]. By 1967/8 IBM generalized its airline reservations work into the PARS system, which ran on the larger members of the IBM [[System/360]] family and which could support the largest airlines' needs at that time (e.g. United Airlines ran about 3000 reservations terminals online in the 1972 timeframe). In the early 1970s IBM modified its PARS reservations system so it could accommodate the smaller regional airlines on smaller members of the 370 systems family. The high performance PARS operating system evolved from [[Airlines Control Program|ACP]] (''Airlines Control Program'') to [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]] (''Transaction Processing Facility'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the early days of automated reservations systems in the 1960s and 1970s the combination of ACP and PARS provided unprecedented scale and performance from an on-line real-time system, and for a considerable period ranked among the largest networks and systems of the era. In the early 1970s major US banks were developing major on-line teleprocessing applications systems and were in urgent need of ACP's high performance capabilities. ACP was made available by IBM to the banking industry in the mid-1970s. This system was used by the great majority of large airlines in the US and internationally; and its smaller 1970's version was used by many smaller regional airlines. PARS (and IPARS) was extremely successful, and it massively improved and revolutionized the efficiency of airlines passenger operations and their profitability.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Along with many other major and regional US airlines, the PARS system was later used by [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] and [[Northwest Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Eric, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/business/diarams-pan-am-s-nwa-s-1988-route-system-pg-1-chart-comparative-strengths.html "Diagrams of the Pan Am's and NWA's 1988 route system"], The New York Times, Sunday, June 11, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;   In this context PARS was also used as a marketing name by TWA when selling their system to travel agencies.
Swiss International Airlines and Brussels Airlines discontinued using PARS beginning of 2016

CPARS (Compact Programmed Airlines Reservations) was used by smaller airlines (e.g. Icelandair).   Among other limitations (compared to PARS) was a shorter booking horizon of 90 days.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Two of these motors were used in the French electric locomotive [[:fr:Midi E 3301|Midi E3301]]]]
A '''repulsion motor''' is a type of [[electric motor]] for using on [[alternating current]] (AC).  It was formerly used as a [[traction motor]] for electric trains (e.g. [[SR Class CP]] and [[SR Class SL]] [[electric multiple unit]]s) but has been superseded by other types of motors. Repulsion motors are classified under [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] motors. In repulsion motors the [[stator]] windings are connected directly to the AC [[Electric power system|power supply]] and the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is connected to a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[Brush (electric)|brush]] assembly, similar to that of a [[direct current]] (DC) motor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrical Year Book 1937,'' published by Emmott and Company Limited, Manchester, England, pp 79–82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The motor has a [[stator]] and a [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] but there is no electrical connection between the two and the rotor current is generated by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]].  The rotor winding is connected to a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] which is in contact with a pair of [[Short circuit|short-circuited]] [[Brush (electric)|brushes]] which can be moved to change their angular position relative to an imaginary line drawn through the axis of the stator.  The motor can be started, stopped and reversed, and the speed can be varied, simply by changing the angular position of the brushes.

==Voltage==
Most commutator motors are limited to about 1,500 [[volt]]s because higher voltages give rise to a risk of [[electric arc|arcing]] across the commutator.  Repulsion motors can be used at higher voltages because the rotor circuit is not electrically connected to the supply.

Repulsion motors are based on the principle of repulsion between two [[magnetic field]]s. Consider a 2-pole [[salient pole]] motor with a vertical magnetic axis. The armature is connected to a commutator and brushes. The brushes are short circuited using a low-resistance jumper.
When alternating current is supplied to the field (stator) winding, it induces an [[electromotive force]] (emf) in the armature. The direction of alternating current is such that it creates a [[north pole]] at the top and a [[south pole]] at the bottom. The direction of induced emf is given by [[Lenz's law]], according to which the direction of induced emf opposes the cause producing it. The induced emf induces current in the armature conductors and the direction of the induced current depends on the position of the brushes.

===Stop positions===
;Brush axis parallel to field
If the brush axis is along the direction of the magnetic field, the armature behaves like an electromagnet and a N-pole is formed directly below the N-pole of the stator and a S-pole is formed directly above the S-pole of the stator. The net torque in this condition is zero. Both the N-poles repel each other and both the S-poles repel each other. The two repulsion forces are in direct opposition to each other and hence no torque will be developed. This is very fast process in this repulsion motor.

;Brush axis at right angles to field
If the brushes are shifted through 90 degrees, so that the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the brush axis, the coils undergoing short circuit change. Apart from the coils undergoing short circuit, the voltage induced in the other coils between the brush terminals is neutralized and the net voltage is zero. Since there is no induced emf, there is no current in the circuit and the net torque developed is, again, zero.

===Run positions===

If the brush axis is displaced at an angle to the magnetic axis, a net voltage is induced at the brush terminals which will produce current in the armature. The current in the armature circuit will produce its own magnetic field, with North and South poles, but in this condition, the North Pole is not directly under the North pole of the magnetic axis and the South Pole is not directly above the South Pole of the magnetic axis. The poles of the armature are slightly displaced from those of the stator. In this condition, the N-pole of the stator field will repel the N-pole of the rotor field and the S-pole of stator field will repel the S-pole of the rotor field, so the rotor starts rotating.

;Direction of rotation
The direction of rotation is determined by the position of the brushes with respect to the magnetic field of the stator. If the brushes are shifted clockwise from the main magnetic axis, the motor will rotate in a clockwise direction. If the brushes are shifted counter-clockwise from the main magnetic axis, the motor will rotate in a counter-clockwise direction.

;Torque and speed control
The starting torque of a repulsion motor is determined by the angle of brush shift from the main magnetic axis. The maximum torque is obtained from a brush shift of 45 degrees. Brush shift can also be used to control the speed of a repulsion motor.

==Types of repulsion motor==

Types of repulsion motor are listed below. It is likely that the different types were developed to match the [[torque]]/speed characteristics of the motor as closely as possible to the service it was required to provide.

===Elihu Thomson===

The [[Elihu Thomson]] motor is the original repulsion motor and is described in "Construction" above.

===Deri===
{| style="float:right"
|-
|[[File:Deri 1.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Two pole Deri motor]]
|[[File:Deri 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Four pole Deri motor]]
|}
The [[Miksa Déri|Deri]] motor is similar to the Elihu Thomson type but has two pairs of short-circuited brushes—one fixed and one moveable.  This allows very fine control of speed.

===Latour-Winter-Eichberg===

This is the "compensated" repulsion motor devised independently by '''Latour''' and by '''Winter-Eichberg'''. There are, again, two pairs of brushes but they are fixed at right angles to each other.  One pair is short-circuited while the other pair is fed with variable-voltage [[alternating current]] from [[Tap (transformer)|tappings]] on the secondary winding of a small [[transformer]].  The primary winding of the transformer is in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] with the stator winding of the motor.  This motor has the same torque/speed characteristics as an ordinary series-wound motor.

===Atkinson===

The '''Atkinson''' motor has two stator coils at right angles to each other.  Speed control (by brush-shifting) is possible from 75% below [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] speed to 10% above.  Starting torque is about 2.5 times full-load torque with twice full-load current.

===Repulsion-start induction-run===

These were used where high starting torque was required. They started as repulsion motors, but once they were running at a sizable fraction of full speed, the brushes were lifted mechanically and all commutator bars were short-circuited together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage [[induction motor]].

==Applications==
Repulsion motor applications included:
* High speed lifts
* Fans and pumps
* Printing presses 
* Textile machines
* Film winding machines (smooth manual speed and direction adjustment could be achieved without complicated circuitry)

'''Selective Door Operation''', also called '''Selective Door Opening''' (or '''SDO''') is a mechanism employed primarily on [[train]]s (although [[bus]]es with multiple doors also generally have this feature) that allows the driver or conductor/guard to open the doors of a train separately.

Selective Door Operation enables trains to call at a station where the platform is shorter than the train. Some doors can be prevented from opening to ensure that passengers do not disembark from any carriages not standing at the platform. The term Selective Door Operation is used mainly in the [[United Kingdom]]; some [[train operating company|train operating companies]] used the term ‘Door De-Select’. A version of this is used in other countries and on other rail systems such as the [[London Underground]].

==UK variations==
In the UK various trains, either [[multiple unit]]s or [[Passenger car (rail)|coaches]], have variations of the Selective Door Operating system. This usually depends on what the specific [[train operating company]] and/or [[rolling stock operating company|train leasing company]] required, either at time of purchase or a later modification to an existing train to keep up to date with regulations. Examples of these variations are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Deviations/Derogation/08-037-DGN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711074844/http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Deviations/Derogation/08-037-DGN.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Most [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] Turbostar units, with certain exceptions like the 170 Mark 1, are fitted with SDO. This when operated de-selects all carriages behind the carriage in which the train doors are being operated, so the guard can operate the SDO, allowing any length of train to occupy the platform as long as it can take one carriage.
*Former [[Midland Mainline]] Class 170 'Mark 1' Turbostar Units are fitted with SDO. This form of SDO was operated by the Driver, who would run the leading carriage off the platform and deactivate the doors in the leading cab before releasing. These units are currently in use with [[CrossCountry]], without any need for this form of SDO.
*[[British Rail Class 172|Class 172 units]] have an SDO feature fitted to them, working in a similar same way to the Class 170. The system on 172 defaults to SDO (unlike the 170) and requires the Guard to deactivate before releasing all the doors. This includes the units [[London Overground]] operates on the Gospel Oak Branch, although [[One-man operation|Driver Only]] is now in operation on the entire London Overground network.
*[[British Rail Class 350|Class 350]], [[British Rail Class 444|444]] and [[British Rail Class 450|450]] Desiro electric multiple units use a system call Unit De-Select. This allows the guard of the train to de-select an entire unit on a train while they are in working in multiple from one of the driving cabs, meaning that an 8 coach 350 or 450 set for example, made up of two units (each unit has 4 coaches), can have one set de-selected. The Class 444 is made up of 5 coaches per unit but the principle is the same.
*[[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] sets have SDO at almost all door locations. These trains are of the slam door variety and fitted with the Central Door Locking system. The guard operates the SDO system from most door control panels throughout the train. The guard can then either de-select doors in front of that location or behind.
*[[British Rail Class 180|Class 180 units]] are fitted with SDO, this is operated by the driver (who also releases the doors) from a switch in the leading cab.
* Most Electrostars (Bombardier built) [[British Rail Class 375|Class 375]], [[British Rail Class 377|377]], [[British Rail Class 378|378]], [[British Rail Class 379|379]] and [[British Rail Class 387|387]] have SDO systems fitted and operate in the South eastern region of the country. A [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receiver located on the train passes location data to the MITRAC Train Control Management System,&lt;ref name="FCC377"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Class 377 Electrostar: Selective Door Operation / SDO Risks|publisher=[[First Capital Connect]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses its database of platform lengths to determine how many doors will be released when the driver presses the 'door open' buttons at a station. The Class 387s in use on the [[Govia Thameslink Railway|Govia Thameslink]] routes have an additional Tracklink II&lt;ref name="sella"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sella Controls: Tracklink solutions| url=http://www.sellacontrols.com/rail-systems/tracklink-solutions| publisher = www.sellacontrols.com| accessdate =2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; system to augment the GPS. The Tracklink II system consists of a [[balise]] fitted at short platform stations which sends data to the approaching train showing which station it is approaching, and the length of the platform that it is entering. The Tracklink II system is necessary because GPS is not accurate enough to differentiate between platforms at a multi-platform station.

==International variations==
Selective door operation is implemented at certain railway stations in the United States. In the [[New York City Subway]], the {{frac|7|1|2}}-car-long platforms at [[145th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line)|145th Street]] (and formerly the 5-car-long loop platforms at [[South Ferry–Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)#Old station|South Ferry]]) are too short to accommodate full-length trains of ten {{convert|51.4|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} cars, so only the first five cars of the train opened their doors at these stations. Also at South Ferry, the inner platform's curves were so tight that only the inner doors of the cars were able to be opened. At [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]] on track 4 of the [[42nd Street Shuttle]], the platform is so short that only the first door of the third car may open at the station.

In [[Boston]], the boarding platform at the [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] terminus of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] accommodates only four of the train's six cars; passengers must press buttons to open the doors. Similar selective door operation protocols are used on many commuter rail lines within the [[Northeast megalopolis]] since some commuter rail stations have platforms that are too short to accommodate longer trains.

In [[Seattle]], the [[Satellite Transit System]] at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] uses selective door operation on the loop connecting the South Satellite (the airport's international concourse) with the airport's main terminal. Passengers on most international flights arrive at the South Satellite, where they are inspected by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officials; after clearing inspection, passengers have the option of waiting in line to be inspected by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] so that they may access the rear two cars and secure area of the airport (to catch a connecting flight) or directly boarding the first train car which transports them to the airport exit and the baggage claim area. The platform screen doors that provide access to the first car of the train do not open at the station serving Concourse B of the airport to prevent unscreened passengers from accessing the concourse. 

In New Zealand, “selective door opening” is used on the [[Wairarapa Connection]] commuter train, as the [[Maymorn railway station]] platform is not long enough to accommodate all the carriages, and Maymorn passengers are restricted to the first three carriages.

==Limitations==
Most modern Selective Door Opening (SDO) systems receive their positioning data from the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).  As the train arrives at a station, the GPS [[Position fixing|determines the location]] for the train's SDO control, which contains a database with a Unique Location Identifier (ULI) for each station. This then enables the correct number of coaches to be opened to suit the length of the platform. However this system is reliant on the train stopping in the correct position, since the SDO will authorise the doors to open as long as the train is within 300 metres of the station.&lt;ref name="RIS2747"&gt;{{cite web| title = Functioning and Control of Exterior Doors on Passenger Vehicles| url=https://www.rssb.co.uk/rgs/standards/RIS-2747-RST%20Iss%201.pdf| publisher = [[RSSB]]| accessdate =2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on which system is in use, SDO may not prevent the doors from being opened where there is no platform if;
* The train stops beyond the appropriate stop mark and the driver releases the doors
* The train stops before the appropriate stop mark and the driver releases the doors
* The driver releases the doors on the wrong side of the train

'''Sergey Alexeyevich Lebedev''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Алексе́евич Ле́бедев}}; 2 November 1902, [[New Style|n.s.]] – 3 July 1974) was a [[Russia|Russian-born]] [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic|Ukrainian Soviet]] scientist in the fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], and designer of the first Soviet computers.

Lebedev was born in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Russia]]. He graduated from [[Moscow State Technical University|Moscow Highest Technical School]] in 1928. From then until 1946 he worked at [[All-Union Electrotechnical Institute]] (formerly a division of MSTU) in [[Moscow]] and [[Kiev]]. In 1939 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Sciences for the development of the theory of "artificial stability" of electrical systems.

During [[World War II]], Lebedev worked in the field of control automation of complex systems. His group designed a weapon-aiming stabilization system for tanks and an automatic guidance system for airborne missiles. To perform these tasks Lebedev developed an [[analog computer]] system to solve ordinary differential equations.

From 1946 to 1951 he headed the [[Kiev Electrotechnical Institute]] of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, working on improving the stability of electrical systems. For this work he received the Stalin (State) prize in 1950.

In 1948 Lebedev learned from foreign magazines that scientists in western countries were working on the design of electronic computers, although the details were secret. In the autumn of the same year he decided to focus the work of his laboratory on computer design. Lebedev's first computer, [[BESM|BESM-1]], was completed by the end of 1951.  In April 1953 the State commission accepted the BESM-1 as operational, but it did not go into series production because of opposition from the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building, which had developed its own weaker and less reliable machine.

Lebedev then began development of a new, more powerful computer, the M-20, the number denoting its expected processing speed of twenty thousand operations per second. In 1958 the machine was accepted as operational and put into series production. Simultaneously the BESM-2, a development of the BESM-1, went into series production. Though the BESM-2 was slower than the M-20, it was more reliable. It was used to calculate satellite orbits and the trajectory of the first rocket to reach the surface of the Moon. Lebedev and his team developed several more computers, notably the BESM-6, which was in production for 17 years.

In 1952, Lebedev became a professor at the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. From 1953 until his death he was the director of what is now called the [[Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering|Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering]].

Lebedev died in [[Moscow]] and is interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

In 1996 the IEEE Computer Society recognized Sergey Lebedev with a [[Computer Pioneer Award]] for his work in the field of computer design and his founding of the Soviet computer industry.

'''Sleipner A''' is a combined accommodations, production and processing offshore platform at the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner East gas field]] in the Norwegian sector of the [[North Sea]]. For those in huds it collapsed. It is a [[Condeep]]-type [[oil platform]], built in [[Norway]] by the company [[Norwegian Contractors]] for [[Statoil]].

It is known for its catastrophic failure on 23 August 1991, due to a design flaw, that resulted from an error caused by unconservative concrete codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selby RG, Vecchio FJ, Collins MP |title=The Failure of an Offshore Platform |journal=Concrete International |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=28–35 |year=1997 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.concrete.org/PUBS/JOURNALS/AbstractDetails.asp?SearchID=461713&amp;date=anytime&amp;allwords=ff&amp;aftermonth=1&amp;searchmonth=8&amp;searchday=1&amp;publication=Concrete+International&amp;ID=56 |access-date=2008-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035900/http://www.concrete.org/PUBS/JOURNALS/AbstractDetails.asp?SearchID=461713&amp;date=anytime&amp;allwords=ff&amp;aftermonth=1&amp;searchmonth=8&amp;searchday=1&amp;publication=Concrete+International&amp;ID=56 |archive-date=2011-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and inaccurate [[finite element analysis]] modelling of the tricell, which formed part of the ballasting/flotation system.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold DN.

Accessed on: June 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Sleipner A is located on the Sleipner East gas field on the North Sea.  Also six satellite fields–Gungne, Loke, Alpha North, Sigyn, Volve and Volve South–are tied-back to Sleipner A.&lt;ref name=subseaiq&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its own operations, the platform is used as a remote operation center for the Sleipner B wellhead platform. The Sleipner B is operated from the Sleipner A via an [[umbilical cable]]. In addition, the Sleipner T [[carbon dioxide]] treatment platform is linked physically to the Sleipner A platform by a bridge.&lt;ref name=reuters181209&gt;

| accessdate = 2009-12-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The platform is designed to accommodate roughly 160&amp;nbsp;people.  The platform deck is {{convert|60|by|140|m|ft|0|sp=us}} with height of {{convert|210|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=alex&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hull was a gravity base made up of support pilings and concrete ballast chambers from which three or four shafts rise and upon which the deck sits. Once fully ballasted, the hull was to sit on the sea floor.  There were 24&amp;nbsp;chambers, of which four formed the 'legs' supporting the facility on top in the case of the Sleipner A oil rig.

The hull was redesigned after the accident and the Sleipner A Platform was successfully completed in June 1993.

==1991 accident==

===Collapse===
The original hull collapsed during the final construction because of a design flaw.&lt;ref name=alex/&gt;  It was towed into [[Gandsfjord]] where it was to be lowered in the water in a controlled ballasting operation at a rate of 1&amp;nbsp;meter per 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. This was necessary for the fitment of the deck platform to the hull. As the hull was lowered to the {{convert|65|m|adj=on|sp=us}} mark,&lt;ref name=oilrigdisasters&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; rumbling noises were heard followed by the sound of water pouring into the unit. A cell wall had failed and a serious crack had developed, and sea water poured in at a rate that was too great for the deballasting [[pump]]s to deal with. Within a few minutes the hull began sinking at a rate of 1&amp;nbsp;meter per minute. As the structure sank deeper into the {{convert|210|m|adj=on|sp=us}} fjord, the buoyancy chambers imploded and the rubble struck the floor of the fjord, creating a [[Richter magnitude scale]] 3&amp;nbsp;earthquake.

Later analysis showed that the failure would occur at 62 meters (203 feet).&lt;ref name=oilrigdisasters/&gt;

No one was injured during the accident.&lt;ref name=alex/&gt;

===Investigation===
The post-accident investigation by [[SINTEF]] in Norway discovered that the root cause of the failure resulted from inaccurate [[NASTRAN]] calculations{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} in the design of the structure. [[stress (physics)|Stress]]es on the ballast chambers were underestimated by 47% and some concrete walls were designed too thin to resist foreseeable hydrostatic pressure when submerged. As the pressure increased, the walls failed and cracked, allowing sea water to enter the tank at an uncontrolled rate, eventually sinking the hull.

After the accident, the project leaders from Norwegian Contractors were brought before the Statoil board, and were expecting severe repercussions. But the director instead asked the famous question "Can you make a new one before schedule?"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} to which the contractors replied "Yes we can". The new hull was completed before schedule.

==Computer-Aided Catastrophes==
Computer-Aided Catastrophes, or CAC for short, such as the Sleipner Incident presented in this article, provide extremely valuable lessons for practising engineers working with numerical simulation tools such as the finite element method.  The reason for the poor finite element result that led to the Sleipner Incident have been studied in more detail in NAFEMS Benchmark Challenge Number 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsay|first1=Angus|title=NBC Number 6|url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/projects/nafems-benchmark-challenge/nbc-number-6/|website=www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk|publisher=Ramsay Maunder Associates|accessdate=25 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3387">The '''Sup 'R' Mod II''' was an [[RF modulator]] sold by M&amp;R Enterprises in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It allowed the connection of computers and other devices with composite video outputs to a television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple II History - Sup'R'Mod |url=http://www.duxburysystems.org/downloads/library/texas/apple/history/museum/peripheralcards_nonapple/suprmod.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Apple Inc.]] wanted to provide users of their [[Apple II]] computers with a way to view color output on a television, but they had trouble getting [[FCC]] approval, because the RF modulation solution they were using was too noisy.  Apple made an arrangement with a small nearby company, called M&amp;R Enterprises, to manufacture and sell the devices.  While Apple could not sell the modulator and computer as a package, retail computer dealers could sell both devices to the end user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3-The Apple II |url=https://apple2history.org/history/ah03/ |website=Apple II History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marty Spergel, who ran M&amp;R Enterprises, was told by [[Steve Jobs]] that it might sell as many as 50 units a month.  Spergel later estimated that he had sold about 400,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=Steven |title=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution |date=1984 |publisher=Dell Publishing Co. |location=New York |pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sup 'R' Mod II began selling in April 1978, for $29.95.&lt;ref name=contactMay1978&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple Contact, issue #1 |url=http://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/documentation/contact/apple_contact_v1_197805.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical features ==
[[File:Sup 'R' Mod II Kit.jpg|thumb|Modulator and antenna switch.]]

The Sup 'R' Mod II kit came with a small printed circuit board, an antenna switch, and a coaxial cable with a [[ferrite core]] and [[RCA connectors]].  Composite video was received by the circuit board through a short cable terminating in a [[molex connector]], which plugged into a header on the Apple II motherboard.  Input could also be provided through an RCA connector.  The output of the RF modulator went out through a coaxial cable to the antenna switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sup'R'Mod II Manual, page 1 |url=https://computerarchive.org/files/mirror/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/video/Sup%20'r%20Mod%20II%20-%20Manual%20-%20Page%201.jpeg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sup'R'Mod II Manual, page 2 |url=https://computerarchive.org/files/mirror/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/video/Sup%20'r%20Mod%20II%20-%20Manual%20-%20Page%202.jpeg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antenna switch allowed the user to select between television broadcasts and computer output.  The television antenna was connected to inputs on the switch, and the switch output was connected to the back of the television.  The connections used [[screw terminal|screw terminals]] with spade lugs.  Moving the switch from "TV" to "GAME PLAY" selected the computer output.

The board and antenna switch came with a bit of double-sided tape to allow the user to attach them to the inside of the computer case and the side of the television, respectively.

The modulator presented a color signal on [[UHF]] channel 33.&lt;ref name="contactMay1978" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of "Mission Survivability" whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the "survivability" of a platform through a complete mission, or the "survivability" of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of "Force Survivability" which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain "mission capable".

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name="Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1"/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of "crew survivability" is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment:

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

The '''Weibull modulus''' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless parameter]] of the [[Weibull distribution]] which is used to describe variability in measured [[strength of materials|material strength]] of brittle materials. 

For [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and other brittle materials, the maximum [[stress (physics)|stress]] that a sample can be measured to withstand before failure may vary from specimen to specimen, even under identical testing conditions. This is related to the distribution of physical flaws present in the surface or body of the brittle specimen, since brittle failure processes originate at these weak points. When flaws are consistent and evenly distributed, samples will behave more uniformly than when flaws are clustered inconsistently. This must be taken into account when describing the strength of the material, so strength is best represented as a distribution of values rather than as one specific value. The Weibull modulus is a shape parameter for the [[Weibull distribution]] model which, in this case, maps the probability of failure of a component at varying stresses.

Consider strength measurements made on many small samples of a brittle ceramic material. If the measurements show little [[Statistical dispersion|variation]] from sample to sample, the calculated Weibull modulus will be high and a single strength value would serve as a good description of the sample-to-sample performance. It may be concluded that its physical flaws, whether inherent to the material itself or resulting from the manufacturing process, are distributed uniformly throughout the material. If the measurements show high variation, the calculated Weibull modulus will be low; this reveals that flaws are clustered inconsistently and the measured strength will be generally weak and variable. Products made from components of low Weibull modulus will exhibit low reliability and their strengths will be broadly distributed.

Test procedures for determining the Weibull modulus are specified in DIN EN 843-5 and DIN 51 110-3.

A further method to determine the strength of brittle materials has been described by the Wikibook contribution [[Wikibooks:Strength of materials/Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics|Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics]].

==Definition==

If the [[probability distribution]] of the strength, ''X'', is a [[Weibull distribution]] with its [[Probability density function|density]] given by 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\lambda,k) =  \begin{cases}
\frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-((x-x_0)/\lambda)^{k}} &amp; x\geq x_0 ,\\
0 &amp; x&lt; x_0 ,\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

then ''k'' is the Weibull modulus.

The value of k shows the kind of failure being experienced. If k&lt;1, then the failure rate decreases with time. This implies that the weak and defective parts fail in the beginning, with the harder sections surviving. If k=1, the rate of failure remains constant. This implies that there is random failure occurring. Thus, there should be some external factor strong enough to cause random failure irrespective of whether the section is strong or weak. If the value of k&gt;1, the rate of failure increases over time. This points to some kind of ageing process, the weakening of the material with the passage of time.

'''William Higinbotham''' (October 25, 1910 – November 10, 1994) was an American [[physicist]]. A member of the team that developed the first [[nuclear bomb]], he later became a leader in the [[nonproliferation]] movement. He also has a place in the [[history of video games]] for his 1958 creation of ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', the first interactive analog computer game and one of the first electronic games to use a graphical display.

==Early life==
Higinbotham was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and grew up in [[Caledonia, New York]]. His father was a minister in the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]]. He earned his [[undergraduate]] degree from [[Williams College]] in 1932 and continued his studies at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title= William A.

In 1947 Higinbotham took a position at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], where he worked until his retirement in 1984.
In 1958, as Head of the Instrumentation Division at Brookhaven, he created a computer game called ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' for the laboratory's annual exposition.

==Legacy==
Largely forgotten for years, critics began to recognize ''Tennis for Two'''s significance to the history of video games in the 1980s. In 1983, [[David Ahl]], who had played the game at the Brookhaven exhibition as a teenager, wrote a cover story for ''[[Creative Computing]]'' in which he dubbed Higinbotham the "Grandfather of Video Games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaplin |first1=Heather |last2=Ruby |first2=Aaron |title=Smartbomb: The Quest for Art, Entertainment, and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution |publisher=Algonquin Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-56512-346-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSOVdxI_gysC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22It+is+imperative%22|pages=35–36|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Frank Lovece]] interviewed Higinbotham for a story on the history of video games in the June 1983 issue of ''Video Review''.&lt;ref name=videoreview /&gt;

In 2011, [[Stony Brook University]] founded the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection, managed by Head of Special Collections and University Archives Kristen Nyitray and Associate Professor of Digital Cultural Studies Raiford Guins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/index.html |title=William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection at Stony Brook University |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Collection is explicitly dedicated to "documenting the material culture of screen-based game media", and in specific relation to Higinbotham: "collecting and preserving the texts, ephemera, and artifacts that document the history and work of early game innovator and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist William A. Higinbotham, who in 1958 invented the first interactive analog computer game, Tennis for Two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/mission.html |title=Mission &amp; Goals of the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of preserving the history of ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', the Collection is producing a documentary on the history of the game and its reconstruction by Peter Takacs, physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/news.html |title=News: William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection : June 17, 2011 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higinbotham remained little interested in video games, preferring to be remembered for his work in [[nuclear nonproliferation]]. After his death, as requests for information on ''Tennis for Two'' increased, his son William B. Higinbotham told Brookhaven: "It is imperative that you include information on his [[nuclear nonproliferation]] work. That was what he wanted to be remembered for." For this work the Federation of American Scientists named their headquarters Higinbotham Hall in 1994.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaplin |first1=Heather |last2=Ruby |first2=Aaron |title=Smartbomb: The Quest for Art, Entertainment, and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution|publisher=Algonquin Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-56512-346-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSOVdxI_gysC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22It+is+imperative%22|page=36|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
