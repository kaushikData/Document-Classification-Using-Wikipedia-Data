The '''Brixton riot''' of 1985 started on 28 September in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] in [[South London]]. It was the second major riot that the area had witnessed in the space of four years, [[1981 Brixton riot|the last in 1981]]. It was sparked by the shooting of Dorothy "Cherry" Groce by the [[Metropolitan Police]], while they sought her 21-year-old son [[Michael Groce]] in relation to a suspected firearms offence; they believed Michael Groce was hiding in his mother's home.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;

After two days of riots, [[photo-journalist]] David Hodge had died, 43 civilians and 10 police officers were hurt. Amongst a number of fires, one building had been destroyed, 55 cars had been burnt out, and 58 burglaries had been committed including acts of [[looting]].&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;

In March 2014, the police eventually apologised for the wrongful shooting of Mrs Groce.&lt;ref name=BBC26698542/&gt; In July of the same year, an inquest jury concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce's death, for which the present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police [[Bernard Hogan-Howe|Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]] subsequently "apologised unreservedly for our failings" to the family.&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|1981 Brixton riot|Michael Groce}}
The community of Lambeth, after the [[1981 Brixton riot]], had lost trust in the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], with many of the mixed race but mainly [[Afro-Caribbean]] population believing the police to be [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]].&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;

Twenty-one-year-old [[Michael Groce]] was one of six children born to Dorothy "Cherry" Groce, who had migrated to the area from [[Jamaica]] when she was in her early teens. From aged six much of his life was spent in [[residential care]], brought up in Tinworth House, on a rough [[housing estate]] in [[Vauxhall]].&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; Michael was involved with [[street gang]]s, and had been exposed to guns during his childhood.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; He spent time in and out of prison throughout his life, and by 1985 had accrued 50 convictions and 15 different spells in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/redemption.shtml|title= Leaving a life of crime|accessdate=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released from prison two months before,&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; whilst out on license{{Clarify|date=January 2015}} Michael became concerned with a turf-war between local street gangs.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; Subsequently, given a gun for protection by a friend,&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; a few days before the riots Michael was in an argument with his girlfriend at his mother's house, and in a fit of showing-off fired the gun into a [[wardrobe]].&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; Shortly afterwards, he heard a knock on the door and went down to answer it, finding a police officer enquiring if he was Michael Groce. He attempted to close the door, but after the police officer would not let him, Michael put the gun into the officer's mouth.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; After the officer left, Michael cleaned the gun and placed it in the house, then fled to his sister's home.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3706789.stm|title=My mum got caught in the crossfire|author=Steve Hawkes|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2004|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raid on Cherry Groce's house==
On the morning of 28 September 1985, a group of police officers raided Cherry Groce's house on Normandy Road, Brixton, including an armed [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] officer, searching for suspected armed robber Michael Groce.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt; Mrs Groce was in bed, whilst three of her six children were in residence when the police entered the house with force. During the raid, Mrs Groce was shot in the chest; after an extensive search, the police did not find Michael Groce. An ambulance was called, and by the time it had arrived a small crowd had gathered outside the house. Mrs Groce was taken to [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in central London.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;

==Riots==
As word of the shooting spread throughout the community, rumours persisted that Mrs. Groce had in fact been killed in the raid. The group that had gathered outside her house grew to over 60,&lt;ref name=TelgCGObit/&gt; and then moved to the local district police station, where they began chanting "murderers" and anti-police slogans,&lt;ref name=ITNClip36/&gt; demanding disciplinary action against the officers involved.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;

However, hostility between the largely black crowd and the largely white police force quickly escalated into a series of mild street battles.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; These then developed into elongated skirmishes in the areas of [[Brixton Road]] and [[Acre Lane]], where the first two of a total of 55 cars over the following 48 hours were burnt out.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; In response the police deployed the first 50 officers in [[riot gear]] in the afternoon, who approached rioters by banging their [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]] on their [[riot shield]]s.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; Through force which involved a number of reported unprovoked attacks on local passers-by and accredited members of the media,&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; the police cordoned off the area around the police station on [[Brixton Road]], and then cleared the surrounding shopping district.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;

That evening, the police lost control of the area for approximately 48 hours. In the subsequent riot, severe injuries were sustained by both sides, with police injured as they were attacked by young black and white youths equipped with bricks and wooden stakes.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; After further skirmishes, the rioters built a defensive wall out of upturned cars across the Brixton Road, which were set alight at various times. From behind this wall, the rioters threw [[petrol bomb]]s at the police, and looted local shops.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;&lt;ref name=ITNClip36&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/compilation/S10021001/|title=Clip 36 of 44 – Brixton Riots|work=[[ITN News]]|date=28 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later stated that they made 149 arrests that evening, mostly for violence, 20 for burglary and theft and two for petrol bombing.&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;

In the aftermath, [[photo-journalist]] David Hodge died a few days later as a result of an [[aneurysm]], after being attacked by gang of looters he was trying to photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guard acquitted of riot death charge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19861022&amp;id=GIJDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5467,5421912|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=Glasgow Herald|date=22 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total over 50 people were injured, 200 arrests were made, one building and dozens of cars were destroyed, and several shops had been looted.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540397.stm|title=1985: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|work=[[BBC News]]|date=28 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference on 30 September, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Wells described the shooting of Mrs Groce as tragic, and whilst recognising the resultant "genuine feelings, particularly those of the relatives and friends of Mrs Groce", blamed the riots on "an unruly criminal element."&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/30/brixton-riots-1985-archive|title=From the archive: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|author=Gareth Parry, Susan Tirbutt and David Rose|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent riots: Peckham, Toxteth and Tottenham===
On 30 September in [[Peckham]], south London, gangs of black youths began throwing petrol bombs and setting shops alight. A major fire at a carpet warehouse off Peckham High Street was reported.&lt;ref name=BBC2486315&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/1/newsid_2486000/2486315.stm|title=1985: Riots erupt in Toxteth and Peckham|work=BBC News|date=1 October 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1985, 10 people (including three police officers) were injured in a second riot in [[1981 Toxteth riots#1985 riot|Toxteth on 1 October 1985]], after gangs stormed the district's streets and stoned and burnt cars in response to the arrest of four local black men in connection with a stabbing. [[Merseyside Police]] Operational Support Division was deployed into the area to restore order and were later criticised by community leaders and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, [Derek Warlock], for their "over zealous and provocative tactics", which included the drumming of batons on riot shields.&lt;ref name=BBC2486315/&gt;

One week later, another serious conflict, sparked by similar circumstances, broke out between the Metropolitan Police and mainly black residents of North London's [[Tottenham]] district in what became known as the [[Broadwater Farm riot]].

==Aftermath==

===Cherry Groce===
On her arrival at hospital, surgeons found that the bullet had penetrated Mrs Groce's lung and exited through her spine, paralysing her from the waist downwards.&lt;ref name=TelgCGObit/&gt; She was hospitalised for over a year, and in hospital-based rehabilitation for a further year; friends within the local community looked after her children. With Mrs Groce permanently paralysed and only able to get around in a [[wheelchair]], and after further rehabilitation, she and her family were allocated a new [[bungalow]] in which to live.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;&lt;ref name=TelgCGObit/&gt;

The police officer who shot Mrs Groce, Detective Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was prosecuted but eventually acquitted of malicious wounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On this day:1987: Officer cleared in Groce shooting case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/15/newsid_2530000/2530537.stm|accessdate=22 March 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs Groce later received over £500,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police, but with no admission of liability.&lt;ref name=Ch4455/&gt;

In 2011, Mrs Groce contracted an infection which led to kidney failure.&lt;ref name=TelgCGObit/&gt; She was treated at [[King's College Hospital]], but she died on [[Easter Sunday]], and was buried in May 2011.&lt;ref name=TelgCGObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8483471/Woman-whose-shooting-sparked-Brixton-riots.html|title=Woman whose shooting sparked Brixton riots |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 April 2011|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13520669|title=Funeral of Cherry Groce|work=BBC News|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inquest====
After the death of Cherry Groce, the district [[coroner]] announced that a judicial inquest was to be held into her death, scheduled for June 2014. [[Simon Israel]] reporting for [[Channel 4 News]] revealed on 21 March 2014 that separate [[pathologist]]s working on behalf of both the family and the police, both independently concluded that there was a causal link between the shooting and the death of Mrs Groce.&lt;ref name=Ch4455&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/simon-israel-home-affairs/cherry-groce-metropolitan-police-publicly-apologises-shooting-mother/455|title=Met publicly apologises for shooting mother of six|author=Israel|website=blogs.channel4.com|publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]|date=21 March 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With both the Metropolitan Police and former Inspector Douglas Lovelock both to be represented at the inquest by [[Queen's Counsel]], the [[Legal Aid Agency]] refused the Groce family funds on the grounds that "there are no new issues."&lt;ref name=Ch4455/&gt; The family subsequently started a petition, and appealed directly to Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] for Legal Aid to support them at the inquest, supported by the Labour MP for Streatham, [[Chuka Umunna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petition to support the Groce family in the inquest into the death of Cherry Groce|website=Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was subsequently overturned on 11 April 2014 by a ministerial discussion through the [[Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ministers allow legal aid funding for family of Cherry Groce at her inquest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/11/ministers-allow-legal-aid-funding-family-cherry-groce-inquest|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26992412|title=Brixton police gun victim Cherry Groce's family in legal aid win|work=BBC News|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2014, the jury at [[Southwark Crown Court|Southwark Coroner's Court]] returned a verdict that concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce's death, and that her "subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid".&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt; Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman testified that during his [[post-mortem]] examination he had found metal fragments from the bullet still lodged in the base of her spine, which had contributed to her being more susceptible to debilitating illnesses.&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt; The present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police [[Bernard Hogan-Howe|Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]] subsequently "apologised unreservedly for our failings" to the family for the years of suffering, stating that the Metropolitan Police operation had been inadequate, failed to carry out its responsibilities properly, and that it was "inexcusable" that it had taken so long for the police to acknowledge these failings.&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|work=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Groce===
{{main|Michael Groce}}
After three days of hiding, Michael learnt via the television news about the shooting of his mother and the riots.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; He quietly turned himself in to the police the following day, accompanied by solicitor [[Paul Boateng]].&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; Michael was then interviewed at [[Scotland Yard]] in relation to an armed robbery at a jeweller's shop in [[Royston, Hertfordshire]] on 10 September, and later released on [[police bail]]. On 26 September, he was charged at [[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]] police station with illegal possession of a sawn-off shotgun,&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt; for which he subsequently received a three-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; He was never charged with any offence associated with the armed robbery or the riots.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt;

Michael wrote his mother an apology in the form of a poem, subsequently published in ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt; Michael attempted to help the community recover; he ran a youth [[association football|football]] team, trying to provide a fun alternative to crime.

Today a reformed character, Michael is a published poet who runs poetry, personal development and motivational [[workshop]]s in schools under the project title "Cherry Blossoms", and gives talks to dissuade others from making mistakes similar to those that he made.&lt;ref name=BBC3706789/&gt;

===Metropolitan Police Service===
Following the trial of Inspector Lovelock, a review of fire arms procedures within the Metropolitan Police led to new policy which authorised only centrally-controlled specifically-trained specialist squads to be armed.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt; This included parts of [[Special Branch]], but excluded others including CID officers.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;

In March 2014, almost 29 years after the events and almost three years after her death, the Metropolitan Police publicly apologised to Cherry Groce's family for her wrongful shooting.&lt;ref name=BBC26698542&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26698542|title=Met publicly apologise over 1985 shooting of mother|work=BBC News|date=22 March 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
* The 1986 [[Pet Shop Boys]] song "[[Suburbia (song)|Suburbia]]", telling a story of boredom and (fictional) riots in suburbia, was partially influenced by the Brixton riots of [[1981 Brixton riot|1981]] and 1985, the latter of which was in recent memory when the single was released.
* [[Stephen Frears]]' 1987 film ''[[Sammy and Rosie Get Laid]]'' opens with an incident very similar to the Groce shooting.
* The ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' episode ''I Predict A Riot'', first aired Wednesday, 26 March 2014 at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, is about a fictional black undercover policeman who went missing during the 1985 Brixton riot.

'''''Atlantis: The Lost Continent Revealed''''' is a [[pseudohistorical]] book by [[Charles Berlitz]]. He lists several alternative theories on where the possible mythical [[Atlantis]] may have been situated, and cites different legends and stories that may support the different theories. All areas and theories are covered starting with [[Plato]], [[Crete]] (Thera), [[the Azores]] and [[Edgar Cayce]]'s involvement in the story. 

Berlitz, author of many popular books on the [[paranormal]] and unexplained phenomena, researched Atlantis and wrote a 1969 book titled ''The Mystery of Atlantis''. Berlitz not only became convinced that Atlantis was real but also that it was the source of the [[Bermuda Triangle]] mystery, a subject he explored in his 1974 best-seller ''[[The Bermuda Triangle (book)|The Bermuda Triangle]].'' Illustrated in the book he strongly believed extra-terrestrials were in some way involved in Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle. His ideas have been described as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 207-208. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlitz's wild ideas about the Bermuda Triangle — and, by extension, Atlantis — were definitively debunked the following year by researcher [[Larry Kusche]], author of 1975 ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery — Solved.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]]. (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 37. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. pp. 274-277. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1984, Berlitz wrote ''Atlantis: The Lost Continent Revealed'' to counter his shot down ideas from critics.

== Theories ==

=== Nuclear Disaster ===

According to skeptical researcher [[Guy P. Harrison]] who has criticized Berlitz's statements about Atlantis as nonsensical: "Charles Berlitz, the same writer who stirred up belief in the Bermuda Triangle, also wrote ''Atlantis: The Lost Continent Revealed''. Berlitz goes so far as to promote the belief that the people of Atlantis possessed nuclear weapons many thousands of years ago and it was a large scale nuclear war that destroyed their culture!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy P. Harrison|Harrison, Guy P]]. (2012). ''Chapter 44: Atlantis Is Down There Somewhere''. In ''50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1-61614-495-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural Causes ===
"Berlitz believed that the [[Azores]] held the key to the Atlantis puzzle and wrote ‘Volcanic activity is constantly occurring in the Azores area, where there are still active volcanoes… The islands of Corvo and [[Flores]] in the Azores, which have been mapped since 1351, have constantly changed their shape, with large parts of Corvo having disappeared into the sea.’&lt;ref&gt;''Sunken Realms: A Complete Catalog of Underwater Ruins'' By Karen Mutton&lt;/ref&gt;
*In this theory he presumed Atlantis was in the middle of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], and due to natural causes slowly sunk through the years.

=== Magical Submergence ===
In his last theory, Berlitz claimed the scenario presented by [[Plato]] was essentially correct. Although most of his evidence was thought provoking, his evidence was slim to non-existent. Here a diver had supposedly located a massive submerged pyramid near the [[Bahamas]], but would not reveal the coordinates. "An island supposedly emerged from the Atlantic Ocean in 1882, complete with bronze artefacts, but was never found again, and the log of the ship which discovered it was destroyed in the [[London blitz]] in 1940". He was presumably referring to the [[Cuicuilco]] pyramid, discovered by Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona in 1922. &lt;ref&gt;''Perilous Planet Earth: Catastrophes and Catastrophism Through the Ages''  By Trevor Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;
*On this account he claims Atlantis is located somewhere in the [[Bermuda triangle]], and would be located between 1968 and 1969, as [[Edgar Cayce]] had predicted before his death in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;''Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients'' by David Hatcher Childress&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debunking Charles Berlitz ==

=== The Truth About The Triangle ===

Researcher [[Larry Kusche]], who published ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved in 1975'', argued that Berlitz and other authors had exaggerated their claims and hadn’t done any proper research. They presented some disappearance cases as "mysteries" when they weren’t mysteries at all, and some reported cases hadn’t even happened within the Bermuda Triangle.

After extensively researching the issue, Kusche concluded that the number of disappearances that occurred within the Bermuda Triangle wasn’t actually greater than in any other similarly trafficked area of the ocean, and that other writers presented misinformation—such as not reporting storms that occurred on the same day as disappearances, and sometimes even making it seem as though the conditions had been calm for the purposes of creating a sensational story. In short: previous Bermuda Triangle authors didn’t do their research and either knowingly or unintentionally "made it up."

The book did such a thorough job of debunking the myth that it effectively ended most of the Bermuda Triangle hype. When authors like Berlitz and others were unable to refute Kusche’s findings, even the most steadfast of believers had difficulty remaining confident in the sensationalized Bermuda Triangle narrative. Nevertheless, many magazine articles, TV shows, and movies have continued to feature the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/bermuda.html "Bermuda (or "Devil's") Triangle"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool has the United Kingdom's oldest and longest established black community, going back several generations.&lt;ref&gt;David Clay, [http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G02865.pdf ""The changing face of community participation: the Liverpool black experience"], ''Participatory Learning and Action'' 58 (IIED), June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool's black community is also unusual among those in the United Kingdom, as the Liverpool-born Black British community often constitute a category distinct from later African and Afro-Caribbean migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Frist, [https://books.google.com/books?id=52gX8NaBS9cC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=liverpool-born+blacks++mixed+race&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dRuJOjlP8Y&amp;sig=zfhSUsK0CBu1jBODJBiPt2XVRgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f6fsVMfREMPtUsunhLAL&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=liverpool-born%20blacks%20%20mixed%20race&amp;f=false ''Work and Community Among West African Migrant Workers Since the Nineteenth Century''], Liverpool University Press, 1999, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dating to the 1730s, the Black community of Liverpool is Britain's oldest, with some Liverpudlians being able to trace their black heritage for as many as ten generations. The community dates back to the [[American Revolutionary War]] with [[Black Loyalists]] settling in the city. They were later followed by more [[African-American]] soldiers. The original African-American community was followed in the 19th and 20th centuries by sailors and soldiers from all over the [[West Indies]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diversemag.co.uk"&gt;Ray Costello, [http://www.diversemag.co.uk/race-detail/the-liverpool-born-black-community "The Liverpool-born black community"], Diverse Magazine, 14 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The black community experienced continued growth due to the location of Liverpool as a port city. Liverpool's port attracted many servicemen and seafarers, including [[African Americans]], [[Jamaicans]], [[Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Trinidadians]], [[Belizean people|Belizeans]], [[Afro-Guyanese|Guyanese]], [[Nigerians]], [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaians]], [[Gambian people|Gambians]], and others from all over the Caribbean and Africa.&lt;ref name=Jnb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jacqueline Nassy|title=Dropping Anchor, Setting Sail: Geographies of Race in Black Liverpool|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1400826411|pages=32 &amp; 93|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LXNrE7QkDw8C|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly settling in the [[Toxteth]] district, they joined already settled [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and to a lesser extent [[Indian people|Indians]] of seafarer or serviceman heritage. The Liverpudlian Black community became a [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|Mixed]]-race community early on, with intermarriages taking place on a large scale among people with African roots, Whites and Asians. In turn most of today's Liverpudlian Blacks, even adding more recent Afro-Caribbean and African migrants, are product of a community that became a distinct multiracial community centuries ago. This process made the Liverpudlian Black community possibly the most distinct [[Black British]] community in the United Kingdom, creating a community that is native as well as unique to the country.&lt;ref name="diversemag.co.uk"/&gt;In 2009 the black community was estimated to make up 1.9% of Liverpool's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&amp;b=276787&amp;c=liverpool&amp;d=13&amp;e=13&amp;g=359393&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1305914899812&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=1812|title=Office for National Statistics.|last=|first=|date=|website=National Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Liverpool|title=Demography of Liverpool Wikipedia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 2011 the population of Liverpool was 2.8% black according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_districts_and_their_ethnic_composition|title=List of English districts and their ethnic composition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social unrest==
The Liverpool Black community experienced unrest early on, with race riots going back to 1919 when returned soldiers descended on the predominantly black/mixed-race areas of Toxteth.&lt;ref&gt;David Clay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qC6zKGwTqG8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=liverpool++black+community&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmUTcF2W7p&amp;sig=fdUPdEg-pCfDUy3vNCGWiSuatqc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DqXsVLjkC4HBUrmLgNAD&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=liverpool%20%20black%20community&amp;f=false "The changing face of community participation: the Liverpool black experience"], in Tom Wakeford, Jasber Singh, ''Participatory Learning and Action'' 58, ''Towards Empowered Participation: Stories and Reflections'' (IIED), June 2008, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infamous were the [[1981 Toxteth riots]], which was the direct result of long-standing tensions between the local police and the black community and that saw hundreds of police and public injured, one man dead, 500 arrested, 70 buildings destroyed and damage estimated at £11m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/toxteth-riots-1981-background---3369242 "Toxteth Riots 1981 background - and how it all began"], ''Liverpool Echo'', 4 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruttedius Niger''' was a rhetor and politician of the early [[Roman Empire]]. He also wrote a historical work.

== Life ==

Bruttedius Niger was a pupil of the rhetor [[Apollodorus of Pergamon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Elder]], ''Controversiae'' 2.1.35-36&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]] he held in 22 AD the office of an [[aedile]]. In the same year he was one of the accusers of the consul of the year 10 AD, [[Caius Junius Silanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], [[Annals (Tacitus)|''Annals'']] 3.66&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have regarded the declaimer [[Junius Otho]] – who also was an accuser of Junius Silanus – as an example in the field of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Elder, ''Controversiae'' 2.1.35&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Tacitus]] recognizes the talent of Bruttedius Niger but thinks that he went astray because of his ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 3.66&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Juvenal]] Bruttedius Niger first was a friend of [[Sejanus]], but after the downfall and death of the powerful commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]] (31 AD) he kicked Sejanus’s body.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal 10.83-88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Elder]] has preserved two passages of Bruttedius Niger’s historical work which deal with the assassination of [[Cicero]] (43 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Elder, ''Suasoriae'' 6.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; About the death of this famous orator Seneca also provides excerpts of other contemporary historians, for example of [[Livy]], [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]], [[Aufidius Bassus]], [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]] and the poem by [[Cornelius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Elder, ''Suasoriae'' 6.17-27&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cardigan''' is a type of knitted [[garment]] that has an open front.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.al/story.asp?S=1771013&amp;nav=1aI8M8qf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cardigan|title=cardigan |website=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Commonly cardigans have buttons: a garment that is tied is instead considered a robe. A more modern version of the garment has no buttons and hangs open by design.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} By contrast, a [[Sweater|pullover]] (or sweater) does not open in front but must be "pulled over" the head to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-[[knitting|knitted]]. Traditionally, cardigans were made of [[wool]] but can now be made of [[cotton]], [[synthetic fiber]]s, or any combination thereof.

==History==
The cardigan was named after [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan]], a [[British Army]] [[Major General]] who led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/10/3/16380180/cardigans-history|title=This Bookish Sweater Has a Violent History|last=le Zotte|first=Jennifer|date=October 3, 2017|work=Racked|access-date=2017-10-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is modelled after the knitted wool [[waistcoat]] that British officers supposedly wore during the war. The legend of the event and the fame that Lord Cardigan achieved after the war led to the rise of the garment's popularity – supposedly, Brudenell invented the cardigan after noticing that the tails of his coat had accidentally been burnt off in a fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cardigansweater.com |title= What is a Cardigan? - Cardigan Sweater History| website= CardiganSweater.com| access-date= 10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= David| first= Saul |year= 1997| title= The Homicidal Earl: The Life of Lord Cardigan| location= London| publisher= Little, Brown| pages= 431–436| isbn= 0316641650}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Cardigan" is an anglicised variation of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] placename [[Ceredigion]].{{citation needed|date= April 2018}}

The term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless [[vest]], but expanded to other types of garment over time. [[Coco Chanel]] is credited with popularizing cardigans for women because "she hated how tight-necked men's sweaters messed up her hair when she pulled them over her head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geller|first1=Allison|title=The Military Origins of the Cardigan|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/the-military-origins-of-the-cardigan/488252/|accessdate=24 June 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The garment is mostly associated with the college culture of the Roaring Twenties and early 1930s, being also popular throughout the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1990s. Cardigans have also regained popularity during the [[2010s]].

==Usage==
Plain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside [[Suit (clothing)|suit jackets]] as a less formal version of the [[waistcoat]] or vest that restrains the [[necktie]] when the jacket has been removed. Its versatility means it can be worn in casual or formal settings and in any season, but it is most popular during cool weather.

Monochromatic cardigans, in sleeved or vest form, may be viewed as a conservative fashion staple. As an item of formal clothing for any gender, it is worn over a button-down [[dress shirt]]. A less formal style is wearing a [[T-shirt]] underneath.

==In popular culture==

'''David Williams''' (1738 – 29 June 1816), was a Welsh philosopher of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period. He was an ordained minister, theologian and political [[polemic]]ist, and was the founder in 1788 of the [[Royal Literary Fund]].

==Upbringing==
Williams was born in a house called Waunwaelod in [[Eglwysilan]] near [[Caerphilly]]. His early education was partly under John Smith, vicar of Eglwysilan, and he went on to a local school run by his namesake, [[David Williams (1709–1784)|David Williams]]. His father, William David, was converted to [[Methodism]] by [[Howell Harris]]; it was at his request that David Williams entered the ministry. Rev. David, an unfortunate speculator in mines and miners' tools, died in 1752; the family consisted of one surviving son and two daughters.

His father on his deathbed made David promise to enter [[Carmarthen Academy]] to qualify as a dissenting minister. He studied there, with an exhibition from the London presbyterian board (1753 to Christmas 1757), under Evan Davies, a pupil of [[John Eames]]. The academy, hitherto Calvinist, had begun to acquire a heterodox repute. From February 1755 the London congregational board sent no students, owing to the alleged [[Arianism]] of Davies's assistant, Samuel Thomas. Davies himself resigned his chair in 1759 under suspicion of [[Arminianism]]. Williams' views were unconventional, largely thanks to his four years study at Carmarthen Academy, and he was regarded as a [[Deism|Deist]].

==Ordination==
Williams was ordained in 1758 to the charge of the dissenting congregation at [[Frome]], Somerset, on a stipend of £45. This was the congregation from which [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]], the deist, had been dismissed in 1720. Williams's theological views did not prove satisfactory. In 1761 he moved to the Mint meeting, [[Exeter]], founded by [[James Peirce]]. Here he was reordained. He prepared ''A Liturgy on the Principles of the Christian Religion'', which is said to have been adopted by his congregation. He soon quarrelled with 'elder members' who objected to his opinions. He retorted by finding fault with their morals. By way of an 'accommodation' he left Exeter about 1769 to take charge of a waning congregation in Southwood Lane, [[Highgate]]. To this congregation the father of [[John Wilkes]] used to drive in a coach-and-six. In this charge he appears to have remained till 1773. His withdrawal was ascribed by himself to 'the intrigues of a lady', and to no rejection of revelation, 'which he had taken for granted'. His successor, in 1774, was [[Joseph Towers]]. His first publication, ''The Philosopher, in Three Conversations'', 1771, (dedicated to [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]] and [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]]), containing a project of church reform, drew the attention of [[John Jebb (1736–1786)|John Jebb]]. With the co-operation of John Lee, a proposal was set on foot for opening a chapel in London with an expurgated prayer-book. Williams was to draw attention to the plan through the public papers. His communications to the ''Public Advertiser'' republished as ''Essays on Public Worship, Patriotism, and Projects of Reformation'', 1773, were so deistic in tone as to put an end to the scheme.

==Letter to David Garrick==
A taste for the drama led to his acquaintance with [[David Garrick]] whom he met at the house of a hostess of 'the wits of the time.' With this lady he visited [[Henry Mossop]], the actor, who attributed his misfortunes to Garrick's neglect. Williams wrote to the papers embodying Mossop's view, but the communication was not printed. Three 
months later he published his keen but truculent ''Letter to David Garrick'', 1772. According to a note by [[John Philip Kemble]] in the British Museum copy there was a second edition; Williams, in an advertisement at the end of his ''Lectures'', 1779, vol. i., claims the authorship of the ''Letter'', and affirms that there was 'a surreptitious edition'. Morris, who reprints the ''Letter'' with a wrong date (1770), says it was withdrawn from sale. In the ''Private Correspondence of David Garrick'', 1831, is a letter (2 October 1772), signed ''D. Ws'' hinting that the published 'Letter' was by 'a young man who is making himself known us a first-rate genius.... His name is Williams. He is intimate at Captain Pye's. [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] knows him, and I have seen him go into [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s'. [[James Boaden]], the editor of the 'Correspondence' calls the writer (evidently Williams himself) an 'arrogant boy '. On Mossop's death (18 November 1773) Williams wrote to Garrick, and received a touching reply.

==School and churches==
In 1773 Williams took a house in Lawrence Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], married a wife without a fortune, and set up a school. As the fruit of his ministry he published a volume of ''Sermons, chiefly upon Religious Hypocrisy'' (1774). His educational ideas, founded on those of [[John Amos Comenius]], he embodied in his ''Treatise on Education''(1774). Book-learning he subordinated to scientific training based on a first-hand knowledge of facts. He made a novel application of the [[Helots#Treatment by Spartans|drunken helot plan]], obtaining from a [[workhouse]] a 'lying boy' as an [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/object_lesson object lesson]. His school 'prospered beyond his expectations', but the death of his wife (in 1775?) for a time unmanned him. He tore himself away, 'leaving his scholars to shift for themselves', and 'secluded himself in a distant country' for 'many months'. He went to [[Buxton]], according to some accounts; he never returned to Chelsea.

In 1774 [[Benjamin Franklin]] 'took refuge from a political storm' in Williams's house, and became interested in his method of teaching arithmetic. Franklin joined a small club formed at Chelsea by Williams, the manufacturer [[Thomas Bentley (manufacturer)|Thomas Bentley]] (partner of [[Josiah Wedgwood]]), and [[James Stuart (1713–1788)|James "Athenian" Stuart]]. At this club Williams broached the scheme of a society for relieving distressed authors, which Franklin did not encourage him to pursue. It was noted at the club that most of the members, though 'good men', yet 'never went to church'. Franklin regretted the want of 'a rational form of devotion'. To supply this, Williams, with aid from Franklin, drew up a form. It was printed six times before it satisfied its projectors, and was eventually published as ''A Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality'', 1776. It does not contain his reduction of the creed to one article, 'I believe in God. Amen'.

On 7 April 1776, Williams opened for morning service a vacant chapel near [[Cavendish Square]] (the building was replaced in 1858 by [[All Saints, Margaret Street]]), using his liturgy, and reading lectures, with texts usually from the Bible, sometimes from classic authors. He got 'about a score of auditors', who seem to have been persons of distinction. The opening lecture was published. Copies of the liturgy were sent to [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] and to [[Voltaire]], who returned appreciative letters in bad French and good English respectively. International botanical travellers Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]] 'now and then peeped into the chapel, and got away as fast as they decently could'. Williams's ''Letter to the Body of Protestant Dissenters'', 1777, is a plea for such breadth of toleration as would legally cover such services as his. All the expenses fell on Williams, who was saved from ruin only by the subscription to his ''Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality'' 1779. These lectures (critical rather than constructive, and not eloquent, though well written) were read at the chapel in 1776–1777. The experiment is said to have lasted four years, but it is probable that after the second year the services were not held in Margaret Street; they were transferred, on the advice of [[Robert Melvill]]e, to a room in the [[British Coffee House]], [[Cockspur Street]], Melville giving a dinner in [[Brewer Street]] after service, 'with excellent [[madeira wine|Madeira]]'. The statement by [[Thomas Somerville]] that Melville took him, in the period 1779–1785, to the service in 'Portland' Square &lt;!-- nearby [[Portman Square]] perhaps? --&gt; is no doubt due to a slip of memory. Somerville's further statement that the 'dispersion of his flock' was due to Williams's 'immorality' becoming 'notorious' seems a groundless slander. No hint of it is conveyed in the satiric lampoon ''Orpheus, Priest of Nature'' 1781, which affirms, on the contrary, that Williams's principles were too strict for his hearers. The appellation 'Priest of Nature' is said to have been first given him by Franklin; 'Orpheus' ascribes it to 'a Socratic woollen-draper of [[Covent Garden]]'. Gregoire &lt;!-- possibly [[Henri Grégoire]], radical French priest of the era --&gt; affirms that he had it from Williams that a number of his followers passed from [[deism]] to [[atheism]].

Williams now supported himself by taking private pupils. After the speech of Sir [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|George Savile]] on 17 March 1779 in favour of an amendment of the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]], Williams published a letter on ''The Nature and Extent of [[freedom of thought|Intellectual Liberty]]'', 1779, claiming that [[religious toleration]] should be without restriction. It was answered by [[Manasseh Dawes]]. In the same year, and with the same object, he translated and published Voltaire's ''Treatise on Toleration'', ''Ignorant Philosopher'' and ''Commentary on Beccaria''. In 1780 he issued ''A Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles''; and on the formation of county associations for parliamentary reform he published his ''Letters on Political Liberty'' (1782). This was translated into French the following year by [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], then in London conducting the [[Lyceum]]. [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière]], a friend of Brissot, visited London in 1784, when Williams made his acquaintance.

Williams's publications at this period include ''Letters concerning Education'' 1785; ''Royal Recollections on a Tour to Cheltenham'' (anon.), 1788; ''Lectures on Political Principles'' 1789; ''Lectures on Education'', 1789; ''Lessons to a Young Prince'' (anon.), 1790.

==Literary fund==
{{Main article|Royal Literary Fund}}
The idea of a "literary fund" to aid "distressed talents" was again suggested by Williams in a club of six persons, formed on the discontinuance of his Sunday lectures (1780), and meeting at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house, [[Conduit Street]]. Among its original members, besides Williams, were Captain Thomas Morris, John Gardner (vicar of [[Battersea]]), and perhaps the printer [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]]. Fruitless applications were made after 1783 to [[William Pitt the Younger]] (who thought the matter very important), [[Charles James Fox]], [[Edmund Burke]], and Sir [[Joseph Banks]]. An advertisement was published (October 1786), 'with no material effect'. The death in a [[debtors' prison]] (1 April 1787) of [[Floyer Sydenham]] led Williams to press the matter. The club, not being unanimous, was dissolved, and another (of eight members) formed. At its first meeting (spring of 1788) the constitution of the Literary Fund, drawn up by Williams, was adopted, each member subscribing a guinea. An advertisement (10 May 1788) invited further subscriptions. The first general meeting to elect officers was held on Tuesday 18 May 1790 at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house. In the course of twelve years £1,738 was distributed among 105 persons. The society was incorporated 19 May 1818; in 1842 it became the [[Royal Literary Fund]]. By the close of the century it possessed an income exceeding £4,000, half from investments, and half from annual contributions.

==Later life==
At the instance of Dr. Hooper of Pant-y-Goetre and Morgan of Tredegar, Williams undertook to write a history of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], and in 1792 visited the county to collect materials. Shortly afterwards [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière|Roland]], during his second term of office as minister of the interior, invited Williams to Paris. He went over about August 1792, was made a French citizen, and remained till the execution (21 January 1793) of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], a measure which he strongly deprecated. While in Paris he published ''Observations sur la derniere Constitution de la France'', 1793. He brought with him, on his return, a letter to [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville]], from [[Pierre Henri Hélène Marie Lebrun-Tondu|Lebrun]], minister of war, who wished to make Williams a medium of communication between the two governments; but no notice was taken of it. An engagement previously entered into for completing the continuation of [[David Hume|Hume]]'s ''History of England'' was cancelled, owing to the political odium incurred by his visit to France. His ''History of Monmouthshire'', 1796, with illustrations drawn and partly engraved by his friend Gardner, and a very modest introduction, was considered a standard work on the subject; unfortunately it has no index.

After the [[Treaty of Amiens|peace of Amiens]] (1802) he again visited France. It was surmised that he had been entrusted with some confidential mission by the English government. Before leaving he had published ''Claims of Literature'', 1802, an authorised account of the Literary Fund. On his return he issued one or two anonymous political tracts, showing, it is said, a diminished confidence in revolutionary methods. His authorship of some anonymous publications is doubtful. On internal evidence he is credited with ''Egeria'', 1803, intended as a first volume of a periodical devoted to political economy. His pecuniary resources failed him.

He had suffered from paralytic attacks, and had a severe stroke in 1811, from which time his faculties declined. He was invited to take up his abode in the house of the Literary Fund, 36 Gerrard Street, [[Soho]], and there he remained till his death, regularly attending the society's meetings. At a special meeting of the general committee, held without Williams's knowledge on 25 July 1815, it was resolved to offer him £50 every six months, as evidence of the committee's 'attachment to the first principles of their society'. Only one instalment was paid before his death on 29 June 1816. A second instalment was handed to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins. On 6 July he was buried in [[St Anne's Church, Soho]], where there is a brief inscription to his memory.

His will, dated 16 July 1814, left his papers to his executors, [[Richard Yates (antiquary)|Richard Yates]] and Thomas Wittingham; his other property went to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins (died 5 February 1845), who moved from Gerrard Street to Lower Sloane Street, and afterwards to King's Road, Chelsea.

==Early life and education==
A [[high school]] drop-out who was able to go to university without finishing High School, Bernard got a job as a service worker at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. She began taking classes from 1971 to 1973. In 1976, she graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton]].

She obtained a [[master's degree]] in history from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1979, and a [[doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]] in 1988.

==Career==
While working on her doctorate, Bernard worked as a labor historian for the [[Telecommunications Workers Union]] in 1980. She left this position in 1982. From 1984 to 1986, Bernard was a labor historian for the Brewery, Winery and Distillery Workers Union (now part of the British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union).

During her studies at Simon Fraser, Bernard became director of the Labour Program in the university's Continuing Studies division. She continued in this role from 1983 to 1989.

In the fall of 1989, Bernard became executive director of the Harvard Trade Union Program (now part of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School).

==Research interests==
Bernard's research interests are widespread and varied. Her writings often focus on women and the traditionally female jobs, to which she brings a feminist and highly [[Social class|class]]-conscious theoretical perspective.  She continues to focus on workers in the telecommunications industry, and the role technological change plays in altering work.  In the last several years, she has publicly discussed how advancing technology will change how labor unions function (especially in regard to member-to-member and union-member communication and organizing).

Bernard's primary reputation, however, is as public speaker. She is provocative and blunt, and has been known to pleasantly shock audiences with her off-color language.&lt;ref&gt;See various transcriptions of her public speeches, including [http://www.iir.ucla.edu/research/march_conf/pdf/bernard.pdf http://www.iir.ucla.edu/research/march_conf/pdf/bernard.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard often takes the American labor movement to task for not being aggressive enough in pushing its agenda, too willing to couch its opinions and conclusions in objective language, and for not engaging in strategic thinking.  As Bernard herself has stated, her prescription is for the American labor movement "to be bold, to be explicit, be as loyal to labor as the
business school is to business. Be audacious!"&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Bernard, "The Labor Movement and Social Change," speech given before "The New Economy and Union Responses," Institute for Labor and Employment, University of California, Los Angeles. March 9, 2001. [http://www.iir.ucla.edu/research/march_conf/pdf/bernard.pdf http://www.iir.ucla.edu/research/march_conf/pdf/bernard.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Such statements, as well as her skills as an orator, have made her much sought-after as a panelist and public speaker.

==Memberships and awards==
Bernard is a member of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women (CRIAW), the [[Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology]] (SCWIST), the [[Labor and Employment Relations Association]], and the [[United Association for Labor Education]].

From 1993 to 1995, she was a trustee of the [[National Labor College|George Meany Center for Labor Studies]].

She is a member of the editorial boards of ''[[WorkingUSA]]'' and ''[[New Labor Forum]]'' and is a sponsor of ''[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]''.

She is a member of the [[National Writers Union]], Local 1981, [[United Auto Workers]], [[AFL-CIO]].

A '''family register''' (also known in several variations, such as '''household register''' and '''family album''', and, when discussing non-[[anglophone]] countries, the native-language names of the registers such as ''[[koseki]]'' in [[Japan]] ,''[[Familienbuch]]'' in [[Germany]],and ''[[hukou]]'' in [[China]]) is a [[civil registry]] used in many countries to track information of a [[genealogy|genealogical]] or family-centric legal interest.

Often, official recognition of certain events or status may only be granted when such event or status is registered in the family registry&amp;mdash;for example, in Japan, a marriage is legally effective when and only when such filing is recorded into the household register (known as a ''koseki'').  In other cases, the family register serves as a centralized repository for family legal events, such as births, deaths, marriages, and expatriations, as with the ''[[familienbuch]]'' in use in Germany and the ''{{ill|livret de famille|fr}}'' in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robiac|first=Emma|title=In a Mother's Words|publisher=EP|location=Paris|page=17|url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/154-in-a-mothers-words|editor=Jacquline Taylor|format=Print|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not the sole source of official recognition for such events.

Use of government-sanctioned or administered family registers, while common in many European nations and in countries which use continental-style [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (where the family or household is legally viewed as the fundamental unit of a nation), is nonetheless rare in English-speaking countries (for example, the closest equivalent in the United Kingdom is the [[electoral roll]], which is also organised by household, but it is limited in the amount of information recorded).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Although the United States for example assigns most citizens and residents a [[social security number]] intended to be unique to the recipient and information regarding birth, death and work history (in the form of contributions to the social security system) is collected, the U.S. social security system has long been intentionally restricted in the scope of information collected and maintained regarding individuals where not directly related to social security benefits&amp;mdash;as such, no information is centrally collected regarding marriage, citizenship status, parentage, or the like, in contrast to the German and Japanese family register systems.

Establishment of a more comprehensive personal information repository (along the lines of the Japanese or former German systems) has been criticized by [[civil liberties]] advocates as subject to governmental or criminal abuse, while proponents cite the benefits of simplified access to vital information.

In South Korea, use of the ''[[hojeok]]'' (similar to the Japanese household registry, written using identical [[Chinese characters]]) was repealed in 2005, in favor of a personal registry system.

The systems of household registers in China, Korea and Japan date back to the [[Tang Dynasty]] or [[Heian Period]] or earlier, both since the seventh century.

==List of household register systems==

===East Asia===
* The ''[[Hoju]]'' scheme is a family register system in [[North Korea]]. ''Hoju'' ({{Korean|호주|戶主}}) means the 'head of the family', ''Hojuje'' ({{Korean|호주제|戶主制}}) is the 'head of the family' system, and ''[[Hojeok]]'' (alternate romanization: Hojok; 호적, 戶籍) is the 'family register'.
* The former ''[[Hoju]]'' system in South Korea attracted controversy for being innately patriarchal and hence representing a 'violation of the right to gender equality'. It was abolished on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kwdi.re.kr/kw_board/skin/news/view.jsp?bp_board=news&amp;bp_bbsNo=153 Welcome to KWDI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Koseki]]'' system in [[Japan]].
* The ''[[Hukou system]]'' also known as ''Huji'' system, in China and in Taiwan.

===South East Asia===

====Vietnam====
The ''hộ khẩu'' is nominally a household and residence registration system—''hộ'' is the Sino-Vietnamese word for "household," and ''khẩu'', literally "mouth" in Sino-Vietnamese, means "household member." The local authority issues to each household a "household registration book" or ''sổ hộ khẩu'', in which the basic biographical information of each household member is recorded. The ''sổ hộ khẩu'' is the ultimate legal proof of residence in Vietnam. Together with the "citizen identification card" or ''giấy chứng minh nhân dân/căn cước công dân'', the ''sổ hộ khẩu'' constitutes the most important legal identification document in Vietnam.

Modeled after the Chinese ''hukou'' system and originally used in urban areas only, ''hộ khẩu'' functioned as a way to manage urban growth and limit how many people moved, as well as who moved, in and out of the city.&lt;ref name="vtJSoutheast"&gt;Hardy, Andrew. "Rules and Resources: Negotiating the Household Registration System in Vietnam under Reform." Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia 16, no. 2 (October 2001): 187-212.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the system became a universal method of control as its application expanded to the countryside. It helped the government keep track of not just movement but also births and deaths. And at certain point during the latter half of the twentieth century, a tight local surveillance system existed to ensure that people were sleeping at the address they had registered as their own. The joke was that the unintended effect of the whole system was the prevention of extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name=vtRowman&gt;Hardy, Andrew. "State Visions, Migrant Decisions: Population Movements since the End of the Vietnam War." In Postwar Vietnam: Dynamics of a Transforming Society, edited by Hy V Luong. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after substantial reforms in the 1990s, the ''hộ khẩu'' system is complicated and cumbersome. It defines four types of residence, KT1 through KT4. KT1 is the primary and permanent type of residence, and denotes a person's primary residential address. If this person moves on a semi-permanent basis to another place within the same province or national municipality (within Saigon, for example), then he or she needs to register for a KT2 residential status at that new address. If this same move happens across provincial borders, then the person has to sign up for a KT3 registration. For migrant workers and students temporarily residing outside of their province or national municipality of permanent residence, they need to apply for a KT4 registration.&lt;ref name="vtJSoutheast"/&gt;  Navigating this matrix of regulations is tough. But the public security apparatus that manages the ''hộ khẩu'' system is also difficult to deal with, especially if one is a poor migrant worker with little to no formal education. Yet ''hộ khẩu'' remains absolutely crucial, especially for the poor. It is tied to access to welfare benefits, and, in the case of children, the right to attend public school.&lt;ref&gt;Abrami, Regina and Nolwen Henaff. "The City and the Countryside: Economy, State and Socialist Legacies in the Vietnamese Labour Market." In Reach for the Dream: Challenges of Sustainable Development in Vietnam, edited by Melanie Beresford and Tran Ngoc Angie, 95-134. Copenhagen: Nordic Institute of Asian Studies Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For a migrant family in Saigon with no KT3 or KT4 registration, subsidised medical care, poverty assistance, and almost-free schooling are all out of reach.&lt;ref name=vtRowman/&gt;

The government of Vietnam has decided to stop controlling citizens with permanent residence book and using an online database whereby each citizen will be registered with a personal identification code. The resolution issued earlier this week says that Vietnam will stop managing its citizen registration through the residency book, which attaches a person to a permanent address [https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-has-decided-to-stop-controlling-citizens-with-permanent-residence-book-3665631.html].

====Thailand====
* The Tabien Baan (ทะเบียนบ้าน), or document proving House Registration, is distributed by a village, city, or other municipal authority. The Tabien Baan (sometimes spelled Tambien Baan) reflects the residents who live at a specific property (this document is not used as proof of Real Estate ownership, for that one must have a Thai Chanote or Title Deed). The Tabien Baan (House Registration) is issued to Thai Citizens and is used as a permanent address for service of process and other official mailings.
* A Tabien Baan is an extremely important document for Thai nationals because it acts as proof of a Thai person's residence. Therefore, it is used to determine a Thai person's voting district and in the case of Thai men of military age, the Tabien Baan is used to ascertain what district the Thai man will be placed in when drawing for the military draft. This can be critical because if one district reaches a certain level of volunteers then it is not necessary to further draft any inhabitants of that district. As a result, a Thai man's House Registration (Tabien Baan) can have a massive impact upon their life and career depending upon the district in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand House Registration: What is a Tabien Baan?|url=http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/thailand-real-estate/thailand-house-registration-what-is-a-tabien-baan/|website=integrity-legal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Indonesia====
''Kartu Keluarga'' (literally, Family Card) is a document in Indonesia that proves residency and which records relationships and family members. Every family in Indonesia is required to own one of these documents. This document records the identity of the family's head and the individual members. The document is kept by the family's head, 'ketua RT' (head of neighborhood association) and 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office. The document is a provincial government document, thus, it is not permitted to strike out, change, replace or make additions in the document. Every data change has to be reported to the village or 'kelurahan' office which will replace the old one with the updated one. Newcomers are not recorded in the document until they have been reported or have been deemed not to have a local residency status.

Changes in data have to be reported within 14 (fourteen) working days by the family's head to 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office. Each report of changes must be submitted with the copy that is held by the family's head and 'ketua RT'. Changes in data include: birth, death or migration (of a member).

However, if a family moves to different 'desa' or 'kelurahan', the document must be revoked by 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office, which must be submitted with the copy that held by family's head and 'ketua RT'. The official in the prior location will produce ''Surat Keterangan Pindah'' (Note of Migration) which will be used to make the new ''Kartu Keluarga'' in the arrival by 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office.

===Continental Europe===
* The former ''[[familienbuch]]'' system in Germany.
* The ''{{ill|livret de famille|fr}}''  system in France.
* The ''{{ill|libro de familia|es}}'' system in Spain.
* The former ''[[Propiska in the Soviet Union|Propiska]]'' system in Russia.

== Criticism ==
The treatment of reserved films by the Murnau Foundation has been met with criticism. Critics accuse the foundation of misusing copyrights for film censorship and not for the intended purpose of copyright law where, they argue, the government should institute a ban through legislation instead. Unlike the [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft|FSK]], there are no legal evaluations for the decisions of the Board of Trustees. Critics also point out the opaque process of deciding which films should be reserved noting that there is no transparent criteria, the experts consulted are not publicized, and any reports used are not publicized. For instance, the film ''[[Der alte und der junge König|The Old and the Young King]]'' contains Nazi propaganda, however, was allowed to be screened publicly. Additionally, the nature of the reserved film screenings has been criticized, since the ''only'' option is to view them with accompanying expert supervision, commentary, and discussion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Gustave Lefebvre''' (17 July 1879 – 1 November 1957) was a [[France|French]] [[Egyptologist]].  As Inspector for Middle Egypt for the Egyptian Antiquities Service headed by [[Gaston Maspero]], he (mis)managed the [[partage]] of [[Ludwig Borchardt]]’s excavations at el-[[Amarna]], Egypt, on January 20, 1913.  Borchardt and Lefebvre had come to an agreement where the artifacts found the year before by Borchardt's team would be split between the German Oriental Company (which financed the excavation) and the country of Egypt "à moitié exacte," or 50-50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,607417,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bust of Nefertiti]], discovered in the sands of the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, and was a piece that Borchardt wanted for Germany.  Recent evidence proves that Borchardt manipulated his way into keeping the bust.  Borchardt first showed the Egyptian official a photograph of the bust "that didn't show Nefertiti in her best light".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egy.com/zamalek/nefertiti.php]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the accompanying documents, the object was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess.  When Gustave Lefebvre came for inspection, the bust was tightly wrapped up in the bottom of a box. The document reveals that Borchardt claimed the bust was made of gypsum (a very low-grade material) to mislead the inspector. Borchardt was one of the leading Egyptologists in the world, and knew that the bust was actually made out of limestone.   The bust was one of the artifacts at the top of the exchange list but was never asked for by the Egyptians in 1913.  The bust of Nefertiti was granted to Germany according to the provisions of Law No. 14 of 1912, and is today a primary exhibition of the [[Neues Museum]] in [[Berlin]]. Time Magazine lists the bust of Nefertiti as one of the Top Ten Plundered Artifacts &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/articl /0,28804,1883142_1883129_1883119,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Dr. '''Hikmet Tanyu''' (1918 – 1992), from [[Turkey]], was a scientist and college professor of philosophy and history of religions who specialized in Jewish religious history.  He studied in  [[Israel]] in the 1970s and wrote a book titled ''Jews and Turks throughout History'' which examines Jewish history and relations between Jewish and Turkish societies through history. This book is considered as the first serious approach to the [[Jewish history]] in [[Turkey]].

Tanyu was also a devoted nationalist in the Republic of Turkey in the 1940s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">A '''historical dictionary''' or dictionary on historical principles is a type of [[dictionary]] which deals not only with the present-day meanings of words but also the historical development of their forms and meanings. It may also describe the vocabulary of an earlier stage of a language's development without covering present-day usage at all. A historical dictionary is primarily of interest to scholars of language, but may also be used as a general dictionary or by those who are casually interested in understanding a word's development over time.

== Features ==
[[File:NED Entry Encyclopedia.jpg|thumb|944x944px|Example of an entry from a historical dictionary ('encyclopedia' from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]''), showing use of cited quotations and chronological ordering of senses.|alt=]]
Typical features of a historical dictionary are:

* Senses of words listed in the order they were first used, allowing the development of meaning over time to be seen&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|last=Hanks|first=Patrick|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199585847|editor-last=Allan|editor-first=Keith|location=Oxford|pages=503–36|chapter=Lexicography from the Earliest Times to the Present|chapter-url=http://www.patrickhanks.com/uploads/5/1/4/9/5149363/2012d-lexicography_from_earliest_times.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comprehensive [[Etymology|etymological]] information, often directly referencing academic research on word history
* Use of illustrative quotations, complete with citations of their sources, providing references and proof of a word's actual existence and use in a given time period
* Dates of first use (and, for obsolete usages, last use) with each word and each sense of each word (if there are quotations in the dictionary, the first quotation is usually the very first example which is known)
However, not all dictionaries which are called 'historical' have all of these features. For example, the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' includes only minimal quotations, with most entries having only an approximate date of first use, and the ''[[Webster's New International Dictionary]]'' (which, though it does not market itself as historical, is founded on historical principles&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) features only dates of first use and does not order its senses chronologically.

== History ==
For some languages, like [[Sanskrit]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], the historical dictionary (in the sense of a word-list explaining the meanings of words that were obsolete at the time of their compilation) was the first form of dictionary developed; though not being scholarly historical dictionaries in the modern sense, they did give a sense of semantic change over time. [[Early modern period|Early modern]] European dictionaries also often included a significant historical element, without being fully historical in form;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Lexicography|last=Considine|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199691630|editor-last=Durkin|editor-first=Philip|location=Oxford|pages=163–175|chapter=Historical Dictionaries: History and Development; Current Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[Samuel Johnson|Samuel Johnson's]] [[A Dictionary of the English Language|''Dictionary of the English Language'']] (1755) included quotations from admired writers as well as some words that were obsolete or obsolescent by the mid 18th century.

Modern historical principles emerged fully with the publication of [[John Jamieson|John Jamieson's]] ''Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language'' (1808). Like modern historical dictionaries, Jamieson attempted to find the earliest use of each word, and printed quotations in chronological order demonstrating the changes which had occurred to that word throughout history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1812 the German classicist [[Franz Passow]] laid out his plan for a comprehensive dictionary of the Greek language which would 'set out […] the life story of each single word in a conveniently ordered overviews', which was completed as the ''Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache'' in 1824. This idea was transmitted to the English-speaking world through the work of Liddell and Scott on their ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (1843), based on a translation of Passow's work into English. However, it was not until the beginning of the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' project of the [[Brothers Grimm]] in 1838 that a historical dictionary of a modern language was attempted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Throughout the later nineteenth century numerous historical dictionary projects were started for the various languages of Europe. The main historical dictionary of English, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was initiated in 1857 and was completed in 1928.

Recently the availability of historical text corpora and other large text databases such as digital newspaper archives have begun to influence historical dictionaries. The ''[[Trésor de la langue française]]'' was the first historical dictionary to be based mainly on a computerized corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.520.6787|title=1 Making Historical Dictionaries by Computer|last=Pajzs|first=Júlia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recent historical dictionaries and historical dictionary revision projects have been based on a mixture of quotations taken down be hand and texts from corpora.

== Compilation ==
Because of their size and scope, the compilation of historical dictionaries takes significantly longer than the compilation of general dictionaries. This is often exacerbated by the scholarly nature and limited audience for the works, meaning that the budget is often limited; historical dictionary projects often survive on a grant-to-grant basis, seeking new funding for each new section of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Richard W.|date=Autumn 1969|title=Research Dictionaries|jstor=454580|journal=American Speech|volume=44|issue=3|pages=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historical dictionaries, such as Jonathan Lighter's ''[[Historical Dictionary of American Slang]]'', have proven to be so expensive for their publishers that they have ended production before the dictionary was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Historical Dictionary of American Slang: Project History|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oup.com/us/collections/slang/history/?view=usa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017212817/http://www.oup.com/us/collections/slang/history/?view=usa|archive-date=2012-10-17|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally historical dictionaries were produced by employing a large number of readers to read and excerpt from historical texts into individual pieces of paper, which were then collated into alphabetical order and referred to during the compilation of the relevant entry. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'', for example, established a reading programme at its foundation which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://public.oed.com/history-of-the-oed/reading-programme/|title=Reading Programme {{!}} Oxford English Dictionary|work=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of computerized [[full-text search]] databases and techniques means that lexicographers can now make use of [[Text corpus|corpora]] of documents to gain a more balanced view of the history of a particular word or phrase, as well as finding new quotation material to fill gaps in the history of some words; some lexicographers have noted, however, that electronic search is not a complete replacement for manual quotation-gathering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222021902/http://partridgeslangonline.com/about.aspx#link2|title=The history behind Partridge Slang Online|date=2015-02-22|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other things because though it can help finding examples of a word already known to exist, full-text search is less good at identifying which words need to be researched in the first place.

== Examples ==

=== Croatian ===
* ''Rječnik hrvatskoga književnoga jezika od preporoda do Ivana Gorana Kovačića''

=== Dutch ===
The [[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal|''Woerdenboek der Nederlandsche Taal'']] is the largest dictionary of the Dutch language, founded on historical principles and published from 1864 to 1998, with a supplement following in 2001.

=== English and Scots ===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is the largest and best-known historical dictionary of the English language, with an aim to cover all words which saw some significant use at any time between the early [[Middle English]] period and the present day.

The earlier history of English is covered in more detail by the ''[[Middle English Dictionary]]'' (1954–2001) and the ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]'' (1986–present). Despite efforts made at time of the founding of the ''Middle English Dictionary'' project to produce a dictionary of [[Early Modern English]], this never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adventuring in Dictionaries: New Studies in the History of Lexicography|last=Adams|first=Michael|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2010|isbn=144382576X|editor-last=Considine|editor-first=John|location=Newcastle-upon-Tyne|pages=290–308|chapter=Legacies of the ''Early Modern English Dictionary''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several historical dictionaries exist which cover the dialects and regionalisms particular to certain geographical areas, like the [[The English Dialect Dictionary|''English Dialect Dictionary'']], the ''[[Scottish National Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'', the [[A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles|''Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles'']], and the ''[[Australian National Dictionary]]''.

Uniquely, from the 1960s to the 2000s, a historical thesaurus was produced for English, which inverts the traditional historical dictionary by showing the development of concepts into words, rather than the development of words to describe different concepts. The ''[[Historical Thesaurus of English]]'' was published in 2009 and is largely based on data from the ''Oxford English Dictionary''; a similar project is now underway for the [[Scots language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/research/fundedresearchprojects/historicalthesaurusofscots/|title=University of Glasgow - Schools - School of Critical Studies - Research - Funded Research Projects - Historical Thesaurus of Scots|website=www.gla.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French ===
* ''[[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Dictionnaire de la langue française]]''
* ''[[Trésor de la langue française]]''
[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_historique_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise Dictionnaire historique de la langue française]

=== German ===
The largest historical dictionary of German is the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' originally compiled by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] and completed after their death in 1961. A second edition of the letters A–F is due for completion in 2017.

There is also the ''[[Deutsches Fremdwörterbuch]]'' which exclusively covers words [[Loanword|loaned]] into German from other languages, which were largely (though not entirely) omitted from the Grimm dictionary.

There is also a ''Frühneuhochdeutsches Wörterbuch'' covering [[Early Modern German]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fwb-online.de|title=Frühneuhochdeutsches Wörterbuch — FWB-online|website=www.fwb-online.de|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch'' covering [[Middle High German]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhdwb-online.de/wb.php|title=Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch - Lemmaliste/Belegarchiv|website=www.mhdwb-online.de|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ''Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch'' covering [[Old High German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awb.saw-leipzig.de/cgi/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=AWB|title=Wörterbuchnetz - Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch|website=awb.saw-leipzig.de|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian ===
* ''[[Grande dizionario della lingua italiana]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Latin ===
The ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]'' underway in Munich is intended to be a complete historical dictionary of classical Latin.

The[[Union Académique Internationale|&amp;nbsp;International Union of Academies]] undertook in 1924 to compile a series of national dictionaries of Latin in each of its member academies; for instance, the [[British Academy]] produced the ''[[Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources]]''.

The '''Hungarian Historical Society''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Történelmi Társulat}}) is one of the most important and prestigious [[learned society]] among the similar societies in Hungary – but the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] is considered as a principal learned society – and the most notable [[historical society]] of [[Hungary]] which was established in 1867. Its main responsibilities are the cultivation of [[History of Hungary]], dissemination of scientific findings, supporting [[research and development]] and representing History of Hungary domestically and around the world.

==Aims==
The historical society's aims are:

*Cultivating and promoting Hungarian historiography and history, organizing archival research and publishing national historical sources according to the unpolitical spirituality.
*Spreading the recent study results of the Hungarian and – as far as possible – Universal History to reach the widest audience.
*Its traditional aims are to become a large, informal "[[guild]]" to defend and represent the interests of the Hungarian historians, the educators of the [[history of Hungary]] and those people who are interested in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =[[Ferenc Glatz]]|last =|first=|title= A Magyar Történelmi Társulat megalakulásának története (The Establishment of the Hungarian Historical Society)|journal=Századok|pages=233–267|year=1961|volume=101|issue=|url=http://real.mtak.hu/34730/1/1967_Glatz_A_Magyar_Tortenelmi_Tarsulat_megalakulasanak_tortenete_u.pdf|accessdate=2018-03-23|language= hu}} ISSN 0039-8098&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motto==

==History==
The Hungarian Historical Society was established on May 15, 1867. The first session to establish the society was held on 2 February 1867 which was summoned by [[Arnold Ipolyi]]. Here they discussed the ways in which the society was formed and chose a committee to elaborate the basic rules. The first General Assembly was held with 300 members at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. On 13 June [[Imre Mikó]] was elected to the chairman of the society, and acted as a leader until 1876.&lt;ref&gt;

==21st century==
The goal of the new [[millennium]] was that the society renewed the old traditions of conferences and congresses related to the various significant anniversaries, and it began monthly talk series about "Critical Issues in the national history" and the modernization of Periodical Századok. The society celebrated its 150th anniversary on May 15, 2017, and on this occasion a memorial conference was held at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] on 6 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web |url= https://www.ogyk.hu/en/blog/posts/celebrating-the-150th-anniversary-of-hungarican-historical-society |title= Celebrating the 150th anniversary of Hungarican Historical Society. Published on 2017-06-02|accessdate=2018-03-23 |last= |first= |publisher= Library of the Hungarian Parliament |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The management and the Board of Directors is run by the General Assembly. The 20 members of the Board of Directors are elected by the ordinary Annual General Assembly meeting among regular members by secret ballot. The management is consisting of nine members: the [[Chairman|chairperson]], the five deputy chairpersons among whom one serves as an acting chairperson, the general secretary, the chairman of the Editorial Board of Periodical Századok and its editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web |url= http://ujkor.hu/content/tisztujitas-a-magyar-tortenelmi-tarsulat-elen |title= Tisztújítás a Magyar Történelmi Társulat élén (The election of the officials of the Hungarian Historical Society in 2015|accessdate=2018-03-23 |last= Szőts|first= Zoltán Oszkár|publisher= újkor.hu |language= magyar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committees==
*Regional committees: [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County]] Committee, [[Southern Great Plain]] Committee, Southern Transdanubia Committee, [[Hajdú-Bihar County]] Committee, [[Heves County]] Committee, Eastern Transdanubia Committee, [[Western Transdanubia]] Committee, [[Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County]] Committee.
*Specialized sections: [[Information history]] Section, [[Doctorandus]] Section, László Vekerdy Section.
*Professional committees (sections): [[Church history]] Section, [[Environmental history]] Section, [[Women's history]] Section, [[Teacher]]'s Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web |url= https://www.facebook.com/mtt.tanaritagozat/ |title= MTT Tanári Tagozat (Teacher's Section, HHS)|accessdate=2018-03-23 |last= |first= |publisher= [[facebook]] |language= hu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernity''' ('''supermodernity''') is a type, mode, or stage of [[society]] that reflects an inversion of [[modernity]] in which the function of an object has its reference point in the form of an object rather than function being the reference point for form.  Hypermodernism stipulates a world in which the object has been replaced by the attributes of the object.  The new attribute-driven world is driven by the rise of [[technology]] and aspires to a convergence between technology and [[biology]] and more importantly information and matter.  Hypermodernism finds its validation in [[Technocentrism|emphasis on the value of new technology]] to overcome natural limitations and emphasizes a dismissal of an object-driven past in favor of a flexible, attribute-driven heuristic. 

==Hypermodernity==
Hypermodernity emphasizes a hyperbolic separation between past and present due to the fact that:
# The past oriented attributes and their functions around objects 
# Objects that do exist in the present are only extant due to some useful attribute in the hypermodern era.

Hypermodernity inverts [[Modernity]] to allow the attributes of an object to provide even more individuality than modernism. Modernity trapped form within the bounds of limited function; hypermodernity posits that function is now evolving so rapidly, it must take its reference point from form itself.  Both positive and negative societal changes occur due to hyper-individualism and increased personal choice. 

[[Postmodernity]] rejected the idea of the past as a reference point and curated objects from the past for the sole purpose of freeing form from function.  In postmodernism, truth was ephemeral as the focus was to avoid non-falsifiable tenets. Postmodernity described a total collapse of Modernity and its faith in progress and improvement in empowering the individual.

==Supermodernity==
If distinguished from hypermodernity, '''supermodernity''' is a step beyond the ontological emptiness of [[postmodernism]] and relies upon plausible heuristic truths.  Whereas [[modernism]] focused upon the creation of great truths (or what [[Lyotard]] called "[[master narrative]]s" or "[[metanarrative]]s"), and postmodernity was intent upon their destruction ([[deconstruction]]); supermodernity operates extraneously of meta-truth.  Instead, attributes are extracted from objects of the past based on their present relevance.  Since attributes are both true and false, a  [[truth value]] is not necessary including falsifiability.  Supermodernity curates useful attributes from modern and postmodern objects in order to escape nihilistic postmodern [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].  The touchscreen phone is an excellent example of supermodernism in action. Related authors are [[Terry Eagleton]] ''After Theory'', and [[Marc Augé]] ''Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3091">'''Jakob Middendorp''' (Latin Jacobus Middendorpius) (c.1537, [[Twente]] - 13 January 1611, [[Cologne]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Catholic theologian and churchman, academic and historian.

==Life==

Middendorp was born about 1537 in [[Oldenzaal]], or perhaps [[Ootmarsum]], as he called himself Otmersensis on the title page of his work ''De celebrioribus Academiis''. He studied the humanities at the Fragerherren gymnasium of [[Zwolle]], philosophy and jurisprudence at [[Cologne University]], where he became doctor of philosophy and both branches of law, and also licentiate of theology; he also taught [[peripatetic philosophy]] at the Montanum gymnasium there.

He remained in [[Westphalia]] during the troubles in the Archdiocese of Cologne in the time of Archbishop [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]], and was professor at various foreign academies; afterwards he returned to Cologne, where he passed the greater part of his life. In 1580 he became dean of St. Maria ad gradus, Cologne, in 1596 dean of St. Andreas, and in 1601 canon of the cathedral chapter. Rector of Cologne University 1580-81 and 1602–04, he was appointed vice-chancellor by the coadjutor, [[Ferdinand of Bavaria (archbishop)|Ferdinand of Bavaria]], in 1602. He lies buried in the church of St. Andreas.

==Works==

As an author he was best known by his ''De celebrioribus universi orbis Academiis, libri II'',&lt;ref&gt;Cologne, 1567, 1572, 1594, and lastly 1602), considerably enlarged, in two volumes, under the title ''Academiarum celebrium universi terrarum orbis libri VIII locupletati''.&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer work in the history of education and universities. It gave legendary foundations for European higher education, and its history was contaminated by the forgeries of [[Annius of Viterbo]], factors leading to its being discounted by later authors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phil-hum-ren.uni-muenchen.de/GermLat/Acta/Laureys.htm, footnote 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published:

* ''Officiorum scholasticorum libri duo, quorum prior tam iuventutis quam populi Christiani magistrorum qui divinas et humanas literas publice privatimque docent, munus edisserit, posterior vero praecipua auditorum populique offica complectitur'' (Cologne, 1570); 
*''Historiam Aristeae versae per LXX interprets Scripturae sacrae ex MS. codicibus Graecis et Latinis restituit et commentario illustravit'' (Cologne, 1603); 
*''Historia monastica, quae religiosae et solitariae vitae originem, progressiones, incrementa et naturam ex scriptura Sacra, ex pontifico et Caesareo jure, ex antiquissimis historiis, ex veterum Patrum et librorum scriptis demonstrat'' (Cologne, 1603).

'''Janko Orožen''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈjaːnkɔ ɔˈɾoːʒən|pron}}; 10 December 1891 – 30 September 1989)&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;Šlebinger, Janko. 1935. "Orožen Janko." ''Slovenski biografski leksikon'', vol. 6: Mrkun–Peterlin. Ljubljana: Zadružna gospodarska banka.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] historian and schoolteacher.

== Life ==
Orožen was born in Sveti Štefan (now [[Turje, Hrastnik|Turje]]), where he also attended a one-room school.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kmecl"&gt;Kmecl, Matjaž. 1972. "Profesor Janko Orožen - osemdesetletnik." ''Jezik in slovstvo'' 17(4): 113.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a teacher training school in [[Maribor]] and then graduated from high school in [[Celje]].&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kmecl"/&gt; He enrolled in law school in [[Prague]] in 1913,&lt;ref name="Kmecl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sumrada"&gt;Šumrada, Janez. 1981. "Janko Orožen - devetdesetletnik." ''Kronika'' 29(3): 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; but withdrew due to a lack of funds. During the First World War he was called up to serve in the Austro-Hungarian army in 1915&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt; and was captured on the Russian front.&lt;ref name="Kmecl"/&gt; He then joined the volunteers in the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in 1918 and fought with them on the [[Macedonian front]].&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt; In 1922 he graduated from the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Ljubljana]], after which he taught as a historian, Slavic specialist, and geographer in [[Murska Sobota]], and then in Celje from 1924&lt;ref name="Kmecl"/&gt; until 1941, when he was exiled to [[Serbia]]&lt;ref name="Kmecl"/&gt; with his family. He taught in [[Užice]] and then temporarily went into retirement in 1942.&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt;
 
During the interwar period, Orožen wrote textbooks for history, geography, [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]]. Altogether he wrote 30 scholarly volumes, 170 articles and reports, and 12 textbooks.&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt; Orožen also studied the history of Celje and the [[Savinja]] and [[Sava]] valleys. After the Second World War, he returned to Celje in 1946 and taught at a high school there until his retirement in 1954.&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt; Following the major flood in the town that year, he dedicated himself to work at the Celje Historical Archives and served as director of the archives until his retirement in 1965.&lt;ref name="Sumrada"/&gt;

==Family==

'''Jean Daujat''' (Paris, 27 October 1906 – 31 May 1998) was a French philosopher of [[neo-Thomism]], a disciple of [[Jacques Maritain]], and the founder of the [[:fr:Centre d'études religieuses|Centre d'études religieuses]], the Center for Religious Studies, specializing in teaching Christian doctrine.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Jean Daujat was born on 27 October 1906, in Paris to parents who were non-practicing believers. Daujat was home schooled by his mother until he entered the Lycee Pasteur in 1918. He obtained a BA in philosophy, with honors in mathematics.

In September 1923, Daujat entered [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]] where he studied mathematics. Meanwhile, his former high school biology teacher Pastor Jules Lefevre directed him toward the philosophy of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]. Daujat also discovered the philosophy of  Jacques Maritain, who greatly influenced his own work.  Jules Lefevre then introduced him to [[Amédée d'Yvignac]], who had founded the [[French Gazette]], which was subtitled "organ of Christian politics." Jean Daujat collaborated in this review along with Maritain, [[Henri Massis]] and Henri Gheon.

===Center for Religious Studies===
In the fall of 1925 Jean Daujat and a group of seven men began the [[:fr:Centre d'études religieuses|Centre d'études religieuses]].  The creation of the [[:fr:Centre d'études religieuses|Centre d'études religieuses]] would be the focus his work for the rest of his life.

In 1926, Jean Daujat entered the [[Ecole Normale Superieure]] to study science. Classmates included [[Etienne Borne]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] in the literature department, the mathematician [[Chevalley]], and  the physicist and geneticist [[Rosenfeld Heir]]. Other influential men who attended alongside Daujat were [[Raymond Aron]], [[Paul Nizan]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Henri Cartan]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]], two of the founders of the [[Bourbaki group]], [[Louis Neel]], [[Nobel Prize]] laureate in physics, Olivier Lacombe, also a disciple of [[Jacques Maritain]] and specialist in Oriental languages, [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]], [[Maurice Bardeche]], [[Robert Brasillach]], [[Thierry Maulnier]] and [[Simone Weil]].

During this period, Daujat continued his philosophical and spiritual training. With Maritain, he became acquainted with [[Vladimir Ghika]], a Romanian prince who became a Catholic priest. Daujat dedicated a book to Ghika some fifty years later, as well as Father [[Garrigou-Lagrange]]. For several years he has collaborated with writer Yvonne ERC Estienne.

===Marriage===
In 1930 Daujat married [[Danish people|Danish]] painter [[Sonia Hansen]], a talented portraitist and landscape painter.

===Work===
In 1931, Daujat began teaching himself at the [[:fr:Centre d'études religieuses|Centre d'études religieuses]], supported by [[Cardinal Verdier]]. He begins to write a treatise on [[theology]] and [[spirituality]], ''The Supernatural Life'', which appeared in 1938 with a preface by Archbishop Beaussart and Father Garrigou-Lagrange. In 1933 he founded the Monthly Magazine which was published until 1939. In addition to its own articles and those of [[Yvonne Estienne]], there were many prestigious authors who wrote for the magazine, such as Father Garrigou-Lagrange, Mgt Ghika, Father Lallement, [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Henri Gheon]], [[Charles Du Bos]], Stanislas Broth, [[Robert of Harcourt]], [[Gustave Thibon]], [[Henriette Charasson]], [[Olivier Lacombe]], [[Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Jacques Madaule]]. 
Daujat published several books on [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. In 1970 ''The Christian Social Order''. And In 1974 ''Y a-t-il une Verite?'' was published.

After the war, his teaching affected thousands of students. He wrote for several magazines like ''The New Man'' or ''The Catholic France''. He published over thirty books, some of which were translated into several languages.
In December 1946, he defended a thesis on the history of science on the theory of electric and magnetic phenomena before a jury that included [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Louis de Broglie]]. He published two books on the philosophy of science: ''Modern Physics'' and ''Traditional Philosophy''.

Because of a Communist threat he received after publishing a booklet showing the perversion of communism, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies, Daujat was asked to speak at numerous conferences on this subject. He published his last book in 1996.

'''Jennifer Jean Casolo''' is an [[United States|American]] citizen who was arrested on November 26, 1989 by [[El Salvador|Salvador]]an government troops during the "Final Offensive" of the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) in San Salvador.

==Controversy==
Casolo's arrest was related to some arms allegedly discovered at her rented house. An American official noted at the time, "It's a good bust."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D91F3FF937A25751C1A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print U.S. Aides See No Victory in American's Release] by Maureen Dowd, New York Times, December 14, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a 1989 report on El Salvador, [[Human Rights Watch]] noted that the Casolo arrest came at a time when the Salvadoran police and army were arresting, jailing and expelling foreigners working with Salvadoran churches and relief organizations. These critics stated their belief that the government used the Casolo incident as part of an effort to threaten and discredit the entire foreign religious community in El Salvador. They also expressed their concern that it appeared to them that the U.S. Embassy staff in San Salvador and officials in Washington appeared to have already accepted the Salvadoran military's view that Casolo's guilt was an established fact. On November 27, 1989, White House spokesman [[Marlin Fitzwater]] stated that "there are indications of her involvement, that's for certain". Faced with criticism {{Clarify|date=August 2014}} &lt;!-- from whom? --&gt;for what appeared to be a bias towards Casolo, Fitzwater apologized "to anyone who feels that they were offended by this."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Elsalva.htm Human Rights Watch 1989 report on El Salvador], hrw.org; accessed August 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
During this time period, many American and Europeans, often under the auspices of church organizations, were believed to be assisting the FMLN in what they believed was a liberation struggle against the Government of El Salvador. In another incident during the 1989 offensive, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) was contacted by the FMLN and told that another American woman could be located at a specific location who was suffering from battle injuries. The ICRC picked up the woman, whose jaw had been destroyed by a bullet, and transported her to a San Salvador hospital. The evidence suggested that she had been moving with an FMLN unit when it clashed with a Salvadoran military patrol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1574880225/ ''Embassies Under Siege: Personal Accounts By Diplomats On The Front Line''], edited by Ambassador Joseph G. Sullivan (1995).&lt;!-- publisher, ISBN, pages needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==World reaction==
The Salvadoran government of [[Alfredo Cristiani]] was pressed by both the Salvadoran military and outraged citizens, who demanded prosecution of a foreigner contributing to the violence in their country. However, Casolo was also supported by a wide number of critics of the Salvadoran government, who demanded that she be released immediately. Former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]] flew in to represent Casolo, as did a number of religious leaders.

After days of pressure, President Cristiani ordered Casolo released for lack of evidence and deported on December 13, 1989. After spending the Christmas holiday with her family in the U.S. Casolo undertook a nationwide public speaking tour to declare her innocence and denounce the Government of El Salvador and the United States' involvement in that country. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

After her release, Casolo was asked to testify before a Congressional subcommittee on the conduct of U.S. Embassy officials in San Salvador during her detention. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}} She became a peace activist and is a PhD candidate in Geography at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. On the Berkeley website, Casolo listed her research interests as "Gender, political ecology, development theory, Latin American indigenous cultures". {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''José Antonio Aguirre y Lecube''' (6 March 1904 – 22 March 1960) was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] politician and activist in the [[Basque Nationalist Party]]. He was the first president of the [[Provisional Government of the Basque Country]], as well as the executive's defense advisor during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Under his mandate, the Provisional Government formed the [[Euzko Gudarostea|Basque Army]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and fought for the [[Second Spanish Republic]].

==Life==
[[File:Jose Antonio Agirre, Aberri Eguna 1933.jpg|thumb|250px|left|José Antonio Aguirre Lecube, 1933]]

José Antonio Aguirre was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], in the province of [[Biscay]]. He studied in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]'s first [[Ikastola]], a school where all lessons were given in the [[Basque language]]. He later studied law at the [[University of Deusto]].

After his father's death in 1920, Aguirre moved with his family to [[Algorta]], close to Bilbao. At 16 years of age, he had to become a father figure to his 10 younger brothers and sisters.

After finishing his law studies, he began working in the family business, Chocolates Aguirre. He later took responsibility for the business and introduced many reforms, including free health care and paid holidays, which significantly improved conditions for the workers in the factory. He also donated part of the business's revenue to the poor and advocated for social housing. Until 1937, Chocolates Bilbaínos S.A. was the second biggest business in its sector in Spain.

Aguirre was a [[Association football|football]] player for [[Athletic Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JOSÉ ANTONIO AGUIRRE Y LECUBE|url=http://www.bizkaia.eus/Home2/Archivos/DPTO4/Temas/Libro%20Agirre-CAST.pdf?idioma=CA|website=bizkaia.eus|publisher=Grafi denda.|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], he was one of the main promoters of the [[Basque Country national football team]], which played in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] to raise funds for Basque refugee children whose parents had been forced into exile.

In 1926, after completing his military service, he began work as an attorney at [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía|Esteban Bilbao]]'s office. Soon after, he founded his own law firm, which focused on political issues and the working conditions of the lower class.

At this time, Spain was ruled by the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Aguirre, a Basque nationalist, joined the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], or Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV). The party later divided into two political streams. Aguirre opposed the division, believing that the Basque Country was above any differences. He worked to unify the two parts and succeeded in 1930.

Aguirre increased his involvement in politics and published articles in the newspapers ''Euzko Gaztedia'' and ''[[Euzkadi]]''. As an example of his integrationist views and new ideals, in 1932, he proposed that the party should accept people who were not born in the Basque Country.

==Basque devolution and the outbreak of civil war==
[[File:AguirreGuerraCivil.jpg|thumb|Document signed by Aguirre in 1937]]
After the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ended in 1930, a new political era began in Spain. In 1931 and 1932, Aguirre intervened decisively in failed attempts at Basque devolution, which called for self-government, including in [[Navarre]].

On 5 November 1933, two weeks before a [[general election]], a referendum was held in [[Álava]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and [[Biscay]] on new wording for the Statute of Devolution, which abandoned the inclusion of Navarre. The wording was approved by an overwhelming majority (459,000 votes in favour, 14,000 against),&lt;ref&gt;"Las irregularidades cometidas en el referéndum, sobre todo en Vizcaya y Guipúzcoa, fueron reconocidas por los propios nacionalistas, que trataban así de alcanzar, con el apoyo del gobierno, el altísimo porcentaje de votos previsto en la Constitución para la aprobación de los Estatutos", ''El péndulo patriótico'', Santiago de Pablo y Ludger Mees, Crítica, 2005, pág. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; although in Álava, the votes in favour did not reach 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Los votos favorables fueron el 46,4%, los votos contrarios representaron el 11% y la abstención fue del 41,41%, según el libro "''Los problemas de la Autonomía vasca en el siglo XX: la actitud alavesa (1917–1979)''" de Santiago de Pablo Contreras, pags. 119 y ss.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the dissolution of the legislature for the general election, the hesitation of radical government,&lt;ref&gt;Para la aprobación del Estatuto se requería la aprobación de los dos tercios de la región, requisito cumplido holgadamente ya que dicha aprobación superó el 80%; no obstante un grupo de alcaldes alaveses defendió que los 2/3 se debían alcanzar en cada territorio histórico. Su reclamación al Congreso de los Diputados fue rechazada en enero de 1934, puesto que, entre otros motivos, muchos alcaldes actuaban a título personal sin que en su ayuntamiento se hubiera celebrado sesión municipal alguna en tal sentido. (Ver. "''Los problemas de la Autonomía vasca en el siglo XX: la actitud alavesa (1917–1979)''" de Santiago de Pablo Contreras)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Carlism|Carlist]] party's opposition to the incorporation of Álava in the statutory process,&lt;ref&gt;Ver. "''1934: Un año decisivo en el País Vasco. Nacionalismo, Socialismo y Revolución''", [[José Luis de la Granja Sainz]], Lavenç, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; the Devolution was blocked until 1 October 1936, when the [[Spanish Civil War]] was unleashed.

==Basque government==
On 7 October, the councillors from Biscay, along with some from Gipuzkoa and Álava, participated in passing a ballot. A major uprising had occurred in Álava and Navarre, and most of Gipuzkoa was in the hands of the rebels. These rebels, as well as the political machinations of the councillors, set the stage for major political change. Aguirre was elected [[lehendakari]], or president. After a religious ceremony at the [[Basilica of Begoña]], in which he swore allegiance to [[Catholicism]], his country, and his party, he visited [[Guernica]] and took his [[oath of office]] in the Basque language:

{{cita|
''Jainkoaren aurrean apalik,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Eusko Lur gainean zutunik,''&lt;br /&gt;
''asaben gomutaz,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Gernikako Zuhaizpean,''&lt;br /&gt;
''herri ordezkarion aintzinean''&lt;br /&gt;
''nere agindua ondo betetxea zin dagit.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehendakariagirre.eu/ Escuchar documento sonoro original del juramento del cargo de Lehendakari por parte de José Antonio Agirre Lekube en el año 1936.] {{eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;


English translation:


"Humble in front of God,&lt;br /&gt;
Standing in our Basque lands,&lt;br /&gt;
Remembering our heritage,&lt;br /&gt;
under Gernika's venerable tree,&lt;br /&gt;
as president of my country,&lt;br /&gt;
I swear to serve my term faithfully."

[http://www.lehendakariagirre.eu/ Oath of Office, 17 September 1936]}}

A government of conciliation was formed with [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]], Socialists, Communists, and other [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], though not without tensions between them. The government was in power in Biscay for several months until the fall of Bilbao.

The first Basque government was made up of four members of the [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco]] (Aguirre as president and head of defense, [[Jesús María Leizaola]] as head of justice and culture, Eliodoro de la Torre as head of finance, and [[Telesforo Monzón]] as head of interior); three of the [[PSOE]] (Santiago Aznar as head of industry, Juan Gracia Colás as head of welfare, and Juan de los Toyos as head of labor); one of [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] (Gonzalo Nárdiz as head of agriculture); one of the Republican Left (Ramón María Aldasoro Galarza as head of trade); one of the Republican Union (Alfredo Espinosa as head of health); and one of the [[Spanish Communist Party]] ([[Juan Astigarrabía]] as head of public works).{{sfn|Arrieta Alberdi|2007|p=210}}

The Basque Army (Basque: ''[[Eusko Gudarostea]]''), with 100,000 soldiers, was made up of battalions of different ideologies. It was well armed but poorly trained, and one of its most acute deficiencies was the absence of heavy artillery and an air force. Aguirre begged [[Indalecio Prieto]] and [[Manuel Azaña]] to send some aircraft. Historians agree that this was not a viable option because of the difficulties in breaking the siege of Biscay.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Notwithstanding, 40 to 50 airplanes were sent in different shipments, the majority flying over enemy territory. Others were sent across France and, after being disarmed, were retained or returned to [[Barcelona]] or [[Valencia]] in accordance with a "no intervention" policy. Another factor that contributed decisively to the Basque Army's defeat was its lack of a qualified [[General Staff|general staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herbert.preiss/files/Payne_Catalan_and_Basque_Nationalism.pdf|title=Catalan and Basque Nationalism|last=Payne|first=Stanley|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1937, the Nationalists broke through the [[Bilbao's Iron Ring|Iron Ring of Bilbao]] and entered the city as a result of the treachery of [[Alejandro Goicoechea]], the engineer who had designed the fortifications. Aguirre moved his government to [[Trucios-Turtzioz|Trucíos]] before heading to [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and finally to [[Catalonia]], where he prepared to continue fighting with his men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/7038|title=José Antonio Aguirre Lecube|website=Euskomedia|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, in May, Aguirre had entered into talks with the Italians, through intermediaries, about a possible surrender. These talks continued, with the leader of the Basque Nationalist Party, [[Juan de Ajuriaguerra]], discussing terms—the [[Santoña Agreement]]—to allow a withdrawal from Bilbao if Nationalist troops did not attack the city. However, they did attack, and Aguirre refused to sign the surrender agreement and fought on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.puzzledelahistoria.com/?cat=1952|title=Pacto de Santona(1937)|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
Aguirre fled the country after the war and was pursued for years by agents of [[Francisco Franco]]. His exile took him to [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], and [[New York City|New York]]. In June 1940, the Breton [[Yann Fouéré]] gave him documents that allowed him to escape France, which had been invaded by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], allies of Franco.

Aguirre fled first to France, where he organized camps and services for Basque refugees and the government-in-exile. Caught behind enemy lines, he was in [[Belgium]] when [[Hitler]] occupied that country. He then fled to Berlin, where he lived underground until a false identity was arranged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/0245zbk/kosmo24501.html|title=::: Euskonews &amp; Media ::: Kosmopolita ::: José Antonio de Aguirre y Lecube in New York|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the protection of a [[Panama]]nian ambassador (Germán Guardia, who provided him with a Panamanian passport), Aguirre reached [[Sweden]]. Dodging [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] German intelligence, he arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on the ship Vasaholm on 27 August 1941. The Brazilian customs authorities registered a Panamanian, Dr. José Álvarez Lastra, and a Venezuelan, María de Arrigorriaga, accompanied by their children, José and Gloria. These were actually Aguirre, his wife [[María Zabala]], and their sons Aintzane and Joseba. But in spite of intense efforts made by [[Manuel de Ynchausti]] in the [[United States]], after a month Aguirre's true identity was in danger of being discovered.

He wrote then to [[Ramón María de Aldasoro]], former trade and business secretary of the Basque government, who led the Euzkadi Delegation in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. But Aldasoro's efforts on Aguirre's behalf were unsuccessful because the Argentine authorities sympathized with the European "New Order."

In light of this, Aguirre went to [[Uruguay]] and asked a small group of Basque patriots for what Argentina had denied him. The Uruguayan president general [[Alfredo Baldomir]] not only was willing but also received Aguirre with honours in accordance with his status. Once the arrangements were complete, the public announcement of his arrival was made on 8 October in the newspapers of [[Montevideo]]. Aguirre's identity was reinstated, and he was given a visa to travel to New York, where he was put under the protection of resident Basques leading movements in [[Mexico]] and New York.

In New York, Aguirre took up a post as a lecturer at [[Columbia University]]. When the United States decided to back Franco in 1952, he went to France, where the Basque government-in-exile was established. There, he found that France's pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] had sequestrated the Basque government building, and that President [[Charles de Gaulle]] was maintaining it on behalf of the Franco regime. The building is now the [[Instituto Cervantes]].

The president of the government-in-exile was always a PNV member, and even the Spanish sole representative in the [[United Nations]] was a Basque appointee, [[Jesús de Galíndez]], until his murder in an obscure episode at the time of Spain's entry to the United Nations. Aguirre also decided to place the large Basque exiles' network at the service of the [[Allies of World War II]], and collaborated with the [[United States Secretary of State]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to defeat their common enemies.

Aguirre died in Paris on 22 March 1960 from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], aged 56. His body was shipped from Paris to [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] in the [[French Basque Country]], where it spent a night in the Monzón house. He was buried on 28 March after a funeral [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] at the Saint-Jean parish church.

==Influence==
Aguirre's life was the subject of a [[Soule]] folk play, ''Aguirre presidenta'' ("President Aguirre"). He wrote a book about his experiences, ''Escape Via Berlin: Eluding Franco in Hitler's Europe'' (New York, 1942).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4578">'''Kjell Bondevik''' (11 March 1901 &amp;ndash; 21 December 1983) was a Norwegian politician for the [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian Democratic Party]].

He was born in [[Leikanger]]. He graduated with the [[cand.philol.]] and [[mag.art.]] (PhD equivalent) degrees in 1927. He worked as a teacher and headmaster in schools in [[Oslo]], [[Haugesund]] and [[Sauda]]. He was a member of the executive committee of [[Sauda]] [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] from 1945 to 1951, and chaired the local party chapter from 1939 to 1947 and the county chapter from 1939 to 1950. He also chaired local chapters of [[Noregs Mållag]] as well as Christian organizations.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{stortingetbio|KJBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], he was arrested in March 1942 for boycotting the Nazi creation, the Teachers Union, together with a large number of other teachers, including [[Gustav Natvig-Pedersen]]. He sat at [[Grini concentration camp|Grini]] for one day, later at [[Jørstadmoen]] and [[Kirkenes]], but was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk fangeleksikon. Grinifangene|editor=Giertsen, Børre R.|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|year=1946|page=80|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from [[Rogaland]] in 1950, and was re-elected on three occasions. From August to September 1963 he served as the [[Minister of Social Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Social Affairs]] during the short-lived centre-right [[cabinet Lyng]]. During this period, [[Knut Haus]] filled his seat in the Parliament. In 1965 he was again appointed to a cabinet post, this time as [[Minister of Church Affairs and Education (Norway)|Minister of Church Affairs and Education]] in the [[cabinet Borten]], which lasted until 1971.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

When the cabinet Borten fell over a controversy related to the forthcoming [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|EEC referendum]], Bondevik was put in charge of tailoring a renewed centre-right coalition. However, the negotiations between the four parties failed, paving the way for a [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour]] [[first cabinet Bratteli|cabinet Bratteli]]. In this context Bondevik described himself as ''djupt såra og vonbråten'', "deeply hurt with broken hopes". This is a well-known quote in Norwegian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Per Aage Pleym |last=Christensen |title=En tviler i sjefsstolen |url=http://www.liberaleren.no/arkiv/002234.php |work=Liberaleren |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=4 March 2008 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029140903/http://www.liberaleren.no/arkiv/002234.php |archivedate=29 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondevik also worked at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1958 to 1965 and the [[University of Bergen]] as a lecturer from 1965 to 1970. In 1982 he was given an [[honorary doctor]]ate at the [[University of Tromsø]], as the first person. He authored many books, mostly about history topics. Biographies about him were published in 1969 and 1981.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Kjell Bondevik is also known as the uncle of [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]], later [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/om_regjeringen/tidligere/oversikt/departementer_embeter/embeter/statsminister-1814-/Kjell-Magne-Bondevik.html?id=463473 Biography of Kjell Magne Bondevik]&lt;/ref&gt; and father of bishop [[Odd Bondevik]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">The '''Maria Rogers Oral History Program''', or '''MROHP''', collects and archives oral histories about [[Boulder County]]. Started in 1976, the program began with a handful of donated interviews, but now includes more than 1600 interviews, available both on the internet and at the [[Boulder Public Library]]'s Carnegie Branch Library for Local History.

== The Woman Behind the Collection ==

The Oral History Program is named for Maria M. Rogers, the woman who directed and developed the program for more than twelve years from 1985 to 1997. Maria gleaned information from hundreds of the program's oral history interviews for her book, ''In Other Words: Oral Histories of the Colorado Frontier'',&lt;ref&gt;p://nell.boulder.lib.co.us/search~S11?/aRogers%2C+Maria/arogers+maria/1%2C1%2C36%2CB/exact&amp;FF=arogers+maria+m+1938+1997&amp;1%2C36%2C/indexsort=r&lt;/ref&gt; which captures the personal and public history of the pioneers and early residents of Colorado.

==About the Collection==

The Maria Rogers Oral History Program Collection contained more than 1,650 interviews as of 2010, with 40 to 100 new interviews being added each year.  Many of the interviews have been recorded, transcribed and archived by volunteers for the program. Some interviews have been donated to the collection by other educational, governmental, and cultural organizations or individuals in the community.

The interviews are about all aspects of life in Boulder County, providing a detailed account of both daily life and major events. The lives of a wide range of people are recorded, including pioneers and other settlers, cattlemen, farmers, housewives, university professors, local government officials and political activists, attorneys, physicians, coal miners, teachers, artists, scientists, and more.  Although interviews are drawn from residents of Boulder County, they often cover topics that are of general interest, such as city planning and open space, political activism, mountaineering and issues involving the disposal of nuclear waste, among many others.

==Digital Archive - Access==

Donations from the Rogers family and from the Boulder Library Foundation have allowed the program to digitize all of its interviews and create a digital archive that is linked to the Boulder Public Library's catalog, making it easy to research the contents of the interviews by doing a search for names, places or keywords. [http://nell.boulderlibrary.org]

The collection is housed in the Carnegie Library for Local History, a branch of the Boulder Public Library, located at 1125 Pine Street in Boulder, Colorado. Patrons may listen to audio of all of the interviews or watch DVDs of the newer interviews at the library.  Access to files that often include supplementary information about the narrators is also available at the library. 

Full audio with summaries or transcripts of the oral histories are also available online at [http://boulderlibrary.org/oralhistory]

==Special Collections==

There are several special projects that have been conducted consisting of groups of interviews on specific topics related to the history of  the city of Boulder and Boulder County.  These special collections currently include the following:

*Activist Women in Boulder County
*Boulder City Government
*Boulder County Parks and Open Space Interviews
*City Planning in Boulder
*First United Methodist Church of Boulder
*Industrial Mine Camp
*Naropa and Buddhism in Boulder
*Post-WWII Housing in Boulder
*Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant

Rossi served as a [[CH-47 Chinook]] [[aviator|pilot]] with the [[18th Aviation Brigade]], commanding B Company, 2nd Battalion, [[159th Aviation Regiment]], 24th Infantry Division,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; stationed at [[Hunter Army Airfield]], [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Her company deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1990. Rossi was interviewed by CNN prior to the ground assault by Coalition forces. She said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes, you have to disassociate how you feel personally about the prospect of going into war and, you know, possibly see the death that's going to be out there. But personally, as an aviator and a soldier, this is the moment that everybody trains for -- that I've trained for -- so I feel ready to meet a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F.

''New York Times''. newspaper article. 7 March 1991. Accessed on 30 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rossi led a flight of her company's CH-47 Chinook helicopters 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) into Iraq on February 24, 1991, ferrying fuel and ammunition during the very first hours of the ground assault by the Coalition Forces. Her company would be involved in supply missions throughout the war.

She was killed when her helicopter crashed into an unlit microwave tower in Northern Saudi Arabia on March 1, 1991, the day after the ceasefire agreement.&lt;ref name="Wise" /&gt; She was buried on March 11, 1991 with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], Section 8, Grave 9872 ({{Coord|38.87170|-77.06594|region:US-VA_type:landmark|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name="ANC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/ |title=Arlington National Cemetery |accessdate=October 4, 2014 |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A red color shows full moons that are also [[lunar eclipse]]s.]]

For [[astronomy]] and [[calendar]] studies, the '''Metonic cycle''' or '''Enneadecaeteris''' (from {{lang-grc|ἐννεακαιδεκαετηρίς}}, "nineteen years") is a period of very close to 19 years that is  nearly a [[Least common multiple|common multiple]] of the solar [[year]] and the [[Month#Synodic month|synodic (lunar) month]]. The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[astronomer]] [[Meton of Athens]] (fifth century BC) observed that a period of 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 [[synodic]] months and, rounded to full days, counts 6,940 days. The difference between the two periods (of 19 years and 235 synodic months) is only a few hours, depending on the definition of the year.

Considering a year to be {{frac|19}} of this 6,940-day cycle gives a year length of 365&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|4}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|76}} days (the unrounded cycle is much more accurate), which is about 11 days more than 12 synodic months. To keep a 12-month lunar year in pace with the solar year, an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] 13th month would have to be added on seven occasions during the nineteen-year period (235 = 19 × 12 + 7). When Meton introduced the cycle around 432&amp;nbsp;BC, it was already known by Babylonian astronomers.&lt;!--how did he introduce it, if it was already known?--&gt;  A mechanical computation of the cycle is built into the [[Antikythera mechanism]].

The cycle was used in the [[Babylonian calendar]], ancient Chinese calendar systems (the 'Rule Cycle' 章) and the medieval [[computus]] (''i.e.'', the calculation of the date of [[Easter]]). It regulates the 19-year cycle of intercalary months of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]]. The start of the Metonic cycle depends on which of these systems is being used; for Easter, the first year of the current Metonic cycle is 2014.

==Mathematical basis==
At the time of Meton, [[axial precession]] had not yet been discovered, and he could not distinguish between [[sidereal year]]s (currently: 365.256363 days) and [[tropical year]]s (currently: 365.242190 days). Most calendars, like the commonly used [[Gregorian calendar]], are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year. Nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 synodic months. The Metonic cycle's error is, therefore, one full day every 219 years, or 12.4 parts per million.

:19 [[tropical year]]s = 6,939.602 days (12 × 354-day years + 7 × 384-day years + 3.6 days).
:235 [[synodic month]]s (lunar phases) = 6,939.688 days (Metonic period by definition).
:254 [[sidereal month]]s (lunar orbits) = 6,939.702 days (19 + 235 = 254).
:255 [[draconic month]]s (lunar nodes) = 6,939.1161 days.

Note that the 19-year cycle is also close (to somewhat more than half a day) to 255 draconic months, so it is also an [[eclipse cycle]], which lasts only for about 4 or 5 recurrences of eclipses. The [[Octon (eclipse cycle)|Octon]] is {{frac|5}} of a Metonic cycle (47 synodic months, 3.8 years), and it recurs about 20 to 25 cycles.

This cycle seems to be a coincidence. The periods of the Moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are believed to be independent, and not to have any known physical [[resonance]]. An example of a non-coincidental cycle is the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], with its 3:2 [[Mercury (planet)#Spin–orbit resonance|spin-orbit resonance]].

A [[lunar year]] of 12 [[Synodic month#Synodic month|synodic months]] is about 354 days, approximately 11 days short of the "365-day" [[solar year]]. Therefore, for a [[lunisolar calendar]], every 2 to 3 years there is a difference of more than a full lunar month between the lunar and solar years, and an extra (''embolismic'') month needs to be inserted ([[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]). The Athenians initially seem not to have had a regular means of intercalating a 13th month; instead, the question of when to add a month was decided by an official. Meton's discovery made it possible to propose a regular intercalation scheme. The Babylonians seem to have introduced this scheme around 500 BC, thus well before Meton.

==Application in traditional calendars==
Traditionally, for the [[Babylonian calendar|Babylonian]] and [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]] [[lunisolar calendar]]s, the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) years of the Metonic cycle. This cycle, which can be used to predict [[eclipse]]s, forms the basis of the Greek and Hebrew calendars, and is used for the [[Computus|computation of the date of Easter]] each year.

&lt;!--'The [[Chaldea]]n astronomer [[Kidinnu]] (4th century BC) knew of the 19-year cycle' This is not surprising as he lived in Babylon c. 100 years after they had started using the cycle. If he had been born say 200 years earlier, I can see the point of mentioning him--&gt;The Babylonians applied the 19-year cycle since the late sixth century BC. As they measured the moon's motion against the stars, the 235:19 relationship may originally have referred to [[sidereal year]]s, instead of [[tropical year]]s as it has been used for various calendars.

According to [[Livy]], the king of Rome [[Numa Pompilius]] (753-673 BC) inserted intercalary months in such a way that ''in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[Ab Urbe Condita]], I, XIX, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As ''the twentieth year'' takes place nineteen years after ''the first year'', this seems to indicate that the Metonic cycle was applied to Numa's calendar.

[[Apollo]] was said to have visited the [[Hyperborea]]ns once every 19 years, presumably at the high point of the cycle.

The [[Runic calendar]] is a [[perpetual calendar]] based on the 19-year-long Metonic cycle. Also known as a Rune staff or Runic Almanac, it appears to have been a medieval Swedish invention. This calendar does not rely on knowledge of the duration of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years. It is set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is the [[Nyköping staff]], which is believed to date from the 13th century.

The [[Bahá'í calendar]], established during the middle of the 19th century, is also based on cycles of 19 years.

==Further details==
The Metonic cycle is related to two less accurate subcycles:

* 8 years = 99 lunations (an [[Octaeteris]]) to within 1.5 days, i.e. an error of one day in 5 years; and
* 11 years = 136 lunations within 1.5 days, i.e. an error of one day in 7.3 years.

By combining appropriate numbers of 11-year and 19-year periods, it is possible to generate ever more accurate cycles. For example, simple arithmetic shows that:

* 687 tropical years = 250,921.39 days;
* 8,497 lunations = 250,921.41 days.

This gives an error of only about half an hour in 687 years (2.5 seconds a year), although this is subject to secular variation in the length of the tropical year and the lunation.

[[Meton of Athens]] approximated the cycle to a whole number (6,940) of days, obtained by 125 long months of 30 days and 110 short months of 29 days. During the next century, [[Callippus]] developed the [[Callippic cycle]] of four 19-year periods for a 76-year cycle with a mean year of exactly 365.25 days.

==Biography==
Michel Collon started his career in the Belgian weekly ''Solidaire''. He continued his work independently by writing books, making films and an Internet ''newsletter'' broadcast to 40 000 subscribers. He is affiliated with the [[Workers Party of Belgium]], and has organised a network of civil observers in [[Yugoslavia]] and in [[Iraq]]. He took part in the anti-imperialist conference Axis for Peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130703043958/http://www.axisforpeace.net/rubrique3.html Le colloque pour la paix dans le monde, les 17 et 18 novembre 2005], sur le site ''www.axisforpeace.net'' (page « Les participants ».&lt;/ref&gt;

Michel Collon denounced the misuse by Dalai Lama of a photograph that implied Chinese soldiers had dressed up as [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and had provoked the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''[[Le Quotidien du peuple]]'' on 3 April 2008 : [http://french.peopledaily.com.cn/vdl/vdl/6386235.html « Enquête sur une photo manipulée »]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], this photograph was taken from the [[Michelle Yeoh]] film ''[[The Touch (2002 film)|The Touch]]'', which was filmed in Lhassa between 2001 &amp; 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-monks30apr30,0,1096049.story Photo of Chinese forces with monks' robes proves illusory]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mitra''''' ([[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]]: [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/mitrás|''*mitrás'']]) is the name of an [[Indo-Iranians#Religion|Indo-Iranian]] divinity from which the names and some characteristics of [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitrá]] and [[Avestan]] [[Mithra]] derive.

The names (and occasionally also some characteristics) of these two older figures were subsequently also adopted for other figures:
* A [[vṛddhi|vrddhi-derived]] form of Sanskrit ''mitra'' gives [[Maitreya]], the name of a [[bodhisattva]] in [[Buddhist]] tradition. 
* In Hellenistic-era [[Asia Minor]], Avestan Mithra was conflated with various local and Greek figures leading to several different variants of Apollo-Helios-Mithras-Hermes-Stilbon.
* Via Greek and some Anatolian intermediate, the Avestan theonym also gave rise to Latin ''[[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]]'', the principal figure of the first century Roman [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mysteries of Mithras]] (also known as 'Mithraism'). 
* In Middle Iranian, the Avestan theonym evolved (among other Middle Iranian forms) into [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''Miši'', [[Middle Persian]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ''Mihr'', and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] Miuro (/mihru/).{{cn|date=February 2016}} Aside from Avestan Mithra, these derivative names were also used for:
** Greco-Bactrian Mithro, Miiro, Mioro and Miuro,
** by the [[Manichaeans]] for one of their own deities.&lt;ref&gt;"The Iranian Manicheans adopted the name of the Zoroastrian god Mithra (Av. ''Miθra''; Mid. Pers. ''Mihr'') and used it to designate one of their own deities. [...] The name appears in Middle Persian as ''Mihr'' (''myhr'', which does not stem from the genuine Old Persian form *''miça''-), in Parthian as ''Mihr'' (''myhr'') and in Sogdian as ''Miši'' (''myšyy''; Sundermann, 1979a, p. 10, sub 3/11.2). The spellings ''mytr, mytrg'', however, are not variants of the name ''Mithra'', they rather denote Maitreya." Werner Sundermann, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-in-manicheism-1 Mithra; iii. In Manichaeism"], ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Additionally, the Manichaeans also adopted 'Maitreya' as the name of their "first messenger".{{cn|date=February 2016}}

==Mythology==
Both [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] Mitra and Avestan Mithra derive from an Indo-Iranian common noun ''*mitra-'', generally reconstructed to have meant "[[wikt:covenant|covenant]], [[treaty]], [[Consensus|agreement]], [[promise]]." This meaning is preserved in Avestan ''miθra'' "covenant." In [[Sanskrit]] and modern [[Indo-Aryan language]]s, ''{{IAST|mitra}}'' means  "friend," one of the aspects of [[human bonding|bonding]] and alliance.

The Indo-Iranian reconstruction is attributed&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2006"&gt;{{citation|last=Schmidt|first=Hans-Peter|chapter=Mithra i: Mithra in Old Indian and Mithra in Old Iranian|year=2006|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|location=New York|publisher=iranica.com|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-i}} (accessed April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; to Christian Bartholomae,&lt;ref name="Bartholomae_1904_c1183"&gt;{{citation|last=Bartholomae|first=Christian|title=Altiranisches Wörterbuch|year=1904|location=Strassburg |publisher=Trübner}} (fasc., 1979, Berlin: de Gruyter), at column 1183.&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently refined by A. Meillet (1907), who suggested derivation from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*mey-'' "to exchange."

A suggested alternative derivation was ''*meh'' "to measure" (Gray 1929). Pokorny ([[IEW]] 1959) refined Meillet's ''*mei'' as  "to bind." Combining the root ''*mei'' with the "tool suffix" ''-tra-'' "that which [causes] ..." (also found in ''[[mantra|man-tra-]]'', "that which causes to think"), then literally means "that which binds," and thus "covenant, treaty, agreement, promise, oath" etc. Pokorny's interpretation also supports "to fasten, strengthen", which may be found in Latin ''moenia'' "city wall, fortification", and in an antonymic form, Old English ''(ge)maere'' "border, boundary-post".

Meillet and Pokorny's "contract" did however have its detractors. Lentz (1964, 1970) refused to accept abstract "contract" for so exalted a divinity and preferred the more religious "piety." Because present-day Sanskrit ''mitra'' means "friend," and New Persian ''mihr'' means "love" or "friendship," Gonda (1972, 1973) insisted on a Vedic meaning of  "friend, friendship," not "contract".

Meillet's analysis also "rectified earlier interpretations"&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2006" /&gt; that suggested that the Indo-Iranian common noun ''*mitra-'' had anything to do with the light or the sun. When H.

Greek/Latin "Mithras," the focal deity of the [[Greco-Roman]] cult of [[Mithraism]] is the nominative form of vocative Mithra.  In contrast to the original Avestan meaning of "contract" or "covenant" (and still evident in post-Sassanid Middle Persian texts), the Greco-Roman Mithraists probably thought the name meant "mediator." In Plutarch's 1st-century discussion of dualistic theologies, ''Isis and Osiris'' (46.7) the Greek historiographer provides the following explanation of the name in his summary of the Zoroastrian religion: Mithra is a ''meson'' ("in the middle") between "the good [[Ahura Mazda|Horomazdes]] and the evil [[Angra Mainyu|Aremanius]] [...] and this is why the [[Iranian peoples|''Pérsai''&lt;!-- Πέρσαι --&gt;]] call the Mediator Mithra"&lt;!-- following Zaehner 101 &amp; 448 --&gt;.

==Indian Mitra==
{{Main|Mitra (Vedic)}}

[[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] Mitra is a prominent deity of the [[Rigveda]] distinguished by a relationship to [[Varuna]], the protector of ''[[rta]]''. Together with Varuna, he counted among the [[Aditya]]s, a group of [[solar deity|solar deities]], also in later Vedic texts. Vedic Mitra is the patron divinity of honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings.

The first extant record of Indic&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties|last=Thieme|first=Paul|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=80.4|year=1960|postscript=.}} pp. 301–317.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra, in the form ''mi-it-ra-'', is in the inscribed peace treaty of c. 1400 BC between [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] kingdom of the [[Mitanni]] in the area southeast of [[Lake Van]] in [[Asia Minor]].  Mitra appears there together with four other Indic divinities as witnesses and keepers of the pact.

==Iranian Mithra==

{{Main|Mithra}}

In [[Zoroastrianism]], Mithra is a member of the trinity of ''[[ahura]]s'', protectors of ''[[asha]]/arta'', "truth" or "[that which is] right". Mithra's standard appellation is "of wide pastures" suggesting omnipresence. Mithra is "truth-speaking, ... with a thousand ears, ... with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge, strong, sleepless, and ever awake." (''Yasht'' 10.7). As preserver of [[Covenant (religion)|covenants]], Mithra is also protector and keeper of all aspects of interpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love.

Related to his position as protector of truth, Mithra is a judge (''ratu''), ensuring that individuals who break promises or are not righteous (''artavan'') are not admitted to [[paradise]]. As also in Indo-Iranian tradition, Mithra is associated with (the divinity of) the sun but [[Hvare-khshaeta|originally distinct from it]]. Mithra is closely associated with the feminine [[yazata]] [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], the hypostasis of knowledge.

==Mithra in Commagene==
There is a deity Mithra mentioned on monuments in [[Commagene]].  According to the archaeologist Maarten Vermaseren, 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC evidence from Commagene demonstrates the "reverence paid to Mithras" but does not refer to "the mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Vermaseren|first=M.

==Buddhist Maitreya==
{{Main|Maitreya}}

Maitreya is sometimes represented seated on a throne, and venerated both in [[Mahāyāna]] and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism. Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from the ancient [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] [[deity]] Mithra. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names. According to ''The Religion of the Iranian Peoples'',  "No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the [[Saoshyant]]s or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya.&lt;ref name="Tiele, p. 159."&gt;C.P. Tiele. ''The Religion of the Iranian Peoples,'' G.K. Nariman, ''trans''., Bombay: The Parsi Publishing Co. (1917), [https://archive.org/stream/religionofirania00tielrich#page/158/mode/2up 159].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]] claims that some [[Zoroastrian]] ideas like Saoshyant influenced the beliefs about Maitreya, such as "expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya.

==Graeco-Roman Mithras==
[[Image:0 Relief représentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|Relief of Roman [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]], in a [[tauroctony]] scene.]]
{{main|Mithraic mysteries}}

The name Mithra was adopted by the Greeks and Romans as ''[[Mithras]]'', chief figure in the [[mystery religion]] of Mithraism. At first identified with the Sun-god [[Helios]] by the Greeks, the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] Mithra-Helios was transformed into the figure Mithras during the 2nd century BC, probably at [[Pergamon]].  This new cult was taken to Rome around the 1st century BC and was dispersed throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Popular among the Roman military, Mithraism was spread as far north as [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Germanic Limes]].

'''Mladen Lorković''' (1 March 1909 &amp;ndash; April 1945) was a [[Croatia]]n politician and lawyer who became a senior member of the [[Ustaše]] and served as the Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) during [[World War II]]. Lorković led the [[Lorković-Vokić plot]], an attempt to establish a coalition government between the Ustaše and the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] and align the Independent State of Croatia with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

As a student, he joined the [[Party of Rights|Croatian Party of Rights]] but, viewed as a [[dissident]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], he fled the country to avoid arrest and eventually settled in Germany where he obtained a [[doctorate]] in law at the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1934, he joined the Ustaše and became a close associate of [[Ante Pavelić]]. Although he was initially commander of all Ustaše in Germany, where he sought support in creating and protecting a Croatian state, he later became leader of all Ustaše outside Italy. Soon after the establishment of the NDH, he was appointed as Foreign Minister and strongly opposed Italian influence on the state. After his cabinet chief, [[Ivo Kolak]], was executed in 1943 for smuggling gold, Lorković was removed from office but later named Minister of Interior. As Minister of Interior, he negotiated with the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) in the hopes of establishing a coalition government. He also held secret negotiations with HSS representatives to propose having the NDH join the Allies against Germany. Although he apparently had the support of Pavelić, he and his cohorts were soon arrested as conspirators against the state and after a period in detention was executed at the end of April 1945 alongside [[Ante Vokić]].

==Early life==
Lorković was born in [[Zagreb]] on 1 March 1909, the son of prominent politician [[Ivan Lorković]].{{sfn|Banac|1984|p=359}} He attended [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Zagreb where he became a supporter of the [[Party of Rights|Croatian Party of Rights]] and later joined the Croatian Youth Movement. He began law studies at the [[University of Zagreb]],{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}} but completed them in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, following his escape. He later earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] on the subject of the "Establishment of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]" under Max Hildebert Boehm at the [[University of Berlin]]. Lorković and [[Branimir Jelić]] spoke about the state of Croatian university students at the International Students Federation congress in Brussels in 1930 for which they were arrested and held at the [[Brussels Palace of Justice|Palace of Justice]] before being taken to the German border.{{sfn|Jelić|1982|p=42}} During his time in Berlin he met and later married Wally Marquead. He later divorced Marquead, and on 19 August 1944 he remarried to the Countess Nada von Ghyczy.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=239}}

==Activities with the Ustaše==
On 6 January 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] dissolved the government and introduced [[6 January Dictatorship|a royal dictatorship]] over the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Frucht|2004|p=428}} Because he was viewed as a dissident, Lorković was placed under constant police surveillance. On 15 November 1929, a warrant for his arrest was issued, but he succeeded in escaping to [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and later to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}}

Lorković was a keen advocate for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' to secede from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}} and on 4 October 1934 swore his Ustaše oath.{{sfn|Nikolić|1976|p=169}} He became commander of all Ustaše units in Germany and later, after the assassination of King Alexander, commander of all Ustaše outside Italy. The assassination of King Alexander led to him being briefly detained in Germany, but was released in mid-1935 after a German court rejected a Yugoslav request for his extradition.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}}

In 1937, Lorković was arrested following a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] conducted by the [[Gestapo]]. He subsequently left Germany and moved to Hungary and in 1939 returned to Yugoslavia, where he became an associate editor of the ''Hrvatski narod'' (''Croatian Folk'') journal and the editor of the underground journal ''Hrvatska pošta'' (''The Croatian Post'').{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}} ''[[Matica hrvatska]]'' published his book, ''The Croatian People and Their Lands'', in 1939 in which he stated that all [[Bosnian Muslims]] were Croats by nationality.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=377}} After the [[Banovina of Croatia]] proclamation, he was arrested in 1940 and detained at [[Lepoglava prison]] and later in [[Krušćica (Vitez)|Krušćica]], near [[Vitez]]. Lorković was a signatory to a declaration, made on 31 March 1941 and signed on 5 May 1941,{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}} in which the Ustaše requested the declaration of a Croatian state. The document also sought German support, protection and recognition among Axis nations.{{sfn|Jelić-Butić|1983|p=26}}

Lorković was one of the most pro-German members of the pre-war Ustaše movement having cultivated political and academic ties in Germany during his time there. After the establishment of the NDH, Lorković became a member of the temporary government of [[Slavko Kvaternik]] known as the Croatian State Leadership. On 16 April 1941, Lorković was named Secretary of the Foreign Ministry{{sfn|Banac|1984|p=359}} in the first government formed by [[Ante Pavelić]], who also served as Foreign Minister.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}} Up to April 1943, he also served as the chief contact between [[Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]], the Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia, and the Pavelić cabinet.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=346}}

Lorković succeeded Pavelić as Foreign Minister on 9 June 1941. Shortly after taking office, he inquired with the French authorities about the fate of three Ustaše implicated in the 1934 assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] and sentenced to life imprisonment. The actual assassin was a Bulgarian mercenary, [[Vlado Chernozemski]], who was killed after the deed by French security forces. Two of the men died in prison, but the third, Milan Rajić, was returned to the NDH in early 1942 through the intervention of the German occupation forces in France, where he was later killed allegedly on Pavelić's orders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=34}}

On 27 July 1941, in a speech designed to inflame Croats against the Serbs living in the NDH, Lorković lied that Serbs had beaten, mutilated and massacred tens of thousands of Croatian peasants during the inter-war period.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=406–407}} In August, he strongly opposed an Italian request to implement civil administration in the demilitarized zone of the NDH. The Italians countered the following spring by accusing Lorković of being a communist to discredit him for his pro-German views. Lorković was cleared of all charges after a police investigation. However, a German police attaché in Zagreb did claim that Lorković had been in contact with some communists in the early 1930s and had helped some Croatian communists in 1941 and 1942.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=37}} In May 1942, Lorković was appointed honorary member of the German Institute for Border and Foreign Studies.{{sfn|Bartulin|2009|p=215}} Lorković, along with [[Vladimir Košak]] and [[Stijepo Perić]], strongly opposed Italian influence over the Independent State of Croatia{{sfn|Nikolić|1967|p=516}} and towards the end of 1942, wrote a note ("''Spomenica''") in which he described the cooperative efforts of Italy's 2nd Army with the [[Chetniks]]. This note was officially submitted on 26 January 1943 to the Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]]. In response, the Italian diplomat [[Raffaele Casertano]] tried to have Lorković removed from office.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]], leader of the German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), wanted to form a Croatian Muslim SS division. He sent Phleps as his representative to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the Croatian government on 18 February 1943. He met with German foreign ministry envoy [[Siegfried Kasche]] and Mladen Lorković who represented Pavelić. Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division but the Waffen SS and Croatian government disagreed on how the division would be recruited and controlled. Lorković suggested that it be named "SS ''Ustaša'' Division", a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar regimental titles such as ''Bosna'', ''Krajina'' and ''Una''. Pavelić and Kasche were concerned that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word "Croatian" was included in its official title and some Croatian Catholic officers were recruited.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=497–498}} Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|division]] as they saw fit causing grave dissatisfaction among the NDH leadership, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|pp=20–24}}

On 23 April 1943 Lorković was removed from office after Lorković's cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was found guilty of gold smuggling and executed.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}} Following his removal, Lorković was named a Minister in Government's Presidency, where he was responsible for relations with the German Army, and become a close associate of General [[Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]]. During the summer of 1943, he advocated cooperation with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and represented the ''Ustaše'' in negotiations with the vice president of the HSS, [[August Košutić]], about forming a coalition government.{{sfn|Matković|2002|p=203}} Lorković advocated a stronger government and greater independence in its activity. He initiated a new government to be led by himself as a prime minister and not the ''[[Poglavnik]]'',{{sfn|Krizman|1986|p=105}} but Pavelić named [[Nikola Mandić]] as prime minister on 2 September 1942. Lorković and some of his associates submitted their resignations, which were not accepted. Despite this setback, Lorković, along with Mandić, continued negotiations with HSS throughout September finalising them at the end of the month.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}}

After the [[capitulation of Italy]] on 20 September 1943, Lorković, with Kasche and other high-ranking German officers, discussed the return of territory lost after the [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|Treaty of Rome]] in April 1941. Ultimately, Hitler gave permission for the Independent State of Croatia to annex the territory by "guaranteeing unlimited independence of Croatia, including this Croatian Adriatic coast."{{sfn|Matković|2002|p=243}}

On 11 October 1943, Lorković was named Minister of Interior, where he advocated stricter policing,{{sfn|Kovačić|2009|p=213}} and a second term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by [[Mehmed Alajbegović]] as Foreign Minister.{{sfn|Krizman|1983|p=351}} After realising that Germany would lose the war and the NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=238}}{{sfn|Vrančić|1985|p=70}}

===Lorković-Vokić plot and death===
{{main|Lorković-Vokić plot}}
In May 1944, he secretly met with the president of [[Knin]] County, David Sinčić, with whom he discussed the poor state of the German war-effort and that the Allies may invade the Balkans via [[Taranto]].{{sfn|Matković|2002|p=251}} That month, he launched an initiative to renew negotiations with the HSS, which he conducted in his apartment. There, he secretly met with Sinčić, August Košutić and [[Ivanko Farolfi]].{{sfn|Matković|2002|p=251}} Lorković also sought foreign contacts and through [[Switzerland]] made contact with British and American officials,{{sfn|Kisić-Kolanović|1996|p=103}} but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=246}} He proposed that the NDH end its relations with Germany and join the Allies, a proposal supported by the Minister of the Armed Forces, [[Ante Vokić]], as well as many high-ranking [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]] officers and politicians.{{sfn|Kujundžić|1995|p=66}} Lorković also negotiatied with the HSS about switching sides with Pavelić's knowledge and consent.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=246}}

At a special session of government held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=451}} Lorković and Vokić were accused of conspiracy against the ''Poglavnik'' and Croatia's German ally.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=247}} Vice President of the Government, [[Džafer Kulenović]], and many others defended them but to no avail.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=452}} Lorković was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the [[Poglavnik|Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division]] (PTS) where it was decided that he would be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to [[Koprivnica]] and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, [[Ljudevit Tomašić]] and others, although Košturić later escaped.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=247}} Lorković was executed at the end of April 1945.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=239}}{{sfn|Nikolić|1976|p=169}}

==Publishing activities==
Lorković's publications during the time of the NDH were closely tied with his political activity and state obligations. He cooperated with a number of magazines, such as ''Croatia'', which was published by [[Croatian Publishing and Bibliographic Institute|HIBZ]] in German and French for the Foreign Ministry.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=239}}

In 1939, ''[[Matica hrvatska]]'' published his book, ''The Croatian People and Their Lands'' (''Narod i zemlja Hrvata''),{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=237}} in which Lorković focused on the issue of Croatian boundaries.{{sfn|Colić|p=70}} In 1942, he participated in the [[Croatian Parliament]] (''Sabor''). Two of his speeches were independently published: ''The International Political Position of Croatia'' (''Međunarodni politički položaj Hrvatske''; 1942) and ''The Croatian Struggle Against Bolshevism'' (''Hrvatska u borbi protiv boljševizma''; 1944). The latter was published in German in 1944.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=239}}

Seyyed '''Mohammad Fazlhashemi''' ({{lang-fa|سید محمد فضل هاشمی}}) was born in Tehran/Iran in 1961. He has been living in Sweden since 1977. He is a professor of Islamic Theology and Philosophy at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden. Until 2013, he was a professor of History of Ideas at the Department of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies at [[Umeå University]], Sweden. He obtained a PhD in 1994 with a thesis on the political thoughts of the Muslim thinker [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111) and the development of political thinking in the Muslim world during the [[European Middle Ages]].

His research has since focused on [[History of Islamic Philosophy|Islamic/Muslim history of ideas]] during modern times. In particular he has studied the perception of Europe/the West and modernity in the Muslim world, the construction of the images of Europe/the West and [[Islam and modernity|modernity in the Muslim world]], the construction of the images of the West among Muslim scholars and the images of the [[Orientalism|Muslim Orient in the West]]. His most recent published work is ''Vems Islam? De Kontrastrika Muslimerna'', (Whose Islam? The Multifaceted Muslims), 2008. This book has been republished in 2009, 2012 and 2014. Mohammad Fazlhashemi is a regular contributor to the Swedish radio and printed media on subjects relating to the role of Islam in the modern world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Neanthes of Cyzicus''' ({{IPAc-en|n|i|ˈ|æ|n|θ|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Νεάνθης ὁ Κυζικηνός}}) is apparently the name of two writers whose works have largely been lost. The elder Neanthes of [[Cyzicus]] was a disciple of [[Philiscus of Miletus]] ("who is reasonably certain to have died before 300 BC"&lt;ref name=newpauly&gt;Michael Weißenberger, "Neanthes," ''Brill's New Pauly'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt;), who himself had been a pupil of [[Isocrates]]. An honorary decree of 287 BC in which the people [[Delphi]] award him the [[proxeny]] (''Fouilles de Delphes'' 1.429 = [[FGrHist]] 84 T 2) is the earliest of "only five decrees from the third century honoring historians, teachers of grammar or literature, or philosophers for their educational activities in the cities' gymnasia."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Scholz, "Peripatetic Philosophers as Wandering Scholars: Some Remarks on the Socio-Political Conditions of Philosophizing in the Third Century BCE," in W. W. Fortenbaugh and Stephen A. White (eds.), ''Lyco of Troas and Hieronymus of Rhodes'', New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zdesXRC6ba8C&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22fgrh%2084%20t%202%22&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fgrh%2084%20t%202%22&amp;f=false p. 331 n. 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a voluminous writer, principally of [[history]], but very little has reached us to form any judgement of his merits. The various authors that quote him seem, with rare exceptions, to place great reliance on his accuracy and judgement. He is frequently referred to by [[Diogenes Laërtius]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 99; iii. 3, 4, 25; vi. 13; viii. 55, 58, 72; ix. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ii. 25, 297, 525; iii. 399; iv. 203; vi. 93, 113, 247; vii. 249&lt;/ref&gt; and by several of the early [[Christian]] writers, as well as by others. Among the writings of Neanthes there were:
#''Memoirs of king Attalus''
#''Hellenica''
#''Lives of illustrious men''
#''Pythagorica''
#''Τὰ κατὰ πόλιν μυθικά''
#''On Purification''
#''Annals''
He probably wrote an account of Cyzicus, as we can infer from a passage in [[Strabo]]. He may also have written many [[panegyric]]al orations and a work Περὶ κακοζηλίας ῥητορικῆς or Περὶ ζηλοτυπίας against the [[Asiatic style]] of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Whibley]], ''A Companion to Greek Studies'', Cambridge University Press, 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTUsAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=neanthes%20cyzicus%20%22asian%20school%22&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q=neanthes%20cyzicus%20%22asian%20school%22&amp;f=false p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt; This latter work, as well as the history of [[Attalus I]] (who ruled 241-197), are irreconcilable with the dates of the Delphian decree and of Philiscus of Miletus; therefore, it is supposed that they are the work of a later Neanthes of the second century BC.&lt;ref name=newpauly/&gt;

'''Peter Connolly''' [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (8 May 1935 – 2 May 2012) was a renowned [[United Kingdom|British]] scholar of the ancient world, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military equipment historian, reconstructional [[archaeologist]] and [[illustrator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a regular contributor to such periodicals as the ''Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies'' and ''Roman Frontier Studies''.

==Biography==
Connolly studied at the [[Faculty of Arts and Architecture (University of Brighton)|Brighton College of Arts and Crafts]], and wrote his first book, ''The Roman Army'', in 1975. He also 
wrote and illustrated books about the ancient world, including ''Pompeii'', ''Greece and Rome at War'', ''The Greek Armies'', ''The Roman Army'', ''Colosseum: Rome's Arena of Death'', and the award-winning ''Legend of Odysseus''.

He appeared regularly on television as an expert on ancient armies and their equipment, and in the 1980s presented a series for UK schools called "An Archaeological Background to the [[Gospels]]" in which he travelled to ancient sites in [[Israel]], illustrating the programmes with his own paintings, many of which appeared in his book ''Living in the Time of Jesus of Nazareth''. He became a member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1984 and a year later was awarded an honorary research fellowship at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] of the [[University College London]].

A postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the key point that religious truth is highly individualistic, subjective and resides within the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Eve, Raymond. "Wiccans vs. Creationists: An Empirical Study of How Two Systems of Belief Differ". The University of Texas. [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-08-25/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eclecticism and non-dogmatic theology==
According to [[postmodern philosophy]], society is in a state of constant change.  There is no absolute version of reality, no absolute truths.  Postmodern religion strengthens the perspective of the individual and weakens the strength of institutions and religions that deal with objective realities.  Postmodern religion considers that there are no universal religious truths or laws, rather, reality is shaped by social, historical and cultural contexts according to the individual, place and or time.  Individuals may seek to draw [[Eclecticism|eclectically]] on diverse religious beliefs, practices and rituals in order to incorporate these into their own religious world view.

In Japan, [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] ideas are woven together and co-exist. Some people who practice [[Buddhism]] may be syncretic in their approach.  Syncretism occurs among the [[Eastern religions]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC Religions: Postmodernism http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/postmodernism.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, versions of [[Hinduism]]&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, B. (1999). ''Eclecticism and Modern Hindu Discourse''. Oxford University Press USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neopaganism]]&lt;ref name="Lewis, James 1996 page 46"&gt;Lewis, James (1996). ''Magic religion and Modern Witchcraft''. New York University Press. Page 46: "While pre-modern themes form the foundation for this movement it is the manner that such themes are reworked to be appropriate in the contemporary context that form the greatest relevance to the significance of Witchcraft as a postmodern form of spirituality".&lt;/ref&gt; may also be interpreted from a postmodern perspective. A postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, [[syncretism|syncretic]], and eclectic: in drawing from various faiths and traditions, it challenges the notion of absolute truths.

==Historical bias==
History may be written by powerful groups in society, who may [[marginalise]], silence or misrepresent other, less powerful or oppressed groups.  As [[Winston Churchill]] famously remarked, "History is written by the victors."&lt;ref&gt;World War 2 in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with general sources By Loyd E. Lee, Robin D. S. Higham - Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the importance of questioning and considering historical bias when studying religion from a historical perspective.  For example, doctoral studies in religion at [[Harvard]] emphasise studying religion using wider contexts of history and comparative studies.  It is these "wider contexts" that makes religion a valid subject of postmodern contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, K.; Ray, B. (2008). ''A Magic Still Dwells:  Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age'', p. 132. University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of religion are often approached from a historical perspective.  A postmodern interpretation of a religion acknowledges that history can be represented in an inherently biased way, reinforcing the mainstream [[ideologies]] of those in power.

==Versions of truth==
Postmodern religion acknowledges and accepts different versions of truth.  For example, [[ritual]]s, beliefs and practices can be invented, transformed, created and reworked based on constantly shifting and changing realities, individual preference, [[myth]]s, [[legend]]s, [[archetype]]s, rituals and cultural values and beliefs.  Individuals who interpret religion using postmodern philosophy may draw from the histories of various cultures to inform their religious beliefs - they may question, reclaim, challenge and critique representations of religion in history based on the theories of postmodernism, which acknowledge that realities are diverse, subjective and depend on the individuals interests and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Heelas, Paul (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DvNStjceR-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Religion, modernity, and postmodernity] - page 4 and 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal to marginalized groups==
Members of groups in society who face [[discrimination]] or who are [[marginalized]], such as [[women]], the [[gay community]] or other [[ethnic minority]] groups, may be drawn to postmodern religious thinking.  For example, the interpretation of Christianity from a postmodern perspective offers the potential for groups in society, such as the Gay community or women, the ability to connect with a version of reality or truth that does not exclude or marginalize them.  A postmodern interpretation of religion &lt;!--duplicated text is not an attempt to start a new religious movement or banish religion from the public sphere, rather it--&gt; may focus on considering a religion without orthodox assumptions (that may reflect power differences in society rather than universal truths).&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; In [[Semitic Neopaganism]], a postmodern approach to this tradition of Neopaganism involves challenging or reclaiming mainstream versions of reality and truth that may be more inclusive of women.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Melissa (April 1998). "Goddess Religion, Postmodern Jewish Feminism, and the Complexity of Alternative Religious Identities", ‌''Nova Religion'', Vol. 1, No. 2, Pages 198–215 (abstract can be found on [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/nr.1998.1.2.198]&lt;br&gt;"This paper argues that Jewish Goddess feminism illustrates the complexity of alternative religious identities and their fluid, ambiguous, and sometimes intimate historical, cultural, and religious connections to mainstream religious identities. While Jewish Goddess feminists find contemporary Judaism theologically and politically problematic, thealogy (feminist discourse on the Goddess and the divinity of femaleness) can offer them precisely the sacralization of female generativity that mainstream Judaism cannot".&lt;/ref&gt;  Minority groups and the socially or economically disadvantaged may be drawn to follow a postmodern approach to religion, because of the way that postmodern philosophy empowers the individual and provides an "emancipatory framework"&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Mcdonough, Peter Mclaren (1996). [http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/282 "Postmodern Studies of Gay and Lesbian Lives in Academia"], ''Harvard Educational Review'', Summer 1996 Issue&lt;/ref&gt; with which to challenge mainstream ideologies or dominant power structures.

==Postmodern interpretations of religion==

===Christianity===
{{main|Postmodern Christianity}}
Interpreting [[Christianity]] using theories of postmodernism usually involves finding the balance between acknowledging pluralism, a plurality of views and historical influence on doctrine and avoiding the extremes of postmodernism.  John Riggs proposes that postmodernism and Christianity have much to offer each other.  He asserts that Christians who have adopted elements of postmodern thinking still need to acknowledge that some notions of reality need to be fixed and real in order to have "meaningful claims about vital topics such as ethics and God".&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, J. (2003). ''Postmodern Christianity: Doing Theology in the Contemporary World'', pp. ix-x. Trinity Press International. {{ISBN|978-1-56338-364-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a specific religious movement that uses postmodern thinking is the [[Emerging Church]].

===Neopaganism===
[[Neopaganism]] can be interpreted from a postmodern perspective.&lt;ref name="Lewis, James 1996 page 46"/&gt;  Postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, syncretic, eclectic, and draw from various faiths and traditions and challenges the notion of absolute truths.  Wicca, the largest tradition of Neopaganism, can be interpreted using postmodern philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James (1996). ''Magic religion and Modern Witchcraft''. New York University Press. Page 46, "... While premodern themes form the foundation for this movement it is the manner that such themes are reworked to be appropriate in the contemporary context that form the greatest relevance to the significance of Witchcraft as a postmodern form of spirituality".&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern interpretations of Wicca often lead to the practitioner adopting a more eclectic approach, because the very nature of postmodern theory involves the acceptance of many versions of truth and reality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[Eclectic Wicca]] is the most widely adapted form of [[Wicca]] in America today&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Diane. ''Wicca and Witchcraft for Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt; and the core philosophies of postmodern thinking are often&lt;ref&gt;Patridge, Christopher. "Alternative Spiritualities, New Religions, and the Reenchantment of the West", in James Lewis (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett. "Four Ways to Be Absolutely Right", in Anderson (ed.), ''The Truth About the Truth: De-confusing and Re-constructing the Postmodern World'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwmt.org/v1n6/editorial.html Fisher, Amber. ''Journal of Western Mystery Tradition'', Vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; used in order to form an interpretation of Wicca that is highly individual and characterized by the subjective questioning of reality and truth.  This version of Wicca may draw eclectically from, adapt, challenge and adopt a wider range of religious beliefs and perspectives, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Druidism]] and [[Hinduism]] and Wicca and [[Goddess]] movements such as [[Dianic Wicca]], [[Celtic Wicca]] and [[Semitic Neopaganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Melissa (April 1998). "Goddess Religion, Postmodern Jewish Feminism, and the Complexity of Alternative Religious Identities", ‌''Nova Religion'', Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 198–215&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern interpretations of Wicca tend to be context driven, egalitarian, immanent and experiential.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael. "Ecofeminism, Neopaganism, and the Gaia Movement in the Postmodern Age", ''Humanism Today'', vol. 7 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Academic texts often represent Wicca in literature and research as a specific tradition that is underpinned by discourses of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Eilberg-Schwartz, Howard. “Witches of the West: Neopaganism and Goddess Worship as Enlightenment Religions”, ''Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion'', vol. 5, no. 1 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern spirituality==
Postmodern spirituality refers to new forms of spirituality in the contexts of postmodern societies in a globalised world. Former universalistic worldviews of modernity become contested, old explanations and certainties questioned.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">'''Pseudo-Ingulf''' is the name given to an unknown [[England|English]] author of the ''Historia Monasterii Croylandensis'', also known as the [[Croyland Chronicle]]. Nothing certain is known of Pseudo-Ingulf although it is generally assumed that he was connected with [[Croyland Abbey]].

The ''Historia Monasterii Croylandensis'' is attributed to Abbot [[Ingulph]], an 11th-century Abbot of Croyland, but is generally accepted to be a 14th-century work. Those parts of the work written after Pseudo-Ingulf, that is the 15th century, are considered a valuable source. Pseudo-Ingulf himself is not; while he may have had access to genuine traditions or documents at Croyland, "he misunderstood or garbled these beyond any possibility of recognition".

A number of distinguished 19th-century historians attempted to extract reliable material from Pseudo-Ingulf, notably [[E. A. Freeman]] and Sir [[Francis Palgrave]], with limited success.

His father, the famous architect [[Mikhail Eisenstein|Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein]], was born in [[Kiev Oblast]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant family originating from [[Vasylkiv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.myriga.info/index.php?act=Attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=55596 Роман Соколов, Анна Сухорукова «Новые данные о предках Сергея Михайловича Эйзенштейна»]: «Киноведческие записки» 102/103, 2013; стр. 314—323.&lt;/ref&gt; The family had converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. His mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a [[Russians|Russian]] [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_avtobiografiya.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia left Riga the same year as the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution of 1905]], taking Sergei with her to St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son would return at times to see his father, who joined them around 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce followed and Julia left the family to live in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein was raised as an Orthodox Christian, but became an atheist later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eisenstein at 100|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813529714|author=Al LaValley|page=70|quote=As a committed Marxist, Eisenstein outwardly turned his back on his Orthodox upbringing, and took pains in his memoirs to stress his atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the stars: the memoirs of Sergei Eisenstein, Volume 5|year=1996|publisher=BFI Publishing|isbn=9780851704609|author=Sergei Eisenstein|editor=Richard Taylor|page=414|quote=My atheism is like that of Anatole France -- inseparable from adoration of the visible forms of a cult.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Petrograd]] Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Sergei left school and joined the [[Red Army]] to serve the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the Tsarist government, and Sergei to Petrograd, [[Vologda]], and [[Dvinsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in [[Minsk]], after success providing [[propaganda]] for the [[October Revolution]]. At this time, he was exposed to [[Kabuki]] theatre and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]], learning some 300 [[kanji]] characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_kak_ya_stal_rezhisserom.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies would lead him to travel to [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Career==
===From theatre to cinema===
[[File:Sadanji Ichikawa II and Sergei Eisenstein.jpg|thumb|With Japanese [[kabuki]] actor Sadanji Ichikawa II, Moscow, 1928.]]
In 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for [[Proletkult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; His productions there were entitled ''Gas Masks'', ''Listen Moscow'', and ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man|Wiseman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein worked as a designer for [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; by writing "The Montage of Attractions" for art journal ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christie|Taylor|1994|pp=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's first film, ''[[Glumov's Diary]]'' (for the theatre production ''Wiseman''), was also made in that same year with [[Dziga Vertov]] hired initially as an "instructor" &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_moya_pervaya_filxma.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length feature film. ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) was acclaimed critically worldwide. It was mostly his international critical renown which enabled Eisenstein to direct ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (also known as ''Ten Days That Shook The World'') as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, and then ''[[The General Line]]'' (also known as ''Old and New''). Internationally, critics praised the films, but at home, Eisenstein's focus in these films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] brought him and like-minded others, such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], under fire from the Soviet film community, forcing him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of [[socialist realism]].

===Travels to Western Europe===
In the autumn of 1928, with ''October'' still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] and cinematographer [[Eduard Tisse]]. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zürich, London, and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tissé entitled ''Frauennot - Frauenglück''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993| p= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American projects===
In late April 1930, [[Jesse L. Lasky]], on behalf of [[Paramount Pictures]], offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 ($1,500,000 in 2017 dollars) and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930, along with Aleksandrov and Tisse.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon [[Basil Zaharoff]] and a film version of ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and more fully developed plans for a film of ''[[Sutter's Gold]]'' by [[Blaise Cendrars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on all accounts failed to impress the studio's producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount proposed a film version of [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Paramount disliked it completely and, additionally, found themselves intimidated by [[Frank Pease|Major Frank Pease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; president of the Hollywood Technical Director's Institute. Pease, an anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by "mutual consent", Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films, techniques, and theories, such as Eisenstein's [[formalist film theory]], were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures'. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as ''[[Eisenstein on Disney]]'', have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with [[Charlie Chaplin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|pp=89–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR, and were known to Eisenstein. The two had mutual admiration and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein's absences from the USSR, and permission for him to travel to Mexico. The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife, [[Mary Craig Sinclair|Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair]], and three other investors organized as the "Mexican Film Trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican odyssey===
{{Main|¡Que viva México!}}
[[File:Russische regisseur bezoekt ons land.ogv|thumb|250px|Sergei Eisenstein visiting [[Rotterdam]] in 1930.]]
On 24 November 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust "upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract also stipulated that the film would be "non-political", that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of "not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars",&lt;ref name = "Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p. 22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the shooting schedule amounted to "a period of from three to four months",&lt;ref name = "Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p. 22" /&gt; and most importantly that: "Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair..."&lt;ref name = "Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p. 22" /&gt; A codicil to the contract allowed that the "Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour's duration.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By 4 December, Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse. Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film which would come, in one form or another, to be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, ''[[¡Que viva México!]]'', was decided on some time later still. While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired Eisenstein to call his films "moving frescoes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Left U.S. film community eagerly followed Eisenstein's progress within Mexico as is chronicled within Chris Robe's book ''Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

After a prolonged absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film's problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with ''Soldadera'' unfilmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the unfinished filming of the "novel" of ''Soldadera'', without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; but this was lost due to Sinclair's cancelling of production. When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of [[Jesus]] caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=234–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; His re-entry visa had expired,&lt;ref name="Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p. 288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month's stay at the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] outside [[Laredo, Texas]], a 30-day "pass" to get from Texas to New York,&lt;ref name="Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p. 288"/&gt; and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Eisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of [[Sol Lesser]], who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative—at the Sinclairs' expense—and distribute any resulting product. Two short [[feature film]]s and a [[short subject]]—''Thunder Over Mexico'' based on the "Maguey" footage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eisenstein in Mexico'', and ''Death Day'' respectively—were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, [[Marie Seton]], called ''[[Time in the Sun]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released - with the same name in contravention to the copyright - his own version, which was awarded with the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it "Mexican Fantasy".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Return to Soviet Union===

[[File:Sergei Eisenstein 02.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenstein c. 1935]]
Eisenstein's foray into the West made the staunchly Stalinist film industry look upon him with a suspicion that would never completely disappear. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in [[Kislovodsk]] in July 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage.&lt;ref name="Leyda 1960 p=299"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leyda|1960|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] where he had taught earlier and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993| p= 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Eisenstein was assigned another project, ''[[Bezhin Meadow]]'', but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as ''¡Que viva México!''. Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines. [[Boris Shumyatsky]], the ''de facto'' head of the Soviet film industry, finally called a halt to the filming and cancelled further production. The thing which appeared to save Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the ''Bezhin Meadow'' catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Shumyatsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot.

===Comeback===
Eisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for 'one more chance', and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'', with music composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.culturalresuena.es/2016/05/warhol-prokofiev-eisenstein-la-musica|title=Warhol, Prokofiev, Eisenstein y la música - Cultural Resuena|last=González Cueto|first=Irene|date=2016-05-23|work=|newspaper=Cultural Resuena|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-10-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, [[Pyotr Pavlenko]],&lt;ref name="Bordwell, p. 27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, [[Dmitri Ivanovich Vasilyev|Dmitri Vasilyev]], to expedite shooting.&lt;ref name = "Bordwell, p. 27" /&gt;

The result was a film critically well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Stalin Prize]].&lt;ref name="Bordwell, p. 28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian [[proverb]]s, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McKenna. 2009. "Proverbs and the Folk Tale in the Russian Cinema: The Case of Sergei Eisenstein's Film Classic ''Aleksandr Nevsky''."  ''The Proverbial «Pied Piper» A Festschrift Volume of Essays in Honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the Occasion of His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', ed. by Kevin McKenna, pp. 277–92. New York, Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Within months of its release, Stalin entered into a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|pact]] with Hitler, and ''Alexander Nevsky'' was promptly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching and was assigned to direct [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'' at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Bordwell, p. 28" /&gt; After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, ''Alexander Nevsky'' was re-released with a wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], where he first considered the idea of making a film about Tsar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma-Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed [[Ivan the Terrible (Prokofiev)|the score]] for Eisenstein's film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' that Prokofiev was developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivan trilogy===
Eisenstein's film, ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]], Part I'', presenting [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV of Russia]] as a national hero, won [[Joseph Stalin]]'s approval (and a [[Stalin Prize]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neuberger|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the sequel, ''Ivan The Terrible, Part II'', was criticized by various authorities and would go unreleased until 1958. All footage from the still incomplete ''Ivan The Terrible, Part III'' was confiscated, and most of it was destroyed, though several filmed scenes exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blois |first1=Beverly |title=Eisenstein's "Ivan The Terrible, Part II" as Cultural Artifact |url=http://www.ctevans.net/Nvcc/HIS241/Documents/Ivan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1934, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein married filmmaker and screenwriter Pera Atasheva (born Pearl Moiseyevna Fogelman; 1900 - 24 September 1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pera Atasheva |url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/name/1424357/ |language=Russian |accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СЮЖЕТ МОГИЛА СЕРГЕЯ ЭЙЗЕНШТЕЙНА, ВОЗЛОЖЕНИЕ ЦВЕТОВ. (1998)|url=http://www.net-film.ru/film-56207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained married until his death. They had no children.

==Death==
Eisenstein suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 2 February 1946, and spent much of the following year recovering. He died of a second heart attack on 11 February 1948, at the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neuberger|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers before being cremated on 13 February, and his ashes were buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|title=The Death of Sergei Eisenstein|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/death-sergei-eisenstein|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film theorist==
Eisenstein was a pioneer in the use of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]], a specific use of [[film editing]]. He and his contemporary, [[Lev Kuleshov]], two of the earliest film theorists, argued that montage was the essence of the cinema. His articles and books—particularly ''Film Form'' and ''The Film Sense''—explain the significance of montage in detail.

His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a "linkage" of related images. Eisenstein felt the "collision" of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called "methods of montage":
#Metric&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Rhythmic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Tonal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Overtonal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Intellectual&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors' course;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭ's ''Lessons with Eisenstein.'' Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s ''[[Le Père Goriot]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothetical was the staging of the [[Haiti]]an struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's ''The Black Consul,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced as well by John Vandercook's ''Black Majesty.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessons from this scenario delved into the character of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|pp=148–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's pedagogy, like his films, was politically charged and contained quotes from [[Vladimir Lenin]] interwoven with his teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially [[class conflict]]. He used stock characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting [[Movie star|stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's vision of [[communism]] brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Like many [[Bolshevik]] artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets, leaving them absolutely free to create, but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world. Due to the fledgling war, the revolution-wracked and isolated new nation didn't have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first.

The '''Stolpersteine in Croatia''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in the [[Republic of Croatia]]. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Croatia there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteine—in 2013 in the Adriatic town [[Rijeka]] ({{IPA-hr|rijěːka|hr}}, in Italian: ''Fiume''). From 1466, this town was under Habsburg rule for four and half centuries, at last with two-thirds of its inhabitants being of Italian descent. Thereafter, Rijeka was independent for some years. From 1924 to the end of WW2, the city belonged to Italy. The name of the Stolpersteine in Croatian is ''Kamen spoticanja'', and in Italian:  ''pietre d'inciampo''.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

He established himself as a retailer of gadgets and jewelery and married Zseni Zipszer, also called Giannetta. The couple had three children, the sons Arturo (1914–1980) and Efraim (born 1919) and the daughter Magda (also Maddalena), who later-on was married to Enrico Heimler and took his name. Both sons were able to emigrate to Palestine in time. His daughter Magda, together with her husband, her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law, escaped to Central Italy in September 1943, and thereafter to Switzerland where she could survive the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=MaddalenaHeimler &gt;[[Claims Resolution Tribunal]]: ''[http://www.crt-ii.org/_awards/_apdfs/Heimler_Daniela.pdf In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation Case No. CV96-4849]'', retrieved on 29 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremus Eugenio Lipschitz was interned by the Mussolini regime from 28 July 1940 to 22 December of that year in the [[Campagna internment camp]]. After his release he was not allowed to return to Fiume for a certain period. He and his wife were arrested in Fiume by German forces in March 1944, first deported to [[Risiera di San Sabba]], a German concentration camp in Trieste, later to [[Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp]]. There, both were murdered at an unknown time.

His sister Giuseppina and her husband Adolfo Simkovits were also murdered in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;CDEC Digital Collection: ''[http://digital-library.cdec.it/cdec-web/persone/detail/person-4994/lipschitz-giuseppina.html Lipschitz, Giuseppina]'',  retrieved on 6 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipschitz's report on the internment in Campagna was translated by his daughter from Hungarian to Italian and published in 2001 in book form. His report was designated by the [[Corriere del Mezzogiorno]] as a particularly relevant historical document.&lt;ref&gt;In a review of the book ''Gli ebrei sotto la persecuzione in Italia'' by Avagliano/Palmieri, the Italian daily [[Corriere del Mezzogiorno]] of 2 April 2011 praised the Lipschitz diary and its "exact description of the internment″.

== Dates of collocations ==
The collocation in Rijeka took place on 21 May 2013. For both victims two Stolpersteine were posed, one in Croatian and one in Italian. The planned collocation of a Stolperstein for [[Branko Lustig]] in [[Osijek]] on 22 May 2013 has probably not taken place.

The '''Tanpopo''' mission is an orbital [[astrobiology]] experiment investigating the potential interplanetary transfer of [[life]], [[organic compound]]s, and possible terrestrial particles in the low Earth orbit. The purpose is to assess the [[panspermia]] hypothesis and the possibility of natural interplanetary transport of microbial life as well as prebiotic organic compounds.

The collection and exposure phase took place from May 2015 through February 2018 utilizing the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo, the [[Kibo (ISS module)|Japanese Experimental Module]] of the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceref.com/international-space-station/nasa-iss-on-orbit-status-13-may-2015.html NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 13 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission, designed and performed by Japan, collected [[cosmic dust]] by using ultra-low density silica gel ([[aerogel]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tabata |first1=M |last2=Imai |first2=E |last3= Yano|first3= H|last4= Hashimoto|first4= H|last5=Kawai |first5= H|display-authors=etal|date= 2014|title=Design of a Silica-aerogel-based Cosmic Dust Collector for the Tanpopo Mission Aboard the International Space Station |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tastj/12/ists29/12_Pk_29/_article |journal= Transactions of The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Aerospace Technology Japan |publisher= J-STAGE|volume= 12|issue= ISTS 29|pages= Pk_29-Pk_34 |doi= 10.2322/tastj.12.Pk_29|access-date=1 September 2016|arxiv=1406.3160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are being analyzed for amino acid-related compounds and microorganisms following their return to Earth.&lt;ref name='prelim2017'&gt;[https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/609841/1/SA6000060153.pdf Current State of Organics Exposure Experiments In the Tanpopo Mission] (PDF).

[[File:Piratpartiets principprogram illustrations (1).jpg|thumb|150px|Dandelion seeds spread by the wind]]
The capture and exposure experiments in the Tanpopo mission were designed to confirm the hypothesis that extraterrestrial [[organic compound]]s played important roles in the generation of the first terrestrial life, as well as examination of the hypothesis of panspermia. If the Tanpopo mission can detect microbes at the higher altitude of [[low Earth orbit]] (400&amp;nbsp;km), it will support the possible interplanetary migration of terrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241270775_Microbe_space_exposure_experiment_at_International_Space_Station_(ISS)_proposed_in_Tanpopo_mission Microbe space exposure experiment at International Space Station (ISS) proposed in "Tanpopo" mission].

Also, by evaluating retrieved samples of exposed terrestrial microbes and astronomical organic analogs on the exposure panels, they can investigate their survival and any alterations in the duration of interplanetary transport.

Researchers also aim to capture [[organic compounds]] and prebiotic organic compounds — such as [[aminoacids]] — drifting in space.&lt;ref name='Yomiuri'/&gt;  The mission collected [[cosmic dust]] and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called [[aerogel]]. Some of these aerogels were replaced every one to two years through February 2018.&lt;ref name='Yomiuri'&gt;[http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002066967 Tanpopo mission to search space for origins of life].

===Objectives===

The objectives of Tanpopo lie in following 6 topics: &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2201.html Astrobiology Exposure and Micrometeoroid Capture Experiments (Tanpopo)]. 18 October 2017. Hideyuki Watanabe. JAXA. Published by NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sources of organic compounds to the surface of Earth&lt;ref name='Yuko2016'/&gt; 
#Organic compounds on micrometeorites are being exposed to the space environment before return to Earth for analyses
#Possibility for terrestrial microbe detection at the ISS orbital altitude due to the processes of volcanic eruptions, thunderstorms, meteorite impacts, and electromagnetic fields around the Earth
#Survival of some species of microbes in the space environment
#Capture of artificial micro-particles (space debris) by aerogel
#Two aerogel densities to capture particles moving at high velocity

==Analyses==
The aerogels were placed and retrieved by using the robotic arm outside Kibo. The first year samples were returned to Earth in mid-2016,&lt;ref name='Yuko2016'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Investigation of the Interplanetary Transfer of Microbes in the Tanpopo Mission at the Exposed Facility of the International Space Station |journal=Astrobiology |date=13 May 2016 |last=Kawaguchi |first=Yuko |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=363–376 |doi=10.1089/ast.2015.1415 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2015.1415 |accessdate=2016-05-29 |display-authors=etal |pmid=27176813|bibcode=2016AsBio..16..363K }}&lt;/ref&gt; panels from the second year were brought back in late 2017, and the last set ended exposure in February 2018.&lt;ref name='Expedition Duration'/&gt; The last aerogels were placed inside the 'landing &amp; return capsule' in early 2018 and ejected toward Earth for retrieval.&lt;ref name='Conference2014'/&gt; After retrieving the aerogels, scientists are  investigating the captured microparticles and tracks formed, followed by microbiological, organochemical and mineralogical analyses. Particles potentially containing microbes will be used for [[PCR amplification]] of [[rRNA]] genes followed by [[DNA sequencing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/me/en/Portaldata/25/Resources/dokumente/institut_me/institutsseminar/abstracts_2014/abstract_kawaguchi_y_09102014.pdf Tanpopo mission: Astrobiology exposure and capture experiments of microbes and micrometeoroid]. (PDF) Yuko Kawaguchi. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry O'Hanlon. 19 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may support the idea that clumps greater than 0.5 millimeters of microorganisms could be one way for life to spread from planet to planet.&lt;ref name='AGU2017'/&gt;  It was also noted that [[glycine]]'s decomposition was less than expected, while [[hydantoin]]'s recovery was much lower than glycine.&lt;ref name='prelim2017'/&gt;

The Victorian Community History Awards are held annually to recognise the contributions made by Victorians in the preservation of the State’s history, and to recognise excellence in historical research. The effect of the VCHA over the period from 1998 to the present has been the stimulation of community history, the lifting of standards and the fostering of diversity and originality. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Victorian Community History Awards''' were established and sponsored in 1997 by  '''Information [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'''. The judges have always been appointed by the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and among the first were Professor [[Weston Bate]], Professor [[A. G. L. Shaw]], and senior journalist at ''The Age'', John Lahey. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding was suspended in 2006 to provide additional funds for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.  After 2010 Information Victoria Bookshop withdrew support for the program, but after a vigorous campaign by the RHSV for the continuance of the Awards, the Baillieu government accepted a submission from the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] (PROV) to continue the program for a further four-year period. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;    

From 2011 the Awards were administered by the RHSV in partnership with PROV.&lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vital records''' are records of life events kept under governmental authority, including [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage license]]s, and [[death certificate]]s. In some jurisdictions, vital records may also include records of [[civil unions]] or [[domestic partnerships]].

In the [[United States]], vital records are typically maintained at both the county&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Register of Deeds Vital Records System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://county.milwaukee.gov/VtialRecordsSystem9855.htm|title=Milwaukee Register of Deeds Vital Records System}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state levels.&lt;ref name="Florida Statutes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/|title=Florida Statutes, Chapter 382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United Kingdom]] and numerous other countries vital records are recorded in the [[civil registry]].

Various European countries are members of an [[International Commission on Civil Status]] which provides a mutually recognized convention on the coding of entries appearing in [[civil status]] documents, with common codes and translation tables between the language of the member states. They also provide an English unofficial translation.

In the fields of [[Records Management]] and [[Archival Science]] the term vital record is used&lt;ref&gt;See for example ISO 15489-1:2001 clause 9.3a.&lt;/ref&gt; to mean "records, regardless of medium, which are essential to the organization in order to continue with its business-crucial functions both during and after a disaster. They need not be permanent, might be active or inactive, originals or copies."&lt;ref name="British Records Association Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishrecordsassociation.org.uk/pages/guide2.htm|title=British Records Association Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that only the life events meaning is restricted to government; the records management meaning in this article applies to both government and non-government organizations.

In the past 10 years, there has been an overall increase in global birth registration rates of children under five from 58 percent to 65 percent. However, more than 100 developing countries still do not have functioning systems that can support efficient registration of births and other life events like marriages and death. Around the world, almost 230 million children under the age of five are not registered. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 85 million of these children, while 135 million live in Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/CRVSScaling-upoverview5-28-14web.pdf|title=Global Civil Registration and Vital Statistics|last=|first=World Bank Report|date=2014|website=|publisher=World Bank|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress with death registration has been much slower globally. In countries in most need of CRVS, up to 80 percent of deaths that occur outside health facilities and two-thirds of all deaths globally are not counted.

The governmental authority is tasked with the safekeeping of the vital records, effectively providing the government with another source of income through [[fee]]s.  The original copy of the vital record is always kept by the government authority.  In the United States vital records are public and in most cases can be viewed by anyone in person at the governmental authority.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Register of Deeds Genealogical Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://county.milwaukee.gov/GenealogicalResearch9856.htm|title=Milwaukee Register of Deeds Genealogical Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Copies can also be requested for a fee.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Register of Deeds Association Vital Records Fee/Application"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrdaonline.org/VitalRecords/Index.htm|title=Wisconsin Register of Deeds Association Vital Records Fee/Application}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of copies:  certified and uncertified.  Certified copies are official copies that can be used as identification whereas uncertified copies do not contain the governmental authority's seal and often are marked that they should not be used for identification.  There may be additional restrictions in place on who can actually request a certified copy, such as immediate family or someone with written authorization.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Request for a Birth Certificate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/VitalRecords/birth.htm#B3|title=Request for a Birth Certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certified copies are usually much more expensive than uncertified copies.  Some states have started making vital records available online for free.&lt;ref name="Seeking Michigan Death Records, 1897-1920"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingmichigan.org/discover/death-records-1897-1920|title=Seeking Michigan Death Records, 1897-1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vital records that are online typically are 90 or more years old and assume the person listed in the record is no longer alive.

{{War}}
A '''war of succession''' or '''succession war''' is a [[war]] prompted by a [[Order of succession|succession crisis]] in which two or more individuals claim the right of successor to a [[demise of the Crown|deceased]] or [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[monarch]]. The rivals are typically supported by [[Political faction|factions]] within the [[Court (royal)|royal court]]. Foreign powers sometimes [[Interventionism_(politics)#Foreign_interventionism|intervene]], [[alliance|allying]] themselves with a faction. This may widen the war into one between those powers.

== Analysis ==
=== Terminology ===
In historiography and literature, a ''war of succession'' may also be referred to as a ''succession dispute'', ''dynastic struggle'', ''[[:wikt:internecine|internecine]] conflict'', ''[[:wikt:fratricidal|fratricidal]] war'', or any combination of these terms. Not all of these are necessarily describing armed conflict, however, and the dispute may be resolved without escalating into open warfare. Wars of succession are also often referred to as a ''civil'' war, when in fact it was a conflict within the royalty, or broader aristocracy, that civilians were dragged into,&lt;ref name="Kunisch1"/&gt; and may therefore be a misnomer, or at least a misleading characterisation.

=== Elements ===
[[File:Ada de Hollande.png|thumb|To inherit [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Ada, Countess of Holland|Ada]] quickly married [[Louis II, Count of Loon|Louis]] before [[Dirk VII, Count of Holland|her father]] was buried,  triggering the [[Loon War]].&lt;ref name="Loon"&gt;{{nl icon}} Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Ada". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nuyens |first=Willem Jan Frans |authorlink=Wilhelmus Nuyens |date=1873 |title=Algemeene geschiedenis des Nederlandschen volks: van de vroegste tijden tot op onze dagen, Volumes 5-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSXrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA80 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=C.L. van Langenhuysen |pages=80–81 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A war of succession is a type of [[civil war|intrastate war]] concerning struggle for the throne: a conflict about supreme power in a [[monarchy]]. It may become an interstate war if foreign powers intervene. A succession war may arise after (or sometimes even before) a universally recognised ruler over a certain territory passes away (sometimes without leaving behind any (legal) offspring), or is declared insane or otherwise incapable to govern, and is deposed. Next, several [[pretender]]s step forward, who are either related to the previous ruler and therefore claim to have a right to their possessions based on the [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary principle]], or have concluded a treaty to that effect. They will seek allies within the nobility and/or abroad to support their claims to the throne. After all options for a diplomatic solution –such as a sharing of power, or a financial deal– or a quick elimination –e.g. by assassination or arrest– have been exhausted, a military confrontation will follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{Cite book |last=de Graaf |first=Ronald P. |date=2004 |title=Oorlog om Holland, 1000-1375 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJufxksLAgAC&amp;pg=PA310 |location=Hilversum |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |page=310 |isbn=9789065508072 |accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite often such succession disputes can lead to long-lasting wars.

Some wars of succession are about women's [[inheritance|right to inherit]]. This does not exist in some countries (a "sword [[fief]]", where the [[Salic law]] applies, for example), but it does in others (a "spindle fief").&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "zwaardleen"; "spilleleen". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; Often a ruler who has no sons, but does have one or more daughters, will try to change the [[primogeniture|succession laws]] so that a daughter can succeed him. Such amendments will then be declared invalid by opponents, invoking the local [[tradition]].

In some cases, wars of succession could also be centred around the reign in [[prince-bishopric]]s. Although these were formally [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] without hereditary succession, the election of the prince-bishop could be strongly intertwined with the dynastic interests of the noble families involved, each of whom would put forward their own candidates. In case of disagreement over the election result, waging war was a possible way of settling the conflict.

It can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a war was purely or primarily a war of succession, or that other interests were at play as well that shaped the conflict in an equally or more important manner, such [[ideology|ideologies]] ([[religion]]s, [[secularism]], [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], [[conservatism]]), [[economy]], [[territory]] and so on. Many wars are not called 'war of succession' because hereditary succession was not the most important element, or despite the fact that it ''was''. Similarly, wars can also be unjustly branded a 'war of succession' whilst the succession was actually not the most important issue hanging in the balance.

=== Polemology ===
The origins of succession wars lie in [[feudalism|feudal]] or [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] systems of government, in which the decisions on war and peace could be made by a single [[Monarch|sovereign]] without the population's consent. The politics of the respective rulers was mainly driven by dynastic interests. German historian Johannes Kunisch (1937–2015) ascertained: "The all-driving power was the dynasties' law of the prestige of power, the expansion of power, and the desire to maintain themselves."&lt;ref name="Kunisch1"&gt;{{de icon}} {{aut|Johannes Kunisch}}, ''Staatsverfassung und Mächtepolitik – Zur Genese von Staatenkonflikten im Zeitalter des Absolutismus'' (Berlin 1979), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the legal and political coherence of the various provinces of a 'state territory' often consisted merely in nothing more than having a common ruler. Early government systems were therefore based on dynasties, the extinction of which immediately brought on a state crisis. The composition of the governmental institutions of the various provinces and territories also eased their partitioning in case of a conflict, just like the status of claims on individual parts of the country by foreign monarchs.&lt;ref name="Kunisch2"&gt;{{de icon}} {{aut|Johannes Kunisch}}, ''La guerre – c’est moi! – Zum Problem der Staatenkonflikte im Zeitalter des Absolutismus'', in: ders.: ''Fürst, Gesellschaft, Krieg – Studien zur bellizistischen Disposition des absoluten Fürstenstaates'' (Cologne/Weimar/Vienna 1992), p. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

To wage a war, a justification is needed (''[[Jus ad bellum]]''). These arguments may be put forward in a [[declaration of war]], to indicate that one is justly taking up arms. As the Dutch lawyer [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645) noted, these must make clear that one is unable to pursue their rightful claims in any other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{aut|Heinz Duchhardt}}, ''Krieg und Frieden im Zeitalter Ludwigs XIV.'' (Düsseldorf 1987), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The claims to legal titles from the dynastic sphere were a strong reason for war, because international relations primarily consisted of inheritance and marriage policies until the end of the [[Ancien Régime]]. These were often so intertwined that it had to lead to conflict. Treaties that led to hereditary linkages, [[pawnbroker|pawning]] and transfers, made various relations more complicated, and could be utilised for claims as well. That claims were made at all is due to the permanent struggle for competition and prestige between the respective ruling houses. On top of that came the urge of contemporary princes to achieve "[[Glory (honor)|glory]]" for themselves.&lt;ref name="Kunisch2" /&gt;

After numerous familial conflicts, the principle of [[primogeniture]] originated in [[Western Europe]] the 11th century, spreading to the rest of Europe (with the exception of Russia) in the 12th and 13th century; it has never evolved outside Europe.&lt;ref name="Moore66"&gt;{{aut|Robert I. Moore}}, ''The First European Revolution: 970-1215'' (2000), p. 66. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not prevented the outbreak of wars of succession. A true deluge of succession wars occurred in Europe between the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) and the [[Coalition Wars]] (1792–1815).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{aut|Gerhard Papke}}, ''Von der Miliz zum Stehenden Heer – Wehrwesen im Absolutismus'', in: Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt (publisher) ''Deutsche Militärgeschichte 1648–1939'', Vol.1 (Munich 1983), p. 186f.&lt;/ref&gt; According to German historian Heinz Duchhardt (1943) the outbreak of wars of succession in the [[early modern period]] was stimulated on the one hand by the uncertainty about the degree to which regulations and agreements on hereditary succession were to be considered a respectable part of emerging [[international law]]. On the other hand, there was also a lack of effective means to provide them recognition and validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{aut|Heinz Duchhardt}}, ''Krieg und Frieden im Zeitalter Ludwigs XIV.'' (Düsseldorf 1987), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British statesman [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] ([[Lord Chancellor]] 1830–34), there were more and longer wars of succession in Europe between [[Norman conquest of England|1066]] and the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) than all other wars put together. "A war of succession is the most lasting of wars. The hereditary principle keeps it in perpetual life – [whereas] a war of [[election]] is always short, and never revives", he opined, arguing for elective monarchy to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brougham |first=Henry |date=1845 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdFMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |title=Lord Brougham's Political Philosophy |journal=[[The Edinburgh Review]] |volume=81-82 |issue=1-2 |pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mughal Empire]], there was no tradition of primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Chandra2005p267"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2005 |isbn=9788124110669 |first=Satish |last=Chandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&amp;pg=PA267 |pages=267–269 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father, and for brothers to war to the death among themselves.&lt;ref name="Markovits96"&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-first=Claude |editor-last=Markovits |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C&amp;pg=PA96 |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=96 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lines of Eärendur died out in Cardolan and Rhudaur, King Argeleb I of Arthedain intended to reunite Arnor in T.A. 1349 and was recognised by Cardolan, but then the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] intervened, annexed Rhudaur, ravaged Cardolan and besieged Arthedain's capital city of [[Fornost]]. In T.A. 1973–1975, Arthedain was finally destroyed; even though allied Men from Gondor and Elves from Lindon subsequently succeeded in defeating Angmar in the [[Battle of Fornost]] and driving out the Witch-king, the Kingdom of Arnor would never be restored until the dawn of the [[Fourth Age]].
