'''Agnes Bernice Martin''' (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was a Canadian-born American abstract painter. Her work has been defined as an "essay in discretion on inward-ness and silence".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although she is often considered or referred to as a [[minimalist]], Martin considered herself an [[abstract expressionist]].&lt;ref name=Stockholm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt; She was awarded a [[National Medal of Arts]] from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=WPost&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Schudel |title=Influential Abstract Painter Agnes Martin Dies at 92  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A9391-2004Dec17 |date=December 18, 2004 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Agnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in [[Macklin, Saskatchewan]], one of four children.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Agnes Martin: the quiet American |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/22341ab2-091f-11e5-b643-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=Financial Times |date=June 5, 2015 |access-date=October 5, 2015 |issn=0307-1766 |first=Rachel |last=Spence |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3787 MoMA | The Collection | Agnes Martin.

Accessed March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin studied at [[Western Washington University]] College of Education, [[Bellingham, Washington]], prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;{{cite news |first=Holland |last=Cotter |title=Agnes Martin, Abstract Painter, Dies at 92 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/arts/design/17martin.html |date=December 17, 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in [[Taos, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=MorrisBell /&gt;{{rp|237}} After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar [[D.

She lived alone all her adult life.&lt;ref name="WPost" /&gt; In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where she lived until her death in 2004.&lt;ref name=MorrisBell /&gt;{{rp|242}}

She was publicly known to have schizophrenia,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; once opting for electric shock therapy for treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many of her paintings bear positive names such as ''Happy Holiday'' (1999) and ''I Love the Whole World'' (2000).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an interview in 1989, discussing her life and her painting, Agnes Martin said, "Beauty and perfection are the same. They never occur without happiness."&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-agnes-martin-13296 |title=Oral history interview with Agnes Martin, 1989 May 15 |publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=October 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer of her time, Agnes Martin never publicly expressed her sexuality, but has been described as a 'closeted homosexual' (sic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiske|first1=Courtney|title=Agnes Martin |url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/04/art_books/agnes-martin-fiske-apr2012 |website=www.brooklynrail.org |publisher=The Brooklyn Rail |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 biography ''Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon'' uncovers several romantic relationships between Martin and other women, including the dealer [[Betty Parsons]].&lt;ref name=Martin2018&gt;{{Cite book |title=Agnes Martin: pioneer, painter, icon |first=Henry |last=Martin |isbn=978-1-943156-30-6 |edition=First paperback |publisher=Schaffner |location=Tucson, Arizona |oclc=981962171}}&lt;/ref&gt; She often employed an intersectional feminist lens when she critiqued fellow artists' work. Jaleh Mansoor, an art historian, states that Martin was "too engaged in a feminist relation to practice, perhaps, to objectify and label it as such".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schiff |first1=Karen L. |title=Agnes Martin, Under New Auspices |journal=Art Journal |date=March 4, 2013 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Her work is most closely associated with Taos,&lt;ref name="Christies"/&gt; with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert environment of New Mexico.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in [[Coenties Slip (Manhattan)|Coenties Slip]] in lower Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included [[Robert Indiana]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Jack Youngerman]], and [[Lenore Tawney]]. [[Barnett Newman]] actively promoted Martin's work, and helped install Martin's exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Christies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5147496 |author=Agnes Martin |title=Starlight 1963, Lot Notes |publisher=[[Christie's]] |location=New York |work=Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another close friend and mentor was [[Ad Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name="Saved From the Artist's Fire"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Landi |date=March 13, 2012 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203753704577253590562995200 |title=Saved From the Artist's Fire |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=6 August 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend [[Lenore Tawney]]'s first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]], the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5437870 |title=Agnes Martin ''Homage to Greece'' (1959) |publisher=[[Christie's]] |location=New York |work=Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Martin famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt the demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist [[Chryssa]] whom Martin had dated off and on throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Martin2018 /&gt; In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalised to control symptoms of schizophrenia which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia: on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan's [[Bellevue Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Martin2018 /&gt; After Martin left New York, she drove about the western US and Canada, deciding to settle in [[Cuba, New Mexico]] for a few years (1968-1977), then settled in [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] (1977-1993).&lt;ref name=MorrisBell /&gt;{{rp|240–242}} In both New Mexico homes, she built adobe brick structures herself.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt; She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events that brought other artists into the public eye.&lt;ref name=Martin2018 /&gt; She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a log cabin she would use as her studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bagley, Christopher |date=March 2008 |url=http://www.wmagazine.com/artdesign/2008/03/bill_katz |title=Perfect Vision |journal=[[W Magazine]] |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from 1975 they were exhibited regularly.

In 1976 she made her first film, ''[[Gabriel (1976 film)|Gabriel]]'', a 78-minute landscape film which features a little boy going for a walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Agnes Martin: Her Life and Art|last = Princenthal|first = Nancy|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson|year = 2015|isbn = 978 0 500 09390 0|location = London|pages = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second movie, ''Captivity'', was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town dump.&lt;ref name=Martin2018 /&gt;

According to a filmed interview with her which was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building's imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years. Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The [[Drawing Center]] (traveling to other museums as well) in 2005 – ''3x abstraction'' – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ew8pPV-59MC |title=3 X Abstraction: New Methods of Drawing, Hilma Af Klint, Emma Kunz, Agnes Martin |editor1=de Zegher, Catherine |editor2=Telcher, Hendel |year=2005 |work=The Drawing Center |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300108262 |quote=Published on the occasion of the exhibition 3 x abstraction: new methods of drawing by Hilma af Klint, Emma Kunz, and Agnes Martin ; Organized by the Drawing Center ; The Drawing Center, New York, NY, March 19-May 21, 2005, Santa Monica Museum of Art, Santa Monica, CA, June 10-August 13, 2005, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, January 24-March 26, 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 biography ''Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon'' was the first book to explore Martin's relationship with women and her early life in substantial detail and was written in collaboration with Martin's family and friends.

The Agnes Martin estate is represented by [[Pace Gallery]], New York.&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/290/agnes-martin/bio |title=Agnes Martin |publisher=Pace Gallery |location=New York |date=2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006234756/http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/290/agnes-martin/bio |archivedate=6 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic style==
In addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin's early works included biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and 1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her first steps into abstraction.&lt;ref name="Saved From the Artist's Fire"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PaceCircle /&gt;

Martin praised [[Mark Rothko]] for having "reached zero so that nothing could stand in the way of truth". Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5147467 |title=Agnes Martin, ''Untitled #1'' (1989) |publisher=[[Christie's]] |location=New York |work=Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early 1960s, she created 6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids.&lt;ref name="christies.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4978845 |title=Agnes Martin, ''Loving Love'' (2000) |publisher=[[Christie's]] |location=New York |work=Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1966 exhibition ''Systemic Painting'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], Martin's grids were therefore celebrated as examples of [[Minimalist art]] and were hung among works by artists including [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Robert Ryman]], and [[Donald Judd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=Systemic Painting: Catalogue for the Exhibition |author=Alloway, Lawrence |year=1966 |publisher=Guggenheim Museum |accessdate=October 6, 2015 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the artist's hand; she shied away from [[intellectualism]], favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially [[Taoism|Taoist]]. Because of her work's added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she preferred to be classified as an [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]].&lt;ref name=Stockholm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;

Martin worked only in black, white, and brown before moving to New Mexico. The last painting before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, ''Trumpet'', marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2003/022003Martin/press.html |title=Agnes Martin: Five Decades, February 20 – April 26, 2003 |publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery|Zwirner &amp; Wirth Gallery]] |location=New York |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, ''On a Clear Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=3556 |title=Agnes Martin 1912 - 2004  |publisher=National Gallery of Canada |location=Ottawa |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/introduction/89 |publisher=Dia Art Foundation |title=Exhibition: Agnes Martin long term view |location=New York |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044855/http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/introduction/89 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;72 square paintings to 60&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;60&amp;nbsp;inches&lt;ref name="Agnes Martin 1994"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=3918126 |title=Agnes Martin ''Untitled No. 4'' (1994) |publisher=[[Christie's]] |location=New York |work=Post War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale |date=May 14, 2002 |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/agnes-martin-1583 |title=Agnes Martin 1912–2004: Artist biography |work=Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists |author=Alley, Ronald |year=1981 |page=488 |location=London |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In ''Untitled No. 4'' (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic paint blended with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist.&lt;ref name="Agnes Martin 1994"/&gt; In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.

==Exhibitions==
Since her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin's work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and two retrospectives including the survey, ''Agnes Martin'', organized by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and ''Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1874–1900'' organized by the [[Stedelijk Museum]], Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, The [[New Mexico Museum of Art|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the [[Menil Collection]], Houston, mounted ''Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond''. That same year, the [[Harwood Museum of Art]] at the [[University of New Mexico]], Pandora, organized ''Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001'', as well as a symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.

In addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the [[Venice Biennale]] (1997, 1980, 1976), the [[Whitney Biennial]] (1995, 1977), and [[Documenta]], Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women's Caucus for Art of the [[College Art Association]] (2005); Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1992);&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor [[Gary Johnson]], Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the [[National Medal of Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#98 Lifetime Honors – National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}, ''nea.gov''.

At the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]], Martin was featured in the exhibition ''Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014'' which examined the two generations of [[Minimalism|Minimalist]] art side-by-side, from October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included [[Anne Truitt]], [[Mary Corse]], and contemporary artists [[Shirazeh Houshiary]] and [[Tomma Abts]].

She was also featured in ''White on the White: Color, Scene, and Space'' in [[Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art]]. From October 2015 through April 2016, Martin was exhibited in ''Opening the Box: Unpacking Minimalism'' at The George Economou Collection in Athens, Greece alongside [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]].  From 2015 to 2017 she had numerous solo exhibitions, some being at the [[Aspen Art Museum]] in Aspen Colorado, [[Tate Modern]] in London, [[K20 Center|K20,]] [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|Kunstsammlung Nordhein-Westfalen]] in Dusseldorf, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA) in Los Angeles, [[Solomon R.

==Legacy==
Martin became an inspiration to younger artists, from [[Eva Hesse]] to [[Ellen Gallagher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Holland Cotter |date=December 17, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/arts/design/17martin.html |title=Agnes Martin, Abstract Painter, Dies at 92 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Harwood Museum of Art]] in Taos, part of the [[University of New Mexico]], announced that it would renovate its Pueblo-revival building and dedicate one wing to Martin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (September 23, 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/23/arts/inside-art.html The Agnes Martin Wing] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery was designed according to the artist's wishes in order to accommodate Martin's gift of seven large untitled paintings made between 1993 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harwoodmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/59 |title=Agnes Martin Gallery, The Harwood Museum of Art, University of New Mexico |location=Taos, NM |publisher=HarwoodMuseum.org |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Albuquerque architectural firm, Kells &amp; Craig, designed the octagonal gallery with an [[oculus]] installed overhead, and four yellow [[Donald Judd]] benches placed directly under the oculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harwoodmuseum.org/about/faqs |title=Can you help me understand the Agnes Martin Gallery? |publisher=Harwood Museum of Art |location=Taos, NM |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kellsandcraig.com/Projects_Base.html |title=Harwood Museum |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |work=Kells + Craig Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gift of the paintings and gallery's design and construction were negotiated and overseen by [[Robert M. Ellis]], the Harwood's director at the time and a close friend of Martin's. Today, the Agnes Martin Gallery attracts visitors from all over the world and has been compared by scholars to the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]] (Matisse Chapel), Corbusier's [[Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut]] in Ronchamp, and the [[Rothko Chapel]] in Houston.

==In popular culture==
Composer [[John Zorn]]'s ''[[Redbird (John Zorn album)|Redbird]]'' (1995) was inspired by and dedicated to Martin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tzadik.com/index.php?catalog=7008 Tzadik catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy Beckett]], in her book ''American Masterpieces,'' said about Martin: "Agnes Martin often speaks of joy; she sees it as the desired condition of all life. Who would disagree with her?... No-one who has seriously spent time before an Agnes Martin, letting its peace communicate itself, receiving its inexplicable and ineffable happiness, has ever been disappointed. The work awes, not just with its delicacy, but with its vigor, and this power and visual interest is something that has to be experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Sister Wendy's American Masterpieces |last=Beckett |first= Wendy |publisher=DK  |edition=1st American |year=2000 |isbn=978-0789459589 |location=Mishawaka, Indiana, U.S.A.|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet Hugh Behm-Steinberg's poem "Gridding, after some sentences by Agnes Martin" discusses patterns in the natural world, makes a parallel between writing and painting, and ends with a line about the poet's admiration of Martin's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behm-Steinberg |first1=Hugh |year=2008 |title=Three Poems  |journal=EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts |volume= |issue=4 |pages= |publisher=Charles Alexander |doi= |url=http://chax.org/eoagh/issuefour/behm-steinberg.html |accessdate=March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work inspired a [[Google doodle]] on the 102nd anniversary of her birth on March 22, 2014. The doodle takes color cues from Agnes Martin's late work which is marked by soft edges, muted colors and distinctly horizontal bands, turned to six vertical bars, one for each letter of the Google logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- this link is not found |url=http://imgace.com/pic/tag/agnes-martin-google-doodle-march-22/ --&gt; |title=Agnes Martin: To celebrate the great painter, Google Doodle offers meditative muted beauty |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/03/22/agnes-martin-to-celebrate-the-great-painter-google-doodle-offers-meditative-muted-beauty/ |author=Michael Cavna |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Screaming Females]], a New Jersey-based punk band, released a track titled after the late artist in their album [[All at Once (Screaming Females album)|All at Once]].

=== Research ===
Johnson focuses on understanding the differences in molecular signature of immune cells across [[tumours]]. He uses large cancer datasets to identify, characterize and model [[immune system]] across different tumour types. He developed ''ImSig'', the network-based computational framework that facilitates the characterization of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nirmal|first=Ajit J.|last2=Regan|first2=Tim|last3=Shih|first3=Barbara B.|last4=Hume|first4=David A.|last5=Sims|first5=Andrew H.|last6=Freeman|first6=Tom C.|date=2018-09-28|title=Immune Cell Gene Signatures for Profiling the Microenvironment of Solid Tumors|url=http://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/10/22/2326-6066.CIR-18-0342|journal=Cancer Immunology Research|language=en|doi=10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0342|issn=2326-6066|pmid=30266715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nirmal|first=Ajit Johnson|title=imsig: Immune Cell Gene Signatures for Profiling the Microenvironment of Solid Tumours|date=2018-07-10|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=imsig|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work involves an extensive degree of both experimental and computational based analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ImSig: Conserved immune cell signature for [[deconvolution]] of complex blood and tissue transcriptomic data|journal=F1000Research|date=2015|issue=4(ISCB Comm J):394|pages=|doi=10.7490/f1000research.1110149.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Edinburgh Group Pages|url=http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/tom-freeman/group-members/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2080">'''Alexander Vargo''' (Russian: Александр Варго) is an official pseudonym used by group of [[Russia]]n [[horror fiction|horror]] writers whose books are published by [[Eksmo]] publishing house in the Myst (Black Book) series.

==History==

Vargo's first novel, The Cook (Russian: Кулинар), was released in 2003. For several years readers thought that Alexander Vargo was a real author, but soon a rumor appeared that a whole group of writers was standing behind this name.
The rumor was proved true in the beginning of 2011 when [[Darker magazine]] released an interview with a few authors of the "Vargo"-team and they confirmed that the real Alexander Vargo never existed and the series was just a publisher's project .{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The name of the original "Vargo"-writer is [[Sergey Dyomin]] (Russian: Сергей Дёмин). Several of "Vargo's" books were also written by [[Igor Isaichev]] and [[Alexei Sholokhov]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1247">'''Alija Gušanac''' ("Alija from Gusinje"; {{floruit}} 1804–05), known in epic poetry as '''Gušanac-Alija''', was an Ottoman [[brigand]] (''krdžalija'') that served the ''[[Dahije]]'', the renegade [[Janissaries]] that had taken the rule of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] following a coup. He was from [[Gusinje]], hence his byname. At the start of the Serbian uprising against the Dahije (1804), Gušanac was in [[Jagodina]]. He was subsequently appointed commander of Belgrade by the Dahije.

'''Costantino Borsini''' (April 7, 1906 in [[Milan]] – October 21, 1940 in Eritrean [[Red sea]]) was an [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] naval officer during [[World War II]]. He received the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] for his actions in command of the  destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'' in the [[Attack on Convoy BN 7]] in October 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/medaglie/Pagine/CostantinoBorsini.aspx Italian Navy web page on Costantino Borsini)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Borsini was born in Milan in 1906. He was a top student at the Naval Academy of [[Livorno]] from March 15, 1922 to November 15, 1926. There he graduated as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]], before embarking on the battleship [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']]. He was then transferred to the battleship [[Italian battleship Andrea Doria|''Andrea Doria'']] and later served in succession on the hydrographic ship ''Ammiraglio Magnaghi'', the destroyer ''Augusto Riboty'', the destroyer ''Giovanni Da Verrazzano'' (after promotion to [[Sub-Lieutenant]] on 1 January 1929) and again on ''Giulio Cesare'', being promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in July 1932.

In 1933 he joined the Italian Naval Detachment in [[Italian concession of Tientsin|Tianjin (China)]]. At his return to Italy he attended the course in [[Taranto]] as "Aircraft Observer" (naval officer attached to [[Regia Aeronautica]] aircraft employed against shipping) and in 1935 he received his patent; he subsequently served for one year as member of the 153rd Seaplane Squadron.

He was then transferred to the [[submarine]] branch till 1937, when he became [[executive officer]] on the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Nembo|1927|2}}, after which he was given command of the [[torpedo boat]] ''Clio''.

In January 1940 he was embarked on the colonial ship [[Eritrea (ship)|''Eritrea'']], stationed in the Eritrean Red Sea at [[Massawa]], and in May of that year he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]] and was given command of the destroyer  ''Francesco Nullo'', operating in the Red Sea.

On October 21, following the unsuccessful [[attack on convoy BN 7]], Borsini fought a fierce battle off [[Harmil]] island against [[HMS Kimberley (F50)|HMS ''Kimberley'']]. In the battle, ''Nullo'' was seriously damaged, and Borsini brought his ship toward an Italian coastal battery so that its guns could hit ''Kimberley''.

When ''Nullo'' started to sink, Borsini ordered the crew to save themselves, and decided to go down with his ship while at his command post. His orderly, [[seaman]] Vincenzo Ciaravolo, went back on board the sinking ship to reach his commander, and both went down with the ship. Both posthumously were awarded the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]]. The attacking British destroyer ''Kimberley'' was hit by the Italian batteries and remained in repair until spring 1941.

== Battle of Harmil Island ==
{{main article|Attack on convoy BN 7}}
After the first minutes of combat against the British convoy BN 7, ''Francesco Nullo'' manoeuvred so as to attack again the convoy before following the destroyer ''Pantera'' toward [[Massawa]], but ''Nullo''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s rudder jammed for several minutes, and the two ships lost contact with each other. Borsini, chased by the incoming British warships, decided to approach the Italian batteries on Harmil island, hoping that they could hit the attacking enemy vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mar-rosso.it/gazzettino/736/Eritrea/Navi%20Sommerse/Francesco%20Nullo History of the destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'' (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-melecatragedia.pdf Battle of Harmil (in Italian)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191340/https://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-melecatragedia.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 02:20 British light cruiser ''Leander'' spotted ''Nullo'', and engaged her at a range of 4600 yards.  The ships dueled for around ten minutes.  ''Leander'' scored several hits, damaging ''Nullo''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[gyrocompass]] and gunnery director.  ''Nullo'' withdrew toward Harmil island and ''Leander'' pursued.  Destroyer ''Kimberley'' joined the pursuit at 0300.  At 0305 ''Leander'' turned back for the convoy.

At 05:40 on 21 October, ''Kimberley'' was off [[Harmil|Harmil Island]] when her lookouts spotted ''Nullo''.  ''Nullo'' spotted ''Kimberley'' around the same time, but Borsini assumed that the approaching destroyer was sistership ''Sauro''.  ''Kimberley'' opened fire at 05:53, catching ''Nullo'' by surprise.  ''Nullo'' returned fire four minutes later, and at 06:15 the four [[120 mm Italian naval gun|Italian 120 mm guns]] on Harmil Island joined the action.

At around 06:25 ''Nullo'' was hit by two shells from ''Kimberley'', one each in the forward and aft engine rooms.  ''Nullo'' lost all power.  Borsini gave the order to abandon ship and steered the ship towards Harmil, attempting to run it aground. He decided to sink with his ship. Borsini and his orderly Ciaravolo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/DettaglioOnorificenze.aspx?decorato=14240 Italian Navy web page on Vincenzo Ciaravolo]&lt;/ref&gt; who decided to die with him, were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor by the Italian Navy.

''Kimberley'' fired two torpedoes at ''Nullo''.  The second of these, at 06:35, tore ''Nullo'' in two.  The Harmil battery then found the range and landed a shell on ''Kimberley''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s engine room, causing the ship to lose power.  ''Kimberley'' fired at the shore battery while the crew frantically repaired the damage.  Finally, ''Kimberley''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s power was restored, and the ship managed to get out of range of the Harmil battery before losing power again and later be towed to safety in [[Port Sudan]].

Of the 204 members of ''Nullo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s crew, 190 survived and were rescued by personnel of the Harmil battery, while 12 perished in combat and two (Lieutenant Commander Borsini and his orderly Ciaravolo) voluntarily sank with the ship. The Italian Royal Navy, fearing that such attitude would cause the loss of too many experienced commanders (two more Italian navy commanders - [[Enrico Baroni]] of destroyer ''Espero'' and Lorenzo Bezzi of submarine ''[[Italian submarine Console Generale Liuzzi|Liuzzi]]'' - had already done so in the few months of war since Italy declared war to the Allies in June 1940), emitted on the next week an informal 'instruction' discouraging such actions (to little avail, as such episodes happened again several times during the war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://conlapelleappesaaunchiodo.blogspot.com/2014/10/francesco-nullo.html History of ''Francesco Nullo'' (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3716">'''D. Jacob Davies''' (15 September 1916 &amp;ndash; 11 February 1974) was a Welsh [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister who became a prominent figure within Welsh public life and within his denomination in Wales and beyond.{{sfn|Evans|1983}}

==Early life==
Jacob Davies was born on 15 September 1916 at Penlon, [[Tregroes]], near [[Llandysul]], one of the five children of o David and Mary Davies.{{sfn|Evans|1983}} He was educated at Tregroes Primary School before earning a scholarship to [[Llandysul Grammar School]] in 1929, where he remained until 1936.{{sfn|Evans|1983}} He then became a student at [[List of dissenting academies (1660–1800)|Carmarthen Presbyterian College]] to prepare for the Unitarian ministry. After some years in Carmarthen he became minister of the Capel Bach, the Unitarian chapel in [[Aberystwyth]], where he enrolled as a student at the [[Aberystwyth University|University]] and graduated in 1945.{{sfn|Evans|1983}}
[[File:D.Jacob Davies.B.A. - geograph.org.uk - 1344833.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Jacob Davies at his childhood home]]

==Hen-Dy-Cwrdd==
Although Davies had intended to study for an MA degree, he received a call to minister the Unitarian churches at Highland Place, [[Aberdare]] and [[Hen-Dy-Cwrdd]], Trecynon. The latter was the oldest nonconformist place of worship in the Aberdare Valley.{{sfn|Jones|2004|pp=128-9}} As well as his duties as a minister, Davies played a wider role in the life of Aberdare, including supporting the movement to establish a Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Aberdar.{{sfn|Evans|1983}}

==Return to Cardiganshire==
In 1957, Jacob Davies returned to his native area to minister the three Unitarian churches at [[Alltyblacca]]; Capel y Bryn, Cwrtnewydd and Cwmsychbant. He remained there until his death in 1974.

Davies was an active broadcaster, writer and journalist, and edited the Unitarian journal, ''Yr Ymofynnydd''. He was an active campaigner for pensioners' rights and the ''Pensioner of Wales'' from 1955 until 1973. He was in demand to preside at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] and the [[Llangollen International Eisteddfod]].{{sfn|Evans|1983}} Politically, Davies supported Plaid Cymru, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the inaugural [[Dyfed County Council]] election in [[Dyfed County Council election, 1973|1973]]. He finished fourth with 21% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Dyfed PlymEC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyfed County Council Election Results 1973-1993|url=http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dyfed-County-1973-1993.pdf|publisher=The Elections Centre, Plymouth University|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with these various activities, Davies was prominent in his denomination beyond Wales and at the time of his death was President of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|General Unitarian Assembly]].

==Death==
Davies died suddenly on 11 February 1974. He was buried four days later at Bwlchydadfa Cemetery, [[Talgarreg]].{{sfn|Evans|1983}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">'''Dana and Virginia Lamb''' were American travel writers.

'''Dana Upton Lamb''' was born in Tustin, California, on January 18, 1901 to John
Charles Lamb and Emma Mary Holderman Lamb. J. C. Lamb served as the Orange County
Tax Collector for thirty-three years and also raised groves of oranges, lemons and avocados.
A 1923 graduate of Santa Ana High School, Dana joined the crews of the steamer W. M. Irish
and the S. S. Carenco, traveling to the Eastern United States and Morocco, Egypt, Greece,
Italy, Cyprus and Syria in 1924-1925. Active in the Boy Scouts at an early age, Dana Lamb
served as field executive for the Orange County Council and as assistant scout executive,
Greater Providence Council, Rhode Island, from 1926-1927. He also served as chief of the
Laguna Beach lifeguard service, which likely provided him with the training and expertise to
begin the Orange County Coast Patrol in the late 1930s.

'''Virginia Marshall Bishop (later Ginger Lamb)''' was born in Santa Ana, CA, to
watchmaker-optometrist Vernon M. Bishop and Nancy Cutler Bishop on September 22, 1912.
The family moved to El Centro, California, shortly following Ginger’s birth but returned to
Santa Ana sometime around 1921. She graduated from Santa Ana High School in 1930.

Dana and Ginger married February 19, 1933. In August, they embarked on what
became a three-year, 16,000 mile voyage in their homemade, sixteen-foot canoe, the
Vagabunda, from Southern California down the Pacific coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and
Costa Rica, and culminated in their crossing of the Panama Canal in September 1936. They
chronicled their adventures in a book, Enchanted Vagabonds (1938), and went on the lecture
circuit to capitalize on the great public interest in their journey and lives as adventurers. They
continued their travels in Mexico and Central America during the 1940s, during which time
they did some research for the Federal Government as special agents and produced a
substantial report titled Report on Mexico in 1943. Their second book, Quest for the Lost City
(1951), detailed their continued adventures in the 1940s and was the basis for a feature-length
film of the same name produced by Sol Lesser and released by RKO Pictures in 1954. 
The Lambs visited several known Maya sites in the area, including [[Bonampak]], [[Palenque]] and [[Yaxchilan]] during their "quest". The Lambs also spent time with the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] Maya of eastern Chiapas. More controversially, the Lambs claim to have discovered their "lost city", which they named "Lashch-Tu-Nich", meaning "place of carved stones" in the Mayan language. Several of the photographs in the book depict the Lambs standing with overgrown ruins. These ruins have never been identified. A Mayan site named Laxtunich is known to have been a subsidiary site of Yaxchilan,&lt;ref&gt;David Drew, ''The lost chronicles of the Maya kings'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of California Press, 1999) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; in Chiapas, and has possibly been identified as the archaeological site at Tecolote,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, ''Chronicle of the Maya kings and queens: Deciphering the dynasties of the ancient Maya'' (New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; though it is of course unknown whether this is the site the Lambs visited. Most professional archaeologists and fellow explorers discount the Lambs' story of the Lost City and the "Golden Books of the Maya" as being largely fabricated.

Having made the seaside village of Corona del Mar their home base during their years
of adventure travel, the growing population explosion in Orange County in the postwar era
prompted the Lambs to move to the former mining town of Hillsboro, in the southwestern
mountains of New Mexico, in 1962. The Lambs continued to camp and explore Baja
California and deliver the occasional lecture, until Ginger Lamb died on February 25,
1967. The ensuing years for Dana Lamb were not idle, as he had to deal with the
ramifications of a disastrous flood in Hillsboro in September 1972 and traveled to Micronesia
in 1975-1976 before his death on June 11, 1979.

A large collection of the Lamb's writings, artifacts, movies, photos, etc. has been amassed at The Sherman Library in Corona Del Mar, California (http://www.slgardens.org/)

The canoe (Vagabunda) used in their Enchanted Vagabonds adventures is on display in the lobby of the Adventurers' Club of Los Angeles (http://www.adventurersclub.org/About.htm.)

[[File:Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-Périgord_by_François_Gérard,_1808.jpg|thumb|[[France|French]] diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] is considered one of the most skilled diplomats of all time.]]
A '''diplomat''' is a person appointed by a [[state (polity)|state]] to conduct [[diplomacy]] with one or more other states or [[international organization]]s. The main functions of diplomats are: representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending state; initiation and facilitation of strategic agreements; treaties and conventions; promotion of information; trade and commerce; technology; and friendly relations. Seasoned diplomats of international repute are used in international organizations (for example, the [[United Nations]], the world's largest international diplomatic organization) as well as multinational companies for their experience in management and [[Negotiation|negotiating]] skills. Diplomats are members of foreign services and diplomatic corps of various nations of the world.

Diplomats are the oldest form of any of the [[foreign policy]] institutions of the state, predating by centuries [[foreign minister]]s and ministerial offices. They usually have [[diplomatic immunity]].

==Terminology==
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|The [[headquarters]] of the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]], the world's largest international diplomatic organization.]]
The regular use of permanent diplomatic representation began between the states of [[fifteenth century]] Italy. However the terms ‘diplomacy’ and ‘diplomat’ appeared in the French Revolution. ''Diplomat'' is derived from the Greek διπλωμάτης (''diplōmátēs''), the holder of a [[diploma]], referring to diplomats' documents of [[Diplomatic accreditation|accreditation]] from their sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Anderson, ''The Rise of Modern Diplomacy, 1450–1919'' (1993), pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomats themselves and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d’Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstraße (Berlin); and Foggy Bottom (Washington). For imperial Russia to 1917 it was the Choristers’ Bridge (St Petersburg). The Italian ministry was called "the Consulta."&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, "The Diplomats" in Jay Winter, ed. ''The Cambridge History of the First World War: Volume II: The State'' (2014) vol 2 p 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career diplomats and political appointees ==
Though any person can be appointed by the state's national government to conduct said state's relations with other states or international organisations, a number of states maintain an institutionalised group of career diplomats—that is, public servants with a steady professional connection to the country's [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]]. The term ''career diplomat'' is used worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independentdiplomat.org/about-us/our-staff/paul-whiteway |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121044208/http://www.independentdiplomat.org/about-us/our-staff/paul-whiteway |archivedate=2015-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-11/25/c_133811052.htm|title=Career diplomat Aurescu becomes Romanian new FM|work=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=18 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822120941/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-11/25/c_133811052.htm|archive-date=22 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/john-f-tefft-a-career-diplomat-will-go-to-russia.html|title=John F.

[[Figurehead|Ceremonial heads of state]] commonly act as diplomats on behalf of their nation, usually following instructions from their head of Government.

==Diplomatic ranks==
{{main|Diplomatic rank}}

Whether being a career diplomat or a political appointee, every diplomat, while posted abroad, will be classified in one of the ranks of diplomats (secretary, counselor, minister, [[ambassador]], [[Diplomacy|envoy]], or ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'') as regulated by international law (namely, by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961).

Diplomats can be contrasted with [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] and [[attaché]]s, who represent their state in a number of administrative ways, but who don't have the diplomat's political functions.

== Function ==
Diplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home-country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country's capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, of trying to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home-country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which [[foreign policy]] develops.

In general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Diplomats have to seize secure communication systems, emails, and mobile telephones can be tracked down and instruct the most reclusive head of mission. The same technology in reverse gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.

[[Email encryption|Secure email]] has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to leak, and enables more personal contact than the formal [[Telegraphy|cablegram]], with its wide distribution and impersonal style.

=== Advocacy ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics – who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done - are for the diplomats overseas to make.

In this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding, and energy of individual diplomats become critical. If competent, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and [[culture]] of the other side.

=== Negotiation ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The diplomat should be an excellent negotiator but, above all, a catalyst for peace and understanding between peoples. The diplomat's principal role is to foster peaceful relations between states. This role takes on heightened importance if war breaks out. Negotiation must necessarily continue – but within significantly altered contexts.

== Training ==
Most career diplomats have [[university]] [[academic degree|degrees]] in [[international relations]], [[political science]], [[economics]], or [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Seldowitz, "The Psychology of Diplomatic Conflict Resolution", in H. J. Langholtz and C. E.Stout, Eds. ''The Psychology of Diplomacy'' (Westport: Praeger, 2004), pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and public image ==
Diplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as "a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party".&lt;ref&gt;Allan Gyngell and Michael Wesley, ''Making Australian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; J. W. Burton has noted that "despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote."&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Burton, ''Systems, States, Diplomacy and Rules'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The state supports the high status, privileges, and [[self-esteem]] of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.

The high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries' conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionalism and ability to behave according to a certain [[etiquette]], in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, [[international law]] grants diplomats extensive privileges and [[diplomatic immunity|immunities]], which further distinguishes the diplomat from the status of an ordinary [[citizen]].

== Psychology and loyalty ==
{{Further|Clientitis}}

While posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir [[Harold Nicolson]] acknowledged that diplomats can become "denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk".&lt;ref&gt;Harold Nicolson, ''The Evolution of Diplomacy'' (New York: Collier, 1962) at 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Day of Diplomats==
Diplomats have started celebrating [[International Day of Diplomats]] on October 24 since 2017. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/first-international-day-of-diplomats-celebrated-in-brasilia-117102500158_1.html First International Day of Diplomats celebrated in Brasilia ] Business Standard, October 25, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; The idea of celebrating International Day of Diplomats on the day the [[United Nations]] was founded was proposed by Indian diplomat [[Abhay K]] to mark the occasion as diplomacy becoming the principal means of resolving disputes. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailyo.in/voices/ifs-indian-foreign-service-diplomats-diplomacy-united-nations/story/1/20024.html Why the world needs International Day of Diplomats, our everyday peacekeepers] Daily O, 12 October, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Francis Jemison''' (December 1, 1844 – July 1, 1862) was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier who served in Company C, 2d Louisiana Infantry, from May 1861 until he was [[killed in action|killed]] at the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[:File:Edwin_Francis_Jemison_obituary.jpg|Obituary: Edwin Francis Jemison]] |work=Southern Recorder|date=5 Aug 1862|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
Jemison enlisted on May 11, 1861, and was among the war's early [[Military volunteer|volunteer]]s.&lt;ref name=exploresouthernhistory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Dale|title=Best Known Confederate Soldier|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/jemison.html|website=ExploreSouthernHistory|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] under Maj.

==Killed in action==
Jemison was killed on July 1, 1862, at the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]], reportedly by a direct hit from a [[Round shot|cannonball]] which decapitated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Jones |first=Terry L. |title=The Louisiana Journey |publisher=Gibbs Smith |year=2006 |page=193 |isbn=1423601300 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4p-eFL6oMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=editions%3AIiZyDqsYvvMC&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=William J.|title=The Two Pictures of Private Jemison|journal=America's Civil War|date=May 2004|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death by cannon fire is corroborated by the 1887 obituary of his younger brother, Sam, but incorrectly identifies the battle as [[First Manassas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End of a Brilliant Lawyer|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2875546/obituary_of_samuel_hunter_jemison/|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=The Ouachita Telegraph|date=1 Jan 1887|quote=the second was killed, with his messmate, by a cannon shot at the first battle of Manassas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Battle of Malvern Hill, both sides buried their dead on the battlefield. After the [[American Civil War]], organizations like the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] returned to the old battlefields and disinterred the bodies of fallen Confederate soldiers and gave them proper burials in places like the Confederate Section of [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]] in nearby [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]].

'''Eliza Capot, Comtesse de Feuillide''' (née '''Hancock'''; 22 December 1761&amp;nbsp;– 25 April 1813) was the cousin, and later sister-in-law, of novelist [[Jane Austen]]. She is believed to have been inspirational for a number of Austen's works, such as ''[[Love and {{notatypo|Freindship}}]]''&lt;!--well-known misspelling-do not alter--&gt;, ''Henry and Eliza'', [[Lady Susan]] and [[Mansfield Park]]. She may have also been the model from whom the character of [[Mary Crawford (Mansfield Park)|Mary Crawford]] is derived.

==Biography==

===Background===

Eliza was born in India into an English [[gentry]] family. She was fourteen years older than her first cousin [[Jane Austen]]. She was the daughter of George Austen's sister Philadelphia, who had gone to India to marry Tysoe Saul Hancock in 1753,&lt;!--Can't remember what this is: reference? Page? [[Cambridge introduction to Jane Austen by Janet Todd, Cambridge University Press.]]--&gt; and has been believed by some to be the natural child of her godfather [[Warren Hastings]], later to be the first Governor-General of Bengal.&lt;ref Name="Poplawski 156"/&gt; This belief was due to rumours circulated at the time by Jenny Strachey, and many elements show that Eliza was indeed the daughter of Tysoe Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Le Faye, 2002, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to England with her parents, in 1765. In 1779 she settled in France and two years later she married a wealthy French Army Captain, Jean-François Capot de Feuillide, who was a count ("comte"). Eliza thus became ''Comtesse de Feuillide''. She came back to England with her mother in 1790, after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]]. Her husband, who was loyal to the [[Kingdom of France|French monarchy]], was arrested for conspiracy against the [[French First Republic|Republic]] and guillotined in 1794.

Her first cousin [[Henry Thomas Austen]], brother of Jane Austen, then courted Eliza, and married her in December 1797; they had no children. Eliza's only son, Hastings (named after [[Warren Hastings]]), died in 1801.

Eliza died in April 1813, with Jane Austen at her bedside.  Eliza and Austen had been quite close ever since she arrived in England.  She is buried in the cemetery of [[St John-at-Hampstead]] in North London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/printed/number4/eliza-grave.htm Jane Austen Society of North America] Picture of gravestone of Eliza de Feuillide&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliza in Austen's works==

===''Juvenilia''===

; ''Love and Freindship'':
; ''[[Love and {{notatypo|Freindship}}]]'' {{sic}},&lt;!--well-known misspelling-do not alter--&gt; is inscribed as follows:
{{quote|''To Madame la Comtesse de Feuillide this novel is inscribed by her obliged humble servant The Author''.}}
In this [[epistolary novel]], Laura is writing to Marianne, the daughter of her most intimate friend, Isobel, ''comtesse de Feuillide''. Her vocabulary includes a few French words, and she writes ''Adeiu'' (sic) before her signature.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Austen was wont to take some liberty with the spelling of a few words in French as well as in English.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a letter from Eliza de Feuillide, the title of the novel had been derived by Jane Austen from the Latin phrase inscribed on the back of a miniature portrait given to cousin Phylly Walter by Eliza, ''Amoris et Amicitiae''.&lt;ref&gt;David Nokes, 1998, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Henry and Eliza'' :
Eliza and Henry Austen are generally considered to be pictured here. This would then be a direct hint to the flirtation between the two that took place in real life.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Austen, Margaret Anne Doody, Douglas Murray (1998) ''Catharine and other writings'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Henry and Eliza'', Eliza appears to be, if not a natural child—as Eliza Hancock quite possibly was—at least a foundling.

===''Lady Susan''===
C. L. Thomson believed that Eliza de Feuillide was the model from which glamorous, shrewd and calculating Lady Susan had been created.&lt;ref name="Southam 146"&gt;B. C. Southam, 1964, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Miss Thomson argued, in 1929, that the courtship that took place between Henry Austen and Eliza de Feuillide is reflected in the novel by the courtship of Reginald de Courcy and Lady Susan; similarly, the letters written by Lady Susan to Johnson have the very style and tone of Eliza's own letters to Phylly Walter; however, Southam categorically rejects any biographical connection.&lt;ref name="Southam 146"/&gt;

===In Austen's major novels===
; ''Mansfield Park'' :
It has often been said that flirtatious Eliza, with all her talent on stage, her vivacity and attractiveness, was the model for the character of [[Mary Crawford (Mansfield Park)|Mary Crawford]] in [[Mansfield Park]].&lt;ref Name="Poplawski 156"&gt;Paul Poplawski, 1998, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Several other similarities link the character of Mary Crawford with Eliza: just as the fictional character, Eliza Hancock had learned to ride, and played the [[harp]].&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Le Faye, [http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br192p16.html ''Jane Austen’s “Outlandish Cousin”: The Life and Letters of Eliza de Feuillide'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the theatricals that play such a role in ''Mansfield Park'' are reminiscent of the plays in which Eliza de Feuillide was the leading lady, ''The Wonder&amp;nbsp;– a woman keeps a secret'', by Susannah Centlivre, and ''The Chances'', a comedy by John Fletcher.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Poplawski, 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Austens' cousin Philadelphia Walter refused to come to [[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] with Eliza to take part in some of these plays, possibly because she disapproved of Eliza's behaviour: indeed, she had been visiting Eliza two months before, and came back with the memory of ''a dissipated life that [...] put me in mind that every woman is at heart a rake''.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Roberts, 1995, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Depuis 1782, les Austen prenaient plaisir à organiser des pièces de théâtre amateur, auxquelles participaient les membres de la famille. L'arrivée d'Eliza relance ces spectacles, car, douée d'un certain talent d'actrice, elle tient les principaux rôles féminins dans deux pièces, ''The Wonder&amp;nbsp;– a woman keeps a secret'' (''Quelle merveille ! Une femme qui garde un secret'') de Mrs Susannah Centlivre, et ''The Chances'' (''Le Hasard''), comédie de John Fletcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Paul Poplawski|1998|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
La petite troupe, formée des membres de la famille Austen et de quelques voisins, se produit dans la grange l'été, et dans la maison pour les spectacles de Noël.&lt;ref&gt;B. C. Southam, ''Jane Austen's Literary Manuscripts'', 2006, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Augustus Lathrop''' (22 June 1849 – 18 October 1909) was an [[Americans|American]] artist.

==Biography==
He was born at sea, near the [[Hawaiian Islands]], being a great grandson of [[Samuel Holden Parsons]] and the son of [[George Alfred Lathrop]] (1819–1877), who for some time was United States consul at [[Honolulu]]. He was a pupil of [[T. C. Farrar]] in [[New York City|New York]], and studied at the Royal Academy of [[Dresden]]. After four months of study in Dresden, at the recommendation of [[James Whistler]] he went to [[London]] to study with that artist.  However, on arriving there, he was recalled to New York to help deal with family financial problems. He gave drawing lessons for a year, and, the family's financial situation having improved, he returned to London to study with Whistler.  He felt neglected by this master, however, and soon moved on.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Lathrop, Francis Augustus|year=1933|author=William Howe Downes}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1870 to 1873, he studied under [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[Edward Coley Burne-Jones]] in [[England]], and worked in the school of [[William Morris]], where he devoted particular attention to [[stained glass]].

His family's financial situation again recalled him to New York in 1873.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He taught painting at [[Cooper Union|Cooper Institute]],&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; became known as an illustrator, painted portraits, designed stained glass, and subsequently confined himself to decorative work. He designed the chancel of [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and decorated the interior of [[Bowdoin College]] chapel, at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and several churches in New York. The Marquand memorial window, in the former Marquand chapel at [[Princeton, New Jersey]] (destroyed 1920), was an example of his work in stained glass. His last work was a series of medallions for the building of the Hispanic-American Society in New York. He was one of the charter members of the [[Society of American Artists]], and became an associate of the [[National Academy of Design]], New York. He died at his home in [[Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey]], on 18 October 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcBBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA399#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=American Art Annual, Volume 8 | publisher=MacMillan Company | year=1911 | pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a graduate of the [[University of Illinois]] where he received his B.S.M.E. degree in 1919 and his M.S.M.E. degree in 1921.  He left college in 1918 to serve in the infantry of the [[U.S. Army]].  While at Illinois he was a member of [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity.

He became a research assistant for [[Union Carbide]] in 1923, then headed its plant in [[Buffalo, New York]].  He then moved to [[New York City]] in 1925 to serve as an engineer for Union Carbide.  He served at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] from 1942 to 1946 in the [[Manhattan Project]] as a chemical and nuclear engineer, under the command of [[Kenneth Nichols]].  In 1944 he was appointed president of Union Carbide and served until he retired in February 1962.&lt;ref name = Emerald1962/&gt;

'''Georgios Stavros''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Σταύρος}}, 1788–1869) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] banker, benefactor and revolutionary. He was one of the founders and the first governor of the [[National Bank of Greece]].

==Early years==
Stavros was born in [[Ioannina]], [[Epirus]], a major intellectual center of the Greek world then under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. He studied in renowned schools of his home town, such as the Balaneios and then the [[Kaplaneios School|Kaplaneios]], under [[Athanasios Psalidas]]. Stavros, later moved to [[Vienna]] in order to take over the commercial business of his father, while studying at the local business school.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgios Stavros |url=http://ha.nbg.gr/en/exhibitions/En_2/1.html |publisher=National Bank of Greece - Historical Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221350/http://ha.nbg.gr/en/exhibitions/En_2/1.html |archivedate=2014-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his profession he had to travel in various European cities. In [[Saint Petersburg]], he met [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], that time a diplomat in the service of the [[Russian Empire]], that would play a key role in the Greek politics the following years. Stavros soon became a member of the patriotic organization [[Filiki Eteria]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

==Greek War of Independence==
Shortly after the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821) he supported the uprising by supplying the revolutionaries with firearms, ammunition and food.&lt;ref name=nbg/&gt; In 1824 Stavros moved to Greece and the next year he was appointed Chief Cashier of the Executive body of the [[First Hellenic Republic]], under [[Georgios Kountouriotis]]. Apart from his financial duties, he joined the armed struggle against the Ottoman Empire by leading an infantry group against [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]]. He held the rank of ''Chiliarchos'' and was in charge of 50 men in central Greece, in order to support the defenders of [[Missolonghi]] during its [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|Third Siege]].&lt;ref name=nbg&gt;{{cite web|last=Νοταράς |first=Γεράσιμος |title=Ο Ηπειρώτης Γεώργιος Σταύρος |url=http://ha.nbg.gr/pdf/ioannina_stavrou.pdf |publisher=Ιστορικό Αρχείο Εθνικής Τράπεζας της Ελλάδος |accessdate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515152301/http://ha.nbg.gr/pdf/ioannina_stavrou.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stavros participated in the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen]] (1827) as representative of the regions of [[Epirus]] and [[Central Greece]], as well as in the [[Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion]] (1831), as representative of Epirus.&lt;ref name=nbg/&gt;

==After Independence and restoration of the Greek economy==
[[File:Banknote national-bank-greece 1926.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Georgios Stavros on the 1926 Greek 10 drachma banknote]]

During Kapodistrias' premiership (1828–1831), he participated in the three-member Economic Committee that was responsible for the operation of the first state bank of Greece, the ''National Financial Bank'' ({{lang-el|Εθνική Χρηματιστική Τράπεζα}}), which issued money, the [[Greek phoenix|Phoenix]], and securities.&lt;ref name=nbg/&gt;

After the assassination of Kapodistrias, Greece came under the rule of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]. During this period Stavros, became a key figure in the establishment of the [[National Bank of Greece]] and was its first governor, elected in 1842.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; The National Bank of Greece was the sole institution that would issue banknotes in Greece ([[Drachmas]]) for the next 87 years.&lt;ref name=nbg/&gt; Until his death, Stavros laid the foundations for the organization and expansion of the Bank, due to experience gained from his business in Vienna as well as the guidance offered by the Swiss banker, [[Jean-Gabriel Eynard]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; Stavros remained in this post until his death in 1869.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

At his own expense, Stavros established an orphanage in his home town of [[Ioannina]].
His portrait is displayed on various pre-1932 Greek banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Numismatist, Vol. 100|year=1987|publisher=American Numismatic Association|pages=1206|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=JcoVT5a_MIXqObmx9IAD&amp;hl=el&amp;id=IGJmAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22george+Stavros%22+bank&amp;q=%22george+Stavros%22#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athelstan II Guthrum Viking king of East Anglia 880.png|thumb|Coin ]]
'''Guthrum''' or '''Guðrum''' (died c. 890), christened '''Æthelstan''' on his conversion to Christianity in 878, was King of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]] in the [[Danelaw]]. He is mainly known for his conflict with [[Alfred the Great]].

==Guthrum, founder of the Danelaw==
It is not known how Guthrum consolidated his rule as king over the other Danish chieftains of the [[Danelaw]] (Danish-ruled territory of England), but by 874 he was able to wage a war against [[Wessex]] and its King, Alfred.

In 875, the Danish forces, then under Guthrum and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], divided, Halfdan's contingent returning north to Northumbria, while Guthrum's forces went to East Anglia, quartering themselves at [[Cambridge]] for the year.

By 876, Guthrum had acquired various parts of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] and then turned his attention to acquiring Wessex, where his first confrontation with Alfred took place on the south coast. Guthrum sailed his army around [[Poole Harbour]] and linked up with another Viking army that was invading the area between the [[River Frome, Dorset|Frome]] and [[River Piddle|Piddle]] rivers which was ruled by Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, M. A. and Powell, F. Y. ''Scandinavian Britain'' (New York: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1908), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[Asser]], Guthrum won his initial battle with Alfred, and he captured the ''[[castellum]]'' as well as the ancient square earthworks known as the Wareham, where there was a convent of nuns.

Alfred successfully brokered a peace settlement, but by 877 this peace was broken as Guthrum led his army raiding further into Wessex, thus forcing Alfred to confront him in a series of skirmishes that Guthrum continued to win. At Exeter, which Guthrum had also captured, Alfred made a peace treaty, with the result that Guthrum left Wessex to winter in Gloucester.

==Surprise attack==
[[File:KENT-338E94. Early Medieval silver coin, penny of Aethelstan II Guthran. (FindID 132251).jpg|thumb|Silver penny of Æthelstan]]

On Epiphany, 6 January 878, Guthrum made a surprise night-time attack on Alfred and his court at [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. It being a Christian feast day the Saxons were presumably taken by surprise—indeed it is possible that Wulfhere, the [[Ealdorman]] of Wiltshire, allowed the attack either through negligence or intent, for on Alfred's return to power later in 878 Wulfhere was stripped of his role as Ealdorman.

Alfred fled the attack with a few retainers and took shelter in the marshes of Somerset, staying in the small village of [[Athelney]]. Over the next few months he built up his force and waged a guerrilla war against Guthrum from his fastness in the fens. After a few months Alfred called his loyal men to Egbert's Stone, and from there they travelled to Edington to fight the invaders.

==Defeat by Alfred==
Guthrum's hopes of conquering all of Wessex came to an end with his defeat at the hands of Alfred at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878.  At Edington, Guthrum’s entire army was routed by Alfred's and fled to their encampment where they were besieged by Alfred's [[fyrd]] for two weeks.  According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', Guthrum’s army was able to negotiate a peace treaty known as the [[Treaty of Wedmore]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' Trans. by M. J. Swanton (New York, Routledge: 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' recorded the event:
:“Then the raiding army granted him (Alfred) hostages and great oaths that they would leave his kingdom and also promised him that their king (Guthrum) would receive baptism; and they fulfilled it. And three weeks later the king Guthrum came to him, one of thirty of the most honourable men who were in the raiding army, at [[Aller, Somerset|Aller]] - and that is near [[Athelney]] - and the king received him at [[baptism]]; and his [[chrism]] loosing was at [[Wedmore]].” &lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

===Conversion to Christianity and peace===

Under the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], the borders dividing the lands of Alfred and Guthrum were established,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. H. C. ''From Alfred the Great to Stephen'' (London, The Hambledon Press: 1991) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrum converted to Christianity, and he took on the Christian name Æthelstan with Alfred as his godfather. 

Guthrum upheld his end of the treaty and left the boundary that separated the Danelaw from English England unmolested. Guthrum, although failing to conquer Wessex, turned towards the lands to the east that the treaty had allotted under his control. Guthrum withdrew his army from the western borders facing Alfred's territory and moved eastward before eventually settling in the Kingdom of Guthrum in [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]] in 879. He lived out the remainder of his life there until his death in 890. According to the ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'', a chronicle compiled in [[Bury St Edmunds]], Guthrum was buried at ''Headleage,'' which is usually identified as [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dumville |first1=David |last2=Lapidge |first2=Michael |title=The Annals of St Neots with Vita Prima Sancti Neoti, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: a Collaborative Edition |location=Cambridge |publisher= |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-85991-117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Guthrum appears in several works of fiction, including:

*[[G. K. Chesterton]]'s poem ''[[The Ballad of the White Horse]]''.
*[[C. Walter Hodges]]' juvenile historical novels ''The Namesake'' and ''The Marsh King''.
*[[Bernard Cornwell]]'s first three novels of [[The Saxon Stories]] series ''[[The Last Kingdom]],'' and ''[[The Pale Horseman]]'', and ''[[The Lords of the North]]''.

On screen, he was portrayed by [[Brian Blessed]] in episode 4 ("King Alfred") of ''[[Churchill's People]]'', by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] in the 1969 film ''[[Alfred the Great (film)|Alfred the Great]]'', and [[Thomas W. Gabrielsson]] in ''[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]]''.

An athlete in Afghanistan, Sadiqi left as the [[Taliban]] arrived and landed in Australia as a refuge in 1999 at [[Port Hedland Detention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazaranetwork.com/video/hazaragi-jacki-chan-mr-hussain |title=Hazaragi Jacki Chan Mr. Hussain Sadiqi Got Australian Best Award 2008 |work=hazaranetwork.com |accessdate=10 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711072459/http://www.hazaranetwork.com/video/hazaragi-jacki-chan-mr-hussain |archivedate=11 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial Arts expert Hussain Sadiqi was born on 1981 in the central highlands of Afghanistan in [[Urozgan]] ([[Daykundi]]). He began his Martial Arts training when he was 9 years old. He attained the top ranking Martial Arts position in Afghanistan at a young age and become the National Champion at the age of 16. At 18 he became the captain of Afghanistan National Team. In 1999 he had to flee Afghanistan because of war; he had become a Taliban target due to his high profile.

His new journey began in 1999 when he left Afghanistan in search of a new homeland. His family paid US$5000.00 to a smuggler to get Hussain out of Afghanistan to safety. His journey entailed traveling from central Afghanistan to Pakistan, then moving to Indonesia, and finally boarding a fishing boat along with 147 other asylums. It took him three months to reach Australia.

Soon after arriving in Australia he was sent to a Detention Center for six months until he was released on a temporary protection visa. After being released he was selected to compete for the Afghan Tae Kwon Do team at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and carry his country flag at the Opening Ceremony. A couple of days before the Games started the International Olympic Committee banned the Afghan team because the Taliban, which controlled Afghanistan at the time, would not allow women compete.

Hussain gained many fans with his Martial arts based documentary "The Art of Fighting"&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/83818210&lt;/ref&gt;, directed by Gavain Browne and produced by Alex Barnes. He carried into this role childhood memories of a desolate mountainous region of central Afghanistan and the battered photograph of Bruce Lee shown to him by his older brother.

When Hussain was growing up in Afghanistan he harbored two dreams – one to take part in the Olympic Games, and the other to become a star of a Martial Arts films like his childhood hero Bruce Lee.

In 2008 he won an award for the best fight scene for in an action movie for  "Among the Dead Men" at the Action on Film International Film Festival in Pasadena, California. The award was for the best action in a Feature Film and was selected from a field of 300 entries from around the world.

Hussain said at the Festival "I feel blessed as somebody from Afghanistan because as soon as you hear about Afghanistan, people think war, poverty, and terrorism. But from such a country this is where I did very hard training to reach this level. Then beating all these people from around the world especially with many Chinese Masters, I feel great".

'''As a Volunteer:'''
Hussain has worked as a volunteer assisting new arrivals to Australia for the past ten years. He is a community leader and spokesperson for the Hazara community residing in Western Australia.
Hussain has also been working as a sports officer to help refugee children from all around the world. He is a role model for them, engaging them with Australian Culture through sports such as Australian Football.

As a refugee advocate he has visited a number of detention centers in Australia and Europe countries. In 2011 he was invited to Geneva as a guest speaker to talk about human rights and refugees to international law students. After visiting refugee camps in Greece, where he noticed the condition of refugees was desperate, he wrote a report calling on the UNHCR and Red Cross to take action.

'''Awards and Achievements:'''
At the age of 27 he achieved 2 gold medals in the field of Shaolin Kung Fu.
In 2008 Sadiqi won the award for the Best Fight Scene for action movie “Among Dead Men” at AOF International film festival in California beating 300 film worldwide.

In 2012 Hussain came back to win the Kung Fu World Championship at the age of 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wandererz.net/2014/01/the-art-of-fighting/ |title=Art of Fighting – Documentary |publisher=wandererz.net |date= 18 January 2014}}

'''Hylda Baker''' (4 February 1905 &amp;ndash; 1 May 1986) was an English [[comedienne]], actress and [[music hall]] performer. Born and brought up in [[Farnworth]], Lancashire, she is perhaps most well known for her role as Nellie Pledge in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[Nearest and Dearest]]'' (1968–73) and for her role in the 1960 film ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]''.

==Early life and career==
Baker was born in [[Municipal Borough of Farnworth|Farnworth]], [[Lancashire]], the first of seven children. Her father, Harold Baker, was a painter and signwriter, who also worked part-time in the [[music hall]]s as a comedian. At ten, Baker made her debut at the [[Opera House, Royal Tunbridge Wells|Opera House]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], and continued to tour as a single variety act—singing, dancing and performing impersonations. By 14, she had started writing, producing and performing her own shows. Her most famous stage act was as a gossip from the [[Northern England|North of England]], with a silent, sullen companion named "Big Cynthia", almost always played by a man in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] (most famously by Victor Graham, and last by [[Matthew Kelly]]).&lt;ref name=funny/&gt; Her act was full of [[malapropisms]] and [[catchphrases]] that had become part of her public persona, the most famous of which were "She knows, y'know!" and, when asked the time "It's quarter past&amp;nbsp;... I must get a little hand put on this watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.obituaries.narkive.com/txKPZ3wa/archive-obituary-hylda-baker-music-hall-comedienne |title=Hylda Baker, music hall comedienne |publisher=Alt.obituaries.narkive.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow comedian [[Victoria Wood]] described her comedic talent as "peculiarly [[Northern England|Northern]]".&lt;ref name=funny&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01279bs "Barbara Windsor's Funny Girls" broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2]] on 5 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television career ==
Baker came to national attention in [[BBC]] television's ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'' in 1955. This led to her television series, ''Be Soon'' (named after another of her catchphrases), in 1957 and a supporting part in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Our House (1960 TV series)|Our House]]'' in 1960, followed by her own sitcom, ''The Best of Friends'', in 1963.

She also appeared in films, including [[Karel Reisz]]'s ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (1960), ''[[Up the Junction (film)|Up the Junction]]'' (1968) and the film version of [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968). Reisz had seen her performing her sketches at the [[Chiswick|Chiswick Empire]] theatre. She had a starring role in the 1962 low-budget black-and-white [[British comedy]] film ''[[She Knows Y'Know]]''. Taking its title from her most famous catch-phrase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/She-Knows-YKnow-Hylda-Baker/dp/B005GV6QH4 |title=She Knows Y'Know [DVD&amp;#93;: Amazon.co.uk: Hylda Baker, Cyril Smith, Joe Gibbons, Montgomery Tully: DVD &amp; Blu-ray |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is described by the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] as a "low life comedy, unfolded against an [[industrial town]] backdrop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b76a93c1c |title=She Knows Y'know &amp;#124; BFI &amp;#124; BFI |publisher=Explore.bfi.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was restored by Blackpool resident Eurwyn Jones who negotiated use of the print, tracked down [[copyright]] holders to ensure it could be shared with fans across the world, and teamed up with Renown Pictures, who restore classic movies, putting the print through modern technology to present a crystal clear picture quality and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/features/he-knows-y-know-1-3797241 |title=He knows y'know&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Blackpool Gazette |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker's most famous role was as Nellie Pledge in the [[Granada Television]] comedy series ''[[Nearest and Dearest]]'' (1968–73). Playing her brother Eli was the comedian [[Jimmy Jewel]] and the series was centred on their characters' [[love-hate relationship]] as they tried to run their small family business, ''Pledge's Purer Pickles''. As they bickered onscreen and traded insults such as "knocked-kneed knackered old nosebag" and "big girl's blouse", the insults continued offscreen as the two disliked each other intensely and their arguments became showbiz legend.&lt;ref name=funny/&gt; A [[Nearest and Dearest (1972 film)|film version of the series]] was made by [[Hammer Films]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;[[Nearest and Dearest (1972 film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (the same year she was a subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/hylda_baker.html |title=Hylda Baker |publisher=Bigredbook.info |date= |accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Later in the series, Baker began having trouble remembering her lines and had to rely on [[cue cards]] and prompts from her co star [[Madge Hindle]], who would whisper her next line to her.&lt;ref name=funny/&gt;

Baker played a virtually identical role in the [[LWT]] comedy series ''[[Not On Your Nellie]]'' (1974–75). In this series she played Nellie Pickersgill, who moves to [[London]] from the North to run her ailing father's pub. However the series was short-lived and, by this time, Baker was again finding it difficult to remember her lines and was also refusing to attend rehearsals. After suing the production company for an on-set injury in which she broke her leg (after slipping on beer on the set), the series ended, as did her television acting career.

Baker recreated her variety act in an episode of the BBC series ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'' in 1976.

In an unusual coda to her musical career, she teamed with [[Arthur Mullard]] in 1978 to record a comedy version of "[[You're the One That I Want]]" from the film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''. Baker and Mullard, then aged 73 and 68, dressed in wigs and costumes similar to the [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] characters from ''Grease'' and appeared on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the Granada Television music show for children ''[[Get It Together (TV series)|Get It Together]]''. The pair recorded an album of pop covers entitled ''Band on the Trot''.&lt;ref name=funny/&gt;

Her final television appearance came the same year in an episode of the BBC arts documentary show [[Omnibus (UK TV series)|''Omnibus'']] about comedians, broadcast on 28 December 1978.

==Personal life and death==
Baker suffered two [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancies]] which led in part to the breakdown of her marriage.&lt;ref name=funny/&gt;

On Christmas Eve 1961, Baker was hit by a passing car that mounted the pavement in London's [[Charing Cross Road]], not far from her then home at Ridgemount Gardens in [[Holborn]]. Left with a broken toe and bruising, Baker claimed she was unable to work for 34 weeks and that the accident had left her with "a waddle". She sued the driver of the vehicle for damages and loss of earnings. Baker refused a settlement offer of £4,000 and took the matter to the High Court where she was initially awarded £2,921 in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver|title=£2921 for Hylda Baker|last=|first=|date=5 May 1964|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|pages=7|via=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was increased to £4,073 (plus costs) at an appeal hearing in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver|title=Hylda Baker wins extra damages|last=|first=|date=11 February 1965|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|pages=3|via=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Baker's [[chauffeur]] Noel Moncaster absconded with £2,500 of her cash. Moncaster was arrested three months later, by which time only £45 of the money remained, after he had used it to travel to France, Spain and Africa. At his trial, Blackpool Magistrates ordered Moncaster to pay Baker £400 (the maximum the magistrates could award) and committed him for later sentencing by Blackpool's [[quarter session]] court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver|title=Chauffeur left with the money|last=|first=|date=12 October 1971|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|pages=5|via=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker lived the life of a star, dressing in [[furs]] and keeping [[monkey]]s as pets. She annoyed her neighbours with loud parties at her [[Blackpool]] home. In her 70s she developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and in 1981 she moved to [[Brinsworth House]], the retirement home for performers, in [[Twickenham]], [[London]]. In 1984, she moved to a psychiatric hospital in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], where she died two years later, aged 81, from [[bronchial pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=funny/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Actress [[Jean Fergusson]], known for appearances in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', wrote a biography and devised and starred in a tribute show, ''She Knows Y' Know!'', at London's [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1997. The show won the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best Entertainment in 1998.

[[Alison Steadman]] played Baker in the play "Our Hylda" by Martyn Hesford, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 June 2017.

'''Javier de Ybarra y Bergé ''' (2 July 1913 - 22 June 1977) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] industrialist, writer, and politician from [[Bilbao]].

Born into a prominent Bilbao family, Javier Ybarra attended the [[University of Deusto]]. During the [[Spanish Second Republic]] he was affiliated with the [[Partido Nacionalista Español]] and then the monarchist [[Renovación Española]] party.  He fought and was injured in the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. From 1963 to 1969 he served as [[mayor]] of Bilbao. 

He wrote works related to his experience during the Civil War, history, and politics. He also served as an executive with firms including [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], several banks, and the newspaper [[El Correo]].

On 20 May 1977 Javier Ybarra was kidnapped by renegade members of the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], who entered his home in disguise, bound and gagged members of his family, and took him away in an ambulance.  Demanding the release of a number of Basque prisoners (a condition largely met by the Spanish government), his captors later demanded a ransom of one billion [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] and further prisoner releases.  The situation had been complicated by the fact that the group that had kidnapped Ybarra formally renounced their affiliation with the larger ETA organization while holding him and were further disturbed when their leader was arrested in France. The Ybarra family attempted to negotiate with the kidnappers and push back the deadline for payment.  The kidnappers failed to respond and on 20 June they announced they had killed Ybarra and sent a map supposedly showing the location of the body. When the [[Guardia Civil]] failed to find it, another communication was sent and the body of Javier Ybarra was found near a farmhouse in [[Navarra]].  He had been shot in the head and wrapped in a plastic sheet.  

Occurring in the immediate aftermath of [[Spanish general election, 1977|Spain's first free national elections in forty years]], the Ybarra killing provoked widespread condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.P. ''The Basque Insurgents: ETA, 1952-1980''. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1984. 100-102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the discovery of the body, the Madrid daily newspaper [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] lead with a full page photo of Ybarra and a statement that "all parties" condemned the "atrocious murder".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1977/06/23/001.html ''ABC'' Madrid, June 23, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeff Palmer''' (born '''David Zuloaga'''; March 27, 1975)&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{IMDb name|0658289|Jeff Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[gay]] actor who has appeared in [[pornographic films]] and [[gay pornographic magazines|magazines]]. Palmer is also a singer-songwriter with a great number of songs released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffpalmer.net/visitormusic.asp Jeff Palmer website - Music page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
David Zuloaga was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], but raised in [[Mendoza, Argentina]] by his [[Evangelical Christian|evangelical]] parents from the age of two. At the age of 14, he saw his first pornographic film starring [[Peter North (pornographer)|Peter North]] which sparked his ambition to become a [[porn star]].&lt;ref name="papermag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papermag.com/?section=article&amp;parid=864|author=Mickey Boardman|title=Jeff Palmer: Old Hollywood Meets West Hollywood|publisher=Pepermag|date=19 June 2003|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer left home at sixteen for [[Brazil]], then a year later to [[Europe]] where he had his first gay sexual experience with a friend. During this period he worked in Amsterdam as a [[male prostitute]] at the Blue Boy club.

==Adult film career==
At the age of 19 Palmer moved to [[Miami]], and a year later debuted in his seminal pornographic film for [[Falcon Studios]] under the direction of award-winning producer/director John Rutherford.&lt;ref name="CPride"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagopride.com/news/interview.cfm/articleid/93136|title=Interview:Jeff Palmer|work=ChicagoPride.com|accessdate=2007-08-24|date=2004-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer performed exclusively for Falcon Studios before leaving in 1999. In 2001 Palmer made a porn comeback in the Pacific Sun Entertainment production ''Palmer's Lust''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Palmer moved back to [[Mendoza, Argentina]] in October 2009 after years in [[Portland, Oregon]], hosting occasional solo [[webcam]] shows for his fans on his website,&lt;ref name="CPride"/&gt; which was closed in early 2016. However, according to the site at the time, Palmer returned to live in Los Angeles in September 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Views==
Palmer is opposed to pharmaceuticals as the best way to fight HIV infection, instead promoting the therapeutic use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-09-10/columns/ny-mirror/1 NY Mirror], villagevoice.com, September 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote personal messages and displayed them prominently on his website home page about this matter and his strong positions about it. In 2002 he signed with Hot Desert Knights to star in his first [[condom]]less, or "[[bareback (sex)|bareback]]" film. It featured Palmer's first [[anal sex|anally receptive]]  or "[[bottom (sex)|bottom]]" sex scene.&lt;ref name="CPride"/&gt;

He admitted in 2004 to a [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pornconfidential.com/pa/Interviews/jeffpalmer.htm Porn Confidential website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Stafano''' is a Republican activist and the Vice President for [[Americans for Prosperity|Americans for Prosperity and Americans for Prosperity Foundation]], a conservative organization that is the primary political group of the Koch brothers ([[Charles Koch]] and [[David Koch]]).

==Biography==
Stefano, a recent mother and 2004 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated reporter, felt disenfranchised by politics in 2008 when she discovered the nascent Tea Party at a local rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/6439/tea_party_confidential|title=Tea Party Confidential|first=Kate|last=Zernike|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=9 May 2018|publisher=In These Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She would eventually rise through the ranks of the Tea Party.  Reflecting her rise in prominence in conservative circles, Stefano spoke at a panel in 2011 at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], Washington's biggest gathering of conservatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/21/why-is-facebook-helping-fund-cpac|title=Why Is Facebook Helping Fund CPAC?|first=Betsy|last=Woodruff|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2018|website=Thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a panel organized by the [[Tea Party Express]], an organizing group founded by Republican consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=Jeffrey|last2=Sobieraj |first2=Sarah |date=2013 |title=The Outrage Industry: Political Opinion Media and the New Incivility}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teapartyexpress.org/3453/cpac-the-tea-party-visits-dc|title=CPAC – The Tea Party Visits DC - Tea Party Express|website=Teapartyexpress.org|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She became a frequent guest on Fox.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jenniferstefano.wordpress.com/about/|title=Get to know Jennifer Stefano|date=30 December 2011|website=Jenniferstefano.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stefano eventually became the Pennsylvania State Director for [[Americans for Prosperity|AFP]].,&lt;ref name="americansforprosperity.org"&gt;[http://americansforprosperity.org/about/staff/about-jennifer-stefano] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the principal political arm of the Koch brothers' network.

==Media appearances==
Stefano has appeared on several broadcast and cable networks as a host and commentator, and she is a "regular guest on Fox News and Fox Business News"&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="americansforprosperity.org"/&gt; She gained widespread media attention in a confrontation with [[Bob Beckel]] on the [[Hannity]] Show on April 16, 2012. After Stefano stated that the [[Head Start Program]], which provides safety net assistance to poor children, did not work, Beckel replied, "You don't know what the f*ck you're talking about!" Beckel did not realize the show was back from the commercial break, and initially refused to apologize. When persuaded that the show was, in fact, live, Beckel apologized for his choice of language, but stood by the overall intent of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/fox-news-bob-beckel-f-bomb_n_1430863.html Fox News' Bob Beckel Drops F-Bomb On Air] The Huffington Post. April 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckel's praise for Head Start was supported by education expert Valerie Strauss, who said in response to the Fox segment, "Head Start produces modest benefits including some long-term gains for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/03/05/does-head-start-work-for-kids-the-bottom-line/|title=Does Head Start work for kids?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11735">'''José Ernesto Medellín Rojas''' (March 4, 1975 – August 5, 2008), born in [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]], was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national who was executed by [[lethal injection]] for the murders of [[murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña|Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

Medellín was convicted of raping and killing 16-year-old Peña and 14-year-old Ertman in June 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/28/ldt.01.html CNN discussion of José Medellín]&lt;/ref&gt;

His case gained notoriety when Mexico sued the United States in the [[International Court of Justice]] on behalf of 51 Mexican nationals asserting that the US had violated the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]], which requires that local authorities inform foreign nationals being held on criminal charges of their right to consult with their country's diplomats. That court ruled that the United States was obliged to have the defendants' cases reopened and reconsidered. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] agreed to hear the case on May 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/washington/01court.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/S/Supreme%20Court NY Times case summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] briefed the Supreme Court on the obligation to comply with international treaties. On March 25, 2008, in ''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'', the court rejected the Bush administration's arguments and cleared the way for Texas to execute the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/25/scotus.texas/index.html|title=Supreme Court overrules Bush, OKs Texas execution|last=Mears|first=Bill |date=2008-03-25|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Court of Justice later ruled that the United States had violated its treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN]], [http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/19/mexican.execution.violation/index.html UN court rules US execution violated treaty], January 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape and murder==
[[File:EllisUnitTX.jpg|thumb|[[Ellis Unit]], where Medellín was initially confined]]
On June 24, 1993, Medellín carried out a gang initiation at T.C. Jester Park in Houston, Texas, along with five others: Peter Cantu, Venancio Medellín, Efrain Perez, Raul Villareal and Derrick O'Brien.  Two others, Frank Sandoval and Ramon Sandoval, were present but did not participate in the initiation.  The initiation involved the new member, Raul Villareal, submitting to beatings from the others.  After this, the gang members remained in the park, drinking alcohol.

Two girls who had attended a birthday party, 14-year-old Jennifer Ertman and 16-year-old Elizabeth Peña, took a shortcut through the park to get home before an 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. curfew.  They encountered the gang, and Medellín began talking to Peña and then grabbed her. She attempted to flee, but he forced her to the ground.  When Peña cried for help, Ertman ran back to aid her. In response, Cantu and O'Brien pushed her to the ground as well.  Ramon and Frank Sandoval chose to leave at that point.
[[File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg|thumb|left|Medellín was moved to the [[Allan B. Polunsky Unit]]]]
The remainder of the gang, as well as Venancio Medellín, took turns anally, orally and vaginally raping the two girls.  Afterwards, they were beaten, then the gang decided to murder the girls so they would not be identified as the rapists.  Medellín killed one of the girls by using her shoelaces to strangle her, then crushing her neck with his foot.  Other gang members strangled the other girl with a nylon belt, until the belt snapped.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite news

Medellín, Villareal, Perez, and Cantu then gathered at Cantu's home, where he lived with his brother, Joe Cantu, and sister-in-law, Christina Cantu. Christina Cantu questioned why Villareal was bleeding and Perez had a bloody shirt. This prompted Medellín to say the gang "had fun", and that details would appear on the news. He then elaborated that he had raped both girls. Peter Cantu then returned, and divided valuables that had been stolen from the girls.  Medellín got a ring with an "E", so he could give it to his girlfriend, Esther. Medellín reported that he had killed a girl, and noted that he would have found it easier with a gun. Derrick Sean O'Brien was videotaped smiling at the scene of the crime. After the gang left, Christina Cantu convinced Joe Cantu to report the crime to police. Four days after the crime, the bodies were found in the park. They were badly decaying, and dental records were used for identification. The medical examiner corroborated the cause of death as strangulation.  All those believed responsible were ultimately arrested. Medellín gave both a written and taped confession.&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt;

==Case history==
{{main|Medellin v. Texas}} 128 S. Ct. 1346; 170 L. Ed. 2d 190; 2008 U.S. LEXIS 2912; 76 U.S.L.W. 4143; 2008-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) P50,242; 21 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. S 126
{{refimprove section|date=August 2008}}
In the International Court of Justice, Mexico sued the United States on behalf of Mexican citizens who had been sentenced to death without having their national consulate notified. The court ruled that the United States acted in error and required that the defendants' cases be reopened.

Initially, the US government described Mexico's suit as "an unjustified, unwise and ultimately unacceptable intrusion in the United States criminal justice system." Reversing that position in early 2005, with Medellín's death-penalty appeal pending before the Supreme Court, the White House announced that it would abide by the decision by instructing the states to reconsider the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals on death row. The Supreme Court then dismissed Medellín's case to enable the Texas courts to comply with that directive.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused to change their rules barring reconsideration of such cases. In that decision, one of the court's judges accused the White House of an "unprecedented, unnecessary and intrusive exercise of power over the Texas court system".  In response, the Bush administration entered the case on  Medellín's behalf and urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Texas court's decision. The case, ''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'', No. 06-984, was argued on October 10, 2007 and decided on March 25, 2008. The US government's brief, filed by Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, told the justices that the Texas court's decision, if not reversed, "will place the United States in breach of its international law obligation" to comply with the International Court of Justice's decision and would "frustrate the president's judgment that foreign policy interests are best served by giving effect to that decision."   Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito, rejected the Bush administration's arguments. Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion.  Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg, dissented.

On July 16, 2008, the International Court of Justice asked for a stay of execution on behalf of Medellin and four other Mexican nationals who also did not receive consular notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7510073.stm|title=Court seeks to stay US executions|date=2008-07-16|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2008, Robert Black, spokesman for Texas Governor Rick Perry, said the state would continue with the scheduled August 5, 2008 execution despite the International Court of Justice order for a stay.  "The world court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court. It is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties. It's very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5890690.html|title=Texas still plans to execute killer despite U.N. order|last=Turner|first=Allan|author2=Ruiz, Rosanna|date=2008-07-17|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==

Huxtable was born in [[Houston]], Texas and raised in [[College Station–Bryan metropolitan area|Bryan-College Station, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)|title=Juliana Huxtable – October 11, 2016|date=July 18, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG5soJNJa4k&amp;t=1554s|accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described her hometown as a typical "conservative [[Bible Belt]] town in Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/juliana-huxtable-new-museum-triennial|title=Meet Juliana Huxtable: Star of the New Museum Triennial|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxtable's mother, Kassandra, raised Huxtable and her two siblings alone after Huxtable's parents divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exmjkp/artist-juliana-huxtables-journey-from-scene-queen-to-trans-art-star-456|title=Artist Juliana Huxtable's Bold, Defiant Vision|date=March 25, 2015|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable was born [[intersex]] and began her [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]] after college. She notes that struggles with gender conformity and sex identity started earlier in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exmjkp/artist-juliana-huxtables-journey-from-scene-queen-to-trans-art-star-456|title=Artist Juliana Huxtable's Bold, Defiant Vision|date=March 25, 2015|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable moved to New York to attend [[Bard College]] and graduated in 2010. Huxtable has spoken about the desire to be a painter while growing up and enrolled in several painting classes during college. She abandoned the medium after professors criticized her for her "obsession with" formal technique and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)|title=Juliana Huxtable – October 11, 2016|date=July 18, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG5soJNJa4k|accessdate=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with artist [[Lorraine O'Grady]], Huxtable mentions studying literature and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moca.org/stream/post/introducing-lorraine-ogrady-and-juliana-huxtable-part-1|title=Introducing: Lorraine O’Grady and Juliana Huxtable, Part 1|work=The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging in New York==
Huxtable moved to New York to work as a legal assistant for the [[ACLU]]'s Racial Justice Program after college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maskmagazine.com/the-street-issue/work/juliana-huxtable|title=Juliana Huxtable|work=Mask Magazine|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the ACLU, Huxtable amassed a significant following on Tumblr, posting long stream-of-consciousness poems and self-portraits that experimented with fashion and [[Nuwaubian Nation|Nuwaubian]] imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maskmagazine.com/the-street-issue/work/juliana-huxtable|title=Juliana Huxtable|work=Mask Magazine|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving her position at the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], Huxtable began DJing.

In 2013, Huxtable participated in the [[House of Ladosha]]'s show ''Whole House Eats'' at [[Superchief Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/house-of-ladosha-the-whole-house-eats|title=House of Ladosha is C-Word Bound|work=Interview Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time as a DJ, Huxtable regularly integrated her poetry into [[DJ mixes]]. Huxtable's poetry was featured in the song "Blood Oranges" from [[Le1f]]'s mixtape [[Tree House (Le1f mixtape)|Tree House]] as well as the runway soundtrack for the [[Hood by Air]] Fall/Winter fashion show "10,000 Screaming Faggots" by Total Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201410&amp;id=49111|title=Wu Tsang|author=Wu Tsang|work=artforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable's interest in fashion led her to model for a number of fashion houses and campaigns. In 2014, she was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of ''C☆NDY'' magazine along with 13 other transgender women – [[Janet Mock]], [[Carmen Carrera]], [[Geena Rocero]], [[Isis King]], [[Gisele Alicea]], [[Leyna Ramous]], [[Dina Marie]], [[Nina Poon]], [[Yasmine Petty]], [[Niki M'nray]], [[Pêche Di]], [[Carmen Xtravaganza]] and [[Laverne Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/laverne-cox-carmen-carrera-on-candy-magazine-cover/12/2014/|title=Laverne Cox, Carmen Carrera, Among 14 Trans Stars On "Candy" Magazine Cover|work=NewNowNext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxtable has modeled for [[DKNY]], [[Eckhaus Latta]], [[Chromat]], and French fashion house [[Kenzo (brand)|Kenzo]].

In August 2014, Huxtable performed in the video for the [[Hercules and Love Affair]] song "My Offence." The video features excerpts of conversations with figures from New York City's queer nightlife scene such as [[Miss Honey Dijon|Honey Dijon]] and [[Contessa Stuto]]. The band's primary member, Andrew Butler, described the song and its video as an examination of his "relationship to taboo words and the use of 'cunt' amongst NYC's gay community to relay flattery, empowerment and strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andy Butler of Hercules And Love Affair Discusses 'My Offence' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/hercules-and-love-affair_n_5679099.html |last=Michelson |first=Noah |date=August 16, 2014 |publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== New Museum Triennial and Performa 15 Biennial ===

In early 2015, Huxtable was selected to present work in the 2015 [[New Museum]] Triennial ''Surround Audience,'' curated by [[Lauren Cornell]] and artist [[Ryan Trecartin]]. Huxtable included two text-based works and two self-portraits, each an inkjet print from the series ''Universal Crop Tops For All The Self-Canonized Saints of Becoming.'' These works, along with a sculpture by fellow Triennial artist [[Frank Benson (artist born 1976)|Frank Benson]] that depicted a life-sized Huxtable rendered in iridescent colors, were prominent works in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/frank-benson-new-museum-triennial/|title=At the 2015 New Museum Triennial, A High-Tech Take on Nude Sculpture|last=McGarry|first=Kevin|website=T Magazine|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Mark Guiducci dubbed Huxtable the "Star of the New Museum Triennial".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/11894022/juliana-huxtable-new-museum-triennial/|title=Meet Juliana Huxtable: Star of the New Museum Triennial|last=Guiducci|first=Mark|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable premiered on season two of [[Ovation (U.S. TV channel)|Ovation TV's]] web-based talk show, ''[[Touching the Art]]'', hosted by fellow 2015 Triennial artist [[Casey Jane Ellison]]. Artist [[K8 Hardy]] and New Museum curator Shelley Fox Aarons were also guests in the same episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL82jzwHBNQ|title=Touching the Art – Season 2 – Episode 1 – Biennials &amp; Triennials – Ovation|date=February 19, 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Huxtable was selected to showcase a new performance piece in the Performa 15 Biennial. The hour-long performance titled, ''There Are Certain Facts That Cannot Be Disputed,'' was presented at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. It included poetry, audio and voice over, video elements, and live-music with fellow collaborators and explored the complicated relationship between the ephemeral nature of digital information and the drive for historical documentation on the internet. As described by the festival's organizers, Huxtable's performance considered "cyberspace as a twilight zone of precariousness and preservation, traversing closed servers, bounced URLs, and Google cache as human and digital characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== ''Shock Value'', House of Ladosha, and other projects ===
Huxtable is a founder and DJ for ''Shock Value,'' a weekly New York City-based nightlife collective run by women artists, DJs, writers, and fashion icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/20742/1/petra-collins-selects-juliana-huxtable|title=Petra Collins selects Juliana Huxtable|last=Dazed|date=July 8, 2014|work=Dazed|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the collective was selected to participate in the group exhibition ''Trigger: Gender as a Weapon and a Tool'' at the [[New Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/trigger-gender-as-a-tool-and-as-a-weapon|title=Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon|website=www.newmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also featured in Issue 7 of the magazine ''Gayletter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gayletter.com/trigger-gender-as-a-tool-and-a-weapon/|title=TRIGGER: GENDER AS A TOOL AND A WEAPON|date=September 29, 2017|work=GAYLETTER|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable currently sits on the editorial board for Topical Cream, a New York-based platform that supports a community of artists, writers, designers, and technologists through digital publishing and public programming initiatives. Topical Cream was founded in 2013 and its board members include Lyndsy Welgos, Ara Anjargolian, Whitney Mallett, Juliana Huxtable, and [[Aria Dean]].

In 2016, Huxtable was a Visiting Artists Program lecturer at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].

Huxtable has participated in multiple panels and lectures, including ''Basquiat and Contemporary Queer Art'' hosted by the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], ''Transgender in the Mainstream'' hosted by [[Art Basel Miami Beach]], and ''Open Score: Generation You'' presented by the [[New Museum]] and [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Art Basel|title=Salon {{!}} Transgender in the Mainstream|date=December 21, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsHXmS1jJYE|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schomburg Center|title=Talks at the Schomburg: Basquiat and Contemporary Queer Art|date=February 8, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ov_Kl-rCw0|accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=New Museum|title=Open Score 2016: Intro + Panel 1: Generation You, presented by New Museum and Rhizome|date=February 22, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ5Ks16ff_o|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Huxtable headlined the opening night performance of the [[Portland Institute for Contemporary Art]]'s Time-Based Art Festival in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pica.org/event/juliana-huxtable/|title=Juliana Huxtable – PICA|work=PICA|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solo exhibitions ===
Huxtable's first solo exhibition, ''A Split During Laughter at the Rally'', opened at ''[[Reena Spaulings]]'' in New York City in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reenaspaulings.com/JH.htm|title=Reena Spaulings Fine Art|website=www.reenaspaulings.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured several posters with DIY-inspired magnets, a video piece featuring members from [[House of Ladosha]], and a flow chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/juliana-huxtable-964106|title=Juliana Huxtable is Helping Art Regain Its Stride {{!}} artnet News|date=May 19, 2017|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show explored "the aesthetics of [[conspiracy]] and American paranoia" through various modes of resistance, alienation, and irony. Huxtable notes that the posters in the exhibition were formally inspired by American artist [[Emory Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artforum.com/words/id=68284|title=Juliana Huxtable talks about conspiracy and her show at Reena Spaulings|last=Fialho|first=As told to Alex|work=artforum.com|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxtable's second solo exhibition, ''Juliana Huxtable'', opened at ''Project Native Informant'' in London, England in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projectnativeinformant.com/exhibition/juliana-huxtable/|title=Project Native Informant – Juliana Huxtable|website=projectnativeinformant.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured three photographs of a black subject with various (often conflicting) tattoos, four sculptural paintings made of military-style clothing, and ten pamphlet-sized posters recounting, "a brawl between Antifa leftist skinheads and Nazi skinheads outside of a Fred Perry sample sale in Paris".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/juliana-huxtables-conspiracy-logic|title=Juliana Huxtable's Conspiracy Logic|last=SSENSE|date=October 27, 2017|work=ssense|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show continues Huxtable's exploration into conspiracy theories and paranoia, subcultures, and identity but on a more humorous note. Fashion also plays a major role throughout Huxtable's practice as this show highlights. Huxtable has referenced Jose Esteban-Muñoz's "Disidentification" as a major inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewhitereview.org/reviews/juliana-huxtable-pni/|title=Juliana Huxtable, PNI – The White ReviewThe White Review|website=www.thewhitereview.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
Huxtable is the author of two books and has contributed to numerous chapbooks and artist's writing anthologies.

Her first book, ''Mucus in My Pineal Gland,'' was published in 2017 by Capricious. The book is a collection of previously performed poems, like ''UNTITLED (FOR STEWART)'' and ''THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTS THAT CANNOT BE DISPUTED,'' as well as a number of new poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/juliana-huxtable-964106|title=Juliana Huxtable is Helping Art Regain Its Stride {{!}} artnet News|date=May 19, 2017|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written in her typical all-caps style and blue font.

Huxtable's second book, ''Life'', was co-written with artist [[Hannah Black]]. The novel is a work of science-fiction and is written in both English and German. It was released in 2017 by König.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aqnb.com/2017/03/16/hannah-black-juliana-huxtables-life-book-release-and-opening-at-mumok-mar-16/|title=Averting the end of the world: Hannah Black + Juliana Huxtable’s LIFE book release + opening at Mumok, Mar 16|date=March 16, 2017|work=atractivoquenobello|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
'''Style'''

Huxtable's practice is interdisciplinary by nature and thus explores a range of topics. Earlier works explore ideas of identity, the body, and text, with influences from [[Afrofuturism]] and science fiction. Huxtable's more recent works explore [[language]], [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], fashion ([[Baroque]] costumes, [[military surplus]], [[punk subculture|punk]] aesthetics, etc.), and various [[counterculture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/juliana-huxtables-conspiracy-logic|title=Juliana Huxtable's Conspiracy Logic|last=SSENSE|date=October 27, 2017|work=ssense|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxtable's visual practice includes, "examining and remixing enduring imagery that, in her observations, retain 'symbolic power.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/juliana-huxtable-964106|title=Juliana Huxtable is Helping Art Regain Its Stride {{!}} artnet News|date=May 19, 2017|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Zultanski writes of Huxtable's ''Mucus in My Pineal Gland'', "...doesn't idealize genrelessness, it moves between genres, unmooring moments of personal experience and speculative thought from literary conventions in order to situate them in the world outside of the text, while reflecting on and enjoying those conventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://4columns.org/zultanski-steven/mucus-in-my-pineal-gland|title=Mucus in My Pineal Gland|last=Zultanski|first=Steven|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxtable often, "references her use of digital spaces, including [[Tumblr]]," [[chat room]]s, [[social media]], online sexual [[subculture]]s, [[Encarta]], and [[Afripedia Project|Afripedia]] as well as [[childhood]], fashion, [[consumer culture]], and the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.out.com/art-books/2017/5/31/all-caps-imagination-juliana-huxtable|title=The All Caps Imagination of Juliana Huxtable|date=May 31, 2017|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influences'''

Huxtable has noted a range of influences including writers [[Octavia E. Butler|Octavia Butler]] and [[Samuel R. Delany]], theorists [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[José Esteban Muñoz|Jose Esteban-Muñoz]], and the visual aesthetics of video director [[Hype Williams (director)|Hype Williams,]] bands [[TLC (group)|TLC]] and [[Blaque]], and singer [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)|title=Juliana Huxtable – October 11, 2016|date=July 18, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG5soJNJa4k|accessdate=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuwaubian Nation|Nuwaubian culture]] has often been a major source of inspiration for her as well. Huxtable's ''Mucus in My Pineal Gland'' is dedicated to "[[Herculine Barbin|Herculine]], [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], [[House of Ladosha|LaDosha]], and Pickaninny Punks."

The '''Kalmykian Cavalry Corps''' ('''{{lang-de|Kalmücken-Kavallerie-Korps}}''') was a unit of about 5,000 Kalmyk volunteers who chose to join the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in 1942 rather than remain in [[Kalmykia]] as German forces retreated before the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name="Pohl1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Otto Pohl|title=Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9VoAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-30921-2|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Stalin subsequently declared the Kalmyk population as a whole to be German collaborators and [[Kalmyk deportations of 1943|had them deported]] to [[Siberia]] suffering great loss of life.

==Origins==
When [[Erich von Manstein]] led the [[German 16th Infantry Division|16th Motorized Infantry Division]] into Kalmykia in early 1942 he already had some Kalmyk advisors from a committee drawn together by [[Goebbels]] for propaganda purposes. These were supplemented by other Kalmyks who had settled in [[Belgrade]] following their flight with [[White Movement|White Russian]] emigres after the Russian [[October Revolution]].

==Organization==
Kalmyk Kavallerie Korps acted within German [[Wehrmacht]] as an independent allied force with all leadership positions taken by [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyks]]. Most of the officers were Kalmyks themselves, with previous Soviet military experience. A few Germans that were present within the corps performed only auxiliary and administrative functions.

Unlike most other national "volunteer" divisions, the Kalmykian Cavalry Corps incorporated genuine volunteers willing to fight together with Germans. The other national divisions relied upon recruits from [[prisoner-of-war camp|POW camps]].&lt;ref name="Pohl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Otto Pohl|title=The Stalinist Penal System: A Statistical History of Soviet Repression and Terror, 1930-1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5vaAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-0336-3|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
More Kalmyks fought in the Kalmykian Cavalry Corps than in comparable units of the Soviet army.&lt;ref name="Müller2014"/&gt;

==Military actions==
The Kalmykian Cavalry Corps fought with the Wehrmacht behind the lines,&lt;ref name="Munoz2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio J. Munoz|title=The East Came West: Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist Volunteers in the German Armed Forces, 1941-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHPzAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Axis Europa Books|isbn=978-1-891227-39-4|pages=158–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially around the [[Azov Sea]]. At the end of 1944, the surviving Kalmyk cavalry troops, together with their families, retreated with the German army.&lt;ref name="Müller2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolf-Dieter Müller|title=The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSvaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA248|date=28 February 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-890-8|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,000 went to [[Silesia]], [[Poland]] and 1,500 to [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], where they were reorganized to fight against the [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].

==End of the war==
After the war, nearly all of the surviving Kalmyk soldiers along with the Kalmyk families that accompanied them were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.

The Kalmykian people were internally deported for 13 years as a punishment for collaborating with Germans.&lt;ref name="Gouchinova2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elza-Bair Mataskovna Gouchinova|title=The Kalmyks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVNz1wjFVxsC&amp;pg=PA221|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-77887-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katharine Teresa Gun''' (''née'' '''Harwood''', born 1974) is a British former translator for the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), a British [[intelligence agency]].&lt;ref name="ipa-teresagun"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accuracy.org/1104-the-katharine-gun-case/ | title=The Katharine Gun Case | accessdate=9 July 2013 | author=IPA's editor | date=25 February 2004 | work=accuracy.org | publisher=Institute for Public Accuracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, she leaked [[top-secret information]] to the press concerning illegal activities by the United States of America in their push for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Some of these activities include the US [[National Security Agency]]'s eavesdropping operation on countries tasked with passing a second United Nations resolution on the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-GCHQ officer 'preventing war'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3243266.stm|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=27 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gun was born in [[Taiwan]] to British parents. Her upbringing later led her to describe herself as a "[[third culture kid]]".&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/26/interviews.iraq|title=The spy who wouldn't keep a secret|author=Oliver Burkeman and Richard Norton-Taylor|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 February 2004|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending her childhood in Taiwan, Gun studied Japanese and Chinese at [[Durham University]] in England.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; Finding it difficult to find work as a linguist, Gun applied to [[GCHQ]] after reading a newspaper advertisement for the organisation. Gun had previously been unaware of GCHQ, later saying that "I didn't have much idea about what they did...I was going into it pretty much blind. Most people do."&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt;

==The leak==
Gun's regular job at GCHQ in Cheltenham was to translate [[Mandarin Chinese]] into English.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; While at work at GCHQ on 31 January 2003, Gun read an email from Frank Koza, the chief of staff at the "regional targets" division of the American intelligence agency, the [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="GuardMar13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/03/katharine-gun-iraq-war-whistleblower|title=Katharine Gun: Ten years on what happened to the woman who revealed dirty tricks on the UN Iraq war vote?|author=Martin Bright|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 March 2013|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koza's email requested aid in a secret and illegal operation to [[Covert listening device|bug]] the United Nations offices of six nations: [[Angola]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chile]], [[Guinea]], and [[Pakistan]]. These were the six "swing nations" on the [[UN Security Council]] that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of [[Iraq]]. The plan allegedly violated the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which regulate global diplomacy.

Gun was outraged by the email, and took a printed copy of it home with her.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; After contemplating the email over the weekend, Gun gave the email to a friend who was acquainted with journalists.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; Gun heard no more of the email until Sunday 2 March, when she saw it reproduced on the front page of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; Less than a week after the ''Observer'' story, on Wednesday 5 March, Gun had confessed to her [[line manager]] at GCHQ that she had leaked the email, and was arrested. In a BBC interview with [[Jeremy Paxman]], she said that she had not raised the matter with staff counsellors as she "honestly didn't think that would have had any practical effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/3489568.stm | work=BBC News | title=Katharine Gun | date=26 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gun spent a night in police custody and was subsequently charged with breaking the [[Official Secrets Act]] eight months later.&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt; The case against Gun was dropped after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence. Gun later embarked on a postgraduate degree course in global ethics at [[Birmingham University]].&lt;ref name="GuardMar04"/&gt;

==Fallout==
On 13 November 2003, Gun was charged with an offence under section 1 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]].&lt;ref name=Beeb1&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3268113.stm |title=Ex-GCHQ woman charged over 'leak' |date=13 November 2003|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her case became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' among activists, and many people stepped forward to urge the government to drop the case. Among them were Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Daniel Ellsberg]] (the US government official who leaked the [[Pentagon Papers]]), and actor [[Sean Penn]], who described her as "a hero of the human spirit". Gun planned to plead "not guilty", saying in her defence that she acted to prevent imminent loss of life in a war she [[illegal war|considered illegal]].

The case came to court on 25 February 2004. Within half an hour, the case was dropped because the prosecution declined to offer evidence.&lt;ref name=Beeb2&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3485072.stm |title=GCHQ translator cleared over leak |date=26 February 2004|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the prosecution dropping the case are unclear. The day before the trial, Gun's defence team had asked the government for any records of advice about the legality of the war that it had received during the run-up to the war. A full trial might have exposed any such documents to public scrutiny as the defence were expected to argue that trying to stop an illegal act (that of an illegal [[war of aggression]]) trumped Gun's obligations under the Official Secrets Act 1989. Speculation was rife in the media that the prosecution service had bowed to political pressure to drop the case so that any such documents would remain secret.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, a Government spokesman said that the decision to drop the case had been made before the defence's demands had been submitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper had reported plans to drop the case the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/22/iraq.freedomofinformation|title=GCHQ mother: My girl is not a traitor|last=Bright|first=Martin|date=2004-02-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the court case, Gun said "I'm just baffled that in the 21st century we as human beings are still dropping bombs on each other as a means to resolve issues."{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Later life==
Gun received the [[Sam Adams Award]] for 2003 and was supported in her case by the UK human rights [[pressure group]] [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and in the US by the [[Institute for Public Accuracy]].  Following the dropping of the case, Liberty commented "One wonders whether disclosure in this criminal trial might have been a little too embarrassing."{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Two years after her trial, Katharine Gun wrote an article entitled "Iran: Time to Leak" (20 March 2006), which asked [[whistleblower]]s to make public information about plans for a potential war against [[Iran]]. She urged "those in a position to do so to disclose information which relates to this planned aggression; legal advice, meetings between the [[White House]] and other intelligence agencies, assessments of Iran's threat level (or better yet, evidence that assessments have been altered), troop deployments and army notifications. Don't let "the intelligence and the facts be fixed around the policy" this time."{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In February 2018, it was announced that a film, ''[[Official Secrets (film)|Official Secrets]]'', recounting Gun's actions in 2003 was due to begin filming in March 2018 with [[Keira Knightley]] taking the part of Gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|title=Keira Knightley, Matt Smith to Star in Real-Life Spy Thriller 'Official Secrets'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/keira-knightley-matt-smith-star-real-life-spy-thriller-official-secrets-1083955|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, Daniel Ellsberg praised the swiftness and importance of Gun taking action, saying it was in some ways more significant than his own whistleblowing on the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/257307270 Daniel Ellsberg speaking about Katharine Gun - 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Klaus Krippendorff was born in 1932 in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]]. In 1954, he graduated with an engineering degree from the State Engineering School [[Hannover]]. In 1961, he graduated as diplom-designer from the [[Ulm School of Design]] (Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm), Germany. And in 1967, he received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[communication]]s from the pioneering Institute for Communication Research at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

Krippendorff started to work as an engineer and during the last year of his graduate study of [[design]] he was a Research Assistant at the Institute for Visual Perception at the [[Ulm School of Design]]. In 1961 he came to the United States with a two-year Ford International Fellowship, first to [[Princeton University]] but completing his second graduate education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1964, he joined the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = "KK CV"&gt;[http://www.asc.upenn.edu/usr/krippendorff/page2vita.htm CV Klaus Krippendorff], retrieved September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is or was a member of the editorial boards of multiple academic journals, such as ''Communication and Information Science'', ''Communication Research'', ''Constructivist Foundations'', ''[[Cybernetics and Human Knowing|Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing]]'', ''International Journal of Cultural Studies'' and the ''Journal of Communication''.&lt;ref name = "KK CV"/&gt;

In 1971, he was awarded an honorary MA from the University of Pennsylvania. In the same year, he received an award for "On Generating Data in Communication Research" as the most outstanding contribution to ''The Journal of Communication,'' published in 1970. In 1979, he became a Fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences. He was elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1982, fellow of the International Communication Association (ICA) in 1985, and fellow of the Japanese Society for Science and Design Studies in 1998.

In 1998, graduate students named him as the teacher of the best doctoral course taken at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2000, he became the Gregory Bateson professor for Cybernetics, Language, and Culture at the Annenberg School for Communication. In 2001 he was awarded the Norbert Wiener Medal in Cybernetics in gold by the [[American Society for Cybernetics]]. Also in 2001, he received the ICA Fellows Book Award for his influential text ''Content Analysis, An Introduction to Its Methodology''. In 2004, he received the Norbert Wiener/Hermann Schmidt Prize from the German Society for Cybernetics and German Society for Pedagogy and Information, at the University of Vienna.&lt;ref name = "KK CV"/&gt;

In 2012, the [[Linnaeus University]] in [[Kalmar]]/[[Växjö]], Sweden, awarded him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy ''honoris causa.''

'''Linda Lingle''' (''née'' '''Cutter'''; June 4, 1953) is an American politician, who was the [[List of Governors of Hawaii|sixth governor of Hawaii]] from 2002 until 2010. She was the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor of Hawaii since 1962. Lingle was also the first [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] of Hawaii and its first Jewish governor. Prior to serving as governor, Lingle served as [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]] mayor, council member, and chair of the [[Hawaii Republican Party]].

During the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] in New York City, Lingle served as chair of the convention during the absence of permanent chair [[Dennis Hastert]] from the convention floor. She was the 2012 [[United States Senate election in Hawaii, 2012|Republican nominee for the United States Senate]], vying unsuccessfully for an open seat vacated by retiring U.S. Senator [[Daniel Akaka]].&lt;ref name="WaPo 2012 announce"&gt;{{cite news| last=Blake | first= Aaron | title=Chris Cillizza's The Fix: Former governor Linda Lingle to run for Senate in Hawaii | date=October 11, 2011 | newspaper=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/former-governor-linda-lingle-to-run-for-senate-in-hawaii/2011/10/11/gIQARlVYcL_blog.html | accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star-Advertiser 2012 announce"&gt;{{cite news| last=DePledge | first=Derrick | title=Lingle joins U.S. Senate race | date=October 11, 2011 | newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser | url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/131499778.html | accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Lingle was appointed as a senior adviser to Illinois Governor [[Bruce Rauner]].&lt;ref name=CBSRauner&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/01/22/rauner-imports-former-hawaii-governor-to-be-top-aide/ |title=Rauner Imports Former Hawaii Governor To Be Top Aide |publisher=CBS Chicago |date=January 22, 2015 |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves on the Governors’ Council of the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] in Washington, D.C.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Lingle was born '''Linda Cutter''' to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/lingle-linda |encyclopedia=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |title=Linda Lingle |first=Robert D. |last=Johnston |date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1953, the daughter of Mildred and Richard Cutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.midweek.com/coverstory/coverstory010505.html |title=Governor Linda Lingle |newspaper=MidWeek |first=Dan |last=Boylan |date=January 5, 2005 |accessdate=June 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingle moved with her parents to [[Southern California]] when she was 12. She graduated from [[Birmingham High School]] in [[Lake Balboa, California]] (at that time, part of [[Van Nuys]]), then received her bachelor's degree in journalism ''cum laude'' from [[California State University, Northridge]], in 1975.

Soon after that, she followed her father to Hawaii, working first in [[Honolulu]] as a public information officer for the [[Teamsters]] and Hotel Workers Union. Later, she moved to [[Molokai]], where she started the ''Molokai Free Press'', a community newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenspeecharchive.org/women/profile/index.cfm?ProfileID=29&amp;printfriendly=1 |title=Women's Political Communication Archive&amp;nbsp;– Linda Lingle |publisher=Iowa State University Carrie Chapman Catt Center |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==County politics==
In 1980, Lingle was elected to the [[Maui County]] Council, where she served five two-year terms. Lingle served three of those terms representing Molokai and two terms as an at-large member. Upon the 1990 retirement of [[Hannibal Tavares]] as [[Mayor of Maui|mayor of Maui County]], Lingle decided to challenge former Maui mayor and Hawai'i State Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Elmer Cravalho]] for the seat. Despite polls showing Lingle trailing far behind her [[Democratic Party of Hawaii|Democratic]] opponent, Lingle proved victorious. The ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'' and ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' newspapers declared the election one of the biggest upsets in Hawai'i political history. She became the youngest person elected to the office of Maui County Mayor, at the age of 37, as well as the first woman. She was sworn into office as Mayor of Maui on January 2, 1991.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite news |title=Other Hawai'i mayors who died in office |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jun/23/br/hawaii80623070.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=The late Hannibal Tavares won the mayor's seat in a special election in October 1979 to complete Cravalho's term. He became Maui's longest serving mayor, serving until Jan. 2, 1991.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Lingle easily won re-election over her Democratic opponent, Maui County councilman [[Goro Hokama]].&lt;ref name=hsb&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary T. |last=Kubota|title=Maui honors councilman's legacy; A service celebrates Goro Hokama's work in politics and labor |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/05/29/news/story7.html |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |publisher= |date=2004-05-29 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Lingle's leadership, Maui County implemented performance-based budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mauimagazine.net/Maui-Magazine/May-June-2008/10-Most-Intriguing-People/index.php?cparticle=6&amp;siarticle=5 |magazine=Maui Magazine |date=May–June 2008 |title=10 Most Intriguing People |last=Sten |first=Michael |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=Her achievements on Maui, where she gained high marks for performance-based budgeting and stimulating job growth, helped propel her to higher office – as Hawai‘i’s first female governor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successful passage and execution earned for Lingle the ''Distinguished Budget Presentation Award'' from the [[Government Finance Officers Association]] for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/linglelinda.html |title=Linda Lingle |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library / The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=Thanks to her leadership, Maui County received the "Government Finance Officers Association Distinguished Budget Presentation Award" for four consecutive years....}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Lingle was also credited for attracting tourism and job growth to Maui County during a period when the state tourism industry was struggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/special/election2002/2002/Oct/27/ln/ln03a.html |title=The Lingle Record: Taxes, spending, growth advanced on her watch |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=October 27, 2002 |first=Kevin |last=Dayton |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=Lingle points out that Maui County led the state in job creation during her time as mayor, with the average monthly wage and salary job count increasing by more than 15 percent from 1990 to 1998. Statewide, the job count increased by only two-tenth of 1 percent during the same years. The job growth in Maui was led by hotels, which increased their employment by more than 19 percent, as well as in retailing and government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998 gubernatorial campaign==
{{Main|Hawaii gubernatorial election, 1998}}

Lingle would once again attempt an upset victory, this time in pursuit of the governor's office in 1998. Barred from seeking a third term as mayor of Maui, Lingle was nominated by the Hawai{{okina}}i Republican Party to run against incumbent Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]]. Republican party members believed that Lingle was the best shot at the office and that 1998 would probably be the only chance the party would have of ever winning. Lingle capitalized on the anger of Hawai{{okina}}i residents over the stagnant economy and their dissatisfaction with the strategies employed by the Democrats in attempt to solve the problem. Cayetano trailed in the media polls heading into the November election but on the evening of the election, Cayetano and Lingle were separated by a single percentage point forcing a recount. Lingle was defeated in the closest election in Hawai{{okina}}i history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq5lingle |title=Linda Lingle |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |first=Mike |last=Gordon |date=July 2, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=Lingle lost by the slimmest margin in Hawai'i history&amp;nbsp;– 1.3 percent&amp;nbsp;– prompting a recount that confirmed the results.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state Democratic Party was accused of launching a [[whisper campaign]] alleging that Lingle was a lesbian, and that she would abolish Christmas as a state holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/1999/03/02/editorial/editorials.html |title=Lingle smear charge shouldn’t be dismissed |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Editorials |date=March 2, 1999 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Governor Cayetano had given state workers all of Christmas Eve day off, and other local government leaders followed suit&amp;nbsp;– except then-Maui County Mayor Lingle, who said it would be too costly.

==State party chair==
[[Image:Linda Lingle navy 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Linda Lingle smashes a bottle of champagne against the sail of the {{USS|Hawaii|SSN-776}} during the ship's christening ceremony.]]
After being defeated, Lingle was elected chair of the Hawai{{okina}}i [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]]. She served from 1999 to 2002. During her tenure as party chair, Lingle overhauled party policies and gave the party a lift she believed was needed to make the party competitive in a historically [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]-dominated state. Internal reforms proved successful and Lingle succeeded in electing more Republicans to seats in both houses of the Hawai{{okina}}i State Legislature. At the peak of Republican success, the party held 19 of the 51 seats in the state House of Representatives. Party membership grew as younger people joined. Republicans gained a more youthful appearance and had reinvented itself informally as the new GOP Hawai{{okina}}i. Lingle is a member of [[The Wish List (political organization)|The Wish List]], America's largest fundraising and campaign [[political action committee]] for Pro-choice Republican Women and The Republican Majority for Choice.

==Governor of Hawaii==

===2002 gubernatorial campaign===
{{Main|Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2002}}

Barred from seeking a third term, Cayetano announced his retirement from political service in 2002. Having become even more popular among Hawaii residents, Lingle was nominated as the Republican candidate for the office of Governor of Hawaii. Her campaign was substantially aided when the popular favorite, Democratic Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] withdrew after allegations of campaign finance irregularities.  Hawaii Democrats then nominated incumbent Lieutenant Governor [[Mazie Hirono]]; it was one of the few gubernatorial races in which both major candidates were women.

Lingle ran on her "Agenda for New Beginnings," a campaign platform developed to promote Republican leadership and highlight their criticisms of the previous 40 years of Democratic administration of the state. It also cited differences between Lingle's message and the previous, more conservative platforms which Hawaii Republicans had advocated.

Focusing less on her mayoral accomplishments and more on the message of reform, Lingle won the election alongside former state judge [[Duke Aiona]], who became Lingle's lieutenant governor.

Lingle was the first state Governor-elect not to be inaugurated at the Coronation Pavilion on the grounds of [[Iolani Palace]]. She was inaugurated in the rotunda of the [[Hawaii State Capitol]]. She took the [[oath of office]] upon a [[Tanakh]].

===First term===
Lingle signed into law the [[Three-strikes law|Three Strikes Law]] and [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry Website Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republicanleague.org/2010/05/ |title=A Tale of Two Women |date=May 2010 |first=Mark |last=Herrick |publisher=California Republican League |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728172247/http://republicanleague.org/2010/05/ |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals in Hawaii to provide [[emergency contraception]] to rape victims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?id=7904 |title=Hawaii Governor Vetoes EC Bill; State Lawmakers Consider Override |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |date=July 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerned that Catholic hospitals would challenge it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82846067.html |title=Drive for Rape-Victim Contraception Slows |agency=Associated Press |first=David |last=Crary |date=September 27, 2003 |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004 Lingle led a delegation to [[Israel]], paid for by the [[Israeli Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/11/ln/ln29a.html |title=Lingle, Hawai'i delegation to visit Israel next week |first=B.J. |last=Reyes |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |agency=Associated Press |date=May 11, 2004 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=The Israeli government is paying all expenses for Lingle, Aiona, the governor's communications adviser Lenny Klompus, and half the expenses for Kunimoto and Koller.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/25/ln/ln46a.html |title=Lingle backs Bush on Iraq, Israel policies |last=Dunford |first=Bruce |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |agency=Associated Press |date=May 25, 2004 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |quote=Lingle returned to her office yesterday after a weeklong trip&amp;nbsp;– along with a 27-member delegation&amp;nbsp;– to Israel, where she met with top leaders and discussed agricultural cooperation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She enjoyed high approval ratings, usually around 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/raceprofile_HAWAIIGOV.html |title=The Hawaii Governor’s Race |first=Jesse |last=McKinley |newspaper=The New York Times |quote=Ms. Lingle&amp;nbsp;– who has regularly enjoyed approval ratings over 70 percent&amp;nbsp;– is one of the least nervous Republicans around. |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingle spent much of 2004 campaigning for Republican candidates, both in the Presidential election and the Hawaii state legislature.  She supported President [[George W. Bush]]'s Iraq policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/25/ln/ln46a.html |title=Lingle backs Bush on Iraq, Israel policies |last=Dunford |first=Bruce |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |agency=Associated Press |date=May 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |quote=Republican Gov. Linda Lingle expressed support yesterday for President Bush's Iraq policies, which she believes protect the security interests of the United States and keep the fight against terrorism there.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigned for Bush in the [[contiguous United States]].  When some polling late in the election showed Bush tied or narrowly leading Democrat [[John Kerry]], Lingle attempted to help Republicans carry her state for the first time since 1984. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] also campaigned in the state.  The state legislature had a Democratic supermajority and she wanted to have enough members to block them from overriding her vetoes. Ultimately, not only did Kerry win the state, but Republicans lost five seats in the state legislature, reducing their presence to near single-digits and causing the Democrats to consider Lingle more vulnerable than they initially expected. In spite of their new confidence, Lingle was re-elected after her 2006 re-election campaign.

In education, she attempted to divide the State Board of Education into seven local school boards, but failed. One of the more controversial issues Lingle has championed is the practice of sending prisoners to the mainland, as opposed to building a new prison in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borreca |first=Richard |url=http://starbulletin.com/2006/07/14/news/story01.html |title=Lingle ends push for new prisons |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=July 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 gubernatorial election===
{{Main|Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2006}}
[[File:Linda Lingle navy 1-cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Linda Lingle in December 2006]]

In 2006, Lingle announced her candidacy for re-election as Governor of Hawai{{okina}}i. In the Democratic Party, many people were speculated to run, but many of them declined, including State Senator [[Colleen Hanabusa]], then Senate President [[Robert Bunda|Bobby Bunda]], former Congressman [[Ed Case]] (who ran for U.S. Senate), U.S. Congressman [[Neil Abercrombie]], and [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawaii County]] Mayor [[Harry Kim (politician)|Harry Kim]]. Despite the difficulty of finding an opponent for Lingle, former State Senator [[Randy Iwase]] decided to run for Governor. In the primary election he easily defeated Waianae Harbormaster [[William Aila Jr.]], and ended up with former Big Island State Senator [[Malama Solomon]] as his running mate. Over the course of the campaign, Iwase was considered an underdog who had only spent $340,000, compared to Lingle's $6 million; in his ads, he attacked Lingle over her relationship with President Bush. Governor Lingle won by the largest margin in state history, 63 percent to 35 percent.

===Second term===
In August 2007, the Hawaii Supreme Court invalidated a Lingle appointee's exemption of the [[Hawaii Superferry]] from having to undertake an environmental assessment before operating in Hawaii waters. The Superferry was an $80 million high-speed ferry. Despite the Court's ruling, the ferry sailed to Kauai without an environmental assessment. It was met by protesters on surfboards who turned the ferry back to Oahu. Lingle summoned a massive police and [[Coast Guard]] response. She told Kauai protesters that they would be charged under Hawaii's anti-terrorism laws if they continued to interfere with the Superferry's operation.&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/surfers-vs-superferry |title=Surfers vs. the Superferry |magazine=The Nation |date=March 16, 2009 |first1=Jerry |last1=Manders |first2=Koohan |last2=Paik |quote=Her purpose was to instruct people that if they repeated their protests, they would be charged under new anti-terrorism laws that carry prison terms up to five years and/or a $10,000 fine. |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingle sought a legislative exemption from environmental law on behalf of the Superferry (known as Act Two). Several Maui groups, including the [[Sierra Club]], Maui Tomorrow and the Kahului Harbor Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, citing a violation of [[separation of powers]], and favoritism towards a single company. The ferry suspended all Hawaii service in March 2009, days after the Hawaii Supreme Court struck down Act Two as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nation-2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/hawaii-court-backs-protestors-vs-superferry |title=Hawaii Court Backs Protestors vs. Superferry |magazine=The Nation |date=April 6, 2009 |first1=Jerry |last1=Manders |first2=Koohan |last2=Paik |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008 Republican Convention
As she had four years before, Lingle campaigned for the Republican ticket, describing herself as "of the same breed as McCain and Palin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/14146/hawaii-s-gop-governor-stands-out-/#ixzz25MqsNe94|accessdate=7 September 2012|title=Hawaii’s GOP Governor Stands Out|newspaper=Jewish Daily Forward|date=September 4, 2008|first=Brett|last=Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She received national exposure when she delivered a primetime address on the third night of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] praising [[John McCain]]'s choice of [[Governor of Alaska|Alaska Governor]] [[Sarah Palin]] as his vice-presidential running-mate.&lt;ref name=palin&gt;Honolulu Advertiser. [http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20080904/NEWS05/809040362/Lingle-lauds-truly-authentic-Palin Lingle lauds 'truly authentic' Palin]. Sept. 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingle and Palin, both Republican [[List of female state governors in the United States|women governors]] of non-[[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]], are friends who grew acquainted through the [[Republican Governors Association]].&lt;ref name=palin /&gt; Lingle's speech filled the role of the traditional address formally nominating the vice-presidential candidate, though Palin was not officially nominated until the next night.

;Health care policies targeting legal immigrants and Compact of Free Association residents
In July 2009, the Lingle Administration ended the Hawai{{okina}}i Immigrant Health Initiative, a state program providing medical coverage for legal immigrants present in the United States for fewer than five years.  This move included the elimination of all residents present in Hawai{{okina}}i under the [[Compact of Free Association]] from QUEST, the state’s Medicaid coverage plan that assists the low income population in Hawai{{okina}}i with their health care needs. Noting that such a policy likely constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, federal district court judge [[John Michael Seabright]] issued a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the substituted health care plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Korab v.

On April 13, 2010, two student protesters who were occupying her office were arrested and criminal trespassing citations were issued to eight others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/global/story.asp?s=12307143 |title=Protestors arrested at Governor Lingle's office |publisher=Hawaii News Now |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sitin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20100413/BREAKING01/100413055/Two+arrested++8+others+cited+on+day+7+of+furlough+sit-in |title=2 Hawaii protesters arrested, 8 others ticketed for school furlough sit-in |publisher=Honolulu Star Advertiser |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators were part of a sit-in to protest a school furlough policy implemented due to budget shortages.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press.

April 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, April 14, two more protesters were arrested and citations were issued to five other protesters.&lt;ref name="sitin"/&gt;

;Civil union veto
Lingle on July 6, 2010 vetoed [[Hawaii House Bill 444]], which would have allowed for [[civil union]]s [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hawaii#Civil unions|for couples in Hawaii]], arguing the issue should be decided by referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaii governor vetoes same-sex civil unions bill|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 6, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-07-06-hawaii-civil-unions-veto_N.htm|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had passed the State House with three votes less than the two-thirds vote threshold necessary to override the veto, although the bill met that threshold in the State Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Reyes | first=B.J. | title=Veto override session dead | date=July 7, 2012 | newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser | url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20100703_veto_override_session_dead.html | accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
{{Main|United States Senate election in Hawaii, 2012}}

In October 2011, Lingle said on [[KSSK-FM|KSSK]] radio show that she would run for the open seat vacated by retiring U.S. Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] (D-HI).&lt;ref name="WaPo 2012 announce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Star-Advertiser 2012 announce" /&gt; She won the Republican primary election on August 11, 2012 against nominal opposition and faced Hirono in the general election&amp;nbsp;– a repeat of the 2002 gubernatorial race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/elections/results/2012/primary/elections/results/2012/primary/files/histatewide.pdf |title=Primary Election 2012&amp;nbsp;– State of Hawaii&amp;nbsp;– Final Summary Report |publisher=State of Hawaii, Office of Elections |date=August 12, 2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingle was the first reasonably well-funded Republican to run for the Senate in Hawaii since [[Pat Saiki]] ran in the 1990 special election against Akaka, and the strongest Republican candidate for a full term in the Senate from the state in memory.  Although a poll in the summer of 2012 showed the race as close as five points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2012/06/12/16045-civil-beat-poll-case-hirono-tied-in-hawaii-us-senate-race/#2 |title=Civil Beat Poll&amp;nbsp;– Case, Hirono Tied In Hawaii U.S. Senate Race |newspaper=Civil Beat |publisher=Peer News |date=June 12, 2012 |first=Michael |last=Levine |accessdate=December 25, 2012 |quote=Hirono holds an early 49 percent to 44 percent lead over Lingle }}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately Hirono defeated Lingle with 63 percent of the vote to Lingle's 37 percent.

==After 2012==
After her failed Senate bid, Lingle taught a public policy seminar at [[California State University, Northridge]], from which she had graduated in 1975. She also gave lectures and worked with the Governor's Council and Energy Security Council for the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]].&lt;ref name=HSA&gt;{{cite news |title=Illinois governor adds Lingle to staff |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser |date=January 23, 2015 |first=Timothy |last=Hurley |pages=A19, A23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Lingle was appointed as a senior adviser to Illinois Governor [[Bruce Rauner]].&lt;ref name=CBSRauner /&gt;  She was to join a trio of outsiders in May/June 2015 to work on problems such as the state's retirement system and low credit ratings.&lt;ref name=HSA/&gt;  Lingle left the chief operating officer position in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sj-r.com/news/20160701/former-hawaii-gov-lingle-leaves-rauner-administration-new-epa-head-also-named |title=Former Hawaii Gov.

In January 2017, Lingle announced at a Republican gathering that she planned to move back to Hawaii in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/honolulu-star-advertiser/20170105/281530815700294 |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser |via=PressReader |date=January 5, 2017 |access-date=December 12, 2017 |first=Sophie |last=Cooke |title=Former Gov.

==Personal life==
Lingle was married and divorced twice. She married her first husband, Charles Lingle, while in college, in 1972. Upon leaving California for Hawaii, she divorced him in 1975 but kept the Lingle name. During her term as mayor of Maui County, Lingle divorced her second husband, Maui attorney William Crockett, to whom she was married from 1986 to 1997. Lingle is currently single and does not have any children.

Her uncle founded the Cutter [[Ford]] car dealerships in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borreca |first=Richard |url=http://starbulletin.com/98/07/13/news/story2.html |title=In Their Words: Linda Lingle |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=July 13, 1998 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingle is active in the [[Republican Jewish Coalition]], serving as a speaker at events and otherwise using her role as the only Jewish Republican US governor.
President [[George W. Bush]] appointed her to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to [[Jerusalem]] for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the [[State of Israel]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lake |first=Eli |url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/bush-visit-may-boost-olmert/76303/ |title=Bush Visit May Boost Olmert |work=The New York Sun |date=May 13, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian of the Year Award''' is given annually on [[Australia Day]]. The announcement of the award has become a major public event in Australia, and is televised nationwide. The award "offers an insight into Australian identity, reflecting the nation's evolving relationship with world, the role of sport in Australian culture, the impact of multiculturalism, and the special status of Australia's Indigenous people".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/the-awards/awards-history/&lt;/ref&gt; The award is unique in that it is sponsored by a national government and commands broad public support.

The following is a list of the recipients of the [[Australian of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/ Australian of the Year - Honour Roll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis, Wendy]] | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">Captain '''Martin Gerard Bayerle''' (born April 23, 1951) is an American [[treasure hunting|treasure hunter]] and author, best known for finding the 1909 shipwreck of the [[White Star Line]]r [[RMS Republic]].

The ''Republic'' was the largest ship to sink in history to her day, only to be eclipsed by the loss of [[RMS Titanic]] in 1912.  Capt.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Martin was born in St. Albans Naval Hospital in [[Queens, New York]], and grew up in the [[Brighton Beach]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ''Fatal Obsession,'' August 22, 1993, Vol. 67 No. 22, A:1, A:12 by Mark S. Warnick.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Gerard, was a lawyer and lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. His mother, Ruth, was a German immigrant who came to the United States following World War II.  Martin lost sight in his left eye from a small explosives accident when he was 11 years old.&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  He first began [[scuba diving]] off the coast of New Jersey and New York at the age of 15 and went on to graduate from [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in February 1969.

===Early career===
Martin attended [[Brooklyn College]] in New York from 1969 through 1972 where he majored in [[Geology]].&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  He taught scuba diving as a student and adjunct professor within the Adult Education Department; during his time there until he opened up a dive shop - Brooklyn Divers Supply Corp. – in 1972.&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  He began running dive operations to local shipwreck sites, such as the ''Mistletoe'', ''Black Warrior'', ''[[USS Turner (DD-648)]]'', ''[[SS Oregon (1883)|Oregon]]'', and ''[[U-853]]'', among others.  He trained about 1,200 people how to scuba dive and became a Master [[PADI]] SCUBA instructor in 1975 (# M1761).

Brooklyn Divers was operated successfully until 1978, when the company’s source of supply and advertisements was abruptly cut off.  Martin sued eight SCUBA company defendants for price fixing conspiracy under the [[Sherman Act]] and reached a six-figure settlement once the case went to trial in federal court in the [[Southern District of New York]] (''Brooklyn Diver Supply Corp. v ScubaPro, Petersen Publications, Dacor, NASDS ...'' – and other major components of the sport SCUBA diving industry).&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  Martin then closed up his Brooklyn operations and moved to [[Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  There he obtained a captain’s license, pilot’s license, and established Martha’s Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. (MAVIS) to serve as a base of operations to attempt to locate the fabled shipwreck of the [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']].&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt; The ''Republic'' was the largest ship to sink in history when she sank off the U.S. East Coast in January 1909 and was rumored to be carrying a vast cargo of gold.

==Discovery and salvage of the RMS ''Republic''==
After two and a half years of preparatory research to determine the wreck’s location, Capt. Bayerle discovered the wreck of the [[RMS Republic|RMS ''Republic'']] in 1981.&lt;ref name="TheAssociated"&gt;The Associated Press, June 28, 1983, Tuesday, AM cycle, Domestic News, 447 words. ''Sunken Luxury Liner Identified off Nantucket,'' FAIRHAVEN, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;  He raised investor capital and purchased the assets from a bankrupt Canadian offshore oil rig support company, Wolf Sub-Ocean Ltd., in addition to the purchase of a 285&amp;nbsp;ft [[Diving Support Vessel]], the ''Oil Endeavor'' (renamed the ''SOSI Inspector'') in the years following the find.  Martin also married during those years and he and his wife, Susan, gave birth to two children – a daughter, Tessa, and a son, Grant.&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  During the summer of 1987, Martin went out to perform a major [[Marine salvage|salvage]] on the ''Republic'' to try to recover the gold, an event that generated international media attention.  Capt. Bayerle was featured on television programs such as ''CBS Evening News,''&lt;ref&gt;CBS Evening News,  July 23, 1987, Thursday, 05:54:20 pm,  Headline: Salvage Operations / Titanic, Republic,  Duration 03:10,  (Studio: Dan Rather) Report introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; ''ABC Evening News'',&lt;ref&gt;ABC Evening News  August 5, 1987, Wednesday, 05:51:00 pm,  Headline: Massachusetts / Treasure Hunt,  Duration 02:40,  (Studio: Peter Jennings) Report introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ABC Good Morning America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p2whJcOKFY |title=Capt. Martin Bayerle interview on Good Morning America - RMS Republic |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 74-day salvage was also closely followed in international periodicals, such as ''Forbes,''&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, ''Romancing the wreck (limited partnerships in sunken ships),''  September 7, 1987,  Pg. 116:2,  326 words.  William G. Flanagan&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times,''&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, July 19, 1987, Sunday, Late City Final Edition, Section 1; Part 2, Page 31, Column 3; National Desk, 614 words. ''Trinkets but Still No Gold at Wreck.'' By SETH S. KING, Special to the New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; ''Associated Press,''&lt;ref name="TheAssociated" /&gt; ''Japan Times'', ''London Times,'' &lt;ref&gt;The Times (London), July 20, 1986, Sunday, Issue 8450, 593 words. ''Gold and wine hoard is target of new dive / White Star Line passenger ship salvage'' by Askold Krushelnycky&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times,  July 31, 1987, Friday, Southland Edition,  Part 1; Page 2; Column 2; National Desk. ''THE NATION''&lt;/ref&gt; among many other major publications.

The 1987 salvage effort was successful in targeting and excavating their target area, but failed to locate the gold, however.  The crew excavated the target area but ended up in the ship’s wine locker, finding hundreds of pre-1900 bottles of wine and champagne.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press - Boston, MA ''Expedition to Sunken Ship Ends With Valuable Artifacts But No Gold''by Dana Kennedy, September 13, 1987, Sunday, AM cycle, Domestic News, 466 words.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once they realized they were in the wine locker rather than the specie room, Capt. Bayerle flew to London and appeared on [[ITV Network|ITV]] and [[BBC radio]], offering a £25,000 reward for the construction plans of the ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph Herald, Dubuque, Iowa. ''Salvor Looks for Help'' Aug. 17, 1987. 2A&lt;/ref&gt;  No one came forth with the plans to the ship, however, and the salvage was terminated for lack of funds.  Despite many years of research and effort, the plans to the ship still have never been found.

==Post-salvage life==
Following the salvage attempt, the 1987 joint venture disbanded and any artifacts brought up were sold at auction.  Martin moved to [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]], to live with his in-laws, the Youngs, on a small farm.&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  He finished his undergraduate education, earning B.Sc. and B.Sc.B.Adm. [[magna cum laude]] degrees from [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State College]] and went on to start his M.B.A. education from [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;  He was accepted into the [[West Virginia University College of Law|WVU College of Law]] in the fall of 1990 but would not complete his legal education there, however, as other personal events intervened.&lt;ref name="Fatal Obsession Part 1" /&gt;

== First-degree murder trial and manslaughter conviction ==
On April 6, 1991, Bayerle shot and killed 38-year old Stefano Robotti, the 'lover' of his alienated wife Susan, near [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y2MxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DaMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5374%2C7338940|title = Man on Trial for Slaying Wife's Lover|last = |first = |date = Dec 11, 1991|work = Reading Eagle|access-date = |via = Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that he "was protecting his family," although a legal and justifiable homicide defense of self or defense of family was not offered to the jury as an option. Evidence of the sexual exploitation of Bayerle's wife and children by the deceased was presented at trial. After a six-week trial, the jury vacillated between involuntary (a misdemeanor) and voluntary manslaughter, and found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter; Bayerle was sentenced to one to five years in State prison. He completed his sentence, with good time, in two-and-a-half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oa5RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YG4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6511%2C3984529|title = Fatal Obsession (series)|last = Warnick|first = Mark|date = August 25, 1993|work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date = |via = Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post conviction and release ==
Upon his release, Capt. Bayerle continued school in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], to complete his M.B.A. education in order to add credibility and depth to his research.  There, he started up an [[Internet Service Provider]] business that he ran for five years and established IDEA, the Internet Development and Exchange Association.&lt;ref&gt;The Denver Post, Nov. 13, 1999, ''E-mail "spat' being settled at e-snail's pace,'' BIZ section, C-01, written by Andrew Backover&lt;/ref&gt;  Capt. Bayerle moved back to [[Manhattan, New York City]], in 2002 to continue his years of research into the rumored gold cargo aboard the Republic.  From that research, he refined a trademarked Third Theory that identified the $3,000,000 1909-value secret transaction on board that was being shipped to the Tsar of Russia, [[Nicholas II|“Bloody” Nicholas II]], a gold cargo that today may be worth in excess of two billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypaul.com/74581/captain-martin-bayerle-the-lost-gold-of-the-republic-and-learning-about-the-gold-standard- |title=Captain Martin Bayerle, The Lost Gold of the Republic, and Learning about the Gold Standard &amp;#124; Peace . Gold . Liberty |publisher=Dailypaul.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
Capt. Bayerle subsequently started an archival research company specializing in retrieving records from government archives.  His old company, MAVIS, has since acquired [[legal title]] to the wreck of the RMS ''Republic'' and her contents, with the court also barring all future claims.&lt;ref name=courtcase /&gt;  After acquiring ownership of Republic, on August 1, 2013, Bayerle published the bulk of his significant research into the mystery of RMS Republic by releasing a book titled ''The Tsar's Treasure: The Sunken White Star Liner With a Billion Dollar Secret.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayerle|first=Martin|title=The Tsar’s Treasure|location=Miami Beach, FL|publisher=[[Barnburner Books LLC]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9888760-0-2|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Tsars-Treasure-Sunken-Billion/dp/0988876000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, MAVIS retained Etoile Blanc Consulting, LLC to manage investment and media properties related to the RMS Republic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etoileblanc.com/ Etoile Blanc Consulting, LLC website]&lt;/ref&gt; Investment opportunities are made available to Accredited Investors through Lords Of Fortune LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lordsoffortune.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=facts |title=The Millionaires' Ship  |publisher=lordsoffortune.com |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Bayerle's personal life is also the subject of an upcoming non-fiction book series, with the first book of the trilogy planned for release in mid-2018.  Plans to adapt the series into feature films are also in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvtimes.com/2013/07/30/billion-dollar-treasure-answer-waiting-off-nantucket-16627 |title=A billion dollar treasure: The answer is waiting off Nantucket, Calendar section, C-15, written by Jack Shea  |publisher=mvtimes.com |date=2013-07-30|accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;    MAVIS is currently preparing for a major recovery operation of the wreck planned for the summer seasons of 2018–2021.

Ret. Col. '''Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah''' ({{lang-ar|محمد خونا ولد هيداله}} ''Muḥammad Khouna Wald Haidallah'') (born 1940) was the [[Heads of State of Mauritania|head of state]] of [[Mauritania]] (Chairman of the [[Military Committee for National Salvation]], CMSN) from 4 January 1980 to 12 December 1984. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2003|2003 presidential election]] and the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]].

== Family background and early career ==
Born in 1940 in the Nouadhibou region (either in then-[[Spanish Sahara]]&lt;ref name="LOC_Consolidation"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mr0038) "Mauritania: Consolidation of Power"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; or colonial [[Mauritania]]{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}), into a family of the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] ''[[Laaroussien]]'' tribe, he passed to secondary education in [[Rosso]] near the border to [[France|French]]-administered [[Senegal]]. He earned a [[baccalaureat]] in [[science]] in [[Dakar]], Senegal, in 1961. After joining the Mauritanian army in 1962,&lt;ref name="rulers"&gt;[http://www.rulers.org/indexh1.html Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah], Rulers.org&lt;/ref&gt; he studied in French military colleges, notably [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]].

After 1975, he commanded forces in the north of Mauritania and [[Tiris al-Gharbiya]] ([[Western Sahara]]), in the war against [[Polisario Front]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, notably in the [[Zouerate]] region and [[Bir Moghrein]].&lt;ref name="rulers"/&gt; In 1978, with the country in severe disorder, he participated in a [[coup d'état]] that overthrew Mauritanian [[President of Mauritania|President]] [[Mokhtar Ould Daddah]]. As a member of the [[CRMN]] military [[Military dictatorship|junta]], he was promoted to the post of Chief of the General Staff.

== As head of CMSN ==
Haidallah became prime minister on 31 May 1979, a few days after the death in an [[airplane]] crash of the previous prime minister, Col. [[Ahmed Ould Bouceif]], with whom he had seized power for the CMSN just a month earlier, from Col. [[Mustafa Ould Salek]] and the CRMN. In January 1980 he seized power from Ould Salek's successor as [[head of state]], [[Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Louly]]. He continued to also hold the position of [[Prime Minister of Mauritania|Prime Minister]] until December of that year, when a civilian, [[Sid Ahmed Ould Bneijara]], was appointed to the post.&lt;ref name=Regime/&gt;

His reign was marked by severe political turbulence, as Mauritania extracted itself from the war with the [[Polisario Front]] — started by Ould Daddah in 1975 — and his regime faced a number of coup attempts and military intrigues.&lt;ref name="Regime"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/mauritania/22.htm "Mauritania: The Haidalla Regime"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1984-09-23"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E3DD143BF930A1575AC0A962948260 "Mauritanian Group Says It Killed Libyan in Rome"], ''[[New York Times]]'', September 23, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 1981 a coup attempt against Haidalla failed,.&lt;ref name="WP_1981-03-17"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/132087452.html?dids=132087452:132087452&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=MAR+17%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Mauritanian+Coup+Attempt+Fails+After+Bloody+Clashes&amp;pqatl=google "Mauritanian Coup Attempt Fails After Bloody Clashes"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 17, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Haidalla accused Morocco of being behind the coup, which Morocco denied, and in the next month [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]] was appointed Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=Regime/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1981-04-27"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E2DA1638F934A15757C0A967948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fMauritania "Career Soldier Takes Over As Premier of Mauritania"], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 27, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempted coup was allegedly sponsored by Libya.&lt;ref name="LOC_Consolidation"/&gt;

In March 1984, Haidallah took the office of Prime Minister again, replacing Taya, in a move to strengthen his personal power.&lt;ref name="Regime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Disintegration"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mr0039) "Mauritania: Political Disintegration"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, however, Taya ousted Haidallah in a coup while the latter was out of the country. Haidalla had been at a [[Franco-African Summit]] in [[Burundi]]&lt;ref name="NYT_1984-12-14"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E0DF1338F937A25751C1A962948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fMauritania "Mauritania's President Arrested by Coup Leader"], UPI, ''[[New York Times]]'', December 14, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA_2007-03-07"&gt;[http://apanews.net/article_eng.php3?id_article=22922 "Former Mauritanian President Ould Haidalla seeks new term in office"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[African Press Agency]], March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and learned of the coup in [[Brazzaville]], during his return to Mauritania, from [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]], the president of the [[Republic of the Congo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Haidallah returned to Mauritania anyway and was arrested at the airport in [[Nouakchott]]; he was eventually released in December 1988.&lt;ref name="APA_2007-03-07"/&gt; Taya promised to install [[democracy]], but his rule was considered dictatorial by many; he was deposed by a military coup in 2005.

=== Foreign policy ===
Haidallah's main achievement was to make peace with the [[Western Sahara]]-based [[Polisario Front]], which had been fighting Mauritania since it annexed part of the former [[Spanish Sahara|Spanish colony]] in 1975. The CMSN opted for complete withdrawal from the conflict, evacuating southern [[Rio de Oro]] (which had been annexed as [[Tiris El Gharbiya]]) and recognizing the POLISARIO as the representative of the [[Sahrawi people]]. This led to a crisis in relations with the country's until-then ally Morocco, which had similarly annexed the remainder of Western Sahara, with Haidallah's government facing an attempted coup, troop clashes and military tension.&lt;ref name="Regime"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.net/mauritainia/ma_polisario.htm "Mauritania: The Polisario Problem"], Arab.net.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations were completely severed between 1981 and 1985, when they were restored by Haidalla's successor.&lt;ref name="LOC_Regional"&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-8584.html "Mauritania: Regional Security Concerns"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/mauritania/64.htm "Mauritania: Morocco"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, relations improved with POLISARIO's main regional backer, [[Algeria]], with the Algerian government sending arms and supplies to bolster his regime.&lt;ref name="LOC_Consolidation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LOC_Maghrib"&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-8576.html Mauritania: Relations with Other States of the Maghrib], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; Haidalla's 1984 recognition of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR, the POLISARIO's [[government-in-exile]]) as a sovereign nation appears to have been one of the triggering causes for Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's coup in 1984.&lt;ref name="LOC_Regional"/&gt;

===Domestic policy===
On the domestic front, his most notable policies were the institution of Islamic [[sharia]] law in 1980-83,&lt;ref name="lexicorient"&gt;[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/mauritania_5.htm "Mauritania: History"], ''Encyclopædia of the Orient''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several failed attempts to rebuild the political system shattered by the 1978 coup — first as a multiparty system, and then, after the first coup attempt against him, as a one-party state.&lt;ref name="LOC_Consolidation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicorient"/&gt; It was also during Haidallah's rule that [[slavery]] was formally abolished in Mauritania, although the practice continues at a diminished level still today. He made a statement announcing the abolition of slavery in July 1980, and this was followed by a legal decree in November 1981.&lt;ref name="AI_2002-11-07"&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAFR380032002!Open "Mauritania: A future free from slavery?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107205340/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAFR380032002!Open |date=2005-01-07 }}, ''[[Amnesty International]]'', November 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Political opponents were treated harshly, with imprisonments&lt;ref name=Enters&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/28/africa/AF_POL_Mauritania_Elections.php "Mauritanian ruler from the 1980s enters post-coup presidential race"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and those responsible for one of the failed coups against his government were executed.

== Activities after losing power ==
After returning to Mauritania in 1984, Haidallah was held in administrative detention for several years by Ould Taya, during which time he fell sick. After his release, he stayed outside politics until 2003, when he returned to head the opposition. He then unsuccessfully ran for president against Taya in November, campaigning on a moderately [[Islamist]] platform, whereas Taya, who had established full diplomatic ties with [[Israel]], was considered pro-Western. Haidallah officially came in second with about 19% of the vote, although he alleged fraud; he was arrested immediately after the election, accused of plotting a coup.&lt;ref name="afrol"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=47459 "MAURITANIA: Ould Haidallah trial to begin on Monday"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 27 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Haidallah had also been briefly detained just prior to the vote.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2003-11-09"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3254431.stm "Top Mauritanian politician held"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', November 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAFR380102003?open&amp;of=ENG-MRT "Mauritania: Fear of ill-treatment or torture / Incommunicado detention / Medical concern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128223646/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAFR380102003?open&amp;of=ENG-MRT |date=2006-11-28 }}, ''[[Amnesty International]]'', 14 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2003-11-10"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3256567.stm "Charges for Mauritania candidate"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', November 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=47144 "Peaceful election, but opposition cries foul"], ''[[IRIN]]'', November 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, 2003 he received a five-year suspended sentence and therefore was set free, but barred from politics for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=47832 "Haidalla walks free with suspended sentence"], ''[[IRIN]]'', December 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An appeals court confirmed this sentence in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=49617 "Opposition leader stripped of political rights as putchists prepare to face trial"], ''[[IRIN]]'', April 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in April, his supporters attempted to register a political party, the [[Party for Democratic Convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=49446 "Mauritania: Haidalla supporters create new opposition party"], ''[[IRIN]]'', April 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haidalla was arrested again on November 3, 2004, accused of involvement in coup plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=51946 "Mauritania: Three opposition leaders arrested in connection with coup plots"], ''[[IRIN]]'', November 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor sought a five-year prison sentence, but he was acquitted on February 3, 2005 at the end of a mass trial of 195 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=52899 "Mauritania: Coup plotters get life in prison but escape death sentence"], ''[[IRIN]]'', February 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== After the 2005 coup ==
Following a military coup against Taya in August 2005, an amnesty in early September freed Haidallah from his sentence, along with more than a hundred others sentenced for political offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.middle-east-online.com/English/mauritania/?id=14508 |title= Political exiles flocking back to Mauritania |work= Middle East Online| date= 12 September 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061020021104/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/mauritania/?id=14508 | archivedate= 20 October 2006 | accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 27, 2006, Haidalla announced that he would be a candidate in [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2007|the presidential election]] scheduled for March 11, 2007.&lt;ref name=Enters/&gt; He campaigned on a nationalist-Islamist platform,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} citing the struggle against poverty and slavery as priorities.&lt;ref name=Enters/&gt; On February 3, he gained the support of another registered presidential candidate, former opposition politician and prisoner under Ould Taya, [[Chbih Ould Cheikh Melainine]], who dropped out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2007/fevrier/3/3.html |title= Ch'Bih Ould Cheikh Melainine retire sa candidature à la présidentielle de mars 2007 |publisher= Agence Mauritanienne d'Information |date= 3 February 2007 |language= fr |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070327102711/http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2007/fevrier/3/3.html |archivedate= 27 March 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cridem.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=7041 |title= Nouvelle coalition de parti et Ould Cheikh Melainine se retire en faveur de Ould Haidalla |work= Convergence Républicaine pour l'Instauration de la Democratie en Mauritanie |date= 3 February 2007 |language= fr |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074948/http://www.cridem.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=7041 |archivedate= 28 September 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no longer having the political base that came with being the main candidate of the opposition under Ould Taya, Haidallah was even less successful in the 2007 election, coming in tenth place and receiving 1.73% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2007/mars/15/5.html|title= Le conseil constitutionnel proclame les résultats du premier tour de l'élection présidentielles du 11 mars 2007|publisher= Agence Mauritanienne d'Information|date= 15 March 2007|language= fr}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, which was won by [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]], Haidalla announced his support for Abdallahi in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=45108 "Former Mauritanian leader pledges support for current president"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, African Press Agency, October 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following [[2008 Mauritanian coup d'état|the coup that ousted Abdallahi]] in August 2008, Haidalla expressed his support for the coup in a statement on August 29, 2008, saying that it was necessary under the circumstances and urging all Mauritanians to support it. He also criticized the negative reactions of Western governments to the coup, alleging that they were interfering in Mauritanian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article&amp;id_article=73968|title= L’ancien président Ould Haidalla défend le nouveau pouvoir en Mauritanie|publisher= African Press Agency|date= 29 August 2008|language= fr}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla (Mohamed Khouna's son) was detained in Morocco for [[drug trafficking]] charges. In 2008 he was judged and condemned to 7 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= La Cour d'appel condamne les accusés à des peines de prison | url= http://www.lematin.ma/Actualite/Express/Article.asp?id=100147 | publisher= [[Le Matin du Sahara et du Maghreb|Le Matin]] | date= 2008-10-17 | accessdate= 2010-05-08|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2010, Haidallah wrote an open letter to the heads of state who have good relations with the [[king of Morocco]], requesting for help to bring his son back to Mauritania or to liberate him. He denounces the conditions of imprisonment of his son, who is handicapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Appel pour des raisons humanitaires |url= http://www.cridem.org/C_Info.php?article=44786 |publisher= Carrefour de la République Islamique de Mauritanie (CRIDEM) |date= 2010-06-18 |accessdate= 2010-05-08|  language= fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, 2010, El Ghassem Uld Bellali, a Mauritanian deputy, declared that the imprisonment of Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla is a Moroccan "political vengeance" against Haidalla's father, for the recognition he gaved to the [[SADR]] and to the [[right of self-determination]] of the [[Sahrawi people]], when he was president of Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Diputado considera "venganza" encarcelamiento en Marruecos hijo ex presidente |url= http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=432144 |publisher= [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] ([[EFE]]) |date= 2010-06-24 | accessdate= 2010-05-08 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Norton''' (born June 26, 1970) is most commonly known as the former co-host and managing editor of [[Revision3]] properties ''[[Tekzilla]]'', ''[[HD Nation]]'', and ''[[Systm]]'', and as the former co-host and managing editor of ''[[The Screen Savers]]'', an interactive [[television program]] on the former [[TechTV]] network  geared toward the [[technology]] enthusiast.

He's written hundreds of product reviews for the likes of [[PC Magazine]], [[CNET]], [[PC World]], Computer Power User, and [[TechTV]], launched the online video and podcast group at Ziff Davis where he produced and hosted 188 episodes of DL.TV and started using computers back in the late CP/M early DOS days.

He's best known for answering tough tech questions, skewering products and beating dead PCs with a sledgehammer for the four years at TechTV when he hosted a live daily television show called The Screen Savers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://revision3.com/host/patrick-norton Revision3 Official Bio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After graduating from college, Norton tested products and wrote for [[PC Magazine]], [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]], and [[InfoWorld]], and managed the hardware reviews section of [[Windows Sources]] magazine.

In the spring of 2000, ZDTV (later TechTV) named Norton as the co-host (alongside [[Leo Laporte]]) and managing editor of [[The Screen Savers]], a television show centered on computers, new technologies, and their adaptations in the world. Norton remained in this capacity until the spring of 2004.

On March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there. Norton chose to stay in San Francisco instead of moving to Los Angeles, and left the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/2100-1026_3-5207821.html Cnet G4 Lays off San Francisco Staff&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton co-hosted an Internet videocast with Robert Heron called DL.TV which covers a wide range of technology related topics and is streamed live every Thursday (it was streamed live twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays until episode 189). Norton has created a large fan base that is still delighted with his work as a technology guru. He announced on August 2, 2007 that he will no longer be the host of DL.TV in favor of a new job and having a child on the way in a few months.[1] His last appearance as the host of DL.TV was episode 188.

Norton also co-hosted a weekly podcast with Jim Louderback, the current CEO for Revision3, called What's New Now. This podcast is no longer being produced, the final episode having been produced May 15, 2007.

Norton wrote for ExtremeiPod before the site was taken down in the wake of pressure from Apple over the use of the word "iPod". He also ran the hardware reviews section of Windows Sources magazine. Norton cut his technical teeth on Osborne and Kaypro CP/M systems in the early 1980s.

Norton occasionally appears on the weekly podcast [[This Week in Tech]] (a.k.a. TWiT) along with several other former members of TechTV, including Leo Laporte, Kevin Rose, John C. Dvorak, and his former DL.TV co-host Robert Heron. He is also currently a co-host of This Week in Computer Hardware on the TWIT.TV network along with Ryan Shrout.

Norton was a managing editor at Revision3 where he hosted Systm, HD Nation and Tekzilla. Norton first confirmed his employment with Revision3 on TWiT episode 110 at 58:52 (The popular Netcast hosted by friend Leo Laporte).&lt;ref&gt;http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/110 This week in Tech Podcast&lt;/ref&gt;  He announced he would be leaving Revision3 on Tekzilla's last episode on November 25, 2014.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On January 9, 2015, Norton and former Tekzilla co-host Shannon Morse launched a brand new webshow called TekThing, which is a spiritual successor to Tekzilla.&lt;ref&gt;http://tekthing.com TekThing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

November 11, 2015, Norton is introduced on the "Tested" YouTube channel as their new Senior Technology Correspondent, with his focus being on audio related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsb4W144YNg|title=Tested In-Depth: How to Listen to High-End Audio|first=|last=Tested|date=11 November 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Norton currently lives in [[Alameda, California]], with his wife Sarah&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrwebauthor.com/techtv/patwed.html|title=retrieved 04/04/2012|website=mrwebauthor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twit.tv/118|title=This Week in Tech podcast, episode 118 for October 22, 2007|website=twit.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revision3.com/tekzilla/free-blu-ray-burning-tools|title=Tekzilla podcast (first 2 minutes), April 3rd, 2012|website=revision3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/348|title=This Week in Tech 348 The Holiday Inn EULA - TWiT.TV|website=TWiT.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul-Bernard de Fontaines''' (1566 [[Lorraine]] - 19 May 1643 [[Rocroi]]), also known as '''Comtefontaine, Conde Fontana''' or '''Fuentes''', was commander of the Spanish infantry during the [[Eighty Years War]]. He was Vogt of [[Bruges]] and governor of [[Damme]]. He participated in the battles around [[Hulst]], [[Kallo]] and [[Antwerp]].

== Life ==
Paul-Bernard de Fontaine was the son of Francisco de Fontaine, Lord of Cierges, rider-chief, governor of Stenay, administrator of the Duke of Lorraine, and Suzanne d'Urre. Both died before Fontaine had finished his first year. His maternal grandfather, Jean d'Urre, master of Thessières, took care of him until, in 1584, he resigned his guardianship, he was 87 years old and died two years later, and gave his oldest son Charles.

In 1636, together with his wife, Anna de Ragicourt, he founded a chapel and almshouse in the Zwarteleertouwersstraat in [[Bruges]] for twelve impoverished soldiers. His coat of arms is placed over the door in the side wall. The building was used until 1914 according to the foundations and is now a monument. At the [[St. Walburga church]] at Damme he donated a main altar bearing his coat of arms.

In 1596, he joined the King of Spain as a volunteer, and subsequently made a military career. In 1597, he was Captain of the infantry; in 1604, captain of the cavalry, in 1611, he became military commander in Flanders. 
When the twelve-year armistice ended in 1621, he built fortresses from Knokke to Lapscheure, later known as the [[Fontaine line]]. In 1631, as commander of the Spanish troops, he broke through the [[siege of Bruges]] by [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]]. In the course of his career, Fontaine appeared more as an efficient administrator than as a military strategist.

In 1638, he was appointed the [[Maestre de campo]] (Commander of the Infantry). At this time, he was already chronically ill and barely capable of military service.&lt;ref name=road&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=737c9ylAfswC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=Paul-Bernard+de+Fontaine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DJeAzwGJU0&amp;sig=-29z-REn4Daf2LrQyY6X_3yhruA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF857Uz4zXAhVR0mMKHUBMCkE4ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul-Bernard%20de%20Fontaine&amp;f=false|title=The Road to Rocroi: Class, Culture and Command in the Spanish Army of Flanders, 1567-1659|last=León|first=Fernando González de|date=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004170820|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Rocroi]] in 1643, he commanded his [[Tercio]]s from a sedan chair before he fell and was later buried in the monastery church of the [[Order of Friars Minor]].&lt;ref name=road&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (The monastery and church were later destroyed during the French occupation.)

'''Peter Mertens''' (born 17 December 1969) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] author and politician of the  [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (PVDA-PTB).

==Youth==
Mertens was born in [[Antwerp]]. In 1987, when he was 18 years old, he founded the ''Studenten tegen Racisme'' (Students against Racism, SteR) with fellow [[University of Antwerp|UFSIA]] student [[Marc Spruyt]]. Four years later he joined the ''Marxistisch-Leninistische Beweging'' (Marxist–Leninist Movement, MLB), during the protests against the [[Gulf War]]. With this organisation he was also present at a wide range of student activities, like the solidarity campaign with the workers of the shipyard [[Boelwerf]] in [[Temse]]. In 1994 Mertens became the president of the MLB, which then participated in the strike movement against proposed reforms by the Minister of Higher Education in the government of the [[French Community of Belgium|French community]], Michel Lebrun.

Mertens obtained his [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in [[sociology]] in 1998 and started working as a temporary employee (interim work). For a year and a half he worked as a labourer for industrial cleaning firms and subcontractors in the [[Port of Ghent]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptb.be/nieuws/artikel/peter-mertens-38-jaar-de-mens-achter-de-functie.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politician==
In 1995 the 5th party congress of the PVDA-PTB took place and Peter Mertens was elected to the National Council of the party. He left his position as president at the MLB in 1998 and became political secretary in the party branch of the province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]. In 2002, at the 7th party congress, Mertens was elected to the party bureau. Another four years later he became responsible for the daily management of the party.

During the 8th party congress on 2 March 2008 Mertens was officially appointed as the successor of [[Ludo Martens]], who was having serious health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/983/Nieuws/article/detail/181417/2008/02/22/Peter-Mertens-nieuwe-voorzitter-PVDA.dhtml|title=Peter Mertens nieuwe voorzitter PVDA|language=Dutch|work=De Morgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his appointment, Mertens declared in the Dutch language newspaper ''[[De Morgen]]'' that his party would leave behind its pedantic attitude and the big theories. As president he wanted to rethink the position of the party, in the process abandoning any connection to [[Maoism]] and [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvda.be/nieuws/artikel/de-morgen-pvda-beschouwt-zich-niet-langer-als-extreem-linkse-partij.html|title=PVDA beschouwt zich niet langer als extreem linkse partij|language=Dutch|work=pvda.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; To present the new vision and direction of the party he wrote the book ''Op Mensenmaat'' (On a human scale). Its successor, ''Hoe durven ze?'' (How dare they?), appeared in December 2011 and became an instant hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=KJ3L6OUF|title=Communist schrijft bestseller|language=Dutch|work=De Standaard}}&lt;/ref&gt; After half a year 17.000 copies were sold and in 2012 Mertens received the [[Jaap Kruithof]] Prize for this work.

At the [[Belgian local elections, 2012|local elections of 2012]] he was on [[Lijsttrekker|top of the list]] for the municipal election in the city of Antwerp and was elected with 8.976 [[Open list|preference votes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vlaanderenkiest.be/index.html#/gemeente/11002/uitslagen&lt;/ref&gt; This made him the fourth most popular politician in Antwerp, behind [[Bart De Wever]], [[Patrick Janssens]] and [[Filip Dewinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio1.be/programmas/vandaag/het-onverhoopte-succes-van-peter-mertens|title=Het onverhoopte succes van Peter Mertens|language=Dutch|work=radio1.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Slane 1842, p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; This genealogy is cited by the medieval Syria-based historians [[Ibn al-Adim]] (d. 1262) and [[Ibn Khallikan]] (d. 1282).&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} also known by the ''[[laqab]]'' (honorific epithet) '''Asad al-Dawla''' ("Lion of the State") (died May 1029), was the founder of the [[Mirdasid dynasty]] of [[Aleppo]], ruling between 1025 until his death. At its peak, his [[emirate]] (principality) encompassed much of the western [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]], northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and a string of central Syrian towns. With occasional interruption, Salih's descendants would rule Aleppo for the next five decades.

Salih launched his career in 1008/09 when he seized [[al-Rahba]] on the [[Euphrates River]]. In 1012, he was imprisoned and tortured by the emir of Aleppo, [[Mansur ibn Lu'lu]]; two years later, he escaped, captured Mansur in battle and released him in return for numerous concessions, including half of Aleppo's revenues. This action cemented Salih as the paramount emir of his [[Banu Kilab]] tribe, many of whose chieftains had died in Mansur's dungeons. With his [[Bedouin]] warriors, Salih captured a string of fortresses along the Euphrates, including [[Manbij]] and [[Raqqa]], by 1022. He later formed an alliance with the [[Banu Kalb]] and [[Banu Tayy]] and militarily supported their struggle against the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s. During this tribal rebellion, Salih annexed the central Syrian towns of [[Homs|Hims]], [[Baalbek|Ba'albak]] and [[Sidon]] before finally conquering Fatimid-held Aleppo in 1025.

Salih established a well-organized administration over his Aleppo-based domains. Militarily, he relied on the Banu Kilab, while entrusting fiscal administration to his local Christian [[vizier]], policing to an [[Salim ibn al-Mustafad|urban militia commander]] and judicial matters to a [[Shia Muslim]] ''[[qadi|qāḍī]]''. His rule was officially tolerated by the Fatimids, to whom he paid formal allegiance. However, his alliance with the Banu Tayy ultimately drew him into conflict with the Fatimid general, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], whose forces killed Salih in battle near [[Lake Tiberias]]. Salih was succeeded by his sons [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]] and [[Shibl al-Dawla Nasr|Nasr]].

==Early life and career==

===Family and tribe===
{{See also|Banu Kilab#Syria}}
[[File:Mirdasid Family Tree.png|thumb|right|300px|Genealogy of Salih ibn Mirdas and the [[Mirdasid dynasty]]]]

The year of Salih ibn Mirdas's birth is not known.&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"/&gt; Both of Salih's parents belonged to noble households of the [[Bedouin]] (nomadic [[Arab]]) tribe of [[Banu Kilab]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"/&gt; His father was a certain Mirdas ibn Idris who hailed from a princely clan of the Kilab,&lt;ref name="Zakkar86"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically from the Rabi'ah ibn Ka'b line of the 'Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr branch.&lt;ref name="Zakkar86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing else is known about Mirdas.&lt;ref&gt;Sobernheim 1936, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; Salih's mother, Rabab al-Zawqaliyah, came from the princely Kilabi clan of Zawqal, which inhabited the environs of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"/&gt; Salih had at least three brothers, only one of whom, Kamil, is named in sources and at least four sons, [[Shibl al-Dawla Nasr|Nasr]] (d. 1038), [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]] (d. 1062), [[Atiyya ibn Salih|Atiyya]] (d. 1071/72) and the youngest whose name is not known (d. 1029).&lt;ref&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salih's family inhabited and controlled the town of [[Qinnasrin]] (Chalcis), to the southwest of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"/&gt; Like most Muslims in Aleppo in the 10th–11th centuries, the Kilab embraced [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar84"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not clear how strongly the tribesmen identified with their faith, Salih's ''[[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'' ([[Teknonymy|paedonymic]]), "Abu Ali" (father of Ali), honored [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], a central figure in Shia tradition.&lt;ref name="Zakkar84"/&gt;

The Kilab were a major sub-tribe of the [[Banu 'Amir]] and first migrated to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] from [[Najd|central Arabia]] during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|7th-century Muslim conquest]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar67"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became a pillar of the [[Qays|Qaysi tribal faction]] and established their strongholds in the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia) and the steppes around Aleppo, which they thenceforth considered their ''diyār'' (tribal territory).&lt;ref name="Zakkar68"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Through their military strength and consistent ambition to govern and keep order in the territories they inhabited, the Kilab persisted as a powerful force in northern Syria throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Bianquis115"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In 932–933, another mass wave of Kilabi tribesmen moved to the environs of Aleppo as soldiers of an invading [[Qarmatians|Qarmatian]] army; according to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the new arrivals "paved the way to the rise and establishment of the Mirdasid dynasty".&lt;ref name="Zakkar69"/&gt; By then, the Kilab had established itself as the dominant tribal force in northern Syria and played a significant role in all the uprisings and internecine fighting involving the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] rulers of Aleppo, between 945 and 1002.&lt;ref name="Zakkar69"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emir of al-Rahba===
[[File:Qalat Rahbeh 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Salih was first mentioned in the historical record when he captured the fortress of [[al-Rahba]] (''pictured in 2005'') in 1008]]

Salih is first mentioned in 1008 in relation to the power struggle over the [[Euphrates]] fortress town of [[al-Rahba]].&lt;ref name="Bianquis115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar88-89"&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was strategically situated at the crossroads between Syria and Iraq and frequently contested by local and regional powers.&lt;ref name="Zakkar87"/&gt; In 1008, Ibn Mihkan, a native of al-Rahba, expelled its [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] governor and sought Salih's military backing to uphold his rule.&lt;ref name="Zakkar88"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Salih continued to dwell in his tribe's desert encampment and it is not known what he received in exchange for protecting Ibn Mihkan.&lt;ref name="Zakkar88"/&gt; A dispute soon arose between Salih and Ibn Mihkan, leading the former to besiege al-Rahba.&lt;ref name="Zakkar88"/&gt; 

The hostilities came to an end following an agreement that stipulated Salih's marriage to Ibn Mihkan's daughter and Ibn Mihkan's relocation to [[Anah]], which he would rule in addition to al-Rahba.&lt;ref name="Zakkar88"/&gt; When Anah's inhabitants revolted against Ibn Mihkan, Salih intervened to reassert his father-in-law's rule.&lt;ref name="Zakkar88-89"/&gt; However, amid these developments Ibn Mihkan was assassinated; contemporary chroniclers presume Salih ordered his death.&lt;ref name="Zakkar89"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Salih proceeded to capture al-Rahba and proclaim his allegiance to the Fatimid [[caliph]], [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar89"/&gt; This marked "the first step in Salih's career and from which his ambition probably evolved", according to Zakkar.&lt;ref name="Zakkar89"/&gt; Salih's capture of al-Rahba most likely boosted his prestige among the Kilab.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme emir of Banu Kilab===
Between 1009 and 1012, the Kilab participated in the struggle between Aleppo’s ruler [[Mansur ibn Lu'lu']] and the Hamdanids and their regional backers for control of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice the Kilab betrayed the Hamdanids and their allies, and in return, demanded from Mansur numerous pastures to breed their flocks and [[Arabian horse|war horses]].&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Instead, Mansur, who viewed the Kilab as a hindrance to his rule,&lt;ref name="Zakkar51"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; strove to eliminate them by luring the tribesmen into a trap.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; To that end, on 27 May 1012, he invited them to a feast and once the tribesmen entered his palace, the gates were locked and Mansur and his ''[[ghilman|ghilmān]]'' (slave soldiers; sing. ''ghulām'') attacked them.&lt;ref name="Zakkar50"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Several were killed and the rest, including Salih, were imprisoned in the [[citadel of Aleppo]].&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Afterward, the Kilabi emir Muqallid ibn Za'ida besieged the town of [[Kafartab]] to gain leverage with Mansur.&lt;ref name="Zakkar50"/&gt; This prompted the latter to move the Kilabi prisoners to facilities with better conditions in case of future peace negotiations with Muqallid.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon hearing of Muqallid's death and his failed siege, Mansur returned the prisoners to the citadel's dungeons, where many among them, including some chieftains, were executed or died of torture or poor conditions.&lt;ref name="Zakkar51"/&gt;

Salih was among those tortured by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud,&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; who was famed for her beauty,&lt;ref name="Zakkar51"/&gt; so that Mansur could wed her.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Zakkar writes that it is not known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, "an energetic and bold" emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab.&lt;ref name="Zakkar51"/&gt; Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel.&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall.&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"/&gt; Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe for the remainder of the night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in [[Dabiq, Syria|Marj Dabiq]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"/&gt; Zakkar questions the truth of this story, and asserts it was more likely that Salih escaped either through bribery or a friendly arrangement with a guard.&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"/&gt;

Salih's escape boosted the Kilab's morale and they assembled to offer him their allegiance.&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"/&gt; In the following days, the Kilab under Salih besieged Aleppo, but Mansur's forces were able to plunder Salih's camp and capture fifty tribesmen.&lt;ref name="Zakkar52"/&gt; Buoyed by his victory, Mansur collected his army of ''ghilmān'' in Aleppo along with local toughs, Christians and Jews and confronted Salih's forces on the outskirts of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kilab routed their opponents, killing some 2,000 Aleppines in the process, and captured Mansur.&lt;ref name="Zakkar53"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between Salih and Mansur's representatives ensued, concluding with an agreement that freed Mansur in return for the release of Salih's brothers, a ransom of 50,000 gold [[dinar]]s and the allotment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to the Kilab.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar53"/&gt; Salih was also able to remarry Tarud and was given Mansur's daughter to wed as well.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Furthermore, Mansur recognized Salih as the supreme emir of the Kilab, formally investing him with authority and control over his tribesmen.&lt;ref name="Zakkar53"/&gt;

==Establishment of Mirdasid emirate==

===Mesopotamian conquests and struggle for Aleppo===
[[File:View from the Byzantine Tower at Meskene, ancient Barbalissos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of [[Barbalissos|Balis]] on the [[Euphrates River]]. Between 1009 and 1022, Salih laid the foundations of his emirate by capturing a string of fortress towns along the Euphrates, including Balis, [[Manbij]], al-Rahba, [[Raqqa]] and al-Rafiqah]]

Using his newfound power, Salih captured the Euphrates towns of [[Manbij]] and [[Barbalissos|Balis]], located east and southeast of Aleppo, respectively.&lt;ref name="Zakkar53"/&gt; With these conquests and his control of al-Rahba, Salih established what would become the Upper Mesopotamian portion of the Mirdasid emirate.&lt;ref name="Zakkar54"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; This crossroads region was agriculturally, commercially and strategically valuable, and put Salih in contact with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, the Fatimids and the rulers of Iraq.&lt;ref name="Zakkar54"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the agreement between Salih and Mansur fell through as the latter abandoned most of his promises to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo,&lt;ref name="Zakkar54"/&gt; while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor [[Basil II]] that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to his territory.&lt;ref name="Zakkar55"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="Zakkar55"/&gt; Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory as the emirates of both the Kilab and their [[Numayrid dynasty|Numayr]]i kinsmen bordered the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="Zakkar55"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The [[Banu Kilab]] and the [[Numayrid dynasty#Origins|Banu Numayr]] were major branches of the [[Banu 'Amir]].|group=note}} The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched one of his sons to [[Constantinople]] to pay allegiance to Basil.&lt;ref name="Zakkar55"/&gt;

In January 1016, Mansur fled Aleppo after the citadel commander, [[Fath al-Qal'i]], revolted and recognized Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Zakkar56"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored his share of Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join Mansur, but kept one of the latter's daughters, whom he married.&lt;ref name="Zakkar56"/&gt; Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar57"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

To secure his hold over Aleppo, Fath invited Fatimid troops from [[Apamea, Syria|Afamiyah]] led by [[Ali al-Dayf]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar57"/&gt; Al-Hakim requested Salih to cooperate with al-Dayf and bestowed on him the title of ''asad al-dawla'' (lion of the state).&lt;ref name="Zakkar57"/&gt; However, Salih opposed the Fatimid presence in Aleppo and proposed an arrangement to Fath giving the latter control of the citadel and the Kilab control of the city.&lt;ref name="Zakkar58-59"&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fath responded favorably, but Aleppo's inhabitants protested the rumored deal, demanding the establishment of Fatimid rule; they enjoyed al-Hakim's tax exemptions and opposed Bedouin governance.&lt;ref name="Zakkar59"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fath was compelled to relocate to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] by al-Hakim, who also sent more troops to Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Zakkar59"/&gt; Salih was thus prevented from seizing the city.&lt;ref name="Zakkar59"/&gt; Nonetheless, Mansur's flight and the instability of Fatimid rule enabled Salih to strengthen his Upper Mesopotamian emirate.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He established his own administration and tribal court.&lt;ref name="Zakkar91"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1019, the court was visited by the Arab poet [[Ibn Abi Hasina]], who would become a prominent eulogist of the Mirdasid dynasty.&lt;ref name="Zakkar91"/&gt;

Meanwhile, al-Hakim appointed [[Aziz al-Dawla]], an Armenian ''ghulām'', governor of Aleppo in 1017.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar59"/&gt; Aziz al-Dawla established friendly relations with Salih and had the latter's mother live in Aleppo to strengthen ties.&lt;ref name="Zakkar60"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of Salih's activities during Aziz al-Dawla's five-year reign;&lt;ref name="Zakkar60"/&gt; according to Zakkar, this indicated that Salih "was satisfied and remained contented" throughout this period.&lt;ref name="Zakkar60"/&gt; Though Salih was not strong enough to challenge the Fatimids, the Kilab were nonetheless given control of the plains around Aleppo by Aziz al-Dawla.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; By 1022, Salih had extended his rule to the Euphrates twin towns of [[Raqqa]] and al-Rafiqah.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; In July of that year, Aziz al-Dawla was assassinated and briefly replaced by [[Abu'l-Najm Badr]], his Turkish ''ghulām''.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a succession of governors with short terms, the last being [[Thu'ban ibn Muhammad]] and Mawsuf al-Saqlabi as governors of the city and citadel, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of Bedouin alliance===
Aziz al-Dawla's replacements were challenged by Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Zakkar91"/&gt; In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military pact with the [[Tayy#Fatimid period|Banu Tayy]] of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] and the [[Banu Kalb]] of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule.&lt;ref name="Bianquis116"/&gt; Medieval historian [[Yahya of Antioch|Yahya al-Antaki]] relates that the alliance was a renewal of a previous pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, [[Ali az-Zahir|az-Zahir]] (r. 1021–1036), who took power in the aftermath of Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021.&lt;ref name="Zakkar9192"&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reconciliation unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, [[Jarrahids#Reign of Hassan|Hassan ibn Mufarrij]] and [[Sinan ibn Ulayyan]], to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.&lt;ref name="Zakkar93"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the terms of the pact, Syria would be split into three Bedouin-run states, with the Kilab under Salih governing Aleppo and northern Syria, the Tayy under its princely [[Jarrahids|Jarrahid household]] ruling  Palestine from [[al-Ramla]], and the Kalb ruling central Syria from Damascus.&lt;ref name="Zakkar9192"/&gt; The combined strength of the three largest tribes in Syria made them a formidable challenge to the Fatimids.&lt;ref name="Zakkar95"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; A Bedouin alliance of this magnitude and nature had not occurred since the 7th century and was made without consideration to the traditional [[Qays–Yaman rivalry]] between the tribes; the Tayy and Kalb were both Yamani while the Kilab were Qaysi.&lt;ref name="Zakkar9192"/&gt; Moreover, its formation surprised Syria's population at the time, who were unaccustomed to the spectacle of Bedouin chiefs seeking kingship in the cities rather than nomadic life in the desert fringe.&lt;ref name="Zakkar95"/&gt; According to Zakkar, "Salih was the outstanding figure among the allies, particularly from a military standpoint", though Hassan ibn Mufarrij apparently managed the allies' communications with the Fatimids.&lt;ref name="Zakkar95"/&gt;

In 1023, Salih and his Kilabi forces headed south and helped the Tayy evict Anushtakin's Fatimid troops from the interior regions of Palestine.&lt;ref name="Zakkar96"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Salih assisted the Kalbi siege of Damascus.&lt;ref name="Zakkar96"/&gt; The Tayy and Kalb's revolts in Palestine and ''[[Jund Dimashq]]'' (Damascus Province), respectively, "supplied the impetus", according to Zakkar, for Salih to move on Aleppo, particularly as the Fatimids' grip on that city was unstable.&lt;ref name="Zakkar91"/&gt; While Salih was fighting alongside his allies in the south, his ''kātib'' (secretary), Sulayman ibn Tawq, captured [[Maarrat Misrin]] in Aleppo's southern countryside from its Fatimid governor.&lt;ref name="Amabe61"&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1023, Salih returned to Aleppo in the belief that its defenders would immediately surrender to him, but this did not occur.&lt;ref name="Zakkar96"/&gt; Salih then withdrew and mobilized his tribal warriors and other local Bedouin.&lt;ref name="Zakkar96"/&gt;

===Conquest of Aleppo===
[[File:Aleppo. Citadel (1265963614).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Salih's forces captured the [[Citadel of Aleppo]] (''pictured in 2007'') from its [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] garrison on 30 June 1025 after a roughly five-month siege]]

In October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, advanced against Aleppo and fought in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf.&lt;ref name="Amabe61"/&gt; Salih himself arrived at Aleppo—after having sacked several Syrian coastal districts—with large numbers of Bedouin warriors on 22 November.&lt;ref name="Amabe61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He besieged the city, first camping outside of [[Bab al-Jinan]], where his demand that Ibn Abi Usama, the city's ''[[qadi|qāḍī]]'' (head Islamic judge), and other notables surrender was refused.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Salih then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; On 18 January 1025, the [[Bab Qinnasrin]] gate was opened to Salih by [[Salim ibn al-Mustafad]], head of the city's surviving Hamdanid ''ghilmān'';&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former ''ghilmān'', he welcomed Salih, who granted the inhabitants safe conduct.&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city's walls demolished.&lt;ref name="Zakkar93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; According to the Egyptian contemporary chronicler [[al-Musabbihi]], this led the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines;&lt;ref name="Zakkar93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and temporarily ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's walls as a tactical move that would enable an easier reconquest of the city should his troops be ousted.&lt;ref name="Zakkar93"/&gt;

Salih besieged the citadel, where Mawsuf and his troops were held up, on 23 January, while Thu'ban and his garrison barricaded themselves in the governor's palace at the foot of the citadel.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; By 13 March, Salih managed to enter the palace and allowed the townspeople to loot it.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; Salih's Bedouin troops were not accustomed to siege warfare and Salih requested skilled forces from the Byzantine governor of [[Antioch]], [[Constantine Dalassenos (duke of Antioch)|Constantine Dalassenos]], who dispatched three hundred bowmen to Aleppo; however, the Byzantine troops were quickly withdrawn on the orders of Emperor Basil II, who did not support Salih's rebellion.&lt;ref name="Zakkar93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; On 5 May, Salih appointed Ibn Mustafad ''muqaddam [[ahdath|al-aḥdāth]]'' (commander of the local militia) and governor of Aleppo and entrusted him and Ibn Tawq with continuing the siege, while Salih left for Palestine to help the Tayy combat a renewed expedition by Anushtakin.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; The Fatimid garrison's appeal for a truce on 6 June was ignored, prompting their desperate calls for Byzantine assistance; the troops went so far as to hang Christian crosses on the citadel walls and loudly praise Basil II while cursing Caliph az-Zahir.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; Muslim townsmen reacted to the pro-Byzantine pleas by joining the siege.&lt;ref name="Amabe62"/&gt; By 30 June, the citadel was breached and Mawsuf and Thu'ban were arrested.&lt;ref name="Amabe63"&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid troops in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"/&gt; On his way back to Aleppo, Salih captured a string of towns and fortresses, namely [[Baalbek|Ba'albak]] west of Damascus, [[Homs|Hims]] and [[Raphanea|Rafaniyya]] in central Syria, [[Sidon]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Gibelacar|Hisn Ibn Akkar]] in the hinterland of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus.&lt;ref name="Zakkar101"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.&lt;ref&gt;Lev 2003, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Salih entered Aleppo's citadel victoriously.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; Afterward, he had Mawsuf and the ''qāḍī'' Ibn Abi Usama executed.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; However, Salih released Thu'ban in return for financial compensation and allowed the city's ''[[da'i|dāʿī]]'' (chief [[Ismailism|Isma'ili]] propagandist) to depart safely.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Salih also confiscated the estates of numerous upper class Aleppines.&lt;ref name="Amabe63"/&gt;

==Emir of Aleppo==
[[File:Aleppo and the citadel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|General view of old [[Aleppo]] (foreground) and its citadel (background), 2008. Aleppo was the capital of Salih's Mirdasid emirate.]]

Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasid emirate]] and sent him numerous honorary robes and presents.&lt;ref name="Zakkar99"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no information about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo,&lt;ref name="Zakkar103"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
According to the 13th-century historian [[George Elmacin|Ibn al-'Amid]], "Salih put in order all [the state] matters and adopted the way of justice".&lt;ref name="Zakkar103"/&gt; Salih organized his emirate along the lines of a medieval Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; To that end, he maintained the fiscal administration, appointed a ''wazīr'' ([[vizier]]) to administer civilian and military affairs, and a Shia ''qāḍī'' to oversee judicial matters.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; He also appointed deputies to govern Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar.&lt;ref name="Zakkar101"/&gt;

Salih's ''wazīr'' was a Christian named Tadrus ibn al-Hasan,&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; who wielded significant influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih on all of his military campaigns.&lt;ref name="Zakkar102"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Aleppine Christians would largely monopolize the post of ''wazīr'' under later Mirdasid rulers,&lt;ref name="Amabe64"&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the community managed significant parts of the emirate's economy.&lt;ref name="Zakkar102"/&gt; Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly ties with the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="Amabe64"/&gt;

Information is largely absent regarding any major administrative changes Salih made to the Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of ''shaykh al-dawla'' (chieftain of the state) or ''raʾīs al-balad'' (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative with the people of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Kennedy259"&gt;Kennedy 2004, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar83"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The post emulated that of the ''shaykh'', who played a secondary role to an ''amīr'' in a princely Kilabi clan.&lt;ref name="Zakkar83"/&gt; The ''shaykh al-dawla'' played an important political role in the city and came from a prominent leading family.&lt;ref name="Kennedy259"/&gt; Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the ''aḥdāth'', which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force.&lt;ref&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they cooperated with Salih, the ''aḥdāth'' were still an independent force.&lt;ref name="Kennedy259"/&gt; Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of [[Turkic people|Turkish]] ''ghilmān'', though details about them are lacking in the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lev 2003, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lev 2003, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence over the Bedouin===
According to historian [[Thierry Bianquis]], Salih had "brought to success the plan which guided his [Kilabi] forebears for a century", and that he ruled with "concern for order and respectability".&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; At its core, Salih's emirate was held together by Kilabi tribal solidarity,&lt;ref&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the Kilab were the backbone of the Mirdasid army.&lt;ref name="Kennedy259"/&gt; Though Salih previously established his paramountcy over the Kilabi chieftains,&lt;ref name="Kennedy259"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar81"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; the Mirdasids were not the only princely clan of the Kilab and several emirs from other clans demanded a stake in the emirate.&lt;ref name="Zakkar81"/&gt; Salih granted each of these emirs an ''[[iqta|iqtāʿ]]'' (fief; pl. ''iqtāʿat''), though details about the size or specific holders of the ''iqtāʿat'' are absent in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedouin customs were a conspicuous part of Salih's rule and he always appeared publicly in the garb of a Bedouin chieftain rather than that of an urban leader.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Salih preferred to live in his tribal camp in the outskirts of Aleppo rather than the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; After his establishment in Aleppo, Salih's status increased among the Bedouin of Syria and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Zakkar103"/&gt; He was sometimes referred to by Arabic chroniclers as ''[[amir al-arab|amīr ʿarab al-Shām]]'' (commander of the Bedouin of Syria); the value of this title during Salih's time is not clear, but it "at least indicate[d] the high position of its holder", according to Zakkar.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his leadership of the Kilab and influence over the Tayy and Kalb in Syria, Salih's influence also extended to tribes in the Jazira, including the Numayr.&lt;ref name="Zakkar103"/&gt; When two Numayri emirs lost [[Edessa]] to [[Nasr al-Dawla]], the [[Marwanids|Marwanid]] emir of [[Mayyafariqin]], they appealed for Salih's intervention; accordingly, Salih persuaded Nasr to restore Edessa to the Numayr.&lt;ref name="Zakkar103"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Banu Munqidh]] first emerged as a political force in the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] valley under Salih's patronage in 1024/25.&lt;ref name="Mouton411"&gt;Mouton 1997, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Salih awarded the Munqhidi chieftain Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh the feudal lands around [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] as an ''iqtāʿ'' for backing Salih's conquest of Aleppo; the town of Shayzar itself was controlled by the Byzantines, however.&lt;ref name="Mouton411"/&gt;

==Death and aftermath==
[[File:Golan Hights Blick von den Golanhöhen auf den See Genezareth 4.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Salih was killed in battle near the eastern shore of [[Lake Tiberias]] (''pictured in 2014'').]]

Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids reached an agreement with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed as a threat to the Caliphate's survival.&lt;ref name="Zakkar99"/&gt;

Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb had been repelled from Damascus,&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; and in 1028, their emir died.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by his nephew, [[Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl]], who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the tripartite Bedouin alliance.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and [[Banu Fazara]] to drive out the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt;

With the Fatimids and Kalb poised against him, Hassan appealed for Salih's help to maintain their tribes' virtual autonomy throughout Syria against Fatimid encroachment.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; Accordingly, Salih mobilized his Kilabi forces to reinforce the Tayy in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; Salih and Hassan first encountered the Fatimid–Kalb army in the vicinity of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], but, unable to halt their advance, they withdrew to the north.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; On 12 or 25 May 1029, the two sides fought at al-Uqhuwanah,&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; on the eastern shores of [[Lake Tiberias]].&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; For unknown reasons, Hassan and his forces fled in the heat of battle, leaving Salih and his men to face off Anushtakin's army alone.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; The Kilab were decisively defeated and Salih, his youngest son and his vizier were slain.&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt;

After the battle, Salih's head was sent to Cairo and put on display,&lt;ref name="Zakkar100"/&gt; while Salih's body was nailed to the gateway of Sidon, a town he had enjoyed residing in.&lt;ref name="Bianquis117"/&gt; The Fatimids went on to conquer Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar from Salih's deputy governors, who all fled.&lt;ref name="Zakkar101"/&gt; Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor and left him in charge of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Crawford92"&gt;Crawford 1953, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwanah, escaped the battle to wrest control of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Crawford92"/&gt; For a brief period, the two sons ruled Aleppo jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1953, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Bianquis118"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city,&lt;ref name="Bianquis118"/&gt; which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080.&lt;ref name="Bianquis122"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sniper''' is a [[military]]/[[paramilitary]] [[marksman]] who operates to maintain effective visual contact with and engage enemy targets from concealed positions or at distances exceeding the target's detection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.shootingrangeindustries.com/what-is-a-sniper-in-the-army-other-military-branches-what-is-the-longest-sniper-rifle-shot/|title=What is a Sniper in the Army &amp; Other Military Branches? What is the Longest Sniper Rifle Shot? - Shooting Range Industries|date=2017-07-31|work=Shooting Range Industries|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snipers generally have specialized training and are equipped with high-precision rifles and high-magnification optics, and often feed information back to their units or command headquarters.

In addition to marksmanship and [[long range shooting]], military snipers are trained in a variety of tactical techniques: detection, stalking, and target range estimation methods, [[Military camouflage|camouflage]], [[field craft]], [[infiltration tactics|infiltration]], [[special reconnaissance]] and [[observation]], [[surveillance]] and [[target acquisition]].

==Etymology==
The verb "to snipe" originated in the 1770s among soldiers in [[British India]] in reference to shooting [[snipe]]s, which was considered an extremely challenging game bird for hunters.
The agent noun "sniper" appears by the 1820s.&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=snipe| work = Online Etymology Dictionary | title = Snipe |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sniper'' was first attested in 1824 &lt;ref&gt;https://army.ca/wiki/index.php/Sniper&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of the word "sharpshooter".&lt;ref name="etymology"/&gt;

A somewhat older term is "sharp shooter", a [[calque]] of 18th-century German ''Scharfschütze'', in use in British newspapers as early as 1801.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Edinburgh Advertiser'', 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; ''"This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern warfare==

[[File:Barrett M82A1.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] sniper using a Barrett M82]]

===Military doctrine===
Different countries use different [[military doctrine]]s regarding snipers in [[military unit]]s, settings, and [[military tactics|tactics]].

Generally, a sniper's primary function in modern [[war]]fare is to provide detailed reconnaissance from a concealed position and, if necessary, to reduce the enemy's fighting ability by shooting high-value targets (especially [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] and other key personnel) and in the process [[suppression fire|pinning down]] and [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralizing the enemy]].&lt;ref name="Plaster p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Typical sniper missions include managing [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] information they gather during [[reconnaissance]] and [[surveillance]], [[target acquisition]] for air-strikes and artillery, assist employed combat force with [[fire support]] and [[counter-sniper tactics]], killing enemy [[commander]]s, selecting targets of opportunity, and even [[matériel|destruction of military equipment]], which tend to require use of [[anti-materiel rifle]]s in the larger calibers such as the [[.50 BMG]], like the [[Barrett M82]], [[McMillan Tac-50]], and [[Denel NTW-20]].&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]- and Russian-derived military [[doctrine]]s include [[Military unit|squad-level]] snipers. Snipers have increasingly been demonstrated as useful by US and UK forces in the recent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq campaign]] in a [[fire support]] role to cover the movement of infantry, especially in [[Urban combat|urban]] areas.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Military snipers from the US, UK, and other countries that adopt their military doctrine are typically deployed in two-man [[Sniper#sniper teams|sniper team]]s consisting of a shooter and [[Spotter (sniping)|spotter]].&lt;ref name="Senich p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Senich|1988|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} A common practice is for a shooter and a spotter to take turns in order to avoid [[asthenopia|eye fatigue]].&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In most recent combat operations occurring in large densely populated towns, such as [[Fallujah, Iraq]], two teams would be deployed together to increase their security and effectiveness in an urban environment. A sniper team would be armed with its long-range weapon and a shorter-ranged weapon in case of close contact combat.

The German doctrine of largely independent snipers and emphasis on concealment, developed during the Second World War, has been most influential on modern sniper tactics, and is currently used throughout Western militaries (examples are specialized camouflage clothing, concealment in terrain and emphasis on [[coup d'œil]]).&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p.

===Sniper teams===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:061019-A-7603F-151.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Army sniper team from [[Jalalabad]] Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT)]]

Sniper rifles are classified as [[crew served weapon|crew-served]], as the term is used in the [[United States]] [[military]]. A '''sniper team''' (or '''sniper cell''') consists of a combination of one or more ''shooters'' with force protection elements and support personnel: such as a ''spotter'' or a ''flanker''. Within the [[Table of Organization and Equipment]] for both the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], the operator of the weapon has an assistant trained to fulfill multiple roles, in addition to being sniper-qualified in the operation of the weapon.

The shooter fires the shot while the spotter assists in observation of targets, atmospheric conditions and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location, communication with other parties; including directing [[artillery]] fire and [[close air support]]. A flanker's task is to observe areas not immediately visible to the sniper or spotter and assist with the team's perimeter and rear security,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} therefore flankers are usually armed with an [[assault rifle]] or [[battle rifle]]. Both spotter and flanker carry additional ammunition and associated equipment.

The spotter detects, observes, and assigns targets and watches for the results of the shot. Using a [[spotting scope]] or a [[rangefinder]], the spotter will also read the wind by using physical indicators and the [[mirage]] caused by the heat on the ground. Also, in conjunction with the shooter, the spotter will make calculations for distance, angle shooting ([[slant range]]), [[Angular mil|mil dot]] related calculations, correction for [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric conditions]] and leads for moving targets. It is not unusual for the spotter to be equipped with a notepad and a laptop computer specifically for performing these calculations.

===Law enforcement applications===


[[Law enforcement sniper]]s, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. [[Police]] forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in [[hostage]] scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a [[SWAT]] team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: "Be prepared to take a life to save a life."&lt;ref name="cbssniper"/&gt; Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under {{convert|100|m|yd|0|sp=us}} and sometimes even less than {{convert|50|m|yd|0|sp=us}}. Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.
[[File:Secret Service on White House roof.jpg|thumb|left|A US Secret Service sniper on the roof of the [[White House]]]]

Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper.&lt;ref name="cbssniper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60II/main267184.shtml |title=The Sniper, SWAT Teams Grow In Number |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=4 May 2008| date=25 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some police sniper operations begin with military assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofgastonia.com/city_serv/police/teams/SniperPage.cfm |title=Gastonia Police Department - Sniper School |accessdate=4 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722032415/http://www.cityofgastonia.com/city_serv/police/teams/SniperPage.cfm |archivedate=22 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/09/06/2025679.htm |title=Police sniper watches from roof, Sydney |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=4 May 2008 |date= 6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one high-profile incident, Mike Plumb, a [[SWAT]] sniper in [[Columbus, Ohio Division of Police|Columbus, Ohio]], prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed.&lt;ref name="nasta"&gt;{{cite web|ref = harv|year = 2010|url = http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|title = The Columbus Ohio Police|publisher = The Columbus Ohio Police|accessdate = 7 May 2010|last = Scanlon|first = James J.|quote = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031206083809/http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|archivedate = 6 December 2003|df = dmy-all}} - [https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cold_blooded/badass-sniper-cleanly-shoots-the-gun-out-of-a-crazy-mans-hand-291329.php?autoplay=true News footage of sniper shooting gun out of a persons hand]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USCG TACLET Airborne Use of Force.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Coast Guard [[Law Enforcement Detachments|TACLET]] marksman uses an M107 from a helicopter.]]

The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the [[Munich massacre]] when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the [[Israel]]i hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of army snipers in the scenario was impossible due to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of trained snipers who could be used in civilian roles was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]].

===Longest recorded sniper kill===

==Military history==
Before the development of [[rifling]], firearms were [[smoothbore]] and inaccurate over long distance. Barrel rifling was invented at the end of the fifteenth century, but was only employed in large cannons. Over time, rifling, along with other gunnery advances, has increased the performance of modern firearms.

===Early history===
Early forms of sniping or marksmanship were used during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. For instance, in 1777 at the [[battle of Saratoga]] the Colonists hid in the trees and used early model rifles to shoot British officers. Most notably, [[Timothy Murphy (sniper)|Timothy Murphy]] shot and killed General [[Simon Fraser of Balnain]] on 7 October 1777 at a distance of about 400 yards.&lt;ref name="MastHalberstadt2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Mast|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=To Be a Military Sniper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A64US-2Em2YC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3002-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Rose|title=American Rifle: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWaAiSScrRcC&amp;pg=PT46|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0-440-33809-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dougan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andy Dougan|title=Through the Crosshairs: A History of Snipers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpJ7fH7I0gkC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7867-1773-6|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Brandywine]], Capt.

[[File:Baker rifle.png|300px|thumb|[[Baker rifle]], an early 19th-century rifle, much more accurate than a [[smoothbore]] [[musket]].]]
A special unit of marksmen was established during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the [[British Army]]. While most troops at that time used inaccurate [[smoothbore]] [[musket]]s, the British "[[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Green Jackets]]" (named for their distinctive green uniforms) used the famous [[Baker rifle]]. Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel ([[rifling]]), this weapon was far more accurate, though slower to load. These [[Riflemen]] were the elite of the British Army, and served at the forefront of any engagement, most often in skirmish formation, scouting out and delaying the enemy. Another term, "sharp shooter" was in use in British newspapers as early as 1801. In the ''Edinburgh Advertiser'', 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; "This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War". The term appears even earlier, around 1781, in Continental Europe, translated from the German Scharfschütze.

===First sniper rifle===
[[File:Whitworth rifle.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Whitworth rifle]], a [[single-shot]] [[muzzle-loaded]] long-range rifle designed by Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]].]]
The [[Whitworth rifle]] was arguably the first long-range [[sniper rifle]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancivilwarstory.com/whitworth-rifle.html|title=Whitworth Rifle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[muzzleloader]] designed by Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]], a prominent British engineer, it used [[polygonal rifling]] instead, which meant that the projectile did not have to bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling.  The Whitworth rifle was far more accurate than the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]], which had shown some weaknesses during the recent [[Crimean War]].  At trials in 1857 which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one.  The Whitworth rifle was capable of hitting the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at 1,400 yards.&lt;ref&gt;"Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 19" By Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crimean War]], the first optical sights were designed to fit onto rifles.  Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by [[Chance Brothers]] of [[Birmingham]].  This allowed a [[marksman]] to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COCIaPM2_ksC&amp;dq=Battle+of+Freeman%27s+Farm+sniping&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Out of Nowhere: A history of the military sniper, from the Sharpshooter to Afghanistan|author=Pegler, Martin|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.

Despite its success at the trials, the rifle was not adopted by the [[British Army]].  However, the [[Armstrong Whitworth|Whitworth Rifle Company]] was able to sell the weapon to the [[French army]], and also to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;“Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers". Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain), 1860, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; where both the Union and Confederate armies employed [[sharpshooter]]s.

===Second Boer War===
[[File:Burnham in africa close up.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederick Russell Burnham]] in Africa]] 
During the [[Boer War]] the latest [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[rifling|rifled]] guns with [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s and [[smokeless powder]] were used by both sides. The British were equipped with the [[Lee–Metford]] rifle, while the Boers had received the latest [[Mauser]] rifles from Germany. In the open terrain of [[South Africa]] the marksmen were a crucial component to the outcome of the battle.

The first British sniper unit began life as the [[Lovat Scouts]], a Scottish Highland regiment formed in 1899, that earned high praise during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The unit was formed by [[Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and reported to an American, Major [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the British Army Chief of Scouts under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]. Burnham fittingly described these scouts as "half wolf and half jackrabbit.".&lt;ref name="Plaster p. 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like their Boer scout opponents, these scouts were well practised in the arts of marksmanship, [[field craft]], map reading, observation, and [[military tactics]].&lt;ref name="cooper1994"&gt;{{cite journal| date=July 1994| title=Cooper's Scout rifle a gun for all reasons: whether it be for hunting or individual combat, this concept may just be the ultimate dual-purpose rifle | last=Copper | first= Jeff| journal=[[Guns &amp; Ammo]]| volume=38| issue=7| issn=0017-5684| page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were skilled [[woodsmen]] and practitioners of discretion: "He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day." They were also the first known military unit to wear a [[ghillie suit]].&lt;ref name="Pegler p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Pegler|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] said of them that "keener men never lived",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snipercentral.com/lovat.phtml|title=Lovat Scouts, Sharpshooters - United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Burnham was the greatest scout of our time."&lt;ref name="sniping_chap11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hesketh-Prichard|first=H.V.|title=Sniping in France|pages=Chapter XI|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/Sniping%20in%20France%20by%20Major%20Hesketh-Prichard.html|isbn=0-85052-426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham distinguished himself in wars in South Africa, Rhodesia, and in Arizona fighting the Apaches, and his definitive work, ''Scouting on Two Continents,'' provides a dramatic and enlightening picture of what a sniper was at the time and how he operated.&lt;ref name="cooper1994"/&gt;

After the war, this regiment went on to formally become the first official sniper unit, then better known as ''sharpshooters''.&lt;ref name="Plaster p. 5"/&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Periscope rifle Gallipoli 1915.jpg|thumb|An Australian sniper aims a periscope-equipped rifle at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915. The spotter beside him is helping to find targets with his own periscope.]]
During [[World War I]], snipers appeared as deadly sharpshooters in the trenches. At the start of the war, only [[Imperial Germany]] had troops that were issued scoped [[sniper rifle]]s. Although sharpshooters existed on all sides, the Germans specially equipped some of their soldiers with scoped rifles that could pick off enemy soldiers showing their heads out of their trench.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} At first the French and British believed such hits to be coincidental hits, until the German scoped rifles were discovered.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} During World War I, the German army received a reputation for the deadliness and efficiency of its snipers, partly because of the high-quality lenses that German industry could manufacture.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p.

Soon the British army began to train their own snipers in specialized sniper schools. Major [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] was given formal permission to begin sniper training in 1915, and founded the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting at [[Linghem]] in France in 1916.&lt;ref name="Parker pp. 211-212"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1924|pp=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with a first class of only six, in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations, proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world.&lt;ref name="Parker_p211-212"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Eric|title=Hesketh Prichard|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also devised a metal-armoured double loophole that would protect the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.&lt;ref name="sniping_chap5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hesketh-Prichard|first=H.V.|title=Sniping in France|pages=Chapter 5|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/Sniping%20in%20France%20by%20Major%20Hesketh-Prichard.html|isbn=0-85052-426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper.&lt;ref name="sniping_chap2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hesketh-Prichard|first=H.V.|title=Sniping in France|pages=Chapter 2|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/Sniping%20in%20France%20by%20Major%20Hesketh-Prichard.html|isbn=0-85052-426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[papier-mâché]] figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could "smoke" a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with [[artillery]] fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using [[Kim's Game]] to train observational skills.&lt;ref name="Prichard-Vernon pp. 10,19"&gt;{{harvnb|Prichard|Vernon|2004| pp=10,19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, he wrote his account of his war time activities in his book ''[[s:Sniping in France|Sniping in France]]'', to which reference is still made by modern authors regarding the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924027946619 Sniping in France by Major H.

===World War II===
[[File:Pav-Stamp.jpg|right|thumb|Soviet sniper [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] in a stamp in 1944.]]
During the [[interbellum]], most nations dropped their specialized sniper units, notably the Germans. Effectiveness and dangers of snipers once again came to the fore during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The only nation that had specially trained sniper units during the 1930s was the [[Soviet Union]]. Soviet snipers were trained in their skills as marksmen, in using the terrain to hide themselves from the enemy and the ability to work alongside regular forces. This made the Soviet sniper training focus more on "normal" combat situations than those of other nations.

Snipers reappeared as important factors on the battlefield from the [[Invasion of Poland|first campaign of World War II]]. During Germany's [[Battle of France|1940 campaigns]], lone, well-hidden French and British snipers were able to halt the German advance for a considerable amount of time. For example, during the pursuit to [[Dunkirk]], British snipers were able to significantly delay the German infantry's advance. This prompted the British once again to increase training of specialized sniper units. Apart from marksmanship, British snipers were trained to blend in with the environment, often by using special camouflage clothing for concealment. However, because the British Army offered sniper training exclusively to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, the resulting small number of trained snipers in combat units considerably reduced their overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Shore p. 316"/&gt;

During the [[Winter War]], [[Finland|Finnish]] snipers took a heavy toll of the invading [[Soviet army]]. [[Simo Häyhä]] is credited with 505 confirmed kills,&lt;ref name="snipercentral.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snipercentral.com/snipers.htm#WWII |title=The Sniper Log Book—World War II |publisher=Snipercentral.com |date= |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | author=Rayment, Sean | title=The long view | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1517044/The-long-view.html | accessdate=30 March 2009 | location=London | date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most with the Finnish version of the [[iron sights|iron-sighted]] bolt-action [[Mosin–Nagant]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0526, Russland, Scharfschütze in Stellung.jpg|thumb|left|German sniper in [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Soviet Union]] (1942)]]

One of the best known battles involving snipers, and the battle that made the Germans reinstate their specialized sniper training, was the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Their defensive position inside a city filled with rubble meant that Soviet snipers were able to inflict significant casualties on the Wehrmacht troops. Because of the nature of fighting in city rubble, snipers were very hard to spot and seriously dented the [[morale]] of the German attackers. The best known of these snipers was probably [[Vasily Zaytsev]], featured in the novel ''[[War of the Rats]]'' and the subsequent film ''[[Enemy At The Gates]]''.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-297-1728-37, Im Westen, Scharfschütze.jpg|thumb|left|German sniper [[Belgium]]/[[France]] (1944)]]
German ''Scharfschützen'' were prepared before the war, equipped with [[Karabiner 98]] and later [[Gewehr 43]] rifles, but there were often not enough of these weapons available, and as such some were armed with captured scoped [[Mosin–Nagant|Mosin–Nagant 1891/30]], SVT or Czech Mauser rifles. The Wehrmacht re-established its sniper training in 1942, drastically increasing the number of snipers per unit with the creation of an additional 31 sniper training companies by 1944. German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose-manufactured sniping ammunition, known as the 'effect-firing' sS round.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Senich: German Sniper 1914-45, Page 91&lt;/ref&gt; The 'effect-firing' sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy 12.8&amp;nbsp;gram (198 gr) full-metal-jacketed boat-tail projectile of match-grade build quality, lacking usual features such as a seating ring to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of .584 (G1) further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte.htg/p41.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219092531/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte.htg/p41.jpg |archive-date=19 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For aiming optics German snipers used the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Zielvier 4x (ZF39) [[telescopic sight]] which had [[bullet drop compensation]] in 50 m increments for ranges from 100 m up to 800 m or in some variations from 100 m up to 1000 m or 1200 m. There were ZF42, Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4), Zeiss Zielsechs 6x, Zeiss Zielacht 8x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack 4x, Hensoldt Dialytan 4x and Kahles Heliavier 4x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles. Several different [[Telescopic sight#Mounting|mountings]] produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles. In February 1945 the [[Zielgerät 1229]] active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the [[StG 44]] assault rifle.

A total of 428,335 individuals received Red Army sniper training, including Soviet and non-Soviet partisans, with 9,534 receiving the sniping 'higher qualification'. During World War ІІ, two six-month training courses for women alone trained nearly 55,000 snipers, of which more than two thousand later served in the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shotgun.com.ua/class/sniping/snip_hist_12.html |title=Снайперское движение в РККА &amp;#124; История снайперского искусства |publisher=Shotgun.com.ua |date= |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} On average there was at least one sniper in an infantry platoon and one in every reconnaissance platoon, including in tank and even artillery units.{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} Some used the [[PTRD]] [[anti-tank rifle]] with an adapted scope as an early example of an [[anti-materiel rifle]].

In the United States Armed Forces, sniper training was only very elementary and was mainly concerned with being able to hit targets over long distances. Snipers were required to be able to hit a body over 400 meters away, and a head over 200 meters away. There was almost no instruction in blending into the environment. Sniper training varied from place to place, resulting in wide variation in the qualities of snipers. The main reason the US did not extend sniper training beyond long-range shooting was the limited deployment of US soldiers until the [[Normandy Invasion]]. During the campaigns in [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], most fighting occurred in [[arid]] and mountainous regions where the potential for concealment was limited, in contrast to Western and Central Europe.

The U.S. Army's lack of familiarity with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German snipers.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In Normandy, German snipers remained hidden in the dense vegetation and were able to encircle American units, firing at them from all sides. The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German snipers could approach in safety and attack them, as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to 1,000m. A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German snipers, allowing the snipers to pick them off one after another.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} German snipers often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front-lines moved, they continued to fight from their sniping positions, refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted.

Those tactics were also a consequence of changes in German enlistment. After several years of war and heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German army was forced to rely more heavily on enlisting teenage soldiers. Due to lack of training in more complex group tactics, and thanks to rifle training provided by the [[Hitlerjugend]], those soldiers were often used as autonomous left-behind snipers. While an experienced sniper would take a few lethal shots and retreat to a safer position, those young boys, due both to a disregard for their own safety and to lack of tactical experience would frequently remain in a concealed position and fight until they ran out of ammunition or were killed or wounded. While this tactic generally ended in the demise of the sniper, giving rise to the nickname "Suicide Boys" that was given to those soldiers, this irrational behavior proved quite disruptive to the Allied forces' progress. After World War II, many elements of German sniper training and doctrine were copied by other countries.&lt;ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/&gt;

In the [[Pacific War]], the [[Empire of Japan]] trained snipers. In the jungles of Asia and the Pacific Islands, snipers posed a serious threat to U.S., British, and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] troops. Japanese snipers were specially trained to use the environment to conceal themselves. Japanese snipers used foliage on their uniforms and dug well-concealed hide-outs that were often connected with small trenches. There was no need for long range accuracy because most combat in the jungle took place within a few hundred meters. Japanese snipers were known for their patience and ability to remain hidden for long periods. They almost never left their carefully camouflaged hiding spots. This meant that whenever a sniper was in the area, the location of the sniper could be determined after the sniper had fired a few shots. The Allies used their own snipers in the Pacific, notably the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], who used [[M1903 Springfield rifle]]s.

Common sniper rifles used during the [[Second World War]] include: the Soviet M1891/30 [[Mosin–Nagant]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[SVT-40]]; the German [[Mauser]] [[Karabiner 98k]] and [[Gewehr 43]]; the British [[Lee–Enfield No. 4]] and [[Pattern 1914 Enfield]]; the Japanese [[Type 97 Sniper Rifle|Arisaka 97]]; the American [[M1903 Springfield rifle#Variants|M1903A4 Springfield]] and [[M1 Garand#M1C and M1D sniper rifles|M1C Garand]]. The Italians trained few snipers and supplied them with a scoped [[Carcano|Carcano Model 1891]].

==Training==
[[File:Rackandchamber.jpg|thumb|A US Marine extracts a fired cartridge casing and chambers a new round into his [[M40 (rifle)|M40A3]].]]

Military sniper training aims to teach a high degree of proficiency in [[camouflage]] and concealment, stalking, [[Observing|observation]] and map reading as well as precision marksmanship under various operational conditions. Trainees typically shoot thousands of rounds over a number of weeks, while learning these core skills.

Snipers are trained to squeeze the trigger straight back with the ball of their finger, to avoid jerking the gun sideways.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The most accurate position is [[Prone position|prone]], with a [[sandbag]] supporting the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], and the stock's cheek-piece against the cheek.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In the field, a [[non-static weapon mount|bipod]] can be used instead. Sometimes a [[sling (firearms)|sling]] is wrapped around the weak arm (or both) to reduce stock movement.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt; Some doctrines train a sniper to breathe deeply before shooting, then hold their [[human lung|lung]]s empty while they line up and take their shot.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Some go further, teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Accuracy===
[[File:CSA-2006-10-17-093634.jpg|right|thumb|A sniper, using a [[United States Navy Mark 14 Mod 0 Enhanced Battle Rifle|MK.14 EBR]] uses two stakes as [[shooting sticks]] to help steady his aim while providing [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] in Iraq.]]

The key to sniping is accuracy, which applies to both the weapon and the shooter. The weapon should be able to consistently place shots within tight tolerances.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The sniper in turn must utilize the weapon to accurately place shots under varying conditions.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a bullet's trajectory and point of impact such as: range to the target, wind direction, wind velocity, altitude and elevation of the sniper and the target and ambient temperature. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can decrease lethality or cause a shot to miss completely.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Snipers [[Calibration|zero]] their weapons at a target range or in the field. This is the process of adjusting the scope so that the bullet's points-of-impact is at the point-of-aim (centre of scope or scope's cross-hairs) for a specific distance.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re-zero during missions.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

A [[sandbag]] can serve as a useful platform for shooting a sniper rifle, although any soft surface such as a [[rucksack]] will steady a rifle and contribute to consistency.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In particular, [[bipod]]s help when firing from a prone position, and enable the firing position to be sustained for an extended period of time. Many police and military sniper rifles come equipped with an adjustable bipod.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Makeshift bipods known as shooting sticks can be constructed from items such as tree branches or ski poles.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Range and accuracy vary depending on the cartridge and specific ammunition types that are used. Typical ranges for common battle field cartridges are as follows:

Servicemen volunteer for the rigorous sniper training and are accepted on the basis of their aptitude, physical ability, marksmanship, patience and mental stability.

===Russian Army===
From 2011, the Russian armed forces has run newly developed sniper courses in [[military district]] training centres. In place of the Soviet practice of mainly squad sharpshooters, which were often designated during initial training (and of whom only few become snipers ''per se''), "new" Army snipers are to be trained intensively for 3 months (for conscripts) or longer (for contract soldiers). The training program includes theory and practice of countersniper engagements, artillery spotting and coordination of air support. The first instructors are the graduates of the Solnechnogorsk sniper training centre.

The method of sniper deployment, according to the Ministry of Defence, is likely to be one three-platoon company at the brigade level, with one of the platoons acting independently and the other two supporting the battalions as needed.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilov, Yuri [http://www.rg.ru/2011/10/19/snaiper.html "Take a bead: Army gets sniper schools"] Rossiiskaya gazeta'' 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range finding===
The range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved [[trajectory]] and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low. As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as [[7.62×51mm NATO]] (.308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball round this difference (or “drop”) from {{convert|700|to(-)|800|m|yd|sp=us}} is {{convert|200|mm}}. This means that if the sniper incorrectly estimated the distance as 700 meters when the target was in fact 800 meters away, the bullet will be 200 millimeters lower than expected by the time it reaches the target.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Laser rangefinder]]s may be used, and range estimation is often the job of both parties in a team.&lt;ref name="Plaster 2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|2006|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; One useful method of range finding without a laser rangefinder is comparing the height of the target (or nearby objects) to their size on the mil dot scope, or taking a known distance and using some sort of measure (utility poles, fence posts) to determine the additional distance. The average human head is {{convert|150|mm|sp=us}} in width, average human shoulders are {{convert|500|mm|sp=us}} apart and the average distance from a person's pelvis to the top of their head is {{convert|1000|mm|sp=us}}.

To determine the range to a target without a laser rangefinder, the sniper may use the [[Angular mil|mil]] dot [[reticle]] on a scope to accurately find the range. Mil dots are used like a [[slide rule]] to measure the height of a target, and if the height is known, the range can be as well. The height of the target (in yards) ×1000, divided by the height of the target (in mils), gives the range in yards. This is only in general, however, as both scope magnification (7×, 40×) and mil dot spacing change. The USMC standard is that 1 mil (that is, 1 milliradian) equals 3.438 MOA ([[minute of arc]], or, equivalently, minute of angle), while the US Army standard is 3.6 MOA, chosen so as to give a diameter of 1 yard at a distance of 1,000 yards (or equivalently, a diameter of 1 meter at a range of 1 kilometer.) Many commercial manufacturers use 3.5, splitting the difference, since it is easier to work with.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}{{verify source|date=June 2016}}

It is important to note that [[angular mil]] (''mil'') is only an approximation of a [[milliradian]] and different organizations use [[Angular mil#Definitions of the angular mil|different approximations]].

At longer ranges, bullet drop plays a significant role in targeting.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The effect can be estimated from a chart, which may be memorized or taped to the rifle, although some scopes come with [[telescopic sight#Bullet drop compensation|Bullet Drop Compensator]] (BDC) systems that only require the range be dialed in. These are tuned to both a specific class of rifle and specific ammunition. Every bullet type and load will have different [[ballistics]]. .308 Federal 175 grain (11.3 g) BTHP match shoots at {{convert|2600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Zeroed at {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}}, a 16.2 MOA adjustment would have to be made to hit a target at {{convert|600|yd|m|-2}}. If the same bullet was shot with 168 grain (10.9 g), a 17.1 MOA adjustment would be necessary.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Shooting uphill or downhill is confusing for many because [[gravity]] does not act perpendicular to the direction the bullet is traveling. Thus, gravity must be divided into its component [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. Only the fraction of gravity equal to the [[cosine]] of the angle of fire with respect to the horizon affects the rate of fall of the bullet, with the remainder adding or subtracting negligible velocity to the bullet along its trajectory. To find the correct zero, the sniper multiplies the actual distance to the range by this fraction and aims as if the target were that distance away. For example, a sniper who observes a target 500 meters away at a 45-degree angle downhill would multiply the range by the cosine of 45 degrees, which is 0.707. The resulting distance will be 353 meters. This number is equal to the horizontal distance to the target. All other values, such as windage, time-to-target, impact velocity, and energy will be calculated based on the actual range of 500 meters. Recently, a small device known as a cosine indicator has been developed.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} This device is clamped to the tubular body of the [[telescopic sight]], and gives an indicative readout in numerical form as the rifle is aimed up or down at the target.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} This is translated into a figure used to compute the horizontal range to the target.

Windage plays a significant role, with the effect increasing with wind speed or the distance of the shot. The slant of visible convections near the ground can be used to estimate crosswinds, and correct the point of aim. All adjustments for range, wind, and elevation can be performed by aiming off the target, called "holding over" or [[Kentucky windage]].&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Alternatively, the scope can be adjusted so that the point of aim is changed to compensate for these factors, sometimes referred to as "dialing in". The shooter must remember to return the scope to zeroed position. Adjusting the scope allows for more accurate shots, because the cross-hairs can be aligned with the target more accurately, but the sniper must know exactly what differences the changes will have on the point-of-impact at each target range.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

For moving targets, the point-of-aim is ahead of the target in the direction of movement. Known as "leading" the target, the amount of "lead" depends on the speed and angle of the target's movement as well as the distance to the target. For this technique, holding over is the preferred method.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Anticipating the behavior of the target is necessary to accurately place the shot.&lt;ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Hide sites and hiding techniques===
[[File:Camouflaged-sniper.jpg|thumb|right|A sniper wearing a [[ghillie suit]] to remain hidden in grassland terrain]]

The term "hide site" refers to a covered and concealed position from which a sniper and his team can conduct surveillance or fire at targets. A good hide conceals and camouflages the sniper effectively, provides cover from enemy fire and allows a wide view of the surrounding area.

The main purpose of [[ghillie suit]]s and hide sites is to break up the outline of a person with a rifle.

Many snipers use ghillie suits to hide and stay hidden. Ghillie suits vary according to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend. For example, in dry grassland the sniper will typically wear a ghillie suit covered in dead grass.

===Shot placement===
Shot placement, which is where on the body the sniper is aiming, varies with the type of sniper. Military snipers, who generally do not shoot at targets at less than {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on}}, usually attempt body shots, aiming at the chest. These shots depend on tissue damage, organ trauma, and [[Bleeding|blood loss]] to kill the soldier. Body shots are used because the chest is a larger target.

Police snipers, who generally shoot at much shorter distances, may attempt a more precise shot at particular parts of body or particular devices: in one incident in 2007 in [[Marseille]], a [[GIPN]] sniper took a shot from {{convert|80|m|yd|abbr=on}} at the pistol of a police officer threatening to commit suicide, destroying the weapon and preventing the police officer from killing himself.&lt;ref name="www.laprovence.com"&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|date= 2 August 2007|url = http://www.laprovence.com/article/region/jai-fait-mouche-sur-son-arme-a-80-metres-pour-le-sauver|title =J'ai fait mouche sur son arme à 80 mètres pour le sauver (ENG:I hit his weapon at 80 meters to save him)|publisher = laprovence.com| accessdate = 14 May 2010| last=Pardini| first= Sèverine |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a high-risk or hostage-taking situation where a suspect is imminently threatening to kill a hostage, police snipers may take head shots to ensure an instant kill. The snipers aim for the [[medulla oblongata]] to sever the spine from the brain. While this is believed to prevent the target from reflexively firing their weapon, there is evidence that any brain hit is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sniper: SAS and Elite Forces Guide|author=Martin J Dougherty|year=2012|publisher=Amber Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Dm6EnU7mkC&amp;pg=PT205&amp;lpg=PT205&amp;dq=sniper+medulla+oblongata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fewgPSo9kP&amp;sig=UrKLMF4UWPXHFjKLMJO1k_8acPw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilkNLW99LYAhVT22MKHZITDNE4ChDoAQhRMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=sniper%20medulla%20oblongata&amp;f=false|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Target acquisition===
{{main|Target acquisition}}
[[File:Marine sniper ghillie suit.JPG|right|thumb|A [[US Marine]] sniper wearing a [[ghillie suit]].]]

Snipers are trained for the detection, identification, and location of a targeted soldier in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. Since most kills in modern warfare are by [[crew-served weapon]]s, reconnaissance is one of the most effective uses of snipers. They use their aerobic conditioning, infiltration skills and excellent long-distance observation equipment (optical scopes) and tactics to approach and observe the enemy. In this role, their [[rules of engagement]] typically let them shoot at high-value targets of opportunity, such as enemy officers.

The targets may be personnel or high-value [[materiel]] (military equipment and weapons) but most often they target the most important enemy personnel such as officers or specialists (e.g. communications operators) so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy operations. Other personnel they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper, like dog handlers, who are often employed in a search for snipers. A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank, talking to [[Radioman|radio operators]], sitting as a passenger in a car, sitting in a car with a large radio antenna, having military servants, binoculars/map cases or talking and moving position more frequently. If possible, snipers shoot in descending order by [[Military rank|rank]], or if rank is unavailable, they shoot to disrupt communications.

Some rifles, such as the [[Denel NTW-20]] and [[Vidhwansak]], are designed for a purely [[anti-materiel rifle|anti-materiel]] (AM) role, e.g. shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft, missile guidance packages, expensive optics, and the bearings, tubes or wave guides of [[radar]] sets. A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target radar dishes, water containers, the engines of vehicles, and any number of other targets. Other rifles, such as the .50 caliber rifles produced by [[Barrett Firearms Manufacturing|Barrett]] and McMillan, are not designed exclusively as AM rifles, but are often employed in such a way, providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles. Other calibers, such as the [[.408 Cheyenne Tactical]] and the .338 Lapua Magnum, are designed to be capable of limited AM application, but are ideally suited as long range anti-personnel rounds.

===Relocating===
Often in situations with multiple targets, snipers use relocation. After firing a few shots from a certain position, snipers move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine where they are and mount a counter-attack. Snipers will frequently use this tactic to their advantage, creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion. In other, rarer situations, relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind.

===Sound masking===
As [[sniper rifle]]s are often extremely powerful and consequently loud, it is common for snipers to use a technique known as sound masking. When employed by a highly skilled marksman, this tactic can be used as a substitute for a noise [[suppressor]]. Very loud sounds in the environment, such as artillery shells air bursting or claps of thunder, can often mask the sound of the shot. This technique is frequently used in [[clandestine operations]], [[infiltration tactics]], and [[guerrilla warfare]].

===Psychological warfare===
[[File:USMC Sniper M24.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Special Reaction Teams|Special Reaction Team]] with an [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] in 2004.]]
Due to the surprise nature of sniper fire, high lethality of aimed shots and frustration at the inability to locate and counterattack snipers, sniper tactics have a significant negative effect on morale. Extensive use of sniper tactics can be used to induce constant stress and fear in opposing forces, making them afraid to move about or leave cover. In many ways, the psychological impact imposed by snipers is quite similar to those of [[landmines]], [[booby-trap]]s, and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] (constant threat, high "per event" lethality, inability to strike back).&lt;ref name="MastHalberstadt2007_2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Mast|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=To Be a Military Sniper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A64US-2Em2YC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3002-9|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstadt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Halberstadt|title=Trigger Men: Shadow Team, Spider-Man, the Magnificent Bastards, and the American Combat Sniper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3Ctc9WRSiEC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=18 March 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-35472-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pegler2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Pegler|title=Out of Nowhere: A history of the military sniper, from the Sharpshooter to Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COCIaPM2_ksC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=20 September 2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-875-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, captured snipers are often [[summary execution|summarily executed]]. This happened during [[World War I]],&lt;ref name="firstworldwar.com"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 22 August 2009 |url = http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/snipers.htm|title = Encyclopedia - Snipers|publisher = firstworldwar.com| accessdate=10 May 2010 | last=Duffy| first= Michael |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="theregister.co.uk.2008.11.28"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 28 November 2008|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/28/sniper_feature/page2.html|title = Snipers - Cowardly assassins, or surgical soldiers?|publisher = The Register| accessdate=10 May 2010 | last=Page | first= Lewis |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the second [[Biscari massacre#Compton Incident|Biscari Massacre]] when 36 suspected snipers were lined up and shot on 14 July 1943.

As a result, if a sniper is in imminent danger of capture, he may discard any items (sniper rifle, laser rangefinder, etc.) which might indicate his status as a sniper. The risk of captured snipers being summarily executed is explicitly referred to in Chapter 6 of US Army doctrine document FM 3-060.11 entitled "SNIPER AND COUNTERSNIPER TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES":

{{quote|Historically, units that suffered heavy and continual casualties from urban sniper fire and were frustrated by their inability to strike back effectively often have become enraged. Such units may overreact and violate the laws of land warfare concerning the treatment of captured snipers. This tendency is magnified if the unit has been under the intense stress of urban combat for an extended time. It is vital that commanders and leaders at all levels understand the law of land warfare and understand the psychological pressures of urban warfare. It requires strong leadership and great moral strength to prevent soldiers from releasing their anger and frustration on captured snipers or civilians suspected of sniping at them.&lt;ref name="http://www.globalsecurity.org.countersniper"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date=27 April 2005|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-06-11/ch6.htm|title = Sniper and countersniper tactics, techniques, and procedures|publisher = GlobalSecurity.org| accessdate=10 May 2010 | last=GlobalSecurity.org| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The negative reputation and perception of snipers can be traced back to the [[American Revolution]], when American "Marksmen" intentionally targeted British officers, an act considered uncivilized by the British Army at the time (this reputation was cemented during the [[Battle of Saratoga]], when [[Benedict Arnold]] allegedly ordered his marksmen to target British General [[Simon Fraser of Balnain (general)|Simon Fraser]], an act that won the battle and French support).&lt;ref name="Senich p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The British side used specially selected sharpshooters as well, often German mercenaries.&lt;ref name="Senich p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

To demoralize enemy troops, snipers can follow predictable patterns. During the [[26th of July Movement]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]], the revolutionaries led by [[Fidel Castro]] always killed the foremost man in a group of [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]'s soldiers.{{Verify source|date=October 2008}} Realizing this, none of Batista's men would walk first, as it was suicidal. This effectively decreased the army's willingness to search for rebel bases in the mountains. An alternative approach to this psychological process is to kill the second man in the row, leading to the psychological effect of nobody wanting to follow the "leader".

===Counter-sniper tactics===
{{Main|Counter-sniper tactics}}

The occurrence of sniper warfare has led to the evolution of many counter-sniper tactics in modern military strategies. These aim to reduce the damage caused by a sniper to an army, which can often be harmful to both combat capabilities and morale.

The risk of damage to a chain of command can be reduced by removing or concealing features that would otherwise indicate an officer's rank. Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field, and eliminate rank insignia on [[battle dress uniform]]s (BDU). Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios.

Friendly snipers can be used to hunt the enemy sniper. Besides direct observation, defending forces can use other techniques. These include calculating the trajectory of a bullet by [[triangulation]]. Traditionally, triangulation of a sniper's position was done manually, though radar-based technology has recently become available. Once located, the defenders can attempt to approach the sniper from cover and overwhelm them. The United States military is funding a project known as RedOwl (Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost With Lasers), which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/10/04/robotic_vacuum_maker_bu_team_up_on_antisniper_device/ |title=Robotic-vacuum maker, BU team up on anti-sniper device
|first=Hiawatha | last=Bray|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=4 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more rounds fired by a sniper, the greater the chance the target has of locating him. Thus, attempts to draw fire are often made, sometimes by offering a helmet slightly out of concealment, a tactic successfully employed in the [[Winter War]] by the Finns known as "Kylmä-Kalle" (Cold Charlie).&lt;ref&gt;Petri Sarjanen (1998). Valkoinen kuolema: Talvisodan legendaarisen tarkka-ampujan Simo Häyhän tarina. {{ISBN|952-5170-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a shop mannequin or other doll dressed as a tempting target, such as an officer. The doll was then presented as if it were a real man sloppily covering himself. Usually, Soviet snipers were unable to resist the temptation of an apparently easy kill. Once the angle where the bullet came from was determined, a large caliber gun, such as a [[Lahti L-39]] "Norsupyssy" ("Elephant rifle") anti-tank rifle was fired at the sniper to kill him.

Other tactics include directing [[artillery]] or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire onto suspected sniper positions, the use of [[smoke screen]]s, placing [[tripwire]]-operated munitions, [[Land mine|mines]], or other [[booby-trap]]s near suspected sniper positions. Even dummy trip-wires can be placed to hamper sniper movement. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is possible to improvise booby-traps by connecting trip-wires to [[hand grenade]]s, [[smoke grenade]]s or [[flare]]s. Though these may not kill a sniper, they will reveal their location. Booby-trap devices can be placed near likely sniper hides, or along the probable routes to and from positions. Knowledge of sniper field-craft will assist in this task.

One very old counter-sniper tactic is to tie rags onto bushes or similar items in suspected sniper hides. These rags flutter in the breeze creating movements in the corner of the sniper's eye, which they will often find distracting. The greatest virtue of this tactic is its simplicity and ease of implementation; however, it is unlikely to prevent a skilled sniper from selecting targets, and may in fact provide a sniper with additional information about the wind near the target.

The use of [[Dog|canine]] units had been very successful, especially during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.k9history.com/history-vietnam-1960-1975.htm|title=K-9 History: Vietnam, 1960 - 1975|website=www.k9history.com|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irregular and asymmetric warfare==
{{Main|Irregular warfare|Asymmetric warfare}}
[[File:Georgian sniper during South Ossetia war.jpg|right|thumb|A Georgian sniper in the [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict]] (2004)]]

The use of sniping (in the sense of shooting at relatively long range from a concealed position) to murder came to public attention in a number of sensational U.S. criminal cases, including the [[Charles Whitman|Austin sniper]] incident of 1966 (Charles Whitman), the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] (Lee Harvey Oswald), and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] of late 2002 (Lee Boyd Malvo). However, these incidents usually do not involve the range or skill of military snipers; in all three cases the perpetrators had U.S. military training, but in other specialties. News reports will often (inaccurately) use the term sniper to describe anyone shooting with a rifle at another person.&lt;ref name="Dockery2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dockery|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Dockery (author)|title=Stalkers and Shooters: A History of Snipers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYWZFOKFQ2gC&amp;pg=PT170|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=3 July 2007|publisher=Penguin Group US|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4406-2890-0|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sniping has been used in asymmetric warfare situations, for example in the [[Northern Ireland]] [[The Troubles|Troubles]], where in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, the majority of the soldiers killed were shot by concealed [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] riflemen.&lt;ref name="Taylor p. 132"&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=132}} - "In 1971, the Provisional IRA shot dead forty-two British soldiers. In 1972, this figure rose to sixty-four, most of them killed by snipers."&lt;/ref&gt; There were some instances in the early 1990s of British soldiers and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] personnel being shot with .50 caliber Barrett rifles by sniper teams collectively known as the [[South Armagh Sniper (1990–1997)|South Armagh sniper]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson,

The sniper is particularly suited to combat environments where one side is at a disadvantage. A careful sniping strategy can use a few individuals and resources to thwart the movement or other progress of a much better equipped or larger force. Sniping enables a few persons to instil terror in a much larger regular force — regardless of the size of the force the snipers are attached to. It is widely accepted that sniping, while effective in specific instances, is much more effective as a broadly deployed psychological attack or as a force-multiplier.&lt;ref name="RobertsSasser2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig Roberts|author2=Charles W.

Snipers are less likely to be treated mercifully than non-snipers if captured by the enemy.&lt;ref name="theregister.co.uk.2008.11.28"/&gt; The rationale for this is that ordinary soldiers shoot at each other at 'equal opportunity' whilst snipers take their time in tracking and killing individual targets in a methodical fashion with a relatively low risk of retaliation.

===War in Iraq===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

In 2003, the U.S.-led multinational coalition composed of primarily U.S. and UK troops occupied Iraq and attempted to establish a new government in the country. However, shortly after the initial invasion, violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency and civil war between many Sunni and Shia Iraqis.
[[File:Bundeswehr sniper team in position.jpg|thumb|[[Bundeswehr]] sniper team in position, Kunduz Province, Afghanistan]]
Through November 2005, when the Pentagon had last reported a sniper fatality, the Army had attributed 28 of 2,100 U.S. deaths to enemy snipers.&lt;ref name="iniraq"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-07-27-insurgent-sniper_x.htm |title=Insurgent snipers sent after troops |publisher=[[USA Today]] |first=John |last=Diamond |accessdate=21 March 2008 |date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, since 2006, insurgent snipers such as "[[Juba (sniper)|Juba]]" have caused problems for American troops. Claims have been made that Juba have shot up to 37 American soldiers in Iraq as of October 2006.&lt;ref name="Rueters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PAR929648.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313004721/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PAR929648.htm |archivedate=13 March 2009 |title=U.S. military probes sniper threat in Baghdad |first=Paul |last=Holmes |publisher=Reuters news service |date= 29 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting U.S. troops, there read: "Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare."&lt;ref name="iniraq"/&gt;

===Afghanistan===
Some sniper teams in Afghanistan have killed large numbers of [[Taliban]] in quite short periods of time. For example, while in Helmand Province, two British snipers (part of the [[Welsh Guards]] Battle group) shot dead a total of 75 Taliban in only 40 days during the summer of 2009. In one session of duty, lasting just two hours, they shot and killed eight Taliban. On another occasion, the same team scored a "Quigley" (i.e., killing two Taliban with a single bullet) at a range of 196 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366154/British-sniper-kills-Taliban-bullet-new-book-reveals.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Oliver | last=Pickup | title=British sniper takes out TWO Taliban with a single bullet: Extraordinary images show how crack shot killed insurgents | date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taliban snipers have themselves caused problems for coalition forces. For example, over a four-month period in early 2011, two Taliban snipers shot dead two British soldiers and wounded six others at an outpost in Qadrat, [[Helmand province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366019/Bravest-brave-Soldiers-Helmand-offer-targets-flush-Taliban-sniper.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bravest of the brave: Soldiers volunteer as targets to flush out sniper who is shooting colleagues |date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one unusual incident, an unnamed 55-year-old ex-Mujahideen fighter with a motorbike and an old British-made Enfield rifle killed two British soldiers with a single shot, hitting the first in the head and the second in the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Drury |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2012627/Taliban-sniper-kills-2-British-soldiers-1-devastating-shot-Afghanistan.html#axzz2JqmwL7ny |title=Taliban sniper kills 2 British soldiers with 1 devastating shot in Afghanistan|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before [[firearm]]s were available, soldiers such as [[Archery|archers]] were specially trained as elite marksmen.

===17th century===
* [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]], who represented the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]], was the first recorded British sniper victim, killed by a Royalist soldier hiding in a bell tower in [[Lichfield]].

===18th century===
* [[Timothy Murphy (sniper)|Timothy Murphy]] ([[American Revolutionary War]]) – killed British General [[General Simon Fraser of Balnian|Simon Fraser]] during the pivotal [[Battle of Saratoga]], hampering the British advance which helped cause them to lose the battle.&lt;ref name="Senich p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}
* [[Patrick Ferguson]] ([[American Revolutionary War]]) - developer of the world's first breech-loaded military rifle (which advanced sniping and sharpshooting tactics), fought with his Corps of Riflemen (recruited from the 6th and 14th Foot) at the [[Battle of Brandywine]], where he may have passed up a chance to shoot George Washington.&lt;ref name="Plaster pp. 39-45, 53-55"&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|pp=39–45, 53–55.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
* [[Napoleonic Wars]] – Use of Marine sharpshooters in the mast tops was common usage in navies of the period, and Admiral Nelson's death at Trafalgar is attributed to the actions of French sharpshooters. The British Army developed the concept of directed fire (as opposed to massive unaimed volleys) and formed Rifle regiments, notably the 95th and the 60th who wore green jackets instead of the usual redcoats. Fighting as [[Skirmisher]]s, usually in pairs and trusted to choose their own targets, they wrought havoc amongst the French during the [[Peninsular War]].
* British [[Rifleman Thomas Plunkett]] (Peninsular war) – shot French General [[Auguste-Marie-François Colbert|Colbert]] and one of his aides at a range of between {{convert|200|and|600|m|yd|0}} using a [[Baker rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hadaway ''[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/c_plunkett.html Rifleman Thomas Plunkett: 'A Pattern for the Battalion.']''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colonel [[Hiram Berdan]] ([[American Civil War]]) – commanded 1st and 2nd US Sharpshooters, who were trained and equipped Union marksmen with the .52 caliber [[Sharps Rifle]]. It has been claimed that Berdan's units killed more enemies than any other in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref name="Senich p. "/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

* During the American Civil War, an unidentified Confederate sniper shot Major General [[John Sedgwick]] during the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] probably with a British [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]] target rifle at the then-incredible distance of minimum {{convert|730|m|yd|0}}. Ben Powell of the 12th South Carolina claimed credit, although his account has been discounted because the general he shot at with a Whitworth rifled musket was mounted, probably Brig Gen. William H.

'''Toastmasters International''' ('''TI''') is a US headquartered [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] educational organization that operates clubs worldwide for the purpose of promoting [[communication]] and [[public speaking]] skills.
==History==
The organization grew out of a single club, '''Smedley Chapter One Club''', which would become the first Toastmasters club. It was founded by [[Ralph C. Smedley]] on October 22, 1924, at the [[YMCA]] in [[Santa Ana, California]], United States.&lt;ref name="OCM1"/&gt; It originated as a set of classes with the aim of improving the communication skills of the young men under his charge.&lt;ref name="Indie1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Synge |first1=Daniel |title=How to speak in public |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-to-speak-in-public-1600759.html |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=September 12, 1995 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toastmasters International was incorporated under [[California]]n law on December 19, 1932.&lt;ref name="OCM1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Scott |first1=Majorie |title=Out of the Past: Toasting the Toastmasters |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PWEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]] |issue=November 1990 |date=November 1990 |pages=45-46  |format=Digitised magazine |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KPF1"/&gt;

The first international chapter was established in Vancouver, Canada in 1932. The organization began admitting women in 1973.&lt;ref name="OCM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaviolaYears"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laviola |first1=Karen |title=A toast to Toastmasters' 65 years |work=[[Orange County Register]] |date=October 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, Toastmasters has served over four million people, and today the organization serves over 352,000 members in 141 countries, through its 16,400 member clubs.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;  Toastmasters membership increased rapidly around the turn of the century, nearing 16,000 clubs worldwide by 2016.&lt;ref name="blakeHow"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=John |title=Stop texting and start speaking: The Olympians of storytelling show you how |url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/us/toastmasters-champions/index.html |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |publisher=CNN |date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
Toastmasters International uses a local club-based structure, each having around 20-40 members. Meetings are held every week or other week and usually in the evening, although some clubs meet in the morning or afternoon.&lt;ref name="OCM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KPF1"&gt;{{cite news |title='Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking...' |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LgYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance|Changing Times (The Kiplinger Magazine)]] |issue=April 1970 |publisher=The Kiplinger Washington Editors |date=April 1970 |pages=17-18  |format=(Digitised magazine)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each club operates as a separate entity with a set of requirements leading to chartered status for them to be recognised as official Toastmasters clubs. Chartered status allows for clubs to use the names, promotional material and programme of TI.&lt;ref name="MPN1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dewey |first1=Larry |title=Score Yourself as a Public Speaker |url=https://archive.org/download/mpnewsjan1966mont/mpnewsjan1966mont.pdf |accessdate=June 23, 2018 |work=Montana Prison News |issue=Volume VII, No. 1 |date=January 1966 |pages=51-52 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Table Topics===
Part of meetings is devoted to Table Topics, which are off-the-cuff speeches which are assigned on the spot by a Topicsmaster. The goal of this is to think on one's feet with minimal preparation. In some clubs attendees are then asked to vote on who they thought gave the best speech.&lt;ref name="OCM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KPF1"/&gt;

===Speeches===
Every meeting is based around a set of organised speeches. Speakers are evaluated by an experienced member who then gives an impromptu speech with constructive feedback based on their performance.&lt;ref name="AMWA1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Delacruz |first1=Bernard (PhD) |title=My Road to Toastmasters |url=https://ia801202.us.archive.org/14/items/v6n44/v6n44.pdf |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |work=Postscripts |agency=[[American Medical Writers Association|American Medical Writers Association – Pacific Southwest Chapter]] |issue=Vol 6, No 44 |date=June 2016 |pages=96-97 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Toastmasters International places a large emphasis on building the public speaking and leadership skills of its members.&lt;ref name="AMWA1"/&gt; The current education system consists of ten differing paths suited to their needs and requirements, based around ''Public Speaking'', ''Interpersonal Communication'', ''Management'', ''Strategic Leadership'', and ''Confidence''. Each path consists of 14 projects.&lt;ref name="BP1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Toastmasters modernizes its education program with Pathways |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/news-and-pr/1490338/toastmasters-modernizes-its-education-program-with-pathways |website=[[Bangkok Post]] |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |language=en |date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content consists of online and print materials, it being the first time in the organisation’s history to provide modern technology in its programme.&lt;ref name="BP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Majumdar |first1=Meghna |title=Pathways: Toastmasters’ programme goes online |url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pathways-toastmasters-programme-goes-online/article22946336.ece |website=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |language=en-IN |date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content is available in English, French and German.&lt;ref name="Delano1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauldry |first1=Jess |title=Public speaking in Luxembourgish |url=http://delano.lu/d/detail/news/public-speaking-luxembourgish/180550 |website=Delano – Luxembourg in English |accessdate=June 22, 2018 |location=[[Luxembourg]] |language=en |date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Vardariotai''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Βαρδαριῶται}}}}), sometimes [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] as '''Vardariots''', were an ethnic and territorial group (probably originally of [[Magyars|Magyar]] origin) in the later [[Byzantine Empire]], which provided a palace guard regiment during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

==History==
The exact origin and nature of the ''Vardariotai'' is uncertain. The name first appears in the tenth century, when a bishopric of the "''Vardariotai'' or ''Tourkoi''" is mentioned as subject to the diocese of [[Thessalonica]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=2153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-fourteenth century writer [[Pseudo-Kodinos]] calls them "Persians" by race (a typical Byzantine anachronism for "Turks"), and recalls that they were settled in the [[Vardar river]] valley by an unnamed Byzantine emperor of old. In both cases, however, "Turks" probably implies the [[Magyars]], who were called "''Tourkoi''" by the Byzantines in the tenth–eleventh centuries. Hence it seems that the ''Vardariotai'' were Magyars resettled in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the tenth century, and that they had become [[Christianization|Christians]] by the end of that century.&lt;ref name="Bartusis 280"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|p=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the twelfth century, the ''Vardariotai'', their Magyar identity by now much diluted, were being recruited into the [[Byzantine army]], and, at the latest during the latter part of the reign of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (r. 1143–1180), they were formed into a distinct palace guard regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|pp=271, 280}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magdalino231"&gt;{{harvnb|Magdalino|2002|p=231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their functions, however, at least in the [[Palaiologan period]], appear to have been more those of a police force than a military unit: Pseudo-Kodinos lists them not with the guards, but with the unarmed palace personnel, and states that their duty was "to keep people orderly" during ceremonies. Unlike the armed members of the [[Varangian Guard]] and the ''[[Paramonai]]'' regiment, they were equipped only with a whip (the ''manglabion'') and a staff (the ''dekanikion'').&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|pp=279–280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kodinos also records that they wore distinctive red uniforms and a "Persian" hat called ''angouroton'' ("cucumber-shaped"), and that the whip, hanging at their belt, was their symbol. This latter reference has led to the hypothesis that the ''Vardariotai'' were the replacement of the older ''[[Manglabites]]'' guards corps.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; They were commanded by a ''[[primikerios]]'', first attested in the year 1166.&lt;ref name="Bartusis 280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magdalino231"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macrides|2007|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteenth-century historian [[George Akropolites]] further states that the ''Vardariotai'' accompanied the Byzantine emperor to his military camp whilst on campaign.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macrides|2007|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether and how the ''vardarioi'', administrative officials of [[Thessalonica]] in the tenth–eleventh centuries, known through their seals, are related to the ''Vardariotai''.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

'''Wesley Batista''' ([[Formosa (Goiás)|Formosa]], born December 8, 1972) is a Brazilian entrepreneur and founder of [[JBS S.A.]] Wesley Batista is the president of the JBS group and is responsible for the implementation of JBS operations in the USA since the acquisition of Swift in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoca.globo.com/politica/noticia/2017/05/quem-sao-os-irmaos-bilionarios-que-podem-derrubar-michel-temer.html Wesley Batista: quem são os irmãos bilionários que podem derrubar Michel Temer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===JBS founder and president===
Wesley Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] were listed in 2016 among the 70 main billionaires of Brazil by [[Forbes]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2016/08/70-maiores-bilionarios-do-brasil-em-2016/ 70 maiores bilionários do Brasil em 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016: Operation Car-Wash ===

In July 2016, Wesley Batista became a suspect in the investigations of [[Operation Car Wash]]. The Brazilian Federal Police charged him for alleged bribes made by his company, [[JBS S.A.]], to the former president of the Brazilian parliament [[Eduardo Cunha]], which were intended to help JBS with the liberation of resources from the [[Fundo de Investimento do Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço|FI-FGTS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/pf-faz-buscas-na-casa-de-joesley-batista-da-friboi/ PF faz buscas na casa de Joesley Batista, da Friboi]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017: Bribery and insider trading allegations ===

On May 17, 2017, the Batista brothers admitted to the Brazilian Federal Police bribing several Brazilian officers and politicians over the last 12 years. As a result of this bribes, him and his company JBS allegedly obtained funding from the [[BNDES]] of over R$10 billion at below market rates, and then using the funds to bribe politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/operacao-lava-jato/noticia/jbs-pagou-para-conseguir-aportes-e-financiamentos-do-bndes-diz-delacao-de-joesley-batista.ghtml JBS pagou para conseguir aportes e financiamentos do BNDES, diz delação de Joesley Batista]&lt;/ref&gt;  As compensation for the cooperation, the Brazilian Federal Police set Batista, his brother and other directors of [[JBS S.A.]] free of charges, having to pay a penalty of R$225 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/economia/negocios/noticia/jbs-diz-que-pagara-multa-de-r-225-milhoes-em-acordo-de-colaboracao-premiada.ghtml JBS pagará multa de R$ 225 milhões em acordo de colaboração premiada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the recordings, Batista and his brother [[Joesley Batista]] sold several shares of [[JBS S.A.]] and bought over USD 1 billion. The release of the recordings resulted in substantial reduction of the stock price of JBS S.A. shares and in the reduction of the value in the Brazilian Real. The Brazilian Securities Commission ("CVM") is investigating the Batista brothers for insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-jbs-regulator-idUSKCN18F0AT Brazil watchdog opens new probes into JBS-related insider trading]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wesley Batista decided to move to the USA.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
