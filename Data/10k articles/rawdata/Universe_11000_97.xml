'''13-Methyltetradecanoic acid''' ('''13-MTD''') is a [[fatty acid]] known to induce [[apoptosis]] or “programmed cell death” of certain human [[Cancer cell|cancer cells]]. 13-MTD was originally purified from a [[Soybean|soy]] fermentation product and can be chemically synthesized; however, the synthesized form contains the same biological property of its natural form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klein R. A.|author2=Halliday D.|author3=Pittet P. G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=The use of 13-methyltetradecanoic acid as an indicator of adipose tissue turnover|date=1980|pages=572–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Decades ago,{{When|date=April 2017}} Pentagenic Pharmaceuticals (Diamond Bar, CA) engineered a soy fermentation product named Yang Zhen Hua 851 through a process of bacterial [[fermentation]]. Beginning in 1985, thousands of cancer patients have accepted Yang Zhen Hua 851 as an alternative to traditional [[chemotherapy]] and experienced improvements in their health and clinical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannun|first1=Y. A.|title=Apoptosis and the dilemma of cancer chemotherapy |date=1997|issue=89|pages=1845–1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once exclusive to China, the soy fermentation product is now used in the United States.

More recently, research has indicated that the component most likely responsible for the anticancer agency in Yang Zhen Hua 851 is 13-Methyltetradecanoic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klein R. A.|author2=Halliday D.|author3=Pittet P. G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=The use of 13-methyltetradecanoic acid as an indicator of adipose tissue turnover|date=1980|issue=15|pages=572–579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatty chain acid is most abundant in Yang Zhen Hua 851 and responds aggressively towards tumor cells through apoptosis. (Essentially, apoptosis is a process of cell death initiated by the presence or absence of certain stimuli.) Thus 13-MTD has become of great interest to the scientific community, and research has been conducted in an effort to understand how 13-MTD  induces apoptosis on a molecular level; moreover, the medical implications of 13-MTD as an alternative to drug chemotherapy are currently being considered.

==Recent{{When|date=February 2018}} discoveries==

To understand how 13-MTD actually induces apoptosis, researchers studied the fatty chain acid’s anticancer activity on [[tumor cells]] developing in [[T-cell lymphoma|T Cell Lymphomas]]. The tests were conducted in vitro (in the lab) and in vivo (in body). The results showed that 13-MTD inhibits tumor cell growth by “down-regulating” p-AKT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cai Q|author2=Huang H|author3= Qian D|author4=Chen K|author5=Luo J|last-author-amp=yes|title=13-Methyltetradecanoic Acid Exhibits Anti-Tumor Activity on T-Cell Lymphomas In Vitro and In Vivo by Down-Regulating p-AKT and Activating Caspase-3 |journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0065308|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e65308|display-authors=etal|pmid=23762338|pmc=3676434}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protein kinase B|AKT]] is a [[Serine/threonine kinase|serine–threonine kinase]] that regulates cell survival. However, AKT’s regulation of cells becomes dysfunctional as cancerous cells develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kim AH|author2=Khursigara G|author3=Sun X|author4=Franke TF|author5=Chao MV|last-author-amp=yes|title=Akt phosphorylates and negatively regulates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase|date=2001|pages=893–901|doi=10.1128/mcb.21.3.893-901.2001|volume=21|issue=3|journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology|pmid=11154276|pmc=86680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, cancerous cells attack the AKT and manage to switch and keep AKT’s signals “on,” resulting in cell dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raman M|author2=Chen W|author3=Cobb MH|title=Differential regulation and properties of MAPKs|journal=Oncogene|date=2007|volume=26|doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1210392|pmid=17496909|pages=3100–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13-MTD helps down-regulate AKT, allowing stability in cells and inducing programmed cell death to the tumor cells.

==Bladder cells==

In a related study, researchers investigated 13-MTD’s anticancer activity in [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tianxin Lin|author2=XinBao Yin|author3=Qingqing Cai|author4=Xinlan Fan|author5=Kewei Xu|author6=Li Huang|author7=Junhua Luo|author8=Jianping Zheng|author9=Jian Huang|title=13-Methyltetradecanoic acid induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells |date=2010|doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2010.04.011|volume=30|issue=3|journal=Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations|pages=339–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that 13-MTD inhibits the growth of human [[bladder cancer]] cells through “[[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]-mediated” apoptosis. Moreover, data indicated that apoptosis was achieved by 13-MTD regulating the AKT and [[MAPK]] pathways. (The MAPK pathway is a chain of cell proteins that transfer information from the cell’s surface, through a receptor, to the cell’s DNA.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Orton RJ|author2= Sturm OE|author3=Vyshemirsky V|author4= Calder M|author5=Gilbert DR|author6=Kolch W|last-author-amp=yes|title=Computational modelling of the receptor-tyrosine-kinase-activated MAPK pathway |journal=The Biochemical Journal|date=2005|issue=Pt 2|pages=249–61 |doi=10.1042/BJ20050908|pmid=16293107|pmc=1316260|volume=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13-MTD brings stability to the cell by down-regulating signals that the cell receives and sends, and also by activating necessary agents to combat cancer cells. For these reasons, 13-MTD has been considered a possible [[Chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] supplement.

==Medical implications==

The results from the scores of studies conducted on 13-MTD indicate that 13-MTD can be a possible chemotherapeutic supplement. The fatty chain acid’s ability to resist and inhibit cancerous cells through apoptosis is impressive; however, what separates 13-MTD from chemical drugs and other fatty acids is the lack of toxicity levels and minimal side effects presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yang Z|author2=Liu S|author3=Chen X|author4=Chen H|author5=Huang M|author6=Zheng J|last-author-amp=yes|title=Induction of apoptotic cell death and in vivo growth inhibition of human cancer cells by a saturated branched-chain fatty acid, 13-methyltetradecanoic acid|journal=Cancer Res|date=2000|pages=505–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published work documents the treatment of both rats and humans with 13-MTD throughout a 42-day period. The researchers studied [[Adipose tissue|adipose]] (body fat) tissue turnover and noted that 13-MTD did not harm participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pittet P. G.|author2=Bessart T.|author3=Jequier E.|author4=Philippossian G.|author5=Liardon R.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Adipose tissue labelling in man, using a structurally-labelled fatty acid as tracer|date=1983|issue=53|pages=115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since 13-MTD is not produced in the human body like other fatty chain acids, its effectiveness does not depend on the body’s environmental state or stress levels. Being a foreign agent, 13-MTD works effectively against a host of cancerous mutations in the body, whereas other fatty acids fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoekstra|first1=D.|title=Ceramide-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes in vivo: a matter of the nucleus?|date=1999|issue=31|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research gathered on 13-MTD and the benefits it provides have helped introduce the fatty chain acid to the scientific community as a possible chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. Considering 13-MTD’s effective apoptosis of certain human cancer cells and the low [[toxicity]] levels it presents, the medical implications of 13-MTD will continue to be studied and developed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== The explosions ===
Eyewitnesses reported a smell of gas and white smoke coming out of [[manholes]] near Kaisyuan 3rd Road and Ersheng 1st Road in Cianjhen District on 31 July 2014 at 20:46, over three hours prior to the incident. The explosions occurred later at 23:57 on Yisin Road, Ersheng Road, Sanduo Road and Guanghua Road.&lt;ref name="LCY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KH Rocked"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/02/2003596471|title=Kaohsiung rocked by underground blasts|last1=Hsiao|first1=Alison|work=Taipei Times|accessdate=2 August 2014|date=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses reported seeing fireballs soaring into the sky and flames reaching 15 stories high. The blasts ripped up roads, trapped and overturned cars and firetrucks, and caused a [[Power outage|blackout]] to the [[electrical grid]]. About 6&amp;nbsp;km of road length were damaged.&lt;ref name="KH Rocked"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408030009.aspx |title=Restoration of roads destroyed in Kaohsiung blasts to begin Monday &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosions reportedly blew cars and motorcycles high up in the air; some vehicles and victims were found at the rooftops of buildings three or four stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408010014.aspx|title=Car, injured people found on rooftop after Kaohsiung explosions|last1=Wang |first1=Shu-fen|last2=Chen|first2=Jay|agency=Central News Agency|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One street had been split along its length, swallowing [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]] and other vehicles.

Schools and offices were closed on that day and residents were asked to leave their houses to smooth out the search and rescue operations. By afternoon, hundreds of people who fled the explosion scenes had returned home after houses around the explosion areas had been declared safe by the city spokesman. They confirmed that no more explosions could happen and that all of the fire had been put out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/world/269432701.html|title=Residents allowed to return after Taiwan gas pipeline blasts kill 26, injure 267|last1=Tsai|first1=Gladys|agency=Associated Press|work=Star Tribune|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=2 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803030014/http://www.startribune.com/world/269432701.html|archive-date=3 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic restrictions were put in place on Sanduo, Guanghua, Yixin, and Kaisyuan Roads. [[Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau]] also closed the northbound exit from Sun Yat-sen Freeway to Sanduo Road. However, [[Kaohsiung MRT]] and buses were not affected by the search and rescue works.&lt;ref name="icrt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrt.com.tw/wordpress/blog/2014/08/01/multiple-gas-explosions-in-kaohsiung-leaves-25-dead-267-injured/#.U95AsuNmO7g|title=Multiple Gas Explosions in Kaohsiung Leaves 26 Dead, 266 Injured|work=ICRT|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help the city in the rescue efforts, at 22:30 on Friday night the [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower) shut down their four sets of [[Electric generator|generators]] fed with liquid natural gas, even though none of their pipelines had been damaged during the explosions. The shutdown lowered Taiwan's total electricity output by 1,100 MW, or about 2.7% of the total capacity. The decision to stop the supply was reached after a discussion between the [[Kaohsiung City Government]] and the oil refinery [[CPC Corporation]], so that road repair and other disaster relief work could proceed without interruption. With their total generation expected to reach 36,970 MW in the peak hours of the coming week, Taipower has an excess capacity of 3,170 MW and thus can still meet the local energy demand in Kaohsiung.&lt;ref name="Taipower"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/03/413926/Taipower-generators.htm|title=Taipower generators shut down in wake of incident|last1=Liu|first1=John|work=China Post|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a precaution, China Petrochemical Development Co., which also operates in Kaohsiung, reduced the gas pressure in its propene pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/kaohsiung/2014/08/01/413789/Chemical-stocks.htm|title=Chemical stocks hit by Kaohsiung gas blasts|agency=Central News Agency|work=China Post|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, another 1,885 servicemen were deployed for the search and rescue operation at the explosion sites, bringing the total servicemen deployed during the incident to 5,567 people. Included among the servicemen were the chemical detection troops who continued to monitor any leaking gas. Equipment such as 22 ambulances, 3 chemical-detection vehicles, 13 excavators, 26 life detecting monitors, and other equipment were also being used in the rescue efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408030003.aspx|title=Military continues safety checks in aftermath of deadly Kaohsiung blasts|agency=Central News Agency|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue works attracted many passerby to watch, wander, or even for an "adventure date" in conjunction with [[Qixi Festival|Chinese Valentine's Day]], a move considered disrespectful for the dead. The police had to ask them to leave and ask the public to stay away from the areas where the explosions occurred, citing the fragility of the ground or the ruined buildings around.&lt;ref name="chinapost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/04/414016/Kaohsiung-calls.htm |title=Kaohsiung calls for avoidance of blast sites |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immediate aftermath ===
The remaining 260 tons of propene inside the damaged pipes was vented out completely by Monday from both of their input and output points. Nitrogen gas was put into pipes ensuring all propene had been removed, a move which had been done earlier by the CPC. The [[Environmental Protection Administration (Republic of China)|Environmental Protection Administration]] also had dispatched personnel to Kaohsiung to assist local government in air pollution monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/04/414015/Remaining-propene.htm |title=Remaining propene to be totally vented this morning: Duh |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office issued the [[death certificates]] of two missing firefighters who had fought the fires caused by the gas explosions, despite their bodies having yet to be found. The prosecutors said that rescuers could not find the bodies and suspected that they might have been vaporized from the explosions.&lt;ref name="chinapost.com.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/06/414175/Kaohsiung-prosecutors.htm |title=Kaohsiung prosecutors to examine part of pipe |publisher=The China Post |date=6 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August, another gas leak was reported in Cianjhen District shortly before 7:50 a.m causing widespread panic among residents. People who lived within 150 meters radius of Kaisyuan 3rd Road were evacuated the city police department to Kaohsiung Municipal Guanghua Junior High School and Le Chyuan Elementary School, raising concern among residents over their safety. Authorities tried to pin down the source of the gas and they dispatched personnel to the intersection of Yisin and Kaisyuan Roads. The gas concentration level reading peaked at 5,000 ppm at around 11 a.m which was mostly methane. However, by 14:30 the concentration level finally dropped below 10 ppm. Early measurements indicated that at least four gases leaked were methane, propene, ethylene and butane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/09/2003596987 |title=New leak sparks Kaohsiung evacuation |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August, the [[Kaohsiung City Government]] ordered LCY to halt all of operations until its plan to improve pipeline safety had been reviewed by the government. Should LCY refuse to do so, the government would notify the [[Taiwan Power Company|Taipower]] and [[Taiwan Water Corporation]] to stop providing the company with electricity and water respectively.&lt;ref name="chinapost4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/09/414463/LCY-ordered.htm |title=LCY ordered to cease operations |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[File:Sanduo 1st Road after Explosion Record 20140811-022.JPG|thumb|The damaged underground pipes and [[Storm drain|sewer system]] creating [[trench]]es.]]

The [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] [[Chang Chia-juch]], acting as the Director of the [[Central Emergency Operation Center]], suspected that the explosions were caused by a [[propene]] leak, and the firefighters could not extinguish the fires with water. Emergency workers had to wait until the gas had burnt away after the supply was shut down. It is suspected that the affected pipelines were those used for gas delivery to the [[petrochemical]] factory LCY Chemical Corp. (LCY; {{zh|c=李長榮化學工業}}).&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Li|first1=Lauly|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/04/414000/LCY-apologizes.htm|title=LCY apologizes over Kaohsiung blasts|work=China Post|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected pipelines were designed and constructed by the government-owned [[CPC Corporation]]. However, CPC said that the pipeline system did not show any sign of problems before the explosion.&lt;ref name="12000 evacuee"/&gt; The gas pipelines were approved in 1990 by [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Wu Den-yih]], who served as mayor of Kaohsiung from 1990 to 1998, and the construction was completed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ada Lee in Kaohsiung and Angela Meng |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1566101/owner-pipeline-caused-deadly-blasts-kaohsiung-never-inspected-it |title=Owners never inspected Taiwan gas pipeline that exploded because they 'didn't have the keys' &amp;#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipelines had not been properly inspected for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setnews.net/News.aspx?PageGroupID=6&amp;NewsID=33800 |title=獨家／「知道管線很多」24年前公文曝光！吳敦義批准埋的 |publisher=Setnews.net |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kaohsiung City Government]] found out that a 4-inch pipeline delivering propene to Ren Da Industrial Park was found to encounter abnormal pressure between 20:40 and 21:00 the night the gas leak was discovered.&lt;ref name="LCY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KH Rocked"/&gt;

Pressure in the LCY piping system used to transport propene from one of its suppliers began to show abnormality starting 20:00&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/03/413931/President-pledges.htm|title=President pledges to ensure no more explosions of gas pipelines|agency=Central News Agency|work=China Post|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thursday night and 3.77 tons of propene leaked between 20:00 and 21:00 The company did not shut down the pipe until 23:40, 16 minutes before the first gas explosion occurred. The concentration of the propene at the explosion site was abnormally high at 13,000 [[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408010049.aspx|title=LCY will not avoid responsibility in blasts: chairman|last1=Chang|first1=Ming-kun|last2=Pan|first2=Chih-yi|first3=Lilian|last3=Wu|last4=Kuo|first4=Chung-han|agency=Central News Agency|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on Friday, LCY CEO said that the company is fully cooperating with the authorities in the investigation and the company will bear the responsibility if found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/03/413933/Investigators-found.htm|title=Investigators found pipeline with evidence of gas leakage: report|last1=Liu|first1=John|work=China Post|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a press conference on Sunday at the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]] in [[Taipei]], LCY said that it was the responsibility of CPC to design and check the gas pipes. CPC responded that the pipes belonged to LCY and CPC did not have any maintenance contract with them. LCY further explained that detecting pressure drops indicating gas leaks was the responsibility of the China General Terminal and Distribution Corporation (CGTD; {{zh|c=華運倉儲}}), who transport LCY's petrochemicals through the pipes. LCY claimed they first detected abnormalities when the propene supply completely ceased at 8:49 p.m and returned to normal half an hour later. At 22:35, they detected further problems, shutting down transporting immediately. According to Kaohsiung's top environment official, though, 3.77 metric tons of gas had leaked already between 20:00 and 21:00, and the pipe system was only shut down at 23:40 - just 16 minutes before the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408030012.aspx|title=Private firm claims exploded pipes managed by state-run oil company|agency=Central News Agency|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office (KDPO) retrieved documents and records related to propene transport after they raided LCY and CGTD offices a day before. Several employees were brought to the prosecutors office for questioning. To better investigate the causes of the accident, KDPO also invited domestic metal and petrochemical experts to the blast areas to collect evidence.&lt;ref name="chinapost.com.tw"/&gt; On 18 December, the CEO and five employees of LCY Chemical, three employees of China General Terminal and Distribution, and three employees of the Kaohsiung Public Works Bureau were indicted for their role in the incident. The indictment charges these three groups with negligence, due to their failure to inspect or maintain the pipeline.&lt;ref name="cna1218"/&gt;

Public reactions towards the government have been largely negative, criticizing what was seen as a slow response by the authorities to stop and isolate the gas leak after it was first reported.

[[File:Sanduo 1st Road After 2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions-1.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army|Taiwanese army]] soldiers during the search and rescue period at Sanduo 1st Road on Friday after the explosion]]

A total of ten [[emergency shelter]]s consisting of several schools and a cultural center were used for the 12,000 people who had evacuated overnight.&lt;ref name="12000 evacuee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/kaohsiung/2014/08/01/413794/12000-people.htm|title=12,000 people in shelters after deadly Kaohsiung explosions|agency=Central News Agency|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people, including high school students, had volunteered to help the post-disaster relief efforts by helping with the relief supplies distribution and offering of other services, such as counseling.&lt;ref name="chinapost2"/&gt;

Dozens of hotels around Kaohsiung offered temporary free lodging, laundry and washroom facilities for the people who were left homeless after their houses were damaged by the blast. Restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores also provided various kinds of supports.

Relief supplies and works, such as food, blanket, sleeping bags, bottled water, injury and emergency assistance, counseling and funeral arrangements, were made possible by the [[Tzu Chi|Tzu Chi Foundation]], the Kaohsiung Branch of the [[Red Cross Society of the Republic of China|Taiwanese Red Cross]], the [[Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation]] and many other foundations. Religious rituals were also held at the blast sites for grieving relatives who had lost their loved ones.&lt;ref name="relief"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/02/2003596473|title=Relief efforts unite entire nation|last1=Chen|first1=Ping-hung|first2=Jason|last2=Pan|work=Taipei Times|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese singers such as [[Kenji Wu]], [[Mayday (Taiwanese band)|Mayday]], and [[Peter Ho]] and Chinese mainland singer [[Ding Dang (singer)|Ding Dang]] joined the public in giving donations to support the blast victims, since many of their relatives also live in Kaohsiung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lollipop.sg/content/jay-chou-and-ruby-lin-narrowly-escape-kaohsiung-gas-explosion|title=Jay Chou and Ruby Lin narrowly escape Kaohsiung gas explosion|publisher=lollipop.sg|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Pan|first=Jason|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/04/2003596631/1|title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: FEATURE: Mayday give relief fund NT$15m, bid fans to follow suit|work=Taipei Times|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Culture (Republic of China)|Ministry of Culture]] launched a poetry drive to honor the blast victims posted on the ministry's [[Facebook]] page. Culture Minister [[Lung Ying-tai]] herself contributed a poem entitled ''If I Had Known Earlier'' ({{zh|c=如果早知道}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/07/2003596859 |title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Poetry drive to honor Kaohsiung victims, families |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (Republic of China)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] has been providing services to hold counselings to help residents to go through [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] by mobilizing medical personnel and social workers to the affected district areas. The services will be in place for the next two to three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/07/2003596857 |title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Health ministry offers PTSD counseling |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the donations and support Kaohsiung had received, many victims complained that they had to wait in line for more than two hours to get them. Some people were also caught on camera pretending that they were the explosion victims or taking turns in group to get the donations several times more than what they were supposed to get.&lt;ref name="chinapost1"/&gt;

As of 7 August, a total NT$2.38 billion worth of donations had been received from companies and individuals, with another NT$1.6 billion funds agreed to be provided by the [[Executive Yuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408080013.aspx |title=Donations continue to pour in for Kaohsiung blast victims |publisher=Focus Taiwan |date= |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/awps/201408100016.aspx |title=United Daily News: Reconstruction top priority for Kaohsiung &amp;#124; What the Papers Say &amp;#124; FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration works ==
[[File:Damaged Kaixuan 2nd Road under Construction 20140811.jpg|thumb|Heavy vehicles mobilized for reconstruction works at Kaisyuan 2nd Road.]]

The initial estimation of the total damage done to Kaohsiung City due to the blast reached around NT$1.9 billion for rebuilding the damaged roads and drainage system. However, the cost may arise higher if the cost to rebuild damaged buildings and to compensate victims are included in order to get their live back on track as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="chinapost3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/05/414087/Govt-to.htm |title=Gov't to prepare plan for nation's gas pipelines |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilding of the 6&amp;nbsp;km damaged road began on Monday by road [[Road surface|resurfacing]]. Sanduo Road work was done by Maintenance Office of the Kaohsiung City Government, Yisin Road by New Construction Office and Kaisyuan Road by Water Resources Bureau. The restoration works included the repaving of the roads, reparation of the damaged [[sidewalk]]s and replanting of trees along the road which would cost around NT$600 million. The restoration of the [[Storm drain|rain water drainage system]] under the road will take around three months which costs another NT$600 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408030009.aspx|title=Restoration of roads destroyed in Kaohsiung blasts to begin Monday|agency=Central News Agency|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1,500 stores along the damaged roads are affected with the reconstruction work of the roads, which lead the owners to temporarily close their stores due to lack of customers. Some of the business owners at Kaisyuan Road are already looking for relocation than waiting for the roadwork to finish in months. The Economic Development Bureau had received registrations from 1,275 companies so far for compensation related to the disaster. The bureau added that the city government will give tax reductions for the affected stores and will construct temporary paths to allow access to the areas without roadworks, and businesses could also apply for social aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/05/2003596702 KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Businesses facing loss of customers during repairs] taipeitimes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coming days after the explosions, restoration and reconstruction works had mostly been hampered, delayed or sometimes halted by heavy rain and the excessive flooding around the area due to the rain. [[Trench]]es created from the blasts were flooded and water flow was blocked due to the damaged sewage, culverts and drainage system. Water pipes had been utilized to minimize flooding in some areas of the city. Armies and fire fighters also were put on standby ready to be deployed with life rafts whenever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/12/414682/Rain-flooding.htm |title=Rain, flooding delay reconstruction |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the Sanduo, Kaisyuan and Yishin Roads were finally opened again for traffic after restoration works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=D307BC15A904EF18FC0833028B91E29C |date=18 November 2014 |title=Kaohsiung Completes Repairs |publisher=Formosa News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042436/http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=D307BC15A904EF18FC0833028B91E29C |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of December 2014, in order to revive the economic activities to the affected stores and shops area, the Kaohsiung City Government held lucky draws and other promotional sales to attract consumption at those stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/kaohsiung/2014/12/29/425153/Kaohsiung-unveils.htm|first=John|last=Liu|date=29 December 2014|title=

== Aftermath ==

=== The petrochemical industry ===
[[Share (finance)|Share prices]] of several Taiwanese petrochemical companies took a dive in the aftermath of the explosions, especially those operating in Kaohsiung. The shares of LCY has dropped 30% since the explosions day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yu-Huay Sun and Adela Lin |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-07/taiwan-economy-minister-offers-resignation-after-deadly-blasts.html |title=Taiwan Economy Minister Offers to Resign After Deadly Blasts |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] [[Woody Duh]] said that the ministry would set up a system soon to help check the underground pipelines and build a database for safety management in the future, starting from Kaohsiung and followed by other [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]], [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|municipalities]] and [[County (Taiwan)|counties]]. Duh mentioned that relocation of the Kaohsiung underground pipelines would be considered once the [[roadworks]] are completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/03/413937/Ministry-initiates.htm|title=Ministry initiates plan to check pipelines under city|agency=Central News Agency|work=China Post|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taipei City Government]] ordered mandatory inspections of all four major gas pipelines in [[Taipei]] within a week after reports of gas leakage smell in [[Zhongshan District, Taipei|Zhongshan]] and [[Wanhua District]]s for five consecutive days. Great Taipei Gas had earlier inspected the site and found no immediate danger, adding that the firm had sealed the leaks and plans to change the pipes. Still at Zhongshan District, the gas company did some maintenance work to the reported gas leak near Songjiang Road. On Friday, Taipei Deputy Mayor [[Chen Hsiung-wen]] led an inspection of a gas storage unit in [[Neihu District]] and said that underground gas pipelines crossing Taipei City carry low-pressure gas and do not carry any chemical substances. He also added that major gas suppliers are required to inspect all of their pipelines within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Chiu|first1=Shao-wen|last2=Lu|first2=Heng-chien|last3=Chung|first3=Jake |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/04/2003596632/1|title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Taipei government orders gas firms to inspect all city pipelines within a week|work=Taipei Times|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city government also later on launched a website for Taipei residents to check what types of underground cables and pipelines running near their houses, ranging from [[Undergrounding|electric lines]], telecommunication lines, and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] used to transport sanitized water, waste water, rain water, natural gas and oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/07/414287/Website-to.htm |title=Website to check underground cables, pipelines near homes |publisher=The China Post |date=8 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few days after the blast, Premier Jiang Yi-huah appointed the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]] to gather and sort out Taiwan's entire underground petrochemical pipeline network information and to establish a management system to avoid similar accidents from happening in the future, adding that such a management system would help local governments to determine which petrochemical pipelines need to be relocated and which ones can stay in place.&lt;ref name="chinapost3"/&gt;

A [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] legislator called on the local governments to form agencies that deal with chemical hazards and employ trained professionals to oversee disaster management, and to better educate firefighters on the nature of different chemicals in order to make correct decisions and reduce casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/05/2003596701 |title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: PFP moot chemical regulations |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and resignation of government officials ===
On 6 August, Premier [[Jiang Yi-huah]] and Economic Affairs Minister [[Chang Chia-juch]] came under fire and were asked to step down by demonstrators after Jiang's "Three Noes" remarks on 4 August stating that there were no need for a special provision bill, financial assistance through special budget allocation, and a dedicated agency to administer post disaster relief and reconstruction for Kaohsiung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/07/2003596855 |title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Activists, residents call on premier to step down |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the same day, residents and DPP councilors of [[Kaohsiung City Council]] went to [[District Courts (Republic of China)|Taiwan Kaohsiung District Court]] to protest against LCY in an attempt to prevent the company from avoiding compensation payments over the gas blasts. Mayor Chen said that Kaohsiung City Government had frozen firm assets and properties worth around NT$1.9 billion as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/08/07/414274/Kaohsiung-aims.htm |title=Kaohsiung aims to seize LCY funds |publisher=The China Post |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August, in order to take the responsibility for the blast, Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Wu Hong-mo, Water Resources Bureau Director Lee Hsien-yi, Public Works Bureau Director Chen Tsun-yung and [[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] Bureau Director Chen Tsun-yung tendered their resignation, a move which Mayor Chen praised and that she approved and stated that the resignation would take effect after the relief works ended.&lt;ref name="chinapost4"/&gt;

In the evening, the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]] issued a statement saying that Minister [[Chang Chia-juch]] and Deputy Minister [[Woody Duh]] had also tendered his resignation earlier at 10 a.m. to the [[Executive Yuan]] due to the difficult political environment as a result of persistent boycott by opposition parties over several economic policies in the past 1.5 years. Despite Premier [[Jiang Yi-huah]] efforts to persuade Chang to stay in his ministerial position, the Executive Yuan finally approved his resignation on 10 August and appointed Deputy Minister [[Woody Duh]] to replace Chang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/08/2003596910 |title=Minister offers to resign following gas explosions |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu |first=Jenny W. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-minister-offers-to-resign-over-blast-1407411936 |title=Taiwan Minister Offers to Resign Over Blast - WSJ |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/11/2003597136 |title=Woody Duh named new MOEA head |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memorial services ===
[[Funeral]]s for the deceased was held on the same day at Kaohsiung municipal mortuary, attended by Vice Premier [[Mao Chi-kuo]], Kaohsiung Mayor [[Chen Chu]], Minister without Portfolio [[Yang Chiu-hsing]], DPP Chairperson [[Tsai Ing-wen]] and also LCY Chairman Bowei Lee. Lee bowed his head to apologize to the families of the blast victims, promising them that the company would provide good financial compensation to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/08/2003596932 |title=KAOHSIUNG DISASTER: Families vent anger at LCY chief |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August, a national religious service was held in [[Kaohsiung Arena]], bringing together around 10,000 people from 30 local religious groups covering [[Buddhism in Taiwan|Buddhism]], [[Christianity in Taiwan|Christianity]], [[Islam in Taiwan|Islam]] and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/13/2003597293/1 |title=Residents of blast-hit areas ask Jiang to help them |publisher=Taipei Times |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], who also attended the event, commended the soldiers and firefighters who risked their lives in saving life of the people. He reassured the audience that the government would provide the necessary assistance to help Kaohsiung residence back to their normal life as soon as possible. He also expressed his gratitude to the business and volunteers who had made generous contributions to the relief and reconstruction efforts after the blast disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201408120025.aspx |title=Religious service held in Kaohsiung for disaster victims (update) &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2548253 |title=Religious service held in Kaohsiung for disaster victims (update) - Taiwan News Online |publisher=Taiwannews.com.tw |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ANAIS''' is a [[particle detector]] experiment designed to detect [[dark matter]]. ANAIS stands for ''Annual modulation with NAI [[Scintillator]]s''. Its main goal is the direct detection of the dark matter through its [[scattering]] off the target nuclei in a radiopure [[NaI#Radiation physics and medicine|NaI(Tl)]] crystal. This dark matter signal should be annually modulated by the change in the relative velocity of [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]-[[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], a result of the rotation of the Earth around the Sun.

ANAIS is the scaled conclusion of feasibility studies carried out with different prototypes by the [[University of Zaragoza]] group at the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], Spain. The complete experiment will use more than one hundred of&amp;nbsp;kg of ultrapure [[sodium]]-[[iodine]] NaI(Tl) crystals. Data recording began at the end of October 2012 using 25&amp;nbsp;kg in two prototype detectors as the last step before launching the larger experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/375/1/012026 Update on the ANAIS experiment.

The angle of incidence is fixed in the design of the aircraft, and with [[Variable-incidence wing|rare exceptions]], cannot be varied in flight.

The term can also be applied to horizontal surfaces in general (such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] or horizontal stabilizers) for the angle they make relative the longitudinal axis of the fuselage.

The figure to the right shows a side view of an airplane.  The extended chord line of the wing root (red line) makes an angle with the longitudinal axis (roll axis) of the aircraft (blue line).  Wings are typically mounted at a small positive angle of incidence, to allow the fuselage to have a low angle with the airflow in cruising flight.  Angles of incidence of about 6° are common on most [[general aviation]] designs.
Other terms for angle of incidence in this context are ''rigging angle'' and ''rigger's angle of incidence''. It should not be confused with the [[angle of attack]], which is the angle the wing chord presents to the airflow in flight. Note that some [[ambiguity]] in this terminology exists, as some engineering texts that focus solely on the study of airfoils and their medium may use either term when referring to angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, A.C.

'''Arches paper''' is a brand of air-dried [[paper]] that is used by [[Printer (publisher)|printers]] and [[watercolor]]ists. It has a warm white colour and is produced in [[hot-pressed]], [[cold-pressed]], and rough varieties. Arches paper is made in the village of Arches in the [[Vosges]], France.

==History==

The history of Arches starts in 1492 when the Arches site completed the amalgamation of the paper-making facilities around the village of Arches, south of Epinal. 

The Moulins d'Arches turned to the production of high quality paper for writing and art publication. The mill thus produced paper for [[incunable]]s (the name given to the first printed books), such as the ''Chronique de Nuremberg'' by Dürer. Also printed on Arches paper was the "Description De L'Égypte" commissioned by Napoleon I upon his return from his Egyptian campaign. The work was used by the royalty from 1809 to 1828.

== Products ==
The product range comprises the following papers:
* Watercolour papers
* Drawing papers: these mould-made papers have a puffy aspect, a nice feel and conservation qualities.
* Printmaking papers
* Oil papers

==See also==
* [[Cartridge paper]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12938">In physics, '''Berry connection''' and '''Berry curvature''' are related concepts which can be viewed, respectively, as a local gauge potential and gauge field associated with the [[Berry phase]]. These concepts were introduced by [[Michael Berry (physicist)|Michael Berry]] in a paper published in 1984&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

emphasizing how [[geometric phase]]s provide a powerful unifying concept in several branches of [[Classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics]]. Such phases have come to be known as [[geometric phase|Berry phases]].

==Berry phase and cyclic adiabatic evolution==

In quantum mechanics, the Berry phase arises in a cyclic [[Adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] evolution. The quantum [[adiabatic theorem]] applies to a system whose [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt; depends on a (vector) parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; that varies with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  If the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'th [[eigenvalue]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_n(\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt; remains non-degenerate everywhere along the path and the variation with time ''t'' is sufficiently slow, then a system initially in the [[eigenstate]] 
&lt;math&gt;\, |n(\mathbf R(0))\rangle &lt;/math&gt; will remain in an instantaneous eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\, |n(\mathbf R(t))\rangle &lt;/math&gt; of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\, H(\mathbf R(t))&lt;/math&gt;, up to a phase, throughout the process.  Regarding the phase, the state at time ''t'' can be written as&lt;ref name=Sakurai&gt;
{{cite book
|author= Sakurai, J.J.
|title= Modern Quantum Mechanics

|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w2a8QgAACAAJ}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
|\Psi_n(t)\rangle =e^{i\gamma_n(t)}\,
e^{-{i\over\hbar}\int_0 ^t dt'\varepsilon_n(\mathbf R(t'))}\,
| n(\mathbf R(t))\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the second exponential term is the "dynamic phase factor." The first exponential term is the geometric term, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; being the Berry phase.  By plugging into the [[Schrödinger equation#Time dependent equation|time-dependent Schrödinger equation]], it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_n(t)=i\int_0^t dt'\,\langle n(\mathbf R(t'))|{d\over dt'}|n(\mathbf R(t'))\rangle=i\int_{\mathbf R(0)}^{\mathbf R(t)} d\mathbf R\,\langle n(\mathbf R)|\nabla_{\mathbf R}|n(\mathbf R)\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
indicating that the Berry phase only depends on the path in the parameter space, not on the rate at which the path is traversed.

In the case of a cyclic evolution around a closed path &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R(T)=\mathbf R(0)&lt;/math&gt;, the closed-path Berry phase is
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_n=i\oint_{\mathcal C} d\mathbf R\,\langle n(\mathbf R)|\nabla_{\mathbf R}|n(\mathbf R)\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
An example of physical system where an electron moves along a closed path is cyclotron motion (details are given in the page of [[Geometric phase|Berry phase]]). Berry phase must be considered to obtain the correct quantization condition.

==Gauge transformation==

Without changing the physics, we can make a [[Gauge theory#Mathematical formalism|gauge transformation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
|\tilde n(\mathbf R)\rangle=e^{-i\beta(\mathbf R)}|n(\mathbf R)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
to a new set of states that differ from the original ones only by an &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;-dependent phase factor.  This modifies the open-path Berry phase to be &lt;math&gt;\tilde\gamma_n(t)=\gamma_n(t)+\beta(t)-\beta(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  For a closed path, continuity requires that &lt;math&gt;\beta(T)-\beta(0)=2\pi m&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; an integer), and it follows that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; is invariant, modulo &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, under an arbitrary gauge transformation.

==Berry connection==
The closed-path Berry phase defined above can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_n=\int_\mathcal{C} d\mathbf R\cdot \mathcal{A}_n(\mathbf R)
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_n(\mathbf R)=i\langle n(\mathbf R)|\nabla_{\mathbf R}|n(\mathbf R)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
is a vector-valued function known as the Berry connection (or Berry potential).  The Berry connection is gauge-dependent, transforming as
&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_n(\mathbf R)=\mathcal{A}_n (\mathbf R)+\nabla_{\mathbf R\,}\beta(\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the local Berry connection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_n(\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt; can never be physically observable. However, its integral along a closed path, the Berry phase &lt;math&gt;\gamma_n&lt;/math&gt;, is gauge-invariant up to an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;e^{i\gamma_n}&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely gauge-invariant, and may be related to physical observables.

==Berry curvature==

The Berry curvature is an [[Antisymmetric tensor|anti-symmetric]] second-rank tensor derived from the Berry connection via
:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega_{n,\mu\nu} (\mathbf R)={\partial\over\partial R^\mu}\mathcal{A}_{n,\nu}(\mathbf R)-{\partial\over\partial R^\nu}\mathcal{A}_{n,\mu}(\mathbf R).
&lt;/math&gt;
In a three-dimensional parameter space the Berry curvature can be written in the [[pseudovector]] form
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf\Omega_n(\mathbf R)=\nabla_{\mathbf R} \times\mathcal{A}_n(\mathbf R).
&lt;/math&gt;
The tensor and pseudovector forms of the Berry curvature are related to each other through the [[Levi-Civita symbol|Levi-Civita]] antisymmetric tensor as
&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n,\mu\nu}=\epsilon_{\mu\nu\xi}\,\mathbf\Omega_{n,\xi}&lt;/math&gt;.  In contrast to the Berry connection, which is physical only after integrating around a closed path, the Berry curvature is a gauge-invariant local manifestation of the geometric properties of the wavefunctions in the parameter space, and has proven to be an essential physical ingredient for understanding a variety of electronic properties.&lt;ref name=resta2000&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For a closed path &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; that forms the boundary of a surface &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, the closed-path Berry phase can be rewritten using [[Stokes' theorem]] as
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_n=\int_\mathcal{S} d\mathbf S\cdot\mathbf\Omega_n (\mathbf R).
&lt;/math&gt;
If the surface is a closed manifold, the boundary term vanishes, but the indeterminacy of the boundary term modulo &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; manifests itself in the [[Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem|Chern theorem]], which states that the integral of the Berry curvature over a closed manifold is quantized in units of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This number is the so-called [[Chern number]], and is essential for understanding various quantization effects.

Finally, note that the Berry curvature can also be written as a sum over all other eigenstates in the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega_{n,\mu\nu}(\mathbf R)=i\sum_{n'\neq n}{\langle n|(\partial H/\partial R_\mu) |n'\rangle\langle n'|(\partial H/\partial R_\nu) | n\rangle-(\nu\leftrightarrow\mu)\over(\varepsilon_n-\varepsilon_{n'})^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Example: Spinor in a magnetic field==

The Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 particle in a [[magnetic field]] can be written as&lt;ref name=Sakurai/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H=\mu\mathbf\sigma\cdot\mathbf B,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\sigma&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Pauli matrices]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic moment]], and '''B''' is the magnetic field. In three dimensions, the eigenstates have energies &lt;math&gt;\pm\mu B&lt;/math&gt; and their eigenvectors are
:&lt;math&gt;
|u_-\rangle=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\sin{\theta\over 2}e^{-i\phi}\\
	-\cos{\theta\over 2}
	\end{pmatrix},
|u_+\rangle=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\cos{\theta\over 2}e^{-i\phi}\\
	\sin{\theta\over 2}
	\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Now consider the &lt;math&gt;|u_-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state.  Its Berry connection can be computed as
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_\theta=\langle u|i\partial_\theta u\rangle=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_\phi=\langle u|i\partial_\phi u\rangle=\sin^2{\theta\over 2}
&lt;/math&gt;,
and the Berry curvature is
&lt;math&gt;
\Omega_{\theta\phi}=\partial_\theta\mathcal{A}_\phi-\partial_\phi\mathcal A_\theta={1\over 2}\sin\theta.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we choose a new gauge by multiplying &lt;math&gt;|u_-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the Berry connections are
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_\phi=-\cos^2{\theta\over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, while the Berry curvature remains the same. This is consistent with the conclusion that the Berry connection is gauge-dependent while the Berry curvature is not.

The Berry curvature per solid angle is given by &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}_{\theta\phi}=\Omega_{\theta\phi}/\sin\theta=1/2&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the Berry phase corresponding to any given path on the unit sphere &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S^2&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic-field space is just half the solid angle subtended by the path.
The integral of the Berry curvature over the whole sphere is therefore exactly &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, so that the Chern number is unity, consistent with the Chern theorem.

==Applications in crystals==

The Berry phase plays an important role in modern investigations of electronic properties in crystalline solids&lt;ref name=BerryMod/&gt; and in the theory of the [[quantum Hall effect#Mathematics|quantum Hall effect]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The periodicity of the crystalline potential allows the application of the [[Bloch theorem]], which states that the Hamiltonian eigenstates take the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)=e^{i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r}u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a band index, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; is a wavevector in the [[reciprocal space|reciprocal-space]] ([[Brillouin zone]]), and &lt;math&gt;u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; is a periodic function of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, letting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; play the role of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;, one can define Berry phases, connections, and curvatures in the reciprocal space.  For example, the Berry connection in reciprocal space is
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_n(\mathbf k)=i\langle u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)|\nabla_{\mathbf k}|u_{n\mathbf k}(\mathbf r)\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
Because the Bloch theorem also implies that the reciprocal space itself is closed, with the Brillouin zone having the topology of a 3-torus in three dimensions, the requirements of integrating over a closed loop or manifold can easily be satisfied. In this way, such properties as the [[electric polarization]], orbital [[magnetization]], [[Hall effect#Anomalous Hall effect|anomalous Hall conductivity]], and orbital magnetoelectric coupling can be expressed in terms of Berry phases, connections, and curvatures.&lt;ref name=BerryMod/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Stonehenge==
The term "bluestone" in Britain is used in a loose sense to cover all of the "foreign" stones at [[Stonehenge]]. It is a "convenience" label rather than a geological term, since at least 20 different rock types are represented. One of the most common rocks in the assemblage is known as Preseli Spotted Dolerite—a chemically altered [[igneous rock]] containing spots or clusters of secondary minerals replacing [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. It is a medium grained dark and heavy rock, harder than granite. Preseli bluestone tools, such as axes, have been discovered elsewhere within the British Isles. Many of them appear to have been made in or near Stonehenge, since there are petrographic similarities with some of the spotted [[dolerite]]s there.

[[File:Carnmenyn Monument H1a.jpg|thumb|Bluestone monument and Carn Menyn, [[Preseli Hills]]]]
The bluestones at [[Stonehenge]] were placed there during the third phase of construction at Stonehenge around 2300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | author = Jon Swaine  | title =Stonehenge birthdate discovered by archaeologists    | work =  | publisher =[[The Daily Telegraph]]  | date =2008-09-22  | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3046095/Stonehenge-birthdate-discovered-by-archaeologists.html  | doi =  | accessdate =2008-09-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that there were about 80 of them originally, but this has never been proven since only 43 remain.  The stones are estimated to weigh between 2 and 4 tons each. The majority of them are believed to have been brought from the [[Preseli Hills]], about 250 kilometres (150 miles) away in [[Wales]], either through [[glaciation]] ([[glacial erratic]] theory) or through humans organizing their transportation.  If a glacier transported the stones, then it must have been the [[Irish Sea Glacier]].&lt;ref&gt; CHIVERRELL, R.C., THRASHER, I., THOMAS, G.S.P., LANG, A., SCOURSE, J.D., VAN LANDEGHEM, K.J.J., McCARROLL, D., CLARK, C., Ó’COFAIGH, C., EVANS, D.J.A. &amp;  BALLANTYNE, C.K. 2013. Bayesian modelling the retreat of the Irish Sea Ice Stream.  Journal of Quaternary Science 28, 200-209.&lt;/ref&gt; In such event, one might expect to find other bluestone boulders or slabs near the Stonehenge site, but no such bluestones (apart from fragments) have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Channel, Naked Science: Who Built Stonehenge? |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/who-built-stonehenge/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502033832/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/who-built-stonehenge/ |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological find of the [[Boscombe Bowmen]] has been cited in support of the human transport theory, while new glacier modelling supports the erratic theory.  Preseli Bluestone dolerite axe heads have been found around the Preseli Hills as well, indicating that there was a population who knew how to work with the stones,&lt;ref&gt;N. P. Figgis, "Prehistoric Preseli" (Atelier Productions, 2001). {{ISBN|1-899793-06-2}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but researchers reporting in 2015 found no firm evidence of quarrying at Rhosyfelin in the Preselis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Western Telegraph|title=New research undermines Welsh bluestone quarry theory|date=13 November 2015|url=http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/14030126.New_research_undermines_Welsh_bluestone_quarry_theory/|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of the major aspects of the Stonehenge "bluestone conundrum" was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Johnson "Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma" (fig.89.P165.) (Thames and Hudson 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year a book devoted specifically to the problem of bluestone provenance and transport concluded that the Stonehenge bluestones are essentially an ill-sorted assemblage of glacial erratics.&lt;ref&gt;Brian John, "The Bluestone Enigma" (Greencroft Books, 2008) page 146. {{ISBN|978-0-905559-89-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research into the origin of the bluestones was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bevins, Richard E., Ixer, Rob A., Webb, Peter C., Watson, John S.  2012.

Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 39, Issue 4, April 2012, pages 1005–1019&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, researchers reported they had confirmed the Preseli Spotted Dolerite stones at Stonehenge came from two Neolithic quarries at [[Carn Goedog]] and [[Craig Rhos-y-felin]] in the Preseli Hills. Using radiocarbon dating, researchers dated the quarry activities to around 3400 BC for Craig Rhos-y-felin and 3200 BC for Carn Goedog. Project director Mike Parker Pearson of the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]] noted the finding was "intriguing because the bluestones didn't get put up at Stonehenge until around 2900 BC… It could have taken those Neolithic stone-draggers nearly 500 years to get them to Stonehenge, but that's pretty improbable in my view. It's more likely that the stones were first used in a local monument, somewhere near the quarries, that was then dismantled and dragged off to Wiltshire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=University College London|title=Stonehenge 'bluestone' quarries confirmed 140 miles away in Wales|date=7 December 2015|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1215/071215-stonehenge-bluestone-quarries|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
[[Image:Pentridge.jpg|thumb|upright|HM Prison Pentridge was one of the many buildings constructed of local bluestone in Melbourne in the 19th century]]

There are three distinct building materials called "bluestone" in Australia.

===Victoria ===
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], what is known as bluestone is a basalt or [[olivine]] basalt. It was one of the favoured building materials during the [[Victorian Gold Rush]] period of the 1850s. In [[Melbourne]] it was extracted from quarries throughout the inner northern suburbs, such as [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]] and [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]], where the quarry used to source the stone for [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]] is now Coburg Lake.&lt;ref&gt;History of Brunswick, City of Moreland, http://moreland.vic.gov.au/moreland-libraries/services/local-history/history-brunswick.html, accessed 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Melbourne'': Quarries and Brickmaking, http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01213b.htm, accessed 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bluestone was also sourced in many other regions of the Victorian volcanic plains, and used in towns and cities of central and western regions, including [[Ballarat]], [[Geelong]], [[Kyneton]], [[Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. It is still quarried at a number of places around the state.

Bluestone is very hard and therefore difficult to work, so it was predominantly used for warehouses, miscellaneous walls, and the foundations of buildings. However, a number of significant bluestone buildings exist, including the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], [[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Deaf Children Australia]] and [[Victorian College for the Deaf]], [[Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind|Vision Australia]], the [[Goldsbrough Mort &amp; Co|Goldsbrough Mort]] warehouses ([[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]]) and the [[Williamstown Lighthouse|Timeball Tower]], as well as [[St Mary of the Angels Basilica, Geelong|St Mary's Basilica]] in [[Geelong]]. Some examples of other major structures that use bluestone include [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], the adjacent Federation Wharf, and [[Hawthorn Bridge]]. Because of its distinctive qualities, post-modern Melbourne buildings have also made use of bluestone for nostalgic reasons. These include the Southgate complex and promenade in [[Southbank, Victoria]], and apartment buildings such as the ''Melburnian''.

Bluestone was also used extensively as [[cobblestone]], and for kerbs and gutters, many examples which still exist in some of [[List of lanes and arcades in Melbourne city centre|Melbourne's smaller city lanes]] and 19th Century inner suburban lanes. Crushed bluestone [[construction aggregate|aggregate]], known as "blue metal" (or "bluemetal"), is still used extensively in Victoria as railway [[track ballast|ballast]], road base, and, combined with [[asphalt|bitumen]], as road surfacing material, as well as in concrete making.

===South Australia===
[[Image:Bluestone33.jpg|thumb|right|Typical colouring caused by mineralisation in Adelaide bluestone.]]

In [[South Australia]], the name bluestone is given to a form of slate which is much less durable than Victorian bluestone, but was valued for its decorative appearance.  The interior of the stone is usually pale grey or beige in colour, but is given attractively coloured surfaces by ferric oxide and other minerals deposited in joints and bedding planes.  The slate is laid in masonry with the mineralised surfaces exposed.  Bluestone was most popular from about the 1850s to the 1920s, quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] at [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]], [[O'Halloran Hill]] (formerly Tapley's Hill) and [[Glen Osmond]], and a number of other places in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lockhart Jack, "The Building Stones of South Australia" (Adelaide 1923) pp. 18-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tasmania===
In Tasmania, the name bluestone is given to dolerite (diabase), which is a dominant stone variety in the landscape, and used in a variety of building roles.

==New Zealand==
[[File:Dunedin Station and Courts.jpg|thumb|right|Dunedin Railway Station (centre) and Law Courts (right), showing dark bluestone and creamy Oamaru stone construction.]]

[[Timaru]] bluestone is an attractive building material, used both historically and to the present.  It is a grey basalt similar to Victorian bluestone,  quarried near Timaru in the South Island. Bluestone from near [[Kokonga]] in [[Central Otago]] is also widely used, and is the main construction material (often with facing of [[Oamaru stone]], a local compact limestone) in many of the notable historic buildings in the southern South Island, most of which were constructed during the financial boom following the [[Otago Gold Rush|Central Otago gold rush]].

Prominent structures to use this combination include [[Otago University Registry Building]], [[Dunedin Law Courts]], and [[Dunedin Railway Station]]. Similar construction using Timaru bluestone was used for [[Christchurch Arts Centre]].

==United States and Canada==
[[File:North River Blue Stone Works Malden NY.png|thumb|Bluestone works at Malden, Ulster County, New York]]

The best known American variety of bluestone is a feldspathic [[sandstone]], which is produced in hundreds of small quarries in adjacent areas of Pennsylvania and New York. It is also quarried in the Canadian Appalachians near Deer Lake in Western Newfoundland. The [[Pennsylvania Bluestone]] Association has 105 members, the vast majority of them quarriers. The other, lesser known, type of American bluestone is formed from a different sedimentary rock, limestone. The limestone is abundant in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of [[Virginia]] yet The [[Frazier Quarry]] is the only remaining quarry that cuts dimension stone from it.

Bluestone from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] is commercially known as bluestone or [[Pennsylvania Bluestone]]. These are a group of sandstones defined as [[feldspath]]ic [[greywacke]]. The sand-sized grains from which bluestone is constituted were deposited in the [[Catskill Delta]] during the Middle to Upper [[Devonian Period]] of the [[Paleozoic Era]], approximately 370 to 345 million years ago.  If the initial deposit was made under slow moving water the ripples of the water action on the sand or mud will be revealed.  This deposition process may be seen today at any ocean beach in shallow water or in a stream bed where conditions allow it to be observed.  The term "bluestone" is derived from a deep-blue-colored sandstone first found in [[Ulster County, New York]].

The Catskill Delta was created from run off from the [[Acadian Mountains]] ("Ancestral Appalachians") which covered the area where New York City now exists.  This Delta ran in a narrow band from southwest to northeast and today provides the base material for the high-quality bluestone which is quarried from the [[Catskill Mountains]] and [[Northeast Pennsylvania]].

As the product became more popular as an architectural and building stone and demand grew, quarrying for it spread throughout south central New York and northeast Pennsylvania.  It is a unique commodity of particular value to the economy of [[Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]]. The [[Starrucca Viaduct]], finished in 1848, is often referred to as an example of the strength and durability of Pennsylvania Bluestone as a building material.

Bluestone from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] is regionally known as bluestone but a less ambiguous name is [[Micrite|Shenandoah Valley Bluestone]]. The limestone formed during the [[Ordovician]] Period approximately 450 to 500 million years ago, but it was formed at the bottom of a relatively shallow ocean that then covered what is today [[Rockingham County, Virginia]].  However, the limestone that accumulated in Rockingham County was darker in color than most other limestone deposits because it was in deeper waters exposed to less light.  The darker blue color resulted in limestone from this region to be dubbed bluestone and with two sequences measuring about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft, it gives the area one of the largest limestone deposits in the world. The stone eventually fades from a deep blue to a light grey after prolonged exposure to the sun and rain.

Given the abundance of the stone in the Rockingham County area, the first settlers used it as foundations and chimneys for their houses.  When [[James Madison University]] was built, the native bluestone was used to construct the buildings because of its high quality and cultural ties. The [[Frazier Quarry]] in Harrisonburg, Virginia Continues to supply JMU with the native bluestone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1360">A body contact or body fault is a conductive connection between body and active parts of electrical equipment resulting from a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition für Körper gemäß {{IEV|195-06-10}}: leitfähiges Teil eines elektrischen Betriebsmittels, das berührt werden kann und üblicherweise nicht unter Spannung steht, aber unter Spannung geraten kann, wenn die Basisisolierung versagt.&lt;/ref&gt;

A body, short or ground fault is:

;Perfect (direct) contact
If there is no fault resistance in the circuit
;Imperfect (indirect) contact
If a fault resistance is present in the circuit (e.g. wet branch, arc)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Gerhard Kiefer, Herbert Schmolke|Title=VDE 0100 und die Praxis, Wegweiser für Anfänger und Profis|Edition=14.|Publisher=VDE Verlag GmbH|PublicationPlace=Berlin und Offenbach|Year=2011|At=p.&amp;nbsp;103|ISBN=978-3-8007-3190-9|Date=   2011|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be caused by installation errors or defects, such as cable breaks.

There is a risk of electric shock when touching the parts of the system under voltage by the body joint. As a countermeasure, so-called protective conductors and [[residual current]] [[circuit breaker]]s are used in [[electrical engineering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">A '''carbon emission label''' or '''carbon label''' describes the [[carbon dioxide]] emissions created as a by-product of manufacturing, transporting, or disposing of a [[consumer product]].  This information is important to consumers wishing to minimize their [[ecological footprint]] and contribution to [[global warming]] made by their purchases.

==Existing programs==
The world's first carbon label, the Carbon Reduction Label, shows the [[carbon footprint]] embodied in a product and was first introduced in the [[UK]] in 2006 by the [[Carbon Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/footprinting/product-carbon-footprinting-the-new-business-opportunity|title=Product carbon footprinting: the new business opportunity| publisher =Carbon Trust|accessdate=12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of products featuring their carbon footprint are [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]] Crisps, Kingsmill bread, British Sugar, Cemex cement, Marshalls paving and Quaker Oats, which have all used the label. One of the biggest supporters of carbon labelling is [[Tesco]], who have labelled a range of products including washing detergent, light bulbs, oranges, milk and toilet paper.  [[HBOS]] feature it on their online bank account.

The Carbon Trust label also requires companies to commit to reduce the embodied carbon in the labeled product or they lose the right to feature the label. An independent panel is currently verifying the process alongside [[Defra]] and the British Standards Institute [[British Standards Institution|BSI]] and a new standard [[PAS 2050]] is due to be introduced in mid-2008. As of August 2009, Defra is undertaking a radical rethink of the food industry on issues of security and sustainability, among many things proposing a green labelling scheme for food products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/defra-proposes-green-food-labelling-scheme/3003268.article Marketing Week - Defra proposes green food labelling scheme.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CarbonCounted label started in January 2007.  It uses a live carbon supply chain to determine the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to bring a product to market.  This third party certified system, based on an open standard, eliminates the need for heavy auditing and guess work associated with values determined when using isolated accounting methods.  This also addresses how to consistently and fairly apply the smaller details such as the heating, cooling, lighting etc. in the shops the products are sold in.

Another label initiative started in spring 2008 in [[Switzerland]]. The independent association climatop labels the most climate friendly products with their label «approved by climatop». In contrast to the label of Carbon Trust, this label does not indicate the carbon footprint of a specific product, it labels those products out of a comparable group of products with a remarkably lower carbon charge. As a rule of thumb, products have to be at least 20% better as other products from the same category. Therefore [[life cycle assessment]]s or the products are calculated by independent offices, and the calculations are reviewed by a third party. Beside the fact that it has to be proven that those products have a lower climate charge, the products also have to fulfil several environmental and social standards.  Examples of labeled products can be found at the Swiss retailer [[Migros]], such as an organic fair trade sugar from [[Paraguay]], [[recycling]] kitchen towels or laundry detergents. This approach has been shown to influence customer purchasing decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10603-010-9140-7 | volume=34 | title=Customer Response to Carbon Labelling of Groceries | journal=Journal of Consumer Policy | pages=153–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] announced carbon footprint labelling scheme in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/20/carbonfootprints.carbonemissions Guardian - Japan to launch carbon footprint labelling scheme.]&lt;/ref&gt; The labels appeared on dozens of items including food and drink starting in April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/07/02/australia-joins-carbon-reduction-label-scheme/&lt;/ref&gt; providing detailed breakdowns of each product's carbon footprint under a government-approved calculation and labeling system.

==Proposed programs==
{{update|date=November 2010}}
California state representative Ira Ruskin sponsored a carbon labeling bill—the Carbon Labeling Act of 2009—in the California state legislature, which has been voted out of the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources. The act would require the State Air Resources Board to develop and implement a program for the voluntary assessment, verification, and standardized labeling of the
carbon footprint of consumer products sold in the state.

In July 2009, [[Walmart]] announced an environmental labeling program for its products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/business/energy-environment/16walmart.html NYTimes - At Wal-Mart, Labels to Reflect Green Intent.]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to create over the next five years a universal rating system, that scores products based on how environmentally and socially sustainable they are over the course of their lives. Wal-Mart’s goal is to have other retailers eventually adopt the indexing system.

In the United States, the Clean Energy Standard (CES) mandates that electric utilities generate a certain percentage of their power from clean energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Caperton, R. W., Gordon, K., Hendricks, B., &amp; Weiss, D. J. (n.d.). A Clean
     Energy Standard Is an Essential First Step Toward a Clean Energy Future&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11901">'''Coronal seismology''' is a technique of studying the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the Sun's [[corona]] with the use of [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) [[wave]]s and [[oscillation]]s. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s - in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for standing waves, but was not practically applied until the late 90s due to a lack of necessary observational resolution.
Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's [[seismology]], [[helioseismology]], and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kind are used to probe a medium. 

The theoretical foundation of coronal seismology is the [[dispersion relation]] of MHD modes of a plasma cylinder: a plasma structure which is nonuniform in the transverse direction and extended along the magnetic field. This model works well for the description of a number of plasma structures observed in the solar corona: e.g. [[coronal loops]], prominence fibrils, plumes, various filaments. Such a structure acts as a [[waveguide]] of MHD waves.

This discussion is adapted from Nakariakov &amp; Verwichte (2009).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of magnetohydrodynamic waves==
There are several distinct kinds of MHD modes which have quite different [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersive]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]], and [[Wave propagation|propagation]] properties:

* Kink (or [[transverse wave|transverse]]) modes, which are [[Oblique shock|oblique]] fast magnetoacoustic (also known as [[magnetosonic wave]]s) guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes the displacement of the axis of the plasma structure. These modes are weakly [[compressibility|compressible]], but could nevertheless be observed with imaging instruments as periodic standing or propagating displacements of coronal structures, e.g. [[coronal loop]]s. The frequency of transverse or "kink" modes is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{K}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_{z}B^{2}}{\mu(\rho_{i}+\rho_{e})}}&lt;/math&gt;

For kink modes the parameter the azimuthal wave number in a cylindrical model of a loop, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1, meaning that the cylinder is swaying with fixed ends.

* Sausage modes, which are also oblique fast magnetoacoustic waves guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes expansions and contractions of the plasma structure, but does not displace its axis. These modes are compressible and cause significant variation of the absolute value of the magnetic field in the oscillating structure. The frequency of sausage modes is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{S}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\mu\rho_{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;

For sausage modes the parameter &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 0; this would be interpreted as a "breathing" in and out, again with fixed endpoints.

* Longitudinal (or slow, or [[Acoustics|acoustic]]) modes, which are slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating mainly along the magnetic field in the plasma structure; these mode are essentially compressible. The magnetic field [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]] in these modes is negligible. The frequency of slow modes is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{L}=\sqrt{k^{2}_{z}\left ( \frac{C_{s}^{2}C_{A}^{2}}{C_{s}^{2}+C_{A}^{2}} \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we define &lt;math&gt;C_{s}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[sound speed]] and &lt;math&gt;C_{A}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Alfvén wave#Alfvén velocity|Alfvén velocity]].

* Torsional ([[Alfvén wave|Alfvén]] or twist) modes are incompressible transverse perturbations of the magnetic field along certain individual magnetic surfaces. In contrast with kink modes, torsional modes cannot be observed with imaging instruments, as they do not cause the displacement of either the structure axis or its boundary.

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\mu\rho_{i}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Observations==
[[Image:Coronal_arcade.png|thumb|alt=coronal arcade after flare|TRACE image of a coronal arcade]]
Wave and oscillatory phenomena are observed in the hot plasma of the corona mainly in EUV, optical and microwave bands with a number of spaceborne and ground-based instruments, e.g. the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO), the [[Transition Region and Coronal Explorer]] (TRACE), the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH, see the [[Nobeyama radio observatory]]). Phenomenologically, researchers distinguish between compressible waves in polar plumes and in legs of large [[coronal loops]], flare-generated transverse oscillations of loops, acoustic oscillations of loops, propagating kink waves in loops and in structures above arcades (an '''arcade''' being a close collection of loops in a cylindrical structure, see image to right), sausage oscillations of flaring loops, and oscillations of prominences and fibrils (see [[solar prominence]]), and this list is continuously updated.

Coronal seismology is one of the aims of the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|Atmospheric Imaging Assembly]] (AIA) instrument on the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission.

A mission to send a spacecraft as close as 9 solar radii from the sun, [[Parker Solar Probe]], is planned for launch in 2015 and aims to provide in-situ measurements of the solar magnetic field, solar wind and corona. It should include a magnetometer and plasma wave sensor, allowing unprecedented observations for coronal seismology.

==Conclusions==
The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal [[magnetic field]], density [[scale height]], "fine structure" (by which is meant the variation in structure of an inhomogeneous structure such as an inhomogeneous coronal loop) and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups. Work relating to the coronal magnetic field was mentioned earlier.&lt;ref name="Nakariakov2001"/&gt;
It has been shown that sufficiently broadband slow magnetoacoustic waves, consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the spectrum, could provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat a [[coronal loop]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the density scale height, transverse oscillations of coronal loops that have both variable circular cross-sectional area and plasma density in the longitudinal direction have been studied theoretically. A second order ordinary differential equation has been derived describing the displacement of the loop axis. Together with boundary conditions, solving this equation determines the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. The coronal density scale height could then be estimated by using the observed ratio of the fundamental frequency and first overtone of loop kink oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of coronal fine structure. Doppler shift oscillations in hot active region loops obtained with the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation instrument (SUMER) aboard SOHO have been studied. The spectra were recorded along a 300 arcsec slit placed at a fixed position in the corona above the active regions. Some oscillations showed phase propagation along the slit in one or both directions with apparent speeds in the range of 8–102&amp;nbsp;km per second, together with distinctly different intensity and line width distributions along the slit. These features can be explained by the excitation of the oscillation at a footpoint of an inhomogeneous coronal loop, e.g. a loop with '''fine structure'''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Effusion.svg|thumb|250px|The image on the left shows effusion, where the image on the right shows [[Molecular diffusion|diffusion]]. Effusion occurs through an orifice smaller than the mean free path of the particles in motion, whereas diffusion occurs through an opening in which multiple particles can flow through simultaneously.]]

In physics and chemistry, '''effusion''' is the process in which a gas escapes from a container through a hole of diameter considerably smaller than the [[mean free path]] of the molecules.&lt;ref&gt;K.J. Laidler and J.H. Meiser, Physical Chemistry, Benjamin/Cummings 1982, p.18. {{ISBN|0-8053-5682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a hole is often described as a ''pinhole'' and the escape of the gas is due to the pressure difference between the container and the exterior. Under these conditions, essentially all molecules which arrive at the hole continue and pass through the hole, since collisions between molecules in the region of the hole are negligible. Conversely, when the diameter is larger than the [[mean free path]] of the gas, flow obeys the [[Sampson flow]] law.

In medical terminology, an '''effusion''' refers to accumulation of fluid in an anatomic space, usually without [[locule|loculation]]. Specific examples include [[Subdural hematoma|subdural]], [[otitis media with effusion|mastoid]], [[pericardial effusion|pericardial]] and [[pleural effusion]]s. 

==Measures of flow rate==
By the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the [[kinetic energy]] for a gas at a temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}m v_{\rm rms}^2 = \frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B} T &lt;/math&gt;

where '''&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;''' is the mass of one molecule, '''&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the [[root-mean-square speed]] of the molecules and '''&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. The average molecular speed '''{{angbr|''v''}}''' can be calculated from the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution#Typical speeds|Maxwell speed distribution]]
as 0.921 &lt;math&gt;v_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;v_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.085 {{angbr|''v''}}). The rate at which a gas of [[molar mass]] '''''M''''' effuses (typically expressed as the ''number'' of molecules passing through the hole per second) is then&lt;ref name=Atk&gt;[[Peter Atkins]] and Julio de Paula, ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.756 {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Rate = \frac{\Delta PAN_A}{\sqrt{2\pi MRT}}&lt;/math&gt;,

Here '''''ΔP''''' is the gas pressure difference across the barrier, '''''A''''' is the area of the hole, '''''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''' is [[Avogadro's number]], '''''R''''' is the [[gas constant]] and '''''T''''' is the [[absolute temperature]]. Assuming the pressure difference between the two sides of the barrier is much smaller than '''&lt;math&gt;P_{ave}&lt;/math&gt;''', the average absolute pressure in the system (''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta P\ll P_{ave}&lt;/math&gt;), it is possible to express effusion flow as a volumetric flow rate as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_E=\frac{\Delta P d^2}{4P_{ave}}\sqrt{\frac{\pi k_BT}{2m}}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;Q_E=\frac{\Delta P d^2}{4P_{ave}}\sqrt{\frac{\pi RT}{2M}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''&lt;math&gt;Q_E&lt;/math&gt;''' is the volumetric flow rate of the gas, '''&lt;math&gt;P_{ave}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the average pressure on either side of the orifice, and '''&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;''' is the hole diameter.

==Effect of molecular weight==
At constant pressure and temperature, the root-mean-square speed and therefore the effusion rate are inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. Gases with a lower molecular weight effuse more rapidly than gases with a higher molecular weight, so that the ''number'' of lighter molecules passing through the hole per unit time is greater.  This is why a balloon filled with low molecular weight [[helium]] (''M'' = 4) deflates faster than an equivalent balloon full of higher molecular weight [[oxygen]] (''M'' = 32). However the total ''mass'' of the escaping molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the molecular weight and is less for lighter molecules.

===[[Graham's law]]===
Scottish chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] (1805–1869) found experimentally that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zumdahl|first=Steven S.|title=Chemical Principles|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-547-19626-8|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, the ratio of the rates of effusion of two gases at the same temperature and pressure is given by the inverse ratio of the square roots of the masses of the gas particles.

: &lt;math&gt;{\mbox{Rate of effusion of gas}_1 \over \mbox{Rate of effusion of gas}_2}=\sqrt{M_2 \over M_1}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the molar masses of the gases. 
This equation is known as [[Graham's law|Graham's law of effusion]].

The effusion rate for a gas depends directly on the average velocity of its particles. Thus, the faster the gas particles are moving, the more likely they are to pass through the effusion orifice.

==Knudsen effusion cell==
The [[Knudsen cell|Knudsen effusion cell]] is used to measure the [[vapor pressure]]s of a solid with very low vapor pressure. Such a solid forms a vapor at low pressure by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The vapor slowly effuses through a pinhole, and the loss of mass is proportional to the vapor pressure and can be used to determine this pressure.&lt;ref name=Atk/&gt; The [[heat of sublimation]] can also be determined by measuring the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, using the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Drago, R.S. ''Physical Methods in Chemistry'' (W.B.Saunders 1977) p.563 {{ISBN|0-7216-3184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Element collecting''' is the [[hobby]] of collecting the [[chemical element]]s. Many element collectors simply enjoy finding peculiar uses of chemical elements. Others enjoy studying the properties of the elements, possibly engaging in [[amateur chemistry]], and some simply collect elements for no practical reason. Some element collectors [[invest]] in elements, while some amateur chemists have amassed a large collection of elements—[[Oliver Sacks]], for example.&lt;ref name="uncle_tungsten"&gt;{{cite book |title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |isbn=978-0-375-40448-1 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the hobby has gained popularity with media attention brought by element collectors like [[Theodore Gray]].

==Acquiring elements==
Some collectors attempt to collect very high purity samples of each element. Others prefer to find the element in everyday use. Some are averse to collecting the element as a compound or [[alloy]], while others find this acceptable. Collectors may isolate elements in their own homes. [[Hydrogen]], for example, can be easily isolated via the [[electrolysis]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gray  |first=Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Gray |title=The Wooden Periodic Table Table |website= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/ |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the element samples, some element collectors also collect items connected with the element, such as manufactured goods containing the element, rocks and minerals with the element as a constituent or compounds of the element.  Some manufacturers also sell coins made from pure elements, and density cubes made from the pure element can also be sourced on [[Online auction|auction sites]] such as [[eBay]].

Some commercial retailers now cater to the element collecting community, even selling large quantities in sets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Theodore |url=http://www.theodoregray.com/Periodictable/HowToGetOne.html |title=How to Get Your Own Element Collection |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; since purchasing elements from large chemical companies like [[Sigma-Aldrich]] is frequently prohibited or uneconomical for individuals. There are a number of specialist element providers which retail to the public over the web, sell individual element samples in addition to full and partial element sets. Many also sell elements through [[Online auction|auction sites]], such as [[eBay]]. Established specialist providers include [https://www.novaelements.com/ Nova Elements], [http://www.periodictable.co.uk/ RGB Elements], [http://www.smart-elements.com/ Smart Elements], [http://elementsales.com/ Metallium], [http://the-collectable-periodic-table2.mybigcommerce.com/ Collect the Periodic Table], [http://luciteria.com/ Luciteria] and [http://onyxmet.com/ Onyxmet].

Element collecting presents many challenges: some elements, such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], and [[arsenic]] are toxic and so are difficult to find or their sale is restricted. Others are extremely rare in commercial use, such as [[scandium]], [[lutetium]] and [[thulium]] and are therefore hard to source or are comparatively expensive. Some, such as [[caesium]] and [[fluorine]], are too reactive and have restrictions on their shipping; others, such as [[gallium]], react corrosively and very fast with [[aluminium]] (e.g., as structural material in [[aircraft]]).&lt;ref name="USPS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pe.usps.com/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub52/pub52.pdf |title=Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[radon]] and [[astatine]] are [[radioactive]] and have [[half-life]]s too short for practical collection in addition to their radioactive hazards. Usually only the stable elements from [[hydrogen]] to [[bismuth]] (except the radioactive [[technetium]] and [[promethium]]) are collected, with the exceptions of the extremely long-lived [[thorium]] and [[uranium]]. It is possible to source other [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements, such as [[radium]] (usually in the form of radium sulphate as part of [[Luminescence|luminescent]] paint on antique watch hands), [[tritium]] - a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], [[americium]] (in the form of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] buttons containing 0.29 micrograms of [[americium]] extracted from older [[smoke detector]]s), and [[technetium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">[[File:Displacement.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|One complete cycle of a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine. The volume displaced is marked in orange.]]
'''Engine displacement''' is the swept [[volume]] of all the [[piston]]s inside the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] of a [[reciprocating engine]] in a single movement from ''top [[Dead centre (engineering)|dead centre]]'' (TDC) to ''bottom dead centre'' (BDC). It is commonly specified in cubic centimetres (''cc'' or cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[litre]]s (l), or  cubic inches (CID). Engine displacement does not include the total volume of the [[combustion chamber]].

==Definition==
Engine displacement is determined from the [[bore (engine)|bore]] and [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] of an engine's [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]]. The bore is the [[diameter]] of the circular chambers cut into the [[cylinder block]].
:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{displacement} = {\pi\over 4} \times \mbox{bore}^2 \times \mbox{stroke} \times \mbox{number of cylinders}&lt;/math&gt;
Or in decimal form:
:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{displacement} = 0.7854... \times \mbox{bore}^2 \times \mbox{stroke} \times \mbox{number of cylinders}&lt;/math&gt;
Examples: The [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|427 Chevy]] bore is 4.312&amp;nbsp;in, and the stroke is 3.65&amp;nbsp;in, therefore the displacement for this eight-cylinder engine is:
:3.1416/4 × 4.312&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 3.65 × 8 = 426.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in
or: 
: 4.312&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 0.7854 × 3.65 × 8 = 426.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in
If the bore is 10&amp;nbsp;cm and the stroke is 5&amp;nbsp;cm with four cylinders, the calculation is:
:3.1416/4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 5 × 4 = 1,570&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.57&amp;nbsp;litres

==Governmental regulations==
{{main|Road tax}}
Taxation of automobiles is sometimes based on engine displacement, rather than power output, fuel economy, emissions, or vehicle weight. Displacement is a basic fundamental of engine design, whereas power output depends a great deal on other factors, particularly on how the car manufacturer has ''[[engine tuning|tuned]]'' the engine from new. This has encouraged the development of other methods to increase engine power, such as [[variable valve timing]] and [[turbocharger]]s.

There are four major regulatory constraints for automobiles: the European, British, Japanese, and American. The method used in some European countries, and which predates the EU, has a level of taxation for engines over 1.0 litre, and another at the level of about 1.6&amp;nbsp;litres. The British system of taxation depends upon vehicle emissions for cars registered after 1 March 2001, but for cars registered before this date, it depends on engine size. Cars under 1549&amp;nbsp;cc qualify for a cheaper rate of tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicleArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10012524&amp;chk=X2gG9G Direct.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173240/http://www.direct.gov.uk/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicleArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10012524&amp;chk=X2gG9G |date=16 June 2006 }}: The Cost of Vehicle Tax for Cars, Motorcycles, Light Goods Vehicles and Trade Licences.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese method is similar to the European taxation by classes of displacement, plus a vehicle weight tax.

The United States, Canada (except Québec&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/additional-registration-fee-large-cylinder-capacity-vehicles/|title=Additional Registration Fee for Large Cylinder Capacity Vehicles|last=SAAQ|website=SAAQ|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Australia, and New Zealand does not tax a vehicle based on the displacement of the engine. Engine displacement is important in determining whether or not smaller vehicles need to be registered with the state and whether or not a license is required to operate such a vehicle. A common threshold is 50&amp;nbsp;cc.

In the Netherlands [[road tax]] is based on region, weight, and fuel type ([[petrol]] / [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]], or other (electric/hybrid/H2))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belastingdienst.nl/reken/motorrijtuigenbelasting/|title=Hoeveel motorrijtuigenbelasting moet ik betalen?|first=|last=Belastingdienst|website=www.belastingdienst.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Sweden, road tax is based on vehicle weight. However, Swedish cars registered in 2008, or later, are taxed based on carbon dioxide emissions.{{Citation needed |date=December 2008}}

Displacement is also used to distinguish categories of (heavier) and lighter motorbikes with respect to driving licence and insurance requirements. In France and some other EU countries, [[moped]]s of less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; displacement (and usually with a [[two-stroke engine]]), can be driven with minimum qualifications (previously, they could be driven by any person over 14). This led to all light motorbikes having a displacement of about 49.9&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Some people tuned the engine by increasing the cylinder bore, increasing displacement; such mopeds cannot be driven legally on public roads since they no longer conform to the original specifications and may go faster than 45&amp;nbsp;km/h.

[[Wankel engine]]s, due to the amount of power and emissions they create for their displacement, are generally taxed as 1.5 times their stated physical displacement (1.3&amp;nbsp;litres becomes effectively 2.0, 2.0 becomes effectively 3.0), although actual power outputs are far greater (the 1.3-litre [[Mazda Wankel engine#13B|13B]] can produce power comparable to either a 3.0 [[V6 engine]] or a turbocharged 2.0 [[inline-4 engine]], and the 2.0-litre 20B can produce power comparable to a 3.5 to 3.8 V6 engine or a 4.0 [[V8 engine]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As such, racing regulations actually use a much higher conversion factor.

==Automotive model names==
In the automotive industry, engine displacement is frequently encoded in the auto manufacturer's model names.  For instance, Nissan's [[Nissan Teana|Teana 350JM]] is a car with a {{convert|3498|cc|cuin}} displacement [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|engine]]. Motorcycles are often labeled similarly.

However, this nomenclature can be misleading. For instance, the [[BMW 3 Series (F30)]] 320i, 328i and 330i all have a 2.0-litre engine; the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205)]] C 200, C 250, C 300 and C 350 Plug-In Hybrid all have a 2.0-litre engine; and the [[Bugatti Veyron]] 16.4 has an 8.0-litre (quad-turbocharged W16) engine.

Lexus [[hybrid vehicle]]s ("h") are marked higher than true engine size to signify the extra power from auxiliary systems. For example, the RX450h has a 3.5 L engine, and the LS600h has a 5.0 L engine.

'''FKM''' (by ASTM D1418 standard) (equivalent to '''FPM''' by ISO/DIN 1629 standard) is the designation for about 80% of [[fluoroelastomer]]s as defined in [[ASTM]] D1418. All FKMs contain [[Vinylidene group|vinylidene]] fluoride as a monomer. Originally developed by [[DuPont]] ([[Viton]]), FKMs are today also produced by [[Daikin]] Chemical ([https://www.daikinchemicals.com/solutions/products/dai-el-fluoroelastomers.html Dai-El]), [[3M]]'s Dyneon (Dyneon Fluoroelastomers), [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]] Specialty Polymers ([http://www.solvay.com/en/markets-and-products/featured-products/tecnoflon.html Tecnoflon]), HaloPolymer (Elaftor) and several Chinese manufacturers. Viton is now manufactured by [[Chemours]]. Fluoroelastomers are more expensive than [[neoprene]] or [[nitrile rubber]] elastomers. They provide additional heat and chemical resistance. FKMs can be divided into different classes on the basis of either their chemical composition, their fluorine content or their crosslinking mechanism.

==Types ==
On the basis of their chemical composition FKMs can be divided into the following types:
*Type 1 FKMs are composed of [[1,1-Difluoroethylene|vinylidene fluoride]] (VDF) and [[hexafluoropropylene]] (HFP). Copolymers are the standard type of FKMs showing a good overall performance. Their fluorine content typically ranges around 66 weight percent.
*Type 2 FKMs are composed of VDF, HFP, and [[tetrafluoroethylene]] (TFE). Terpolymers have a higher fluorine content compared to copolymers (typically between 68 and 69 weight percent fluorine), which results in better chemical and heat resistance. Compression set and low temperature flexibility may be affected negatively.
*Type 3 FKMs are composed of VDF, TFE, and perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE). The addition of PMVE provides better low temperature flexibility compared to copolymers and terpolymers. Typically the fluorine content of type 3 FKMs ranges from 62 to 68 weight percent.
*Type 4 FKMs are composed of [[propylene]], TFE, and VDF. While base resistance is increased in type 4 FKMs, their swelling properties especially in hydrocarbons are worsened. Typically they have a fluorine content of about 67 weight percent.
*Type 5 FKMs are composed of VDF, HFP, TFE, PMVE, and [[Ethylene]].  Type 5 FKM is known for base resistance and high temperature [[hydrogen sulfide]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swjagels.com/uploads/Base_Resistant_FKM_Technology_in_Oilfield_Seals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful overview of different types of FKM-compounds is listed [http://www.polycomp.nl/fkm-advantages here].

==Crosslinking mechanisms==
There are three established [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] mechanisms used in the curing process of FKMs.
*[[Diamine]] crosslinking using a blocked diamine. In the presence of basic media VDF is vulnerable to dehydrofluorination which enables the addition of the diamine to the polymer chain. Typically [[magnesium oxide]] is used to neutralize the resulting [[hydrofluoric acid]] and rearrange into [[magnesium fluoride]] and water. Although rarely used today, diamine curing provides superior rubber-to-metal [[adhesive|bonding]] properties as compared with other crosslinking mechanisms. The diamine's capability to be hydrated makes the diamine crosslink vulnerable in aqueous media.
*Ionic crosslinking (dihydroxy crosslinking) was the next step in curing FKMs. This is today the most common crosslinking chemistry used for FKMs.  It provides superior heat resistance, improved hydrolytic stability and better compression set than diamine curing. In contrast to diamine curing the ionic mechanism is not an addition mechanism but an aromatic [[nucleophilic substitution]]. Dihydroxy aromatic compounds are used as the crosslinking agent and quaternary [[phosphonium]] salts are typically used to accelerate the curing process.
*[[Peroxide]] crosslinking was originally developed for type 3 FKMs containing PMVE as diamine and bisphenolic crosslinking systems can lead to cleavage in a polymer backbone containing PMVE. While diamine and bisphenolic crosslinking are ionic reactions, peroxide crosslinking is a free radical mechanism. Though peroxide crosslinks are not as thermally stable as bisphenolic crosslinks, they normally are the system of choice in aqueous and nonaqueous [[electrolytes]].

'''Fernico''' describe a family of [[metal alloy]]s made primarily of [[iron]], [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]]. The family includes Kovar, FerNiCo I, FerNiCo II, and Dumet. The name is made up of the chemical symbols of its constituent three elements. "Dumet" is a [[portmanteau]] of "dual" and "metal," because it is a heterogeneous [[alloy]], usually fabricated in the form of a wire with an alloy core and a [[copper]] cladding. These alloys possess the properties of electrical conductivity, minimal oxidation and formation of porous surfaces at working temperatures of glass and thermal coefficients of expansion which match glass closely. These requirements allow the alloys to be used in glass seals, such that the seal does not crack, fracture or leak with changes in temperature.

Dumet is most commonly used in seals where lead-in wires pass through the glass bulb wall of standard household electric lamps (light bulbs) among other things.

The two Fernico alloys both consist of [[iron]] (Fe), [[nickel]] (Ni), and [[cobalt]] (Co). Fernico is used at high temperatures {{nowrap|(20 to 800°C)}} and is identical to [[Kovar]]. Fernico II is used at cryogenic temperatures in the {{nowrap|-80 .. -180°C}} range. Both are used to create electrically conductive paths through the walls of sealed [[borosilicate]] glass containers. Dumet is used for a similar purpose, but is tailored for seals through [[soda lime]] and [[lead alkali silicate]] glasses.

These alloys adhere to [[lead-tin solder|lead-tin]], tin, and [[silver solder]]s. Other metals, including copper, molybdenum, nickel, and steel can be spot-welded to the FerNiCo alloys forming low resistance electrical connections.

FerNiCo I has the same linear coefficient of expansion as certain types of borosilicate ("hard" glass), (c6.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;°K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, thus serving as an ideal material for the lead-out wires or other seal structures in [[light bulb]]s and [[thermionic valve]]s. Dumet is also used for this purpose, but for passing through softer soda-lime and lead-alkali glasses. This wire is often coated with a glass-like film of sodium [[metaborate]], ({{chem|NaBO|2}}), so the molten glass will "wet" and adhere to it. 25% by mass of the finished wire is copper.&lt;ref &gt;S.T. Henderson and A.M. Marsden, "Lamps and Lighting" 2nd Ed., Edward Arnold Press, {{ISBN|0 7131 3267 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cunife]] exhibits a similar property.

== Uses ==
There are very few uses of Fernico. Some of them are: 
* It is used to seal metals and glass.
* It is often used in the form of nanopowder

[[File:Segmented FGM plate with n layers.png|thumb|alt=Segmented FGM with n layers|Segmented functionally graded material]]

In [[materials science]] '''Functionally Graded Materials''' ('''FGMs''') may be characterized by the variation in composition and structure gradually over volume, resulting in corresponding changes in the properties of the material. The materials can be designed for specific function and applications. Various approaches based on the bulk (particulate processing), preform processing, layer processing and melt processing are used to fabricate the functionally graded materials.

==History==
The concept of FGM was first considered in Japan in 1984 during a space plane project. Where a combination of materials used would serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 k across a 10&amp;nbsp;mm section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1592 |title=Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) and Their Production Methods |publisher=Azom.com |date=2002-08-22 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years this concept has become more popular in Europe, particularly in Germany. A transregional collaborative research center (SFB Transregio) is funded since 2006 in order to exploit the potential of grading monomaterials, such as steel, aluminium and polypropylen, by using thermomechanically coupled manufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transregio-30.com |title=Home |publisher=Transregio-30.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
The basic structural units of FGMs are elements or material ingredients represented by ''maxel''. The term maxel was introduced in 2005 by Rajeev Dwivedi and [[Radovan Kovacevic]] at [[Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing]] (RCAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=R Dwivedi1 S Zekovic1 R Kovacevic1 |url=http://pib.sagepub.com/content/220/10/1647.abstract |title=Field feature detection and morphing-based process planning for fabrication of geometries and composition control for functionally graded materials |publisher=Pib.sagepub.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attributes of maxel include the location and volume fraction of individual material components.

A maxel is also used in the context of the [[additive manufacturing]] processes (such as [[stereolithography]], selective laser [[sintering]], fused deposition modeling, etc.) to describe a physical [[voxel]] (a portmanteau of the words 'volume' and 'element'), which defines the build resolution of either a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means.

==Applications==
There are many areas of application for FGM. The concept is to make a composite material by varying the microstructure from one material to another material with a specific gradient. This enables the material to have the best of both materials. If it is for thermal, or corrosive resistance or malleability and toughness both strengths of the material may be used to avoid corrosion, fatigue, fracture and stress corrosion cracking.

The transition between the two materials can usually be approximated by means of a power series.
The aircraft and aerospace industry and the computer circuit industry are very interested in the possibility of materials that can withstand very high thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT2000/images/5920arnold3.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally achieved by using a ceramic layer connected with a metallic layer.

The Air Vehicles Directorate has conducted a Quasi-static bending test results of functionally graded titanium/[[titanium boride]] test specimens which can be seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpafb.af.mil/shared/media/ggallery/hires/AFG-070601-004.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605103426/http://www.wpafb.af.mil/shared/media/ggallery/hires/AFG-070601-004.jpg |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The test correlated to the finite element analysis (FEA) using a quadrilateral mesh with each element having its own structural and thermal properties.

Advanced Materials and Processes Strategic Research Programme (AMPSRA) have done analysis on producing a thermal barrier coating using Zr02 and NiCoCrAlY. Their results have proved successful but no results of the analytical model are published.

The rendition of the term that relates to the additive fabrication processes has its origins at the RMRG (Rapid Manufacturing Research Group) at [[Loughborough University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The term forms a part of a descriptive [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of terms relating directly to various particulars relating to the additive [[Computer aided design|CAD]]-[[Computer aided manufacturing|CAM]] manufacturing processes, originally established as a part of the research conducted by architect Thomas Modeen into the application of the aforementioned 
techniques in the context of architecture.

Gradient of elastic modulus essentially changes the fracture toughness of adhesive contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Valentin L.|last2=Pohrt|first2=Roman|last3=Li|first3=Qiang|date=2017-09-01|title=Strength of adhesive contacts: Influence of contact geometry and material gradients|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=308–325|doi=10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|issn=2223-7690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling and simulation==
[[File:Fgr plate.png|thumb|350px| Functionally graded armor tile after ballistic testing (front and back)]]
Numerical methods have been developed for modelling the mechanical response of FGMs, with the finite element method being the most popular one. Initially, the variation of material properties was introduced by means of rows (or columns) of homogeneous elements, leading to a discontinuous step-type variation in the mechanical properties &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bao|first=G.|last2=Wang|first2=L.|date=1995|title=Multiple cracking in functionally graded ceramic/metal coatings|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002076839400267Z|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|language=en|pages=2853–2871|doi=10.1016/0020-7683(94)00267-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Later, Santare and Lambros &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santare|first=M.H.|last2=Lambros|first2=J.|date=2000|title=Use of graded finite elements to model the behaviour of nonhomogeneous materials|url=http://appliedmechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleID=1414141|journal=Journal of Applied Mechanics|language=en|pages=819-822|doi=10.1115/1.1328089}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed functionally graded finite elements, where the mechanical property variation takes place at the element level. Martínez-Pañeda and Gallego extended this approach to commercial finite element software &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez-Pañeda|first=E.|last2=Gallego|first2=R.|date=2015|title=Numerical analysis of quasi-static fracture in functionally graded materials|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10999-014-9265-y|journal=International Journal of Mechanics and Materials in Design|language=en|pages=405-424|doi=10.1007/s10999-014-9265-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Contact properties of FGH can be simulated using the Boundary Element Method (which can be applied both to non-adhesive and adhesive contacts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Qiang|last2=Popov|first2=Valentin L.|date=2017-08-09|title=Boundary element method for normal non-adhesive and adhesive contacts of power-law graded elastic materials|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00466-017-1461-9|journal=Computational Mechanics|language=en|pages=1–11|doi=10.1007/s00466-017-1461-9|issn=0178-7675|arxiv=1612.08395|bibcode=2018CompM..61..319L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2119">'''Gas separation''' can refer to any of a number of techniques used to separate [[gas|gases]], either to give multiple products or to purify a single product.

==Swing Adsorption Techniques==


===Pressure swing adsorption===
{{Main|Pressure swing adsorption}}
Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) pressurizes and depressurizes gas around an adsorbent media to selectively adsorb certain components of a gas, allowing others to be selectively discarded.

===Vacuum swing adsorption===
{{Main|Vacuum swing adsorption}}
Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) uses the same principle as PSA but swings between vacuum pressures and atmospheric pressure. The two techniques may be combined and are called "vacuum pressure swing adsorption" (VPSA) in this case.

===Temperature swing adsorption===
{{Main|Temperature swing adsorption}}
Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) uses a similar technique to other swing adsorption techniques but cycles temperature instead of pressure.

==Cryogenic distillation==
{{Main|Air separation}}
Cryogenic distillation is typically only used for very high volumes because of its nonlinear cost-scale relationship, which makes the process more economical at larger scales. Because of this it is typically only used for air separation.

==Membrane gas separation==
{{Main|Membrane gas separation}}
Membrane technologies are not as well developed as other gas separation techniques and as a result they are less widely used. Manufacturing challenges mean the units are better suited for small to mid scale operations.

The use partially permeable membranes which allow "fast" gases to pass through and be removed, while "slow" gases remain in the airstream and emerge without the original contaminants. Membrane technology is most often used for moisture removal, hydrogen removal and nitrogen enrichment.

'''Gebran Gerge Bassil''' ({{lang-ar|جبران جرجي باسيل}}; born 21 June 1970) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] politician, and as of 20 September 2015, the leader of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]]. 

==Early life==
Bassil was born in a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christian]] family. Bassil received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in civil engineering from [[American University of Beirut|the American University of Beirut]] in 1992 and 1993 respectively.&lt;ref name=ECspeakers/&gt;
He was a member of a number of associations: the [[Lebanese Red Cross]] and Rotary Club of Batroun, Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gebran Biography|url=http://www.gebranbassil.com/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Between the years of 1998 and 2005, Gebran Bassil was an activist for various positions in the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] in Lebanon. In 2005, he became a candidate in the general elections in the district of [[Batroun]]. He didn't succeed at getting elected. From 2005 to 2008, Bassil became the head of the Free Patriotic Movement. 

He served as the Minister of telecommunications in [[Lebanese government of July 2008|the Lebanese cabinet]] led by [[Fouad Siniora]] from May 2008 to June 2009, and then as the minister of energy in [[Lebanese government of November 2009|the cabinet]] headed by [[Saad Hariri]]&lt;ref name=ECspeakers&gt;{{cite web|title=Speakers|url=http://cemea.economistconferences.com/event/how-can-lebanon-reach-its-full-potential/speakers-0#.USdkv1pjZgs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201212/http://cemea.economistconferences.com/event/how-can-lebanon-reach-its-full-potential/speakers-0#.USdkv1pjZgs|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2013|publisher=Economist Conferences|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassil lost [[Lebanese General Elections 2009|the general elections]] held in 2009.&lt;ref name=gnews11nov&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon finally has a government Sulaiman's man seals the deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lebanon+finally+has+a+government+Sulaiman's+man+seals+the+deal.-a0211926500|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=Gulf News|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has been serving as the Minister of Energy and Water in the cabinet headed by [[Najib Mikati]] since June 2011, and assumed the role of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants as of February 2014. In the general election of 2018, Bassil was elected as an Member of Parliament (MP) for the Batroun-Koura-Zgharta-Bsharri electoral district.&lt;ref name=embassyofleb&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cabinet |url=http://www.lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/TheCabinet.html |publisher=Embassy of Lebanon |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414081913/http://www.lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/TheCabinet.html |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of government in 2011===
{{Main|Lebanese government of November 2009}}
On 12 January 2011, the government collapsed after Bassil announced that all ten opposition ministers had resigned following months of warnings by Hezbollah that it would not remain inactive should there be indictments against the group. The New York Times suggested the resignations came after the collapse of talks between Syria and Saudi Arabia to ease tensions in Lebanon.

===2017 Lebanon–Saudi Arabia dispute===
Lebanon's president Aoun and some Lebanese officials including Bassil believed that the abrupt resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri was made under coercion by Saudis and have claimed that the Saudis have kept him hostage.

This led Bassil to visit multiple European countries and meet with senior EU leaders to rally diplomatic support for Lebanon and it's stability. During his European tour, he met with High Representative/Vice-President of the [[European Union]] [[Federica Mogherini]] in Brussels&lt;ref&gt;https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/35598/high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-met-lebanese-foreign-minister-gebran_en&lt;/ref&gt;, Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2017/11/16/lebanese-fm-bassil-in-turkey-to-discuss-bilateral-ties-developments-in-the-region&lt;/ref&gt;, German FM [[Sigmar Gabriel]]&lt;ref&gt;http://nna-leb.gov.lb/en/show-news/85560/nna-leb.gov.lb/en&lt;/ref&gt;, Russian FM [[Sergei Lavrov]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-lebanon-bassil/lebanese-foreign-minister-some-forces-trying-to-oust-lebanon-leader-ifax-idUSKBN1DH1FQ&lt;/ref&gt; and French President [[Emmanuel Macron]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-lebanon-france/lebanons-hariri-must-return-home-from-saudi-to-prove-he-is-free-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1DE29I&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Personal life==
Bassil and his wife Chantal Michel Aoun have three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gebran Bassil's Profile, Biography &amp; Heritage |url=http://5.79.63.190/Profile/Profile.aspx?l=EN&amp;fid=565&amp;No=e44a7f65-26af-40e7-9f3b-7683e7941f7a&amp;nAID=13370&amp;PreveVal=3394%7CY4aF1Nc+P/XFp1iC+aGPyw6aoWJ2/HenIRD/98JFLiA=%7CUcL6yL3tHT1wJyGFITIheg==1 |publisher=Katagogi |accessdate=3 April 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father in law is the current Lebanese president (since 31 October 2016) and the former leader and the founder of the Free Patriotic Movement, [[Michel Aoun]].&lt;ref name=wleaks9&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Reform Prospects In Lebanon's New Government|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09BEIRUT1229|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Dispute with Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri===
In a meeting with [[Free Patriotic Movement|FPM]] supporters in [[Batroun]] district, Bassil accused Speaker of the Parliament [[Nabih Berri]] of seeking to derail a diaspora conference organized by the Foreign Ministry in [[Abidjan]] by forcing Shiite businessmen to boycott the gathering. Bassil accused Berri of threatening to have Shiite businessmen participating in the conference fired from their jobs and the bank funding the diaspora gathering closed.

Bassil’s comments were revealed in a leaked video which was broadcast by [[Al Jadeed]] local TV station. The video sparked an outcry on social media  with Finance Minister [[Ali Hassan Khalil]], Berri's top political aide, blasting Bassil for crossing a red line and describing him as a "political dwarf" with sectarian motives. The leaked video also triggered a wave of street protests by the Berri's supporters, who responded by blocking a number of [[Beirut]]’s major roads and vital arteries with burning tires.

Bassil’s “thug” remark was the tip of the iceberg of long-simmering tension between the FPM and the [[Amal Movement]] that started with a decree that sought to promote a number of Army officers who has served under Aoun in the late 1980s when he was Army commander.

===Comments on Israel===
Bassil was criticized by many Lebanese politicians after an interview in December 2017 with [[Al-Mayadeen]] in which he stated that Lebanon does not have an ideological problem with Israel. 

He also said in that interview that he was not against Israel "living in security".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-israel/lebanese-foreign-minister-denounced-over-israel-comments-idUSKBN1EM1EZ&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|The [[crystal]] structure of [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, a typical ionic compound. The purple spheres represent [[sodium]] [[cation]]s, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the green spheres represent [[chloride]] [[anion]]s, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
In [[chemistry]], an '''ionic compound''' is a [[chemical compound]] composed of [[ion]]s held together by [[electrostatic forces]] termed [[ionic bonding]]. The compound is neutral overall, but consists of positively charged ions called [[cation]]s and negatively charged ions called [[anion]]s. These can be [[simple ion]]s such as the [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[sodium chloride]], or [[Polyatomic ion|polyatomic]] species such as the [[ammonium]] ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and [[carbonate]] ({{chem|CO|3|2−}}) ions in [[ammonium carbonate]]. Individual ions within an ionic compound usually have multiple nearest neighbours, so are not considered to be part of molecules, but instead part of a continuous three-dimensional network, usually in a [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]].

Ionic compounds containing [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are classified as [[acid]]s, and those containing basic ions [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[oxide]] (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) are classified as bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and can be formed by [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|acid–base reactions]]. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by [[evaporation]] of their [[solvent]], [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[freezing]], a [[solid-state reaction route|solid-state reaction]], or the [[electron transfer]] reaction of [[Reactivity series|reactive]] metals with reactive non-metals, such as [[halogen]] gases.

Ionic compounds typically have high [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s, and are [[Hardness|hard]] and [[Brittleness|brittle]]. As solids they are almost always [[insulator (electricity)|electrically insulating]], but when [[melting|melted]] or [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] they become highly [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]], because the ions are mobilized.

== History of discovery ==
The word ''ion'' is the Greek {{lang|grc|ἰόν}}, ''ion'', "going", the present participle of {{lang|grc|ἰέναι}}, ''ienai'', "to go". This term was introduced by English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834 for the then-unknown species that ''goes'' from one [[electrode]] to the other through an aqueous medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/faraday_michael.shtml | title=Michael Faraday (1791–1867) | publisher=BBC | location=UK | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825051236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/faraday_michael.shtml | archivedate=2016-08-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion | title=Online etymology dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-07 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514084635/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion | archivedate=2011-05-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:X-ray spectrometer, 1912. (9660569929).jpg|thumb|X-ray spectrometer developed by Bragg]]

In 1913 the crystal structure of sodium chloride was determined by [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bragg|first1=W. H.|last2=Bragg|first2=W. L.|title=The Reflection of X-rays by Crystals|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1 July 1913|volume=88|issue=605|pages=428–438|doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0040|bibcode=1913RSPSA..88..428B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bragg|first1=W. H.|title=The Reflection of X-rays by Crystals. (II.)|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=22 September 1913|volume=89|issue=610|pages=246–248|doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0082|bibcode=1913RSPSA..89..246B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman/&gt; This revealed that there were six equidistant [[Coordination number|nearest-neighbours]] for each atom, demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead as a network with long-range [[Crystal structure|crystalline]] order.&lt;ref name=sherman/&gt; Many other inorganic compounds were also found to have similar structural features.&lt;ref name=sherman/&gt; These compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral [[atom]]s, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when [[X-ray reflectivity|X-ray reflection]] experiments (which detect the density of electrons), were performed.&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=Jack|title=Crystal Energies of Ionic Compounds and Thermochemical Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=August 1932|volume=11|issue=1|pages=93–170|doi=10.1021/cr60038a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=R. W.|last2=Brindley|first2=G. W.|title=A Quantitative Study of the Reflexion of X-Rays by Sylvine|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1 November 1928|volume=121|issue=787|pages=155–171|doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0188|bibcode=1928RSPSA.121..155J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal contributors to the development of a theoretical treatment of ionic crystal structures were [[Max Born]], [[Fritz Haber]], [[Alfred Landé]], [[Erwin Madelung]], [[Paul Peter Ewald]], and [[Kazimierz Fajans]].{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p = 505}} Born predicted crystal energies based on the assumption of ionic constituents, which showed good correspondence to [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] measurements, further supporting the assumption.&lt;ref name=sherman/&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Halite-57430.jpg|alt=White crystals form a mineral sample of halite, shown against a black background.|thumb|[[Halite]], the mineral form of [[sodium chloride]], forms when salty water evaporates leaving the ions behind.]]
Ionic compounds can be produced from their constituent ions by [[evaporation]], [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], or [[freezing]]. Reactive metals such as the [[alkali metal]]s can react directly with the highly [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] [[halogen]] gases to form an ionic product.{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p = 312}} They can also be synthesized as the product of a high temperature reaction between solids.{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=71}}

If the ionic compound is soluble in a solvent, it can be obtained as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this [[electrolyte]] [[solution]].{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=82}} As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, [[nucleation]] occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the [[evaporite]] minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wenk|first1=Hans-Rudolf|last2=Bulakh|first2=Andrei|title=Minerals: their constitution and origin|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-52958-7|page=351|edition=Reprinted with corrections.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5r5M5ebK7YC&amp;lpg=PA358&amp;pg=PA351|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203204320/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5r5M5ebK7YC&amp;lpg=PA358&amp;pg=PA351|archivedate=2017-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] and the solid compound nucleates.{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=82}}

Insoluble ionic compounds can be precipitated by mixing two solutions, one with the cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain [[counterion]]s of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, it is important to ensure they do not also precipitate.{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=133–140}} If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|acid–base reaction]] or a [[neutralization reaction]] to form water.{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=144–145}} Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as [[spectator ions]].{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=133–140}}

If the solvent is water in either the evaporation or precipitation method of formation, in many cases the ionic crystal formed also includes [[water of crystallization]], so the product is known as a [[hydrate]], and can have very different chemical properties.{{sfn|Brown|2009|page=417}}

Molten salts will solidify on cooling to below their [[freezing point]].{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=79}} This is sometimes used for the [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state synthesis]] of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together.{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|pages=79–81}} In other cases, the solid reactants do not need to be melted, but instead can react through a [[solid-state reaction route]]. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven.{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=71}} Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.{{sfn|Wold|Dwight|1993|page=71}}

In some reactions between highly reactive metals (usually from [[Alkali metal|Group 1]] or [[Alkaline earth metal|Group 2]]) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by [[electron transfer]],{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=312–313}} a process thermodynamically understood using the [[Born–Haber cycle]].{{sfn|Barrow|1988|p=161–162}}

==Bonding==
[[File:NaF.gif|300px|thumb|right|A schematic [[electron shell]] diagram of [[sodium]] and [[fluorine]] atoms undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]] to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally. The oppositely charged ions – typically a great many of them – are then attracted to each other to form a solid.]]
{{main article|Ionic bonding}}
Ions in ionic compounds are primarily held together by the [[electrostatic force]]s between the charge distribution of these bodies, and in particular the ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations.{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=6}} There is also a small additional attractive force from [[van der Waals interactions]] which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions.{{sfn|Kittel|2005|p=61}} When a pair of ions comes close enough for their [[valence shell|outer]] [[electron shell]]s (most simple ions have [[closed shell]]s) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs,{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=507}} due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].{{sfn|Ashcroft|Mermin|1977|p=379}} The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=507}}

If the [[electronic structure]] of the two interacting bodies is affected by the presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed.{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=65}} Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most [[electronegative]]/[[electropositive]] pairs such as those in [[caesium fluoride]] exhibit a small degree of [[covalent bond|covalency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannay|first1=N. Bruce|last2=Smyth|first2=Charles P.|title=The Dipole Moment of Hydrogen Fluoride and the Ionic Character of Bonds|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=February 1946|volume=68|issue=2|pages=171–173|doi=10.1021/ja01206a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|title=The modern theory of valency|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|date=1948|pages=1461–1467|doi=10.1039/JR9480001461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character.{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=65}} The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using [[Fajans' rules]], which use only charges and the sizes of each ion.

[[File:Mercury-telluride-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png|thumb|The unit cell of the [[zinc blende]] structure]]
Ions typically pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in an arrangement that minimizes the [[lattice energy]] (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy can be related to the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the [[Madelung constant]]{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=507}} that can be efficiently computed using an [[Ewald sum]].{{sfn|Kittel|2005|p=64}} When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the [[Born–Landé equation]],{{sfn|Pauling|1960|p=509}} the [[Born–Mayer equation]], or in the absence of structural information, the [[Kapustinskii equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch370/CH370_Lectures/Lecture%20Documents/Ch07_2_LatticeEnergy.pdf|title=Lattice Energy|first=Robert|last=Carter|work=CH370 Lecture Material|date=2016|accessdate=2016-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513161409/http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch370/CH370_Lectures/Lecture%20Documents/Ch07_2_LatticeEnergy.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using an even simpler approximation of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres, the arrangement of anions in these systems are often related to [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed]] arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral [[interstitial site|interstice]]s.{{sfn|Ashcroft|Mermin|1977|p=383}}{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=444–445}} Depending on the [[stoichiometry]] of the ionic compound, and the [[Coordination sphere|coordination]] (principally determined by the [[Cation-anion radius ratio|radius ratio]]) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed,&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Lesley E.

Some ionic liquids, particularly with mixtures of anions or cations, can be cooled rapidly enough that there is not enough time for crystal [[nucleation]] to occur, so an ionic [[glass]] is formed (with no long-range order).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Souquet|first1=J|title=Electrochemical properties of ionically conductive glasses|journal=Solid State Ionics|date=October 1981|volume=5|pages=77–82|doi=10.1016/0167-2738(81)90198-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within an ionic crystal, there will usually be some point defects, but to maintain electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Point defects in ternary ionic crystals|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0079678665900099|journal = Progress in Solid State Chemistry|pages = 265–303|volume = 2|doi = 10.1016/0079-6786(65)90009-9|first = Hermann|last = Schmalzried|year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frenkel defect]]s consist of a cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in the bulk of the crystal,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; [[Schottky defect]]s consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prakash|first1=Satya|title=Advanced inorganic chemistry|date=1945|publisher=S. Chand &amp; Company Ltd.|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-219-0263-2|page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cations have multiple possible [[oxidation state]]s, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a [[non-stoichiometric compound]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an [[F-center]], a free electron occupying an anion vacancy.{{sfn|Kittel|2005|page=376}} When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] concentration.

This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and [[solid state ionic conductivity]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the [[lattice parameter]]s, reducing the overall density of the crystal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different [[Crystal field theory|crystal-field symmetry]], especially in the case of different cations exchanging lattice sites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This results in a different [[Crystal-field splitting parameter|splitting]] of [[D-Orbitals|d-electron orbitals]], so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Properties==

===Acidity/basicity===
Ionic compounds containing [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are classified as [[acid]]s, and those containing [[electropositivity|electropositive]] cations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/oxides.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229143840/http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/oxides.html |archivedate=2015-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and basic anions ions [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[oxide]] (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) are classified as bases. Other ionic compounds are known as [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and can be formed by [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|acid–base reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitten |first=Kenneth W. |last2=Galley |first2= Kenneth D.|last3=Davis|first3=Raymond E.| title=General Chemistry|edition = 4th|year=1992 | publisher=Saunders | page=128| isbn=978-0-03-072373-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the compound is the result of a reaction between a [[strong acid]] and a [[weak base]], the result is an [[Acid salt|acidic salt]]. If it is the result of a reaction between a [[strong base]] and a [[weak acid]], the result is a [[basic salt]]. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the [[conjugate base]] ion and conjugate acid ion, such as [[ammonium acetate]].

Some ions are classed as [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]], being able to react with either an acid or a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=David|title=Amphoteric molecules, ions and salts|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=November 1955|volume=32|issue=11|pages=550|doi=10.1021/ed032p550|bibcode=1955JChEd..32..550D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of some compounds with ionic character, typically oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant covalent character), such as [[zinc oxide]], [[aluminium hydroxide]], [[aluminium oxide]] and [[lead(II) oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mark|last1=Weller|first2=Tina|last2=Overton|first3=Jonathan|last3=Rourke|first4=Fraser|last4=Armstrong|title=Inorganic chemistry|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-964182-6|pages=129–130|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melting and boiling points===
Electrostatic forces between particles are strongest when the charges are high, and the distance between the nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s and a low [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]].{{sfn|McQuarrie|Rock|1991|p = 503}} Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Influence of Relative Ionic Sizes on the Properties of Ionic Compounds|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 1928-04-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 1036–1045|volume = 50|issue = 4|doi = 10.1021/ja01391a014|first = Linus|last = Pauling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become [[molten salt]]s (although some ionic compounds such as [[aluminium chloride]] and [[iron(III) chloride]] show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tosi|first1=M. P.|editor1-last=Gaune-Escard|editor1-first=Marcelle|title=Molten Salts: From Fundamentals to Applications|date=2002|publisher=Springer Netherlands|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-010-0458-9|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ft9sCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203204320/https://books.google.com/books?id=ft9sCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C), and are termed [[ionic liquid]]s.{{sfn|Freemantle|2009|p=1}} Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky [[substituent]]s like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.{{sfn|Freemantle|2009|pages=3–4}}

Even when the local structure and bonding of an ionic solid is disrupted sufficiently to melt it, there are still strong long-range electrostatic forces of attraction holding the liquid together and preventing ions boiling to form a gas phase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Critical Temperature, Normal Boiling Point, and Vapor Pressure of Ionic Liquids|journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date = 2005-04-01|issn = 1520-6106|pages = 6040–6043|volume = 109|issue = 13|doi = 10.1021/jp050430h|pmid = 16851662|first = Luis P. N.|last = Rebelo|first2 = José N.|last2 = Canongia Lopes|first3 = José M. S. S.|last3 = Esperança|first4 = Eduardo|last4 = Filipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even room temperature ionic liquids have low vapour pressures, and require substantially higher temperatures to boil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Boiling points exhibit similar trends to melting points in terms of the size of ions and strength of other interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When vapourized, the ions are still not freed of one another. For example, in the vapour phase sodium chloride exists as diatomic "molecules".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porterfield|first1=William W.|title=Inorganic Chemistry a Unified Approach.|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0-323-13894-9|pages=63–67|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K24W4LMy5dIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inorganic%20chemistry&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203204320/https://books.google.com/books?id=K24W4LMy5dIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inorganic%20chemistry&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brittleness===
Most ionic compounds are very [[brittle]]. Once they reach the limit of their strength, they cannot deform [[malleability|malleably]], because the strict alignment of positive and negative ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes [[fracture]] via [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Johnston|first1=T. L.|last2=Stokes|first2=R. J.|last3=Li|first3=C.

R.|last2 = Tyson|first3 = A. H.|last3 = Cottrell|bibcode = 1967PMag...15..567K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compressibility===
The [[compressibility]] of an ionic compound is strongly determined by its structure, and in particular the [[coordination number]]. For example, halides with the caesium chloride structure (coordination number 8) are less compressible than those with the sodium chloride structure (coordination number 6), and less again than those with a coordination number of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillwell|first1=Charles W.|title=Crystal chemistry. V. The properties of binary compounds|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=January 1937|volume=14|issue=1|page=34|doi=10.1021/ed014p34|bibcode=1937JChEd..14...34S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solubility===
When ionic compounds [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]], the individual ions [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] and are [[solvation|solvated]] by the solvent and dispersed throughout the resulting solution.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pages=89–91}} Because the ions are released into solution when dissolved, and can conduct charge, soluble ionic compounds are the most common class of [[strong electrolyte]]s, and their solutions have a high [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|pages=91–92}}

The [[solubility]] is highest in [[polar solvent]]s (such as [[water]]) or [[ionic liquid]]s, but tends to be low in [[nonpolar solvent]]s (such as [[petrol]]/[[gasoline]]).{{sfn|Brown|2009|pages=413–415}} This is principally because the resulting [[Intermolecular force#Ion-dipole and ion-induced dipole forces|ion–dipole interactions]] are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the [[enthalpy change of solution|heat of solution]] is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are pulled out of the lattice and into the liquid. If the [[solvation]] energy exceeds the [[lattice energy]], the negative net [[enthalpy change of solution]] provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the [[Entropy of mixing|entropy change of solution]] is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p = 422}} There are some unusual ionic compounds such as [[cerium(III) sulfate]], where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p = 422}}

===Electrical conductivity===
Although ionic compounds contain charged atoms or clusters, these materials do not typically [[electrical conductivity|conduct electricity]] to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be [[Electrical mobility|mobile]] rather than stationary in a [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. This is achieved to some degree at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and [[solid state ionic conductivity]] is observed. When the ionic compounds are [[solution|dissolved in a liquid]] or are melted into a [[liquid]], they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical Conductivity of Ionic Compound|url=http://cikguwong.blogspot.com/2011/05/chemistry-form-4-chapter-5-electrical.html|accessdate=2 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521205809/http://cikguwong.blogspot.com/2011/05/chemistry-form-4-chapter-5-electrical.html|archivedate=21 May 2014|df=|date=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.{{sfn|Zumdahl|1989|p=341}}

In some unusual ionic compounds: [[fast ion conductor]]s, and ionic glasses,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; one or more of the ionic components has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Electronic and Ionic Materials|last = Gao|first = Wei|publisher = World Scientific|year = 1999|isbn = 978-981-02-3473-7|location = |page = 261|url = https://books.google.com/?id=fxH3N_7L0LwC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;f=false|last2 = Sammes|first2 = Nigel M|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203204320/https://books.google.com/books?id=fxH3N_7L0LwC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=MR0Sj2c4x9&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;f=false|archivedate = 2017-12-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These materials are used in all solid-state [[supercapacitor]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], and [[fuel cell]]s, and in various kinds of [[chemical sensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Anthony R.|title=Solid electrolytes and mixed ionic?electronic conductors: an applications overview|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|date=1991|volume=1|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1039/JM9910100157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boivin|first1=J.

{{see also|Color of chemicals}}

The [[colour of chemicals#salts|colour of an ionic compound]] is often different to the [[colour of chemicals#ions in aqueous solution|colour of an aqueous solution]] containing the constituent ions,{{Sfn|Pauling|1960|p=105}} or the [[hydrate]]d form of the same compound.{{sfn|Brown|2009|page=417}}

The anions in compounds with bonds with the most ionic character tend to be colourless (with an [[absorption band]] in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum).{{Sfn|Pauling|1960|p=107}} In compounds with less ionic character, their colour deepens through yellow, orange, red and black (as the absorption band shifts to longer wavelengths into the visible spectrum).{{Sfn|Pauling|1960|p=107}}

The absorption band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength when they are involved in more covalent interactions.{{Sfn|Pauling|1960|p=107}} This occurs during [[solvation|hydration]] of metal ions, so colourless [[anhydrous]] ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.{{Sfn|Pauling|1960|p=107}}

==Uses==
Ionic compounds have long had a wide variety of uses and applications. Many [[minerals]] are ionic.{{sfn|Wenk|Bulakh|2004|page=774}} Humans have processed [[common salt]] (sodium chloride) for over 8000 years, using it first as a food seasoning and preservative, and now also in manufacturing, agriculture, water conditioning, for de-icing roads, and many other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurlansky|first1=Mark|title=Salt: a world history|date=2003|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-928199-3|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ionic compounds are so widely used in society that they go by common names unrelated to their chemical identity. Examples of this include [[borax]], [[calomel]], [[milk of magnesia]], [[muriatic acid]], [[oil of vitriol]], [[saltpeter]], and [[slaked lime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lower|first1=Simon|title=Naming Chemical Substances|url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/intro/int-5.html|website=Chem&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; General Chemistry Virtual Textbook|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116000437/http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/intro/int-5.html|archivedate=16 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble ionic compounds like salt can easily be dissolved to provide [[electrolyte]] solutions. This is a simple way to control the concentration and [[ionic strength]]. The concentration of solutes affects many [[colligative properties]], including increasing the [[osmotic pressure]], and causing [[freezing-point depression]] and [[boiling-point elevation]].{{sfn|Atkins|de Paula|2006|pages=150–157}} Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution.{{sfn|Atkins|de Paula|2006|pages=761–770}} The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the [[electrical double layer]] around [[colloid]]al particles, and therefore the stability of [[emulsion]]s and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]].{{sfn|Atkins|de Paula|2006|pages=163–169}}

The chemical identity of the ions added is also important in many uses. For example, [[fluoride]] containing compounds are dissolved to supply fluoride ions for [[water fluoridation]].&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{vcite web |title=Water fluoridation: a manual for engineers and technicians |author=Reeves TG |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/Fluoridation/CDC-FluoridationManual-1986.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-01-18 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |year=1986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208052648/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/Fluoridation/CDC-FluoridationManual-1986.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid ionic compounds have long been used as paint pigments, and are resistant to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satake|first1=M|last2=Mido|first2=Y|title=Chemistry of Colour|date=1995|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-276-1|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FA4hOk5KJBgC&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203204320/https://books.google.com/books?id=FA4hOk5KJBgC&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;ots=4wpC5lAywl&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1801 [[pyrotechnician]]s have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks.{{sfn|Russell|2009|page=14}} Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited.{{sfn|Russell|2009|page=82}} These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pages=108–117}}{{sfn|Russell|2009|pages=129–133}}

In chemistry, ionic compounds are often used as precursors for high-temperature solid-state synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xu|first1=Ruren|first2=Wenqin|last2=Pang|first3=Qisheng|last3=Huo|title=Modern inorganic synthetic chemistry|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-53599-3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many metals are geologically most abundant as ionic compounds within [[ore]]s.{{sfn|Zumdahl|Zumdahl|2015|pages=822}} To obtain the [[Chemical element|elemental]] materials, these ores are processed by [[smelting]] or [[electrolysis]], in which [[redox reaction]]s occur (often with a reducing agent such as carbon) such that the metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.{{sfn|Zumdahl|Zumdahl|2015|pages=823}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Chiranjib Kumar|title=Chemical metallurgy principles and practice|date=2003|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-60525-5|pages=359–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
{{see also|IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry}}
According to the [[nomenclature]] recommended by [[IUPAC]], ionic compounds are named according to their composition, not their structure.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=68}} In the most simple case of a binary ionic compound with no possible ambiguity about the charges and thus the [[stoichiometry]], the common name is written using two words.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=70}} The name of the cation (the unmodified element name for monatomic cations) comes first, followed by the name of the anion.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=69}}&lt;ref name=Kotz&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kotz |first1= John C.|last2= Treichel|first2= Paul M|last3 = Weaver|first3 = Gabriela C.|title= Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity|edition=Sixth|date= 2006|publisher= Thomson Brooks/Cole|location= Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-534-99766-3 |oclc= |page= 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[magnesium chloride]], and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[sodium sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}, [[sulfate]], is an example of a [[polyatomic ion]]). To obtain the [[empirical formula]] from these names, the stoichiometry can be deduced from the charges on the ions, and the requirement of overall charge neutrality.

If there are multiple different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (''di-'', ''tri-'', ''tetra-'',&amp;nbsp;...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions,{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|pages=75–76}} and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=75}} For example, KMgCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[magnesium potassium trichloride]] to distinguish it from K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [[magnesium dipotassium tetrachloride]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbons|first1=Cyril S.|last2=Reinsborough|first2=Vincent C.|last3=Whitla|first3=W. Alexander|title=Crystal Structures of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] for [[potassium]] is K).{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=76}} When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (''bis-'', ''tris-'', ''tetrakis-'',&amp;nbsp;...) are used.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|pages=76–77}} For example, Ba(BrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate)]].{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=77}}

Compounds containing one or more elements which can exist in a variety of charge/[[oxidation state]]s will have a stoichiometry that depends on which oxidation states are present, to ensure overall neutrality. This can be indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements present, or the charge on the ions.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=77}} Because of the risk of ambiguity in allocating oxidation states, IUPAC prefers direct indication of the ionic charge numbers.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=77}} These are written as an [[arabic numerals|arabic]] integer followed by the sign (...&amp;nbsp;, 2−, 1−, 1+, 2+,&amp;nbsp;...) in parentheses directly after the name of the cation (without a space separating them).{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=77}} For example, FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[iron(2+) sulfate]] (with the 2+ charge on the [[Fe2+|Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions balancing the 2− charge on the sulfate ion), whereas Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[iron(3+) sulfate]] (because the two iron ions in each [[formula unit]] each have a charge of 3+, to balance the 2− on each of the three sulfate ions).{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|p=77}} [[Stock nomenclature]], still in common use, writes the [[oxidation number]] in [[Roman numerals]] (...&amp;nbsp;, −II, −I, 0, I, II,&amp;nbsp;...). So the examples given above would be named [[iron(II) sulfate]] and [[iron(III) sulfate]] respectively.{{sfn|IUPAC|2005|pp=77–78}} For simple ions the ionic charge and the oxidation number are identical, but for polyatomic ions they often differ. For example, the [[uranyl(2+)]] ion, {{chem|UO|2|2+}}, has uranium in an oxidation state of +6, so would be called a dioxouranium(VI) ion in Stock nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernelius|first1=W. Conard|title=Numbers in chemical names|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=November 1982|volume=59|issue=11|page=964|doi=10.1021/ed059p964|bibcode=1982JChEd..59..964F}}&lt;/ref&gt; An even older naming system for metal cations, also still widely used, appended the suffixes ''-ous'' and ''-ic'' to the [[Latin]] root of the name, to give special names for the low and high oxidation states.{{sfn|Brown|2009|page=38}} For example, this scheme uses "ferrous" and "ferric", for iron(II) and iron(III) respectively,{{sfn|Brown|2009|page=38}} so the examples given above were classically named [[ferrous sulfate]] and [[ferric sulfate]].

'''Lycopodium powder''' is a yellow-tan dust-like powder, consisting of the dry [[spore]]s of [[clubmoss]] plants, or various [[pteridophyte|fern relatives]].  When mixed with air, the spores are highly flammable and are used to create flashes or flames as theatrical special effects. 
  
==Composition==
The powder is consists of the dry [[spore]]s of [[clubmoss]] plants, or various [[pteridophyte|fern relatives]] principally in the genera ''[[Lycopodium]]'' and ''[[Diphasiastrum]]''. The preferred source species are [[Lycopodium clavatum|''Lycopodium clavatum'' (wolf's-foot clubmoss)]] and [[Diphasiastrum digitatum|''Diphasiastrum digitatum'' (common groundcedar)]], because these widespread and often locally abundant species are both prolific in their spore production and easy to collect.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Main uses==
Today, the principal use of the powder is to create flashes or flames that are large and impressive but relatively easy to manage safely in [[magic (illusion)|magic]] acts and for [[movie theatre|cinema]] and [[theater|theatrical]] [[special effects]]. Historically it was also used as a photographic [[flash powder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Photographic Times and American Photographer, vol.18|date=1888|publisher=Scovill Manufacturing Company|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zlJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=lycopodium+powder+photography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Y-hEj8T-S&amp;sig=40UovNr9vSgYOyUbU50pzjsnd7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrjJr8-YbXAhWMQSYKHZyeAWMQ6AEIcjAS#v=onepage&amp;q=lycopodium%20powder%20photography&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these uses rely on the same principal as a [[dust explosion]], as the spores have a large surface area per unit of volume, (a single spore's diameter is about 33 [[micrometre|micrometers (μm)]]),&lt;ref&gt;Z. Živcová, E. Gregorová, W. Pabst; Porous alumina ceramics produced with lycopodium spores as pore-forming agents; Journal of Materials Science (2007), v 42, i 20, p 8760-8764. {{doi|10.1007/s10853-007-1852-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a high [[fat]] content.

It is also used in [[fireworks]] and [[explosive]]s, [[fingerprint powder]]s, as a covering for [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s, and as an [[ice cream]] stabilizer.

==Other uses==
Lycopodium powder is also sometimes used as a [[lubricating]] dust on skin-contacting [[Natural rubber|latex (natural rubber)]] goods, such as [[condom]]s and [[medical gloves]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150224021804/http://www.niepce.com/pagus/pagus-other.html Commercial uses – Lycopodium Powder]. [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] experiments and demonstrations, lycopodium powder can be used to make [[sound wave]]s in air visible for observation and measurement, and to make a pattern of [[electrostatic charge]] visible. The powder is also highly [[hydrophobic]]; if the surface of a cup of water is coated with lycopodium powder, a finger or other object inserted straight into the cup will come out dusted with the powder but remain perfectly dry.

Because of the very small size of its particles, lycopodium powder can be used to demonstrate [[Brownian motion]].  A microscope slide, with or without a well, is prepared with a droplet of water, and a fine dusting of lycopodium powder is applied.  Then, a cover-glass can be placed over the water and spore sample in order to reduce convection in the water by evaporation.  Under several hundred diameters magnification, one will see in the microscope, when well focused upon individual lycopodium particles, that the spore particles "dance" randomly.  This is in response to asymmetric collisional forces applied to the macroscopic (but still quite small) powder particle by microscopic water molecules in random thermal motion.  The lycopodium particles appear to be "alive", but they are only inert particles being buffeted by forces which, again, because of the small size of the lycopodium particles, respond to the momentum applied to them, which does not quite average to zero in three dimensions.  Thus, the particles move.

As a then-common laboratory supply, lycopodium powder was often used by inventors developing experimental prototypes.  For example, [[Nicéphore Niépce]] used lycopodium powder in the fuel for the first internal combustion engine, the [[Pyréolophore]], about 1807,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and [[Chester Carlson]] used lycopodium powder in 1938 in his early experiments to demonstrate [[xerography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:DOAS Diagram.jpg|thumb|DOAS Diagram]]

'''Moisture Removal Efficiency''' ('''MRE''') is a measure of the [[Energy efficiency (physics)|energy efficiency]] of any [[dehumidification]] process. Moisture removal efficiency is the [[water vapor]] removed from air at a defined inlet air temperature and humidity, divided by the total energy consumed by the dehumidification equipment during the same time period, including all fan and pump energy needed to move air and fluids through the system.

Water vapor removal is expressed as pounds or [[kilogram]]s. Energy is usually expressed as [[kilowatt hour]]s. Inlet air temperature is expressed in either degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. Inlet air humidity may be expressed in several ways, most commonly as the humidity ratio of the inlet air; the weight of water vapor in the air, compared to the weight of the dry air that contains it. An example of the MRE of a dehumidification system could be: 4.4&amp;nbsp;lb/kWh @ 85&amp;nbsp;°F, 140 gr/lb. Using the SI system of units, that same MRE would be 2.0&amp;nbsp;kg/kWh @ 30&amp;nbsp;°C, 20.0 g/kg.

== History ==

The authority for this definition of moisture removal efficiency is ANSI/AHRI Standard 920, published by the [[Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute]] (AHRI).&lt;ref&gt;AHRI Standard 920 (2015) - Performance Rating of DX- Dedicated Outdoor Air System Units&lt;/ref&gt; AHRI is an association of equipment manufacturers. Standard 920 was developed by the group of manufacturing members of AHRI that is concerned with energy efficiency of packaged dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS equipment).&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer members of the AHRI Dehumidification Section that generated ANSI/AHRI Standard 920-2015 included: Carrier, Dectron, Desert Aire, Greenheck, Modine, Munters, Research Products, and Trane.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard provides an objective and quantitative basis for rating and comparing dehumidification performance and energy consumption of equipment that dehumidifies incoming ventilation and makeup air as part of a building’s [[mechanical system]]s.

Dehumidification of ventilation and makeup air consumes a great deal of energy worldwide. In all except desert and high-altitude climates, the annual dehumidification load for ventilation air exceeds the annual cooling load for ventilation air by a factor of 2 to 5.&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, Brundrett &amp; Kittler (2008) ASHRAE Humidity Control Design Guide, {{ISBN|1-883413-98-2}} ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of energy efficiency of dehumidification arises because of regulatory requirements in some nations that demand energy efficiency for buildings’ mechanical systems.

According to members of AHRI’s dehumidification product section, the reason for developing Standard 920 was to provide ASHRAE with a neutral and high-quality test method for dehumidification energy efficiency. The committee’s goal was to have ASHRAE include minimum dehumidification efficiency requirements in ASHRAE Standard 90.1.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 (2016)  Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt; That standard is often used as the basis of building energy codes in the US and Canada, and also used worldwide as the baseline for voluntary energy programs such as LEED Certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)

== Integrated seasonal moisture removal efficiency (ISMRE) ==

To provide a metric that allows estimation of annual rather than instantaneous dehumidification performance of ventilation dehumidification systems, AHRI Standard 920 further defines a test protocol for measuring a system’s “integrated seasonal moisture removal efficiency”. This metric is analogous to the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) that is used to compare cooling energy efficiency of competing equipment.

Like the SEER test methodology, AHRI Standard 920 requires that the dehumidification equipment be tested at several discrete combinations of inlet air temperature and humidity. In the 2015 edition of the standard, four such test conditions are defined. The moisture removal efficiency of the equipment is measured at each of these conditions, and then a proportionality factor is applied to each MRE. The results of those calculations are summed to arrive at the rated ISMRE of the equipment.

'''Monofluorophosphate''' is an anion with the formula PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a phosphate group with one oxygen atom substituted with a fluoride atom. The charge of the ion is −2. The ion resembles sulfate in size, shape and charge, and can thus form compounds with the same structure as sulfates. These include [[Tutton's salts]] and [[langbeinites]]. The most well-known compound of monofluorophosphate is [[sodium monofluorophosphate]], commonly used in toothpaste.

Related ions include [[difluorophosphate]] ({{chem|PO|2|F|2|−}}) and [[hexafluorophosphate]] ({{chem|PF|6|−}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=F. Albert|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Geoffrey|title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry: A Comprehensive Text|year=1966|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related neutral molecule is [[phosphenic fluoride]] PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F.

Organic derivatives can be highly toxic and include [[diisopropyl fluorophosphate]]. Some of the [[Novichok agent]]s are monofluorophosphate esters. Names are given to these by naming the groups attached as esters and then adding "fluorophosphonate" to the end of the name. Two organic groups can be attached. Other related nerve gas substances may not be esters, and instead have carbon-phosphorus or nitrogen-phosphorus bonds. The organic fluorophosphonates react with [[serine esterase]]s and [[serine protease]]s irreversibly.  This prevents these enzymes from functioning. Such an important enzyme is [[acetylcholinesterase]] as found in most animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baynes|first1=John W.|last2=Dominiczak|first2=Marek H.|title=Medical Biochemistry E-Book|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780702073007|page=72|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Bs9FDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the organic esters are detoxified in mammals by an enzym in the blood and liver called [[paraoxonase]] [[PON1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zech|first1=Ronald|last2=Chemnitius|first2=JörgM.|title=Paraoxonase (PON1) in Health and Disease|date=2002|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461353584|pages=137–163|language=English|chapter=PON1 in Different Species|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-1027-7_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willy Lange from Berlin discovered sodium monofluorophosphate in 1929. He fruitlessly tried to make monofluorophosphoric acid. However, he did discover the highly toxic organic esters. Following this discovery various nerve gases like [[sarin]] were developed.

Fluorophosphate glasses are low melting point kinds of glass which are mixtures of fluoride and phosphate metal compounds. For example, the composition 10% SnO, 40% SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 50% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; forms a glass melting about 139&amp;nbsp;°C. PbO and PbF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can lower the melting temperature, and increase water resistance.&lt;ref name="Shaw1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Cathy M.|author2=James E. Shelby|year=1988|title=Effect of Lead Compounds on the Properties of Stannous Fluorophosphate Glasses|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=71|issue=5|pages=C–252–C–253|issn=0002-7820|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1988.tb05071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These glasses can also be coloured by various other elements, and organic dyes.

==Production==

Hydrolysis of [[difluorophosphate]] with an alkali produces monofluorophosphate.

:{{chem|PO|2|F|2|−}} + 2 MOH → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Industrial production is by reaction of a [[fluoride]] with a [[metaphosphate]].

:MF + MPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F

[[Disodium hydrogen phosphate]] or [[tetrasodium pyrophosphate]] can react with hydrogen fluoride to form the sodium salt.

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;

Phosphoric acid reacts with metal fluorides dissolved in molten [[urea]] to yield monofluorphosphates.&lt;ref name="Schülke1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schülke|first=U.|author2=R.

==Properties==
Monofluorophosphates are stable at room temperature, but will decompose when heated. For example, at 450&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin (unit)|K]] silver monofluorophosphate gives off [[phosphoryl fluoride]] (POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a gas leaving behind silver phosphate (Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and silver pyrophosphate (Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Weil2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Matthias|author2=Michael Puchberger, Ekkehard Füglein, Enrique J.

A '''multihead weigher''' is a fast, accurate and reliable weighing machine, used in packing both food and non-food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==History==
The multihead weigher was invented and developed by [[Ishida (company)|Ishida]] in the 1970s and launched it into the [[food industry]] across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ferguson |last=Evans |title=The Rise of the Japanese Specialist Manufacturer: Leading Medium-Sized Enterprises |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0-EDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121 |date=30 September 2008 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-0-230-59495-1 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packaging-int.com/suppliers/ishida-europe-ltd.html |title=Ishida company profile |publisher=Packaging International |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishida.com/company/history.html |title=Ishida company history |publisher=[[Ishida (company)]] |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatandcontrol.com/productvideo.asp?pid=204&amp;vid=212&amp;autostart=1 |title=Ishida product description |publisher=Heat and Control, Inc. |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today this kind of machine, thanks to its high speed and accuracy, has widely spread in the [[packaging industry]] and is produced worldwide by a number of manufacturers. Some manufacturers offer complete packaging lines, integrating the multihead weigher  with other [[Packaging#Packaging machines|packaging machinery]] ranging from bagmakers (including [[Vertical form fill sealing machine|Vertical Form Fill and Seal bagmakers]]) to traysealers and inspection systems. The latter include checkweighers and X-ray inspection systems.

== How multihead weighing works ==
A ‘typical target’ weight per pack might be 100 [[gram]]s of a product. The product is fed&lt;ref&gt;Force Measurement Panel (2010). ''A Guide to Dynamic Weighing for Industry.'' London: The Institute of Measurement and Control. 22-28. (Downloadable free from www.npl.co.uk/instmc-wfmp)&lt;/ref&gt; to the top of the multihead weigher where it is dispersed to the pool hoppers. Each pool hopper drops the product into a weigh hopper beneath it as soon as the weigh hopper becomes empty.

The weigher’s computer determines the weight of product in each individual weigh hopper and identifies which combination contains the weight closest to the target weight of 100g.  The multihead weigher opens all the hoppers of this combination and the product falls, via a discharge chute, into a bagmaker or, alternatively, into a distribution system which places the product, for example, into trays.

Dispersion is normally by gravity, vibration or centrifugal force, while feeding can be driven by vibration, gravity, belts, or screw systems.

An extra layer of hoppers (‘booster hoppers’) can be added to store product which has been weighed in the weigh hoppers but not used in a weighment, thus increasing the number of suitable combinations available to the computer and so increasing speed and accuracy.

== How multihead weighing can help a business ==
Multihead weighing can help in the following ways:

'''Filling bags'''

The range of bags which can be filled using multihead weighers is immense. At one end of the scale are large catering packs of many kilogrammes. At the other are small bags of crisps which can be handled at high speed and efficiency.

'''Mix-weighing'''

Products containing up to eight components can be mixed on a multihead weigher, very accurately at high speeds. The weigher is divided into sections, each with its own infeed. For example, a breakfast cereal containing hazelnuts and dried fruit plus two relatively cheap ingredients, could be weighed on a multihead with say eight heads devoted to each of the more expensive components and four heads to each of the other two. This would ensure high weighing speed while ensuring that overfilling of the expensive ingredients was negligible.

'''Placing into trays'''

A well-engineered distribution system enables you to combine the speed and accuracy of multihead weighing with precise, splash-free delivery of product into trays.

== Applications ==

Multihead weighers were used initially for weighing certain vegetables. Their use expanded exponentially in the 1970s and 1980s when they were applied to the rapid  weighing of snacks and confectionery into bags.
What cherry tomatoes and crisps had in common was that they flowed easily through the machine and into the pack, with no more encouragement than gravity and a moderate level of vibration of the feeders.
Since then, the accuracy and relative speed have been extended to many products which would in the early days of the technology have been seen as difficult to handle.

'''Sticky products'''

Fresh meat and fish, whether in a sauce or not, poultry and cheese (including grated cheese) can be moved along by using belts or screw feeders rather than vibration.

'''Granules and powders'''

While free-flowing, fine-grained powders can be weighed more cheaply by other means (such as cut-gate or linear weighers, or volumetric feeders), granules such as coffee granules and products such as loose tea can be weighed on today’s multiheads.

'''Fragile products'''

Weighers with more shallow angles of descent and various cushioned inserts have made it possible to pack delicate and brittle items such as hand-made chocolates and gourmet biscuits.

'''Complex products'''

Using mix-weighing combined with a distribution system tailored to deliver separate components into a tray, a ready meal can be assembled with just the right quantities of, say, rice, meat and vegetables in the appropriate compartments.

The '''National Lubricating Grease Institute''' is an international [[trade association]] that serves the [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] and [[gear]] [[lubricant]] industry. It exists to promote research and development of lubrication technology. It also publishes industry standards for greases.
[[File:National Lubricating Grease Institute logo.jpg|100px|right]]
== History ==

The '''NLGI''' was incorporated by a small number of U.S. companies in 1933 to create a code for the [[National Recovery Act]]. The original name of the organization was the ''National Association of Lubricating Grease Manufacturers, Inc''. The name was changed in 1937 as the industry recognized the need for a joint development and standards association and membership grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cowan |first1=Sandy |title=What is NLGI? |date=January 2007 |journal=Machinery Lubrication |publisher=Noria Corporation |url=http://www.machinerylubrication.com/Read/978/nlgi |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLGI is a not-for-profit corporation whose membership includes grease manufacturers and sales organizations, associated equipment manufacturers, industry suppliers, service organizations, research and educational groups. Membership is open to corporations and individuals.

According to information posted by the NLGI in 2004, the institute has member organizations in 26 countries, while subscriptions to its journal, the ''NLGI Spokesman'', represent 50 countries.

== Standards ==

In cooperation with [[ASTM International]] and [[SAE International]], the NLGI has developed the categorisation of lubricating greases specified in standard {{nowrap|ASTM D4950}} ''“standard classification and specification for automotive service greases”'', reproduced in standard {{nowrap|SAE J310}} ''“automotive lubricating greases”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fuels and lubricants handbook: technology, properties, performance, and testing (volume 1)

The NLGI has also created a symbol, the ''NLGI Certification Mark'', which can be used on containers of greases to advertise their {{nowrap|ASTM D4950}} category.

The measure of the consistency of a lubricating grease is commonly expressed by its [[NLGI consistency number]], defined by the NLGI in the ''“standard classification of lubricating grease”''. The NLGI consistency number is used in several standards: {{nowrap|ASTM D4950}}, {{nowrap|SAE J310}} and {{nowrap|[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6743-9}} ''“lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Significance of tests for petroleum products

The NLGI also administers a professional certification program. Individuals passing an examination designed to test their knowledge in the field of lubricating grease obtain the ''Certified Lubricating Grease Specialist'' (CLGS) certification.

'''Nervonic acid''' (24:1, n-9) is a [[fatty acid]].  It is a monounsaturated analog of [[lignoceric acid]] (24:0). It is also known as selacholeic acid and ''cis''-15-tetracosenoic acid.

It exists in nature as an elongation product of [[oleic acid]] (18:1 Δ9), its immediate precursor being [[erucic acid]]. Nervonic acid is particularly abundant in the white matter of animal brains and in peripheral nervous tissue where nervonyl sphingolipids are enriched in the myelin sheath of nerve fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.aocs.org/Membership/informArticleDetail.cfm?itemnumber=11122|title =American Oil Chemists' Society|date =|accessdate =|website =AOCS|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190021/http://www.aocs.org/Membership/informArticleDetail.cfm?itemnumber=11122|archivedate =2016-03-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, recent studies have concluded that nervonic acid is implicated as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of nerve cell [[myelin]].

This acid is an important member of the group of the [[cerebrosides]], which are fatty acids of the glycosphingolipids group, important components of the muscles and the central nervous system and peripheral. Indeed, it is one of the major fatty acids in brain sphingolipids, normally accounting for approximately 40% of the total fatty acids in sphingolipids.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.jlr.org/content/39/11/2161.full.pdf |pmid = 9799802|year = 1998|last1 = Sandhir|first1 = R.|title = Localization of nervonic acid beta-oxidation in human and rodent peroxisomes: Impaired oxidation in Zellweger syndrome and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy|journal = Journal of Lipid Research|volume = 39|issue = 11|pages = 2161–71|last2 = Khan|first2 = M.|last3 = Chahal|first3 = A.|last4 = Singh|first4 = I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
As it is defined as a [[monounsaturated]] fatty acid, it has one double bond in the fatty acid chain and all the remaining [[carbon]] atoms are single-bonded.

It is classified in the sub-group of very [[Long chain fatty acid|long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)]], which includes molecules containing more than 20 carbon atoms. It has specifically 24-carbon backbone and the sole C=C double bond originating from the methyl end is in n-9 or omega-9 (ω-9).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Functions ==
[[File:Key to Fats.svg|left|thumb|Nervonic acid position in the fatty acids classification.|267x267px]]Nervonic acid is an essential nutrient for the growth and maintenance of the [[brain]].

This acid has been found in breast-milk: it is said it can speed the development in infants. It is the reason why it is recommended to pregnant and nursing women.

This acid is a regulator of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion channel]] in the cell membrane of nerve tissues, so nervonic acid plays an important role in the control of the levels of calcium of the cytosol.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Nervonic acid can regulate the function of brain cell membranes and have a neuroprotective effect which is important to high-level training adults or athletes: it is an energy supplement.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Moreover, due to its function as an intermediate in myelin biosynthesis, dietary therapy with nervonic acid-containing fats has been studied: nervonic acid appears to be beneficial for the treatment of genetic disorders of the lipid metabolism, such as [[Zellweger syndrome]] or adrenoleukodistrophy. Nervonic acid beta-oxidation takes place in [[peroxisome]]s, and this oxidation is impaired in [[Adrenoleukodystrophy|X-ALD]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Localization of nervonic acid beta-oxidation in human and rodent peroxisomes: impaired oxidation in Zellweger syndrome and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy|journal = Journal of Lipid Research|date = 1998-11-01|issn = 0022-2275|pmid = 9799802|pages = 2161–2171|volume = 39|issue = 11|first = R.|last = Sandhir|first2 = M.|last2 = Khan|first3 = A.|last3 = Chahal|first4 = I.|last4 = Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to different mutations, people having these disorders have ineffective peroxisomes. It causes an important accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, that can be treated with oils enriched with 24:1 (Lorenzo's oil, Lunaria's oil).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kinkibio.com/news/NATIONAL%20RESEARCH%20COUNCIL.pdf|title = Production of Nervonic acid in Brassica carinata for Industrial and Health Applications|date = April 2014|accessdate = 15 October 2015 |website = Kinkibio|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It is also used as a biomarker to predict who will suffer some psychoses. For instance, there is evidence of abnormal levels of fatty acids in individuals with schizophrenia. In particular, decreased levels of 24:1 are related with prodromal psychosis symptoms so it can be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of this kind of disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com.sire.ub.edu/mp/journal/v17/n12/full/mp2011167a.html|title = Decreased nervonic acid levels in erythrocyte membranes predict psychosis in help-seeking ultra-high-risk individuals|last = Amminger|first = G P|date = 2012|journal = Nature|doi = |pmid = |access-date =|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nervonic acid can be an indicator of future neurodevelopmental disorders in male babies whose mother has preeclampsia. Recent studies show that cord nervonic acid levels were lower in women with preeclampsia delivering male babies as compared to normotensive control group. But this does not happen with girl babies. These results suggest that male babies born to mothers with preeclampsia may be at an increased risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders as compared to female babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differential levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in women with preeclampsia delivering male and female babies|journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Essential Fatty Acids|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1532-2823|pmid = 25172358|pages = 227–232|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.plefa.2014.07.002|first = Suchitra|last = Roy|first2 = Madhavi|last2 = Dhobale|first3 = Kamini|last3 = Dangat|first4 = Savita|last4 = Mehendale|first5 = Girija|last5 = Wagh|first6 = Sanjay|last6 = Lalwani|first7 = Sadhana|last7 = Joshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acid is present in the composition of aged eye lens, but it does not appear in normal eye lens. This data shows that we can use the presence of nervonic acid (together with [[heneicosylic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]]) as biomarkers of aging lens, which is the most vulnerable stage for cataract development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lipid biomarkers of lens aging|journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1559-0291|pmid = 23179275|pages = 192–200|volume = 169|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s12010-012-9963-6|first = Bimal Prasanna|last = Mohanty|first2 = Soma|last2 = Bhattacharjee|first3 = Prasenjit|last3 = Paria|first4 = Arabinda|last4 = Mahanty|first5 = Anil Prakash|last5 = Sharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nervonic acid occurs in [[seed oil]] of plants, where significant amounts are contained. Indeed, more than 10% of the lipids contain nervonic acid, usually in the form of [[triglyceride]]s. The seed oils of ''[[Lunaria]]'' species (''[[Lunaria biennis]]'' or ''[[Lunaria annua]]'', for example) are a quite important source of this long chain fatty acid, since they contain over 20% of it in the triglyceride lipid. Nervonic acid is also found in ''[[Cardamine gracea]]'', ''[[Heliophila longifola]]'', and ''[[Malania oleifera]]''. In all these species, 24:1 usually is esterified at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions on the glycerol backbone.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=lGhhHQAAG4oC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=nervonic#v=onepage&amp;q=nervonic&amp;f=false|title = New seeds oils improved human and animal health:genetic manipulation of the Brassicaceae for oils enriched in Nervonic acid|last = Taylor|first = David|date = 2009|journal = Modification of Seed Composition to Promote Health and Nutrition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |isbn = 9780891181699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources can be the [[mold]]s ''[[Neocallimastix frontalis]]'', the bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas atlantica]]'', the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', and the marine diatom ''[[Nitzschia cylindrus]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bbb.231| title = Brassica carinata - a new molecular farming platform for delivering bio-industrial oil feedstocks: Case studies of genetic modifications to improve very long-chain fatty acid and oil content in seeds| journal = Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 538| year = 2010| last1 = Taylor| first1 = David C.| last2 = Falk| first2 = Kevin C.| last3 = Palmer| first3 = C.

'''Oil &amp; Gas UK''' is the leading [[trade association]] for the [[United Kingdom]] offshore oil and gas industry.

==History==
Oil &amp; Gas UK is a not-for-profit organisation, established in April 2007 on the foundations of the '''UK Offshore Operators Association (UKOOA)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6549805.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; The association is the leading representative body for the UK offshore oil and gas industry that stretches back over 30 years. Its membership is open to all companies active in the area; these include businesses such as super majors to large contractor businesses and from independent oil companies to [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] working in the supply chain.

==Function==
Oil &amp; Gas UK is a trade association for the whole sector. It is a source of information for the UK Upstream and a gateway to industry networks and expertise.

They do this by:
*raising the profile of the UK offshore oil and gas industry
*promoting open dialogue within and across all sectors of the industry on topics including technical, fiscal, safety, environmental and skills issues, and brokering [[solution]]
*developing and delivering industry-wide initiatives and programmes engaging with governments and other external organisations with a stake in the industry’s future

==Location==
The association is situated in [[Portland House]] on the corner of ''Bressenden Place'' and ''Victoria Street'' in the [[City of Westminster]]. It also has an office on ''Market Street'' in Aberdeen near the train station, in the town where the UKOOA was based.

The '''Parque Arqueológico do Solstício''' (Solstice Archaeological Park), referred to in academic sources as AP-CA-18, is an archaeological park located in [[Amapá]] state, [[Brazil]], near the city of [[Calçoene]]. It contains a [[megalith]]ic [[stone circle]], colloquially known as the '''Amazon Stonehenge''', consisting of 127 blocks of granite, each up to 4 meters tall, standing upright in a circle measuring over 30 meters in diameter at the bank of the Rego Grande river on a hilltop. Archaeologists believe that this site was built by indigenous peoples for astronomical, ceremonial, or burial purposes, and likely a combination. The function of this megalithic site is unknown, much like other sites such as [[Stonehenge]], a much older site in Great Britain.

==Discovery==
The first reports of the Rego Grande site are from naturalist [[Emilio Goeldi]] in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}} Locals have called the site "Tropical Stonehenge" for some time. In 2005, archaeologists began excavation of the site after it was reported by a geologist during a socioeconomic study.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

==Findings==
Though the stones have not been submitted to dating techniques, [[carbon-dating]] of pottery sherds has placed the site at 500 – 2000 years old.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}} The origin of these granite blocks has yet to be studied as well. In certain Megalithic sites, such as Stonehenge in [[Wiltshire, England]], the blocks were moved to the site from some distance away. Archaeologists are not yet sure whether the Rego Grande site were also brought from elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

On the [[winter solstice]] of December 21, the [[shortest day]] of the year in the northern hemisphere, the shadow of one of the blocks disappears when the sun is directly above it.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; The rock seems to be placed at angle so that the shadow is possibly small throughout the day.&lt;ref name="wonderm"&gt;{{cite web

They believe the site was made by a sophisticated indigenous culture.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; One of the stones has a circular hole carved into it. During the winter solstice, the sun shines directly though this hole onto another rock for an extended amount of time,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} supporting the idea that Amazon Stonehenge was used as an astronomical site.

Apart from the circular hole the granite stones that make up Amazon Stonehenge appear irregularly shaped.  Whether this irregularity reflects primitive mining technology or holds clues regarding potential uses of the site has not yet been determined.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/americas/brazil-amazon-megaliths-stonehenge.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

During the excavations two large pits have been found, both approximately 1.5 – 2 meters deep and covered by large stone slabs. During excavation, shards of pottery, red clay, and ash from human remains were found. Three intact urns were found in a triangular formation at the bottom of one pit and more intact urns, as well as a few lids were found in the second. Remnants of cremated human remains have been found with these shards and in the urns, suggesting that these pits were either burial sites or that select human remains were buried here because they were significant. Shards of bowls and other pieces of pottery have been found in smaller pits near by. These bowls, lids, and urns have been found created in the shapes of animals and human-like figurines.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mongabay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news

==Significance ==
Evidence has been found near the Rego Grande site and all over the Amazon to suggest that the indigenous people of the region lived in a complex societies that involved both agriculture and a close relationship with the natural environment around them.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

There are also several other megalithic sites in Brazil that follow the curves of the Rego Grande river. The fact that these Megalithic sites seem to follow such a pattern suggests that Amazon Stonehenge may have been used as either a ceremonial site and that its structure and cultural significance were shared amount different indigenous communities in pre-Columbian Brazil.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

Despite not knowing the exact use of the Rego Grande site, most scientist agree that it alludes to a pre-Columbian society that was much more complex than previously thought.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

A '''plastic bottle''' is a [[bottle]] constructed from high density [[plastic]]. Plastic bottles are typically used to store liquids such as [[water]], [[soft drinks]], [[motor oil]], [[cooking oil]], [[medicine]], [[shampoo]], [[milk]], and [[ink]].  The size ranges from very small sample bottles to large [[carboy]]s.  Some consumer blow molded containers have integral [[package handle|handles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== History==
Plastic bottles were first used commercially in 1947 but remained relatively expensive until the early 1950s when high-density [[polyethylene]] was introduced.&lt;ref name="The History of soft drink Timeline"&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of soft drink Timeline|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa091699.htm|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly became popular with both manufacturers and customers due to their lightweight nature and relatively low production and transportation costs compared with [[glass bottle]]s.&lt;ref name="plasticvsglass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2014/04/plastic-vs-glass-why-plastic-containers.html|title=Plastic vs. Glass - Why Plastic Containers Are Better|publisher=Packaging of the World|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlepi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.seattlepi.com/advantages-plastic-bottles-4834.html|title=The Advantages of Plastic Bottles|publisher=Seattle Pi|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plasticpackagingfacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticpackagingfacts.org/plastic-packaging|title=Benefits of Plastic Packaging|publisher=Plastic Packaging|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the biggest advantage plastic bottles have over glass is their superior resistance to [[breakage]], in both production and transportation. Except for wine and beer, the [[food industry]] has almost completely replaced glass bottles with plastic bottles.

The materials used in the manufacture of plastic bottles vary by application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebottles.com/resins.htm|title=plastic bottle resin materials|website=www.ebottles.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic packaging manufacturers|url=https://www.3plastics.com/|website=3Plastics|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrochemical resins===
;[[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE)
:HDPE is the most widely used resin for plastic bottles. This material is economical, impact resistant, and provides a good moisture barrier. HDPE is compatible with a wide range of products including acids and caustics but is not compatible with [[solvents]]. It is supplied in FDA-approved food grade. HDPE is naturally translucent and flexible. The addition of color will make HDPE opaque, but not glossy. HDPE lends itself to silk screen decoration. While HDPE provides good protection at below freezing temperatures, it cannot be used with products filled above {{convert|190|°F|°C|abbr=on}} or products requiring a hermetic (vacuum) seal.
;Fluorine-treated HDPE
:These bottles are exposed to fluorine gas in a secondary operation, are similar in appearance to HDPE, and serve as a barrier to hydrocarbons and aromatic solvents. Fluorine-treated bottles may contain insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, photographic chemicals, agricultural chemicals, household and industrial cleaners, electronic chemicals, medical cleaners and solvents, citrus products, d-limonene, flavors, fragrances, essential oils, surfactants, polishes, additives, graffiti cleaning products, pre-emergents, stone and tile care products, waxes, paint thinner, gasoline, biodiesel, xylene, acetone, kerosene and more.
;[[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE)
:LDPE is similar in composition to HDPE. It is less rigid and generally less chemically resistant than HDPE, but is more translucent. LDPE is used primarily for squeeze applications. LDPE is significantly more expensive than HDPE.
;[[Polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET, PETE) / [[Polyester]]
:This resin is commonly used for carbonated beverages, water bottles, and food packaging. PET provides very good alcohol and essential oil barrier properties, generally good chemical resistance (although acetones and ketones will attack PET) and a high degree of impact resistance and tensile strength. The orienting process serves to improve gas and moisture barrier properties and impact strength. This material is not resistant at high temperature. Its maximum temperature is {{convert|200|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.
;[[Polycarbonate]] (PC)
:PC is a clear plastic used to make bottles for milk and water. Five-gallon water bottles are a common application of PC.
;[[Polypropylene]] (PP)
:PP is used primarily for jars and closures. It is rigid and is a barrier to moisture. Polypropylene is stable at temperatures up to {{convert|220|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. it is autoclavable and offers the potential for steam sterilization. The compatibility of PP with high filling temperatures is responsible for its use with hot fill products. PP has excellent chemical resistance, but provides poor impact resistance in cold temperatures.
;[[Polystyrene]] (PS)
:PS is transparent and rigid. It is commonly used with dry products, including vitamins, petroleum jellies, and spices. Styrene does not provide good barrier properties, and exhibits poor impact resistance.
;[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC)
:PVC is naturally clear. It has high resistance to oils, and has transmits very little oxygen. It provides a strong barrier to most gases, and its drop-impact resistance is also very good. This material is chemically resistant, but it is vulnerable to some solvents. PVC has poor resistance to high temperatures and will distort at {{convert|160|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, making it incompatible with hot-filled products. It has attained notoriety in recent years due to potential health risks.
;Post-consumer resin (PCR)
:PCR is a blend of reclaimed natural HDPE (primarily from milk and water containers) and virgin resin. The recycled material is cleaned, ground and recompounded into uniform pellets along with prime virgin material especially designed to build up environmental stress crack resistance. PCR has no odor but exhibits a slight yellow tint in its natural state. This tint can be hidden by the addition of color. PCR is easily processed and inexpensive. However, it cannot come into direct contact with food or pharmaceutical products. PCR can be produced in a variety of recycled content percentages up to 100%.
;K-Resin (SBC)
:SBC is a highly transparent, high-gloss, impact-resistance resin. K-Resin, a styrene derivative, is processed on polyethylene equipment. It is specifically incompatible with fats and unsaturated oils or solvents. This material is frequently used for display and point-of-purchase packaging.

===Other materials===
;[[Bioplastic]]
:A bioplastic is a polymer structure based on processed biological materials rather than [[petrochemical]]s. Bioplastics are commonly made from renewable sources like starch, vegetable oil, and less commonly, chicken feathers. The idea behind bioplastic is to create a plastic that has the ability to biodegrade.&lt;ref&gt;http://plasticisrubbish.com/2013/03/07/what-is-bioplastic-2/&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Bisphenol A]]''' (BPA):
:BPA is a synthetic compound that serves as a raw material in the manufacturing of such plastics as polycarbonates and [[epoxy resin]]s. It is commonly found in reusable drink containers, food storage containers, canned foods, and children's toys. BPA can seep into food or beverages from containers that are made with BPA.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Tips to reduce your exposure to BPA | website=Mayo Clinic | date=2016-03-11 | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331 | access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is ongoing concern as to the use of plastics in consumer [[food packaging]] solutions, [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of the disposal of these products, as well as concerns regarding [[consumer safety]]. Karin Michaels, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, suggests that toxins [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] from plastics might be related to disorders such as [[infertility]] and [[cancer]] in humans.&lt;ref name=thehindubusinessline&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic packaging is injurious to health|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/plastic-packaging-is-injurious-to-health/article7167252.ece|publisher=thehindubusiness.com|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, plastic water bottles are regulated by the [[FDA]] which also inspects and samples bottled water plants periodically. Plastic water bottle plants hold a low priority for inspection due to a continuously good safety record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneillnessContaminants/BuyStoreServeSafeFood/ucm077079.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the FDA maintained that there was a lack of human data showing plastics pose health problems, however in January 2010, the FDA reversed its opinion saying they now have concerns about [[health risk]]s.&lt;ref name=thehindubusinessline /&gt; An article published on November 6, 2017 in [[Water Research]] reported on the content of [[microplastics]] in mineral waters packed in plastic or glass bottles, or beverage cartons.&lt;ref name=schymanski&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schymanski | first=Darena | last2=Goldbeck | first2=Christophe | last3=Humpf | first3=Hans-Ulrich | last4=Fürst | first4=Peter | title=Analysis of microplastics in water by micro-Raman spectroscopy: Release of plastic particles from different packaging into mineral water | journal=Water Research | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=129 | year=2018 | issn=0043-1354 | doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.11.011 | pages=154–162 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, research conducted by Sherri Mason from the State University of New York in Fredonia revealed the presence of polypropylene, polystyrene, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate microparticles in plastic bottles. Polypropylene was hereby found to be the most common polymeric material (54%) and nylon the second most abundant (16%) polymeric material. The study also mentioned that polypropylene and polyethylene are polymers that are often used to make plastic [[bottle cap]]s.

A '''plastic igniter cord''' (PIC) is a type of fuse used to initiate an explosive device or charge. In appearance igniter cord is similar to [[safety fuse]] and when ignited, an intense flame spits perpendicular to the cord at a uniform rate as it burns along its length. Igniter cord in construction is again similar to safety fuse, consisting of a pyrotechnic composition at the core, wrapped with a nylon sheath to provide shape and finally wrapped again in an outer plastic shell to provide water resistance. Normally, igniter cord also consists of a metal wire at the very center of the pyrotechnic core which also runs the entire length of the cord; the pyrotechnic composition will react with the metal wire (typically aluminum, iron or copper) to increase the energetics of the fuse. There are two types of PICs: the fast type which has nominal burning speed of 30 cm per second, a diameter of about 3 mm, and is brownish in color; and the slow type, which has a diameter of 2 mm, is greenish in color, and has a nominal burning speed of 3 cm per second.

{{infobox promethium|image name=Promethium.gif}} 
'''Promethium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Pm''' and [[atomic number]] 61. All of its [[isotope]]s are [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]]; it is extremely rare, with only about 500-600 grams naturally occurring in Earth's crust at any given time, and one of only two such elements that are followed in the [[periodic table]] by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with [[technetium]]. Chemically, promethium is a [[lanthanide]]. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.

In 1902 [[Bohuslav Brauner]] suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements [[neodymium]] (60) and [[samarium]] (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by [[Henry Moseley]] who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found that atomic number 61 was missing. In 1926, two groups (one Italian and one American) claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both "discoveries" were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at [[Ohio State University]], a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not generally recognized. Promethium was first produced and characterized at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor. The discoverers proposed the name "prometheum" (the spelling was subsequently changed), derived from [[Prometheus]], the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans, to symbolize "both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind's intellect". However, a sample of the metal was made only in 1963.

There are two possible sources for natural promethium: rare [[Radioactive decay|decays]] of natural [[europium]]-151 (producing promethium-147), and [[uranium]] (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, which are used in [[luminous paint]], [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]] and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 ([[enriched uranium]]) with [[thermal neutron]]s to produce promethium-147 as a [[fission product]].

==Properties==

===Physical properties===
A promethium atom has 61 electrons, arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] &amp;#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&amp;#93;4f&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cotton"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=1233}}&lt;/ref&gt; In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one of the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the second largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; It is the most notable exception to the general trend of the contraction of lanthanide atoms with the increase of their atomic numbers. (see [[lanthanide contraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson5th|pages=776, 955}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, the first three ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium;&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less than those of neodymium.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt;

Promethium has a [[Close-packing of equal spheres|double hexagonal close packed]] (dhcp) structure and a hardness of 63&amp;nbsp;kg/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=str/&gt; This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta, [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] (bcc) phase upon heating to 890&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=CRCrare/&gt;

===Chemical properties and compounds===

Promethium belongs to the [[cerium group]] of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=120}} Because of its instability, chemical studies of promethium are incomplete. Even though a few compounds have been synthesized, they are not fully studied; in general, they tend to be pink or red in color.{{sfn|Emsley|2011|p=429}}&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/478714/promethium promethium]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of acidic solutions containing Pm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with [[ammonia]] results in a gelatinous light-brown sediment of hydroxide, Pm(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is insoluble in water.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=121}} When dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a water-soluble yellow salt, PmCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is produced;{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=121}} similarly, when dissolved in nitric acid, a nitrate results, Pm(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The latter is also well-soluble; when dried, it forms pink crystals, similar to Nd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=121}} The electron configuration for Pm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is [Xe] 4f&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and the color of the ion is pink. The ground state term symbol is &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry of the f-block elements| author=Aspinall, H. C.|year= 2001| page=34, Table 2.1|publisher=Gordon &amp; Breach|isbn=978-9056993337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sulfate is slightly soluble, like the other cerium group sulfates. Cell parameters have been calculated for its octahydrate; they lead to conclusion that the density of Pm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·8&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 2.86&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=122}} The oxalate, Pm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·10&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=123}}

Unlike the nitrate, the [[promethium oxide|oxide]] is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=121}} This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Further annealing at 800&amp;nbsp;°C and then at 1750&amp;nbsp;°C irreversibly transforms it to a [[monoclinic]] and [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.&lt;ref name=PmO/&gt;

Promethium forms only one stable oxidation state, +3, in the form of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the [[periodic table]], the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating chemical compounds containing Pm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=120}}

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of promethium}}
Promethium is the only [[lanthanide]] and one of only two elements among the first 83 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes. This is a result of a [[Isotopes of technetium#Stability of technetium isotopes|rarely occurring effect]] of the [[liquid drop model]] and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; The primary decay products are [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]] isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via [[positron decay]] and [[electron capture]], and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). Promethium [[nuclear isomer]]s may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable [[praseodymium]]-141.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

The most stable isotope of the element is promethium-145, which has a specific activity of {{convert|940|Ci/g|TBq/g|abbr=on|lk=on}} and a half-life of 17.7&amp;nbsp;years via [[electron capture]].&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G. Audi |author2=A. H. Wapstra |author3=C. Thibault |author4=J. Blachot |author5=O. Bersillon |year=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=729 |issue=1 |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRCel/&gt; Because it has 84 neutrons (two more than 82, which is a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] which corresponds to a stable neutron configuration), it may emit an [[alpha particle]] (which has 2 neutrons) to form praseodymium-141 with 82 neutrons. Thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed [[alpha decay]].{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=114}} Its [[partial half-life]] for alpha decay is about 6.3{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;years, and the relative probability for a &lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;Pm nucleus to decay in this way is 2.8{{e|-7}}&amp;nbsp;%. Several other promethium isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Pm, &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Pm, &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm etc.) also have a positive energy release for alpha decay; their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed.

The element also has 18 nuclear isomers, with [[mass number]]s of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers have more than one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a half-life of 43.1&amp;nbsp;days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

==History==

===Searches for element 61===
In 1902, Czech chemist [[Bohuslav Brauner]] found out that the differences in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them.&lt;ref name="61a"&gt;{{cite journal|title =A Revised Periodic Table: With the Lanthanides Repositioned|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|volume=7|issue=3|year=2005|doi=10.1007/s10698-004-5959-9|pages=203–233|first=Michael|last=Laing}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction was supported in 1914 by [[Henry Moseley]] who, having discovered that [[atomic number]] was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atomic and Nuclear Physics: An Introduction in S.I.

The first claim of a discovery was published by Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of [[Florence]], Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the [[Brazil]]ian mineral [[monazite]] by fractionated crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 "florentium".

In 1963, promethium(III) fluoride was used to make promethium metal. Provisionally purified from impurities of samarium, neodymium, and americium, it was put into a [[tantalum]] crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible; the outer crucible contained lithium metal (10 times excess compared to promethium).{{sfn|Emsley|2011|p=429}}{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=123}} After creating a vacuum, the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal:

==Production==

The production methods for different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=115}} Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with [[thermal neutron]]s&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; or by bombarding a [[uranium carbide]] target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Applications of inorganic mass spectrometry|year = 2011|page = 144|publisher = Springer|isbn = 978-3-642-21022-8|last1 = Hänninen|first1 =  Pekka|last2 =  Härmä|first2 =  Harri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with [[fast neutron]]s to cause [[fast fission]], which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.&lt;ref name=De2001&gt;{{cite book|title = Applications of inorganic mass spectrometry|isbn=978-0471345398

These batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=CRCel/&gt;{{sfn|Emsley|2011|p=428}} The first promethium-based battery was assembled in 1964 and generated "a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about 2 cubic inches, including shielding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/T-ED.1964.15271|title=Construction of a promethium-147 atomic battery|year=1964|last1=Flicker|first1=H.|last2=Loferski|first2=J.

The element, like other lanthanides, has no biological role. Promethium-147 can emit [[X-ray]]s during its [[beta decay]],&lt;ref name=Simmons1964&gt;{{cite journal|title = Reed Business Information|year = 1964|author = Simmons, Howard|journal = New Scientist|page = 292|volume = 22|issue = 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are dangerous for all lifeforms.

'''Punjab State Power Corporation Limited''' (PSPCL) is the [[electricity]] generating and distributing company of the [[Government of Punjab (India)|Government of Punjab]] state in [[India]].

== History ==
PSPCL was incorporated as company on 16-04-2010 and was given the responsibility of operating and maintenance of State's own generating projects and distribution system. The business of Generation of [[Electrical power industry|power]] of erstwhile PSEB was transferred to PSPCL.

===Milestone===
All the power Stations operated at their best ever plant load factor since their installation. 
kdfsfds
Net Power generated during 2008-09 is 37222 Million units, which is more than 2006-07 by 2238 Million Units resulting of 6.40% increase in two years.
The 1980 MW (3x660) Talwandi Sabo Power Project awarded to M/s Sterlite Energy Ltd. Mumbai on 4.7.08 and PPA signed on 1.9.08.
Power purchase agreement with M/S GVK for installing 2x270 MW thermal power station at Goindwal Sahib signed on 26 May 2009. The foundation stone has been laid and the company has started the construction.

4.76 lakh new connections including 61,849 No. tubewell connections were released during 2007-09.
24 Hrs. Urban pattern supply made available to 12428 villages and 6158 Deras/ Dhanies with 5 or more houses.
To help SC &amp; BPL consumers, free monthly consumption up to 200 units allowed for connected load of 1000 watts w.e.f. 12-10-06 instead of earlier 500 watts.
Strict measures have been taken to reduce power theft. Disciplinary action taken against the erring employees and 5 numbers Anti Power Theft Police Stations have been set up.
New technologies like electronic meters, remote control of transformers, remote meter reading and HVDS system for AP/ Industries introduced.
20.29 lakh meters out of 55.98 lakh General/ Industrial Consumers shifted out of their premises as on 31.3.09 to curb theft of energy.
All these measures have helped in reducing losses by 4% from 23.92% (2006–07) to 19.91% (2008–09) / which resulted in substantial increase in revenue.
During 2007-09, 62 numbers New Grid substations erected and capacity at 132 number Grid substations augmented besides addition of 1070 circuit km. Transmission line and 149 MVAR shunt capacitors to State Grid.

The '''San Justo tornado''' was a powerful [[tornado]] which struck [[San Justo, Santa Fe|San Justo]], a town in the province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]], on January 10, 1973. At least 63 people were reported dead and 350 were reported injured as it cut a 300 yard wide swath through the town. It was the most violent tornado ever recorded in South America, and also the entire Southern Hemisphere.
Multiple factories and upwards of 500 homes were destroyed or damaged, and some homes were said to have vanished with little or no trace. Vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled beyond recognition, and grass was reportedly ripped from the ground. A newspaper image showed a vehicle motor that was embedded into a concrete wall by the tornado. A tractor was found in a wooded area 500 meters away from the dealership where it originated, and a pond outside of town was reportedly sucked dry by the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;http://tormentasdebuenosaires.blogspot.com/2011/03/tornado-ef5-en-san-justo-santa-fe.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado is widely considered to have been an [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|F5]] on the [[Fujita Scale]]. This tornado was the most violent ever reported in Argentina and Southern Hemisphere and had an economic cost of about $60,000,It was also the deadliest tornado in Argentina's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date= June 19, 2013 |title=Viento Asesino |trans-title=|medium=motion picture |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBHRd77w7_Y |accessdate= August 26, 2014 |time= |publisher=unknown |location=Argentina |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transition temperature''' is the temperature at which a material changes from one [[crystal]] state ([[Allotropy|allotrope]]) to another.  More formally, it is the temperature at which two crystalline forms of a substance can co-exist in equilibrium. For example, when [[Allotropes_of_sulfur#List_of_allotropes_and_forms|rhombic sulfur]] is heated above 95.6&amp;nbsp;°C it changes form into monoclinic sulfur.  When cooled below  95.6&amp;nbsp;°C it reverts to rhombic sulfur. At 95.6&amp;nbsp;°C the two forms can co-exist.

Another example is [[tin]], which transitions from a cubic shape below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C to a tetragonal shape above that temperature.

In the case of ferroelectric or ferromagnetic crystals a transition temperature may be known as the [[Curie temperature]].

&lt;!--Commented out information that seems inconsistent with the primary definition:

Transition temperature is the temperature at which a [[solid]] changes [[State of matter|state]], either becoming softer when [[Heat|heated]] or more brittle when cooled.

Transition temperature is the temperature above and below which [[solubility]] changes in a noticeably different way. On a graph the transition temperature is deduced by the intersection of two lines each of which have a different gradient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12889">'''Ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) electricity transmission''' has been used in China since 2009 to transmit both AC and DC electricity over long distances separating China's energy resources and consumers. Expansion of both AC and DC capacity continues in order to match generation to consumption demands while minimizing transmission losses. [[Decarbonization]] improvements will result from the replacement of lower efficiency generation, located near the coast, by more modern high efficiency generation with less pollution near the energy resources.

==Background==
Since 2004, electricity consumption in [[People's Republic of China|China]] has been growing at an unprecedented rate due to the rapid growth of industrial sectors. Serious supply shortage during 2005 had impacted the operation of many Chinese companies. Since then, China has very aggressively invested in [[electricity supply]] in order to fulfill the demand from industries and hence secure [[economic growth]]. Installed generation capacity has run from 443&amp;nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]] at end of 2004 to 793&amp;nbsp;GW at the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="China Stat"&gt;Data available from China National Statistics Bureau, http://www.stats.gov.cn&lt;/ref&gt; The increment in these four years is equivalent to approximately one-third of the total capacity of the [[United States|USA]], or 1.4 times the total capacity of [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Data available from Electricity Information Administration, DOE, US, http://www.eia.doe.gov&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period of time, power consumption has also risen from 2,197&amp;nbsp;[[Terawatt-hour|TWh]] to 3,426&amp;nbsp;TWh.&lt;ref name="China Stat" /&gt;
China's electricity consumption is expected to reach 6,800–6,900&amp;nbsp;TWh by 2018 from 4,690&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2011, with installed capacity reaching 1,463&amp;nbsp;GW from 1,056&amp;nbsp;GW in 2011, of which 342&amp;nbsp;GW is hydropower, 928&amp;nbsp;GW coal-fired, 100&amp;nbsp;GW wind, 43GW nuclear, and 40GW natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinamining.org/News/2012-03-14/1331688172d55207.html&lt;/ref&gt;  China is the world's largest consuming nation of electricity in 2011.

==Transmission and distribution==
On the [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]] side, the country has focused on expanding T&amp;D capacity and reducing losses by:
# deploying long-distance ultrahigh-voltage AC ([[UHVAC]], referring to 1000&amp;nbsp;kV) and ultrahigh-voltage DC ([[UHVDC]], referring to ±800&amp;nbsp;kV) transmission
# installing high-efficiency [[amorphous metal transformer]]s.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Jerry (2009), From Strong to Smart: the Chinese Smart Grid and its relation with the Globe, AEPN, Article No. 0018602, Asia Energy Platform.

==UHV transmission worldwide==
UHV transmission and a number of UHVAC circuits have already been constructed in different parts of the world. For example, 2,362&amp;nbsp;km of 1,150 kV circuits were built in the [[former USSR]], and 427&amp;nbsp;km of 1,000&amp;nbsp;kV AC circuits have been developed in Japan ([[Kita-Iwaki powerline]]). Experimental lines of various scales are also found in many countries.&lt;ref name="Du"&gt;Du Z (2008), Study on Strategic Planning of Ultra High Voltage Grid Development in China, Ph.D Thesis, Shangdong University (In Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of these lines are currently operating at lower voltage due to insufficient power demand or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao J, Niu L (2007a), Research and Application of UHVAC Transmission Technologies in Japan Part I, Proceedings of CSU-EPSA, Vol. 19, No. 1, p. 28–33 (In Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao J, Niu L (2007b), Research and Application of UHVAC Transmission Technologies in Japan Part II, Proceedings of CSU-EPSA, Vol. 19, No. 4, P. 1–6 (In Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; There are fewer examples of UHVDC. Although there are plenty of ±500&amp;nbsp;kV (or below) circuits around the world, the only operative circuits above this threshold are the [[Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system]] at 735&amp;nbsp;kV AC (since 1965, 11 422 km long in 2018) and [[HVDC Itaipu|Itaipu]] ±600&amp;nbsp;kV project in [[Brazil]].
In Russia, construction work on a 2400&amp;nbsp;km long bipolar ±750&amp;nbsp;kV DC line, the [[HVDC Ekibastuz–Centre]] started in 1978 but it was never finished. In USA at the beginning of the 1970s a 1333&amp;nbsp;kV powerline was planned from [[Celilo Converter Station]] to Hoover Dam. For this purpose a short experimental powerline near Celilo Converter Station was built, but the line to Hoover Dam was never built.

==Reasons for UHV transmission in China==
China's decision to go for UHV transmission is based on the fact that energy resources are far away from the load centers. The majority of the [[Hydroelectricity|hydropower]] resources are in the west, and [[coal]] is in the northwest, but huge loadings are in the east and south.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; To reduce transmission losses to a manageable level, UHV transmission is a logical choice. As the [[State Grid Corporation of China]] announced at the 2009 International Conference on UHV Power Transmission in [[Beijing]], China will invest [[RMB]] 600 billion (approximately US$88 billion) into UHV development between now and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;UHV Corner, State Grid of China Corporation, http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ztzl/tgyzl/default.shtml (In Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the UHV grid enables the construction of newer, cleaner, more efficient power generation plants far from population centers. Older power plants along the coast will be retired.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Stephen (2014), China to build new hi-tech power network to help fight pollution, SCMP. Available: http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1512282/china-build-new-hi-tech-power-grid-help-fight-pollution&lt;/ref&gt; This will lower the total current amount of pollution, as well as the pollution felt by citizens within urban dwellings. The use of large central power plants providing electric heating are also less polluting than individual boilers used for winter heating in many northern households.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Dale (2014), Super-grid: China masters long-distance power transmission, Reuters. Available: https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/19/us-china-electricity-grid-kemp-idUSKBN0EU19B20140619&lt;/ref&gt; The UHV grid will aid China's plan of electrification and decarbonization,&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;Reference 11&lt;/ref&gt; and enable integration of renewable energy by removing the transmission bottleneck that is currently limiting expansions in wind and solar generation capacity whilst further developing the market for long-range electric vehicles in China.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;Reference 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over UHV==
{{original research|section|date=April 2017}}
There has been controversy over UHV since 2004 when the State Grid Corporation of China&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/default.shtml State Grid Corporation of China website]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the idea of UHV construction. The controversy has been focused on UHVAC while the idea of building UHVDC has been widely accepted.&lt;ref name="han"&gt;Han,X.P.(2009) [http://www.china5e.com/show.php?contentid=52396 Clone of Tyrannosaur—debate of ultrahigh-voltage] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;
The most debated issues are the four listed below.

# Security and reliability issues: With the construction of more and more UHV transmission lines, the power grid around the whole nation is connected more and more intensively. If an accident happens in one line, it is difficult to limit the influence to a small area. This means that the chances of a [[Power outage|blackout]] are getting higher. Also, it may be more vulnerable to terrorism.{{cn|date=April 2017}}
# Market issue: All other UHV transmission lines around the world are currently operating at a lower voltage because there is not enough demand.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The potential of long distance transmission needs more in-depth research. Although the majority of coal resources are in the northwest, it is difficult to build coal power plants there because they need a large amount of water and that is a scarce resource in northwest China. And also with the economic development in west China, the demand of electricity has been booming these years.
# Environmental and efficiency issues: Some experts argue that UHV lines won't save more land compared to building extra railroads for increased coal transport and local power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, W.X.(2009) [http://www.china5e.com/show.php?contentid=42259 Coal transportation or ultrahigh-voltage?] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[water scarcity]] issue, the construction of coal-fired power plants in the west is hindered. Another issue is transmission efficiency. Using [[combined heat and power]] at user end is more energy efficient than using power from long distance transmission lines.{{cn|date=April 2017}}
# Economic issue: The total investment is estimated to be 270 billion RMB (around US$40 billion), which is much more expensive than building new railroad for coal transportation.
Also, the huge amount of investment in UHV transmission may draw investment away from energy efficiency programs and power grid distribution reconstruction (which is argued to be the most vulnerable part of whole power grid).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

However, the construction of UHV may boost the development of renewable energy in China, especially wind energy in west China (Neimenggu and Xinjiang area).

There is also controversy over whether the construction proposed by State Grid Corporation of China is a strategy to be more monopolistic and fight against the power grid reform.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;

[[File:BR T01.jpg|thumb|[[Vortexis]] Schematic]]
A '''vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT)''' is a type of [[wind turbine]] where the main rotor shaft is set transverse to the wind (but not necessarily vertically) while the main components are located at the base of the turbine. This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to be pointed into the wind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jha |first1=A.R. |year=2010 |title=Wind turbine technology |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press }}{{pn|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.05.036 |title=The Darrieus wind turbine: Proposal for a new performance prediction model based on CFD |journal=Energy |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=4919–34 |year=2011 |last1=Raciti Castelli |first1=Marco |last2=Englaro |first2=Alessandro |last3=Benini |first3=Ernesto }}&lt;/ref&gt; which removes the need for wind-sensing and orientation mechanisms. Major drawbacks for the early designs ([[Savonius wind turbine|Savonius]], [[Darrieus wind turbine|Darrieus]] and [[giromill]]) included the significant [[torque]] variation or "[[Torque ripple|ripple]]" during each revolution, and the large bending moments on the blades. Later designs addressed the [[torque ripple]] issue by sweeping the blades [[Helix|helically]] ([[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov type]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/753/6/062009/pdf Analysis of Different Blade Architectures on small VAWT Performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical axis wind turbine has its axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines and vertical to the ground. A more general term that includes this option is "transverse axis wind turbine" or "cross-flow wind turbine." For example, the original Darrieus patent, US Patent 1835018, includes both options.

Drag-type VAWTs such as the Savonius rotor typically operate at lower [[tip speed ratio|tipspeed ratios]] than lift-based VAWTs such as Darrieus rotors and [[Darrieus_wind_turbine#Cycloturbines|cycloturbines]].

==General aerodynamics==
The forces and the velocities acting in a Darrieus turbine are depicted in figure 1. The resultant velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec{W}&lt;/math&gt;, is the vectorial sum of the undisturbed upstream air velocity, &lt;math&gt;\vec{U}&lt;/math&gt;, and the velocity vector of the advancing blade, &lt;math&gt;-\vec{\omega }\times\vec{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{W}=\vec{U}+\left( -\vec{\omega }\times\vec{R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Forces and velocities of blades of Darrieus wind turbine.png|thumb|right|Fig1: Forces and velocities acting in a Darrieus turbine for various azimuthal positions]]
[[File:Vertical-axis wind turbine at Hartnell College Alisal Campus.gk.webm|thumb|A helical Darrieus turbine]]
Thus the oncoming fluid velocity varies during each cycle. Maximum velocity is found for &lt;math&gt;\theta =0{}^\circ &lt;/math&gt; and the minimum is found for &lt;math&gt;\theta =180{}^\circ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal or orbital blade position. The [[angle of attack]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;, is the angle between the oncoming air speed, W, and the blade's chord. The resultant airflow creates a varying, positive angle of attack to the blade in the upstream zone of the machine, switching sign in the downstream zone of the machine.

It follows from geometric considerations of angular velocity as seen in the accompanying figure that: 

&lt;math&gt;V_t=R \omega + U\cos(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;V_n=U \sin(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the relative velocity as the resultant of the tangential and normal components yields:

&lt;math&gt; W= \sqrt{V_t^2+V_n^2} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.10.023 |title=Aerodynamic models for Darrieus-type straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbines |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1087–109 |year=2008 |last1=Islam |first1=M |last2=Ting |first2=D |last3=Fartaj |first3=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, combining the above with the definitions for the [[tip speed ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda =(\omega R) /U&lt;/math&gt; yields the following expression for the resultant velocity:

&lt;math&gt;W=U\sqrt{1+2\lambda \cos \theta +\lambda ^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395143097660/Extended%20abstract.pdf{{full|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angle of attack is solved as:

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{V_n}{V_t} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Which when substituting the above yields:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha =\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{\sin \theta }{\cos \theta +\lambda } \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jweia.2007.03.007 |title=An extended k–ε model for turbulent flow through horizontal-axis wind turbines |journal=Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics |volume=96 |pages=103–22 |year=2008 |last1=El Kasmi |first1=Amina |last2=Masson |first2=Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt;


The resultant aerodynamic force is resolved either into [[Lift (force)|lift]] (L) - [[Drag (physics)|drag]] (D) components or normal (N) - tangential (T) components. The forces are considered acting at the quarter-chord point, and the [[pitching moment]] is determined to resolve the aerodynamic forces. The aeronautical terms "lift" and "drag" refer to the forces across (lift) and along (drag) the approaching net relative airflow. The tangential force acts along the blade's velocity, pulling the blade around, and the normal force acts radially, pushing against the shaft bearings. The lift and the drag force are useful when dealing with the aerodynamic forces around the blade such as [[Stall_(fluid_mechanics)#Dynamic_stall|dynamic stall]], boundary layer etc.; while when dealing with global performance, fatigue loads, etc., it is more convenient to have a normal-tangential frame. The lift and the drag coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of the relative airflow, while the normal and tangential coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of undisturbed upstream fluid velocity.

&lt;math&gt;C_{L}=\frac{F_L}{{1}/{2}\;\rho AW^{2}}\text{     };\text{     }C_{D}=\frac{D}{{1}/{2}\;\rho AW^{2}}\text{      };\text{      }C_{T}=\frac{T}{{1}/{2}\;\rho AU^{2}R}\text{      };\text{     }C_{N}=\frac{N}{{1}/{2}\;\rho AU^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

A = Blade Area (not to be confused with the Swept Area, which is equal to the height of the blade/rotor times the rotor diameter),
R = Radius of turbine

The amount of power, P, that can be absorbed by a wind turbine:

&lt;math&gt; P=\frac{1}{2}C_{p}\rho A\nu^{3}  &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;C_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the power coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is air density, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the swept area of the turbine, and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.05.017 |title=Evaluation of different turbine concepts for wind power |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=1419–34 |year=2008 |last1=Eriksson |first1=S |last2=Bernhoff |first2=H |last3=Leijon |first3=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

VAWTs offer a number of advantages over traditional [[horizontal-axis wind turbine]]s (HAWTs):
  
* Being omni-directional, some forms do not need to track the wind. This means they don't require a complex mechanism and motors to yaw the rotor and pitch the blades.&lt;ref&gt;AIP Conference Proceedings 1931, 030040 (2018); [https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5024099]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* VAWTs generally function better than HAWTs in turbulent and gusty winds. HAWTs cannot efficiently harvest such winds, which also cause accelerated fatigue.
* the gearbox of a VAWT takes much less fatigue than that of a HAWT.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2017}} 
* In VAWTs, gearbox replacement and maintenance are simpler and more efficient, as the gearbox is accessible at ground level, so that that no cranes or other large equipment are needed on-site. This reduces costs and impact on the environment. Motor and gearbox failures generally are significant considerations in the operation and maintenance of HAWTs both on and offshore.
* some designs of VAWTs in suitable situations can use [[screw pile]] foundations, which hugely reduces the road transport of concrete and the carbon cost of installation. Screw piles can be fully recycled at the end of their life.
* wings of the Darrieus type have a constant chord and so are easier to manufacture than the blades of a HAWT, which have a much more complex shape and structure.
* VAWTs can be grouped more closely in wind farms, increasing the generated power per unit of land area.
* VAWTs can be installed on HAWT wind farm below the existing HAWTs; this can supplement the power output of the existing farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-648721101.html |title=Another Approach to Wind |first=Steven |last=Peace |date=June 1, 2004 |journal=Mechanical Engineering }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* research at [[California_Institute_of_Technology|Caltech]] has also shown that a carefully designed wind farm using VAWTs can have an output power ten times that of a HAWT wind farm of the same size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2011-07-wind-turbine-placement-tenfold-power.html |title=Wind-turbine placement produces tenfold power increase, researchers say |first=Kathy |last=Svitil |date=July 13, 2011 |work=PhysOrg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

One of the major outstanding challenges facing vertical axis wind turbine technology is dynamic stall of the blades as the angle of attack varies rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/jfm.2018.112 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Scaling and topological considerations |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=841 |pages=746-66 |year=2018 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |last3=Honnery |first3=D. |last4=Smits |first4=A.J. |bibcode=2018JFM...841..746B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jweia.2015.09.001 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Comparing experiments and computations |journal=Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics |volume=146 |pages=163–71 |year=2015 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Lohry |first2=M.W. |last3=Martinelli |first3=L. |last4=Soria |first4=J. |last5=Smits |first5=A.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00348-008-0543-z |title=Visualization by PIV of dynamic stall on a vertical axis wind turbine |journal=Experiments in Fluids |volume=46 |pages=97–108 |year=2008 |last1=Simão Ferreira |first1=Carlos |last2=Van Kuik |first2=Gijs |last3=Van Bussel |first3=Gerard |last4=Scarano |first4=Fulvio |bibcode=2009ExFl...46...97S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blades of a VAWT are fatigue-prone due to the wide variation in applied forces during each rotation.  This can be overcome by the use of modern composite materials and improvements in design - including the use of aerodynamic wing tips that cause the spreader wing connections to have a static load. The vertically oriented blades can twist and bend during each turn, causing them to break apart.

VAWTs have proven less reliable than [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|HAWT]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiras |first=Dan |year=2010 |title=Wind Power Basics: A Green Energy Guide |publisher=New Society |isbn=978-0-86571-617-9 }}{{pn|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although modern designs of VAWTs have overcome many of the issues associated with early designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2172/1035336 |title=A retrospective of VAWT technology |year=2012 |last1=Ashwill |first1=Thomas D. |last2=Sutherland |first2=Herbert J. |last3=Berg |first3=Dale E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kear|first=Matt|last2=Evans|first2=Ben|last3=Ellis|first3=Rob|last4=Rolland|first4=Sam|date=January 2016|title=Computational aerodynamic optimisation of vertical axis wind turbine blades|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0307904X15003984|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|volume=40|issue=2|pages=1038–1051|doi=10.1016/j.apm.2015.07.001|issn=0307-904X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The Windspire, a small VAWT intended for individual (home or office) use was developed in the early 2000s by US company Mariah Power. The company reported that several units had been installed across the US by June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/vertical-axis-wind-turbine-spins-into-business/|title=Vertical-axis wind turbine spins into business|publisher=[[CNET]]|first1= Martin|last1=LaMonica|date=2 June 2008|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arborwind, an Ann-Arbor (Michigan, US) based company, produces a patented small VAWT which has been installed at several US locations as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arborwind.com/about-us/history/|title=History|publisher=Arbor Wind|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] wind-energy researchers began a five-year study of applying VAWT design technology to offshore wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2012/08/offshore-use-of-vertical-axis-wind-turbines-gets-closer-look.html|title=Offshore Use of Vertical-axis Wind Turbines Gets Closer Look|publisher=Renewable Energy World|first1=Stephanie|last1=Holinka|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers stated: "The economics of offshore windpower are different from land-based turbines, due to installation and operational challenges. VAWTs offer three big advantages that could reduce the cost of wind energy: a lower turbine center of gravity; reduced machine complexity; and better scalability to very large sizes. A lower center of gravity means improved stability afloat and lower gravitational fatigue loads. Additionally, the drivetrain on a VAWT is at or near the surface, potentially making maintenance easier and less time-consuming. Fewer parts, lower fatigue loads and simpler maintenance all lead to reduced maintenance costs."

A 24-unit VAWT demonstration plot was installed in southern California in the early 2010s by [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] aeronautical professor [[John Dabiri]]. His design was incorporated in a 10-unit generating farm
installed in 2013 in the Alaskan village of Igiugig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/513266/will-vertical-turbines-make-more-of-the-wind/|title=Will Vertical Turbines Make More of the Wind?|publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]]|first1=Kevin|last1=Bullis|date=8 April 2013|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dulas, Anglesey]] received permission in March 2014 to install a prototype VAWT on the breakwater at Port Talbot waterside. The turbine is a new design, supplied by Wales-based C-FEC (Swansea),&lt;ref name="fecturbine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-fec.com/turbine/|title=C-Fec turbine|publisher=C-Fec|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be operated for a two-year trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/37298/dulas-secures-consent-for-prototype-vertical-axis-wind-turbine/|title=Dulas secures consent for prototype 'vertical axis' wind turbine|publisher=Renewable Energy Focus|date=5 March 2014|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This VAWT incorporates a wind shield which blocks the wind from the advancing blades, and thus requires a wind-direction sensor and a positioning mechanism, as opposed to the "egg-beater" types of VAWTs discussed above.&lt;ref name="fecturbine"/&gt;

4 Navitas (Blackpool) have been operating two prototype VAWTs since June 2013, powered by a Siemens Power Train, they are due to enter the market in January 2015, with a free technology share to interested parties. 4 Navitas are now in the process of scaling their prototype to 1 MW, (working with PERA Technology) and then floating the turbine on an offshore pontoon. This will reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">The '''Virginia Petroleum Convenience and Grocery Association''' (VPCGA) is a statewide [[trade association]] formed in 1948 providing advocacy, educational and networking services to its membership.

Until 1999, the Association (www.vpcga.com) was known as the Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Association. As the traditional [[jobber (fuel)|jobber]] (wholesaler) evolved more into direct sales to consumers so did the Association. VPCGA now has over 600 members, who in turn own and operate more than 4000 retail locations across [[Virginia]]. Members operate gasoline/convenience locations, grocery stores, travel centers, sell home heating oil, lubricants and supply petroleum products to the motoring public, agriculture and maritime industries and the armed forces.

The Association is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors, and has had just three Presidents since its founding. The current President, Michael O'Connor, [[Certified Association Executive|CAE]], has more than 25 years of association management experience and has led the Association as President and Chief Executive Officer since 2000.

In addition to representing the interests of the membership at the [[Virginia General Assembly]] and various regulatory agencies, the Association publishes regular industry updates containing important compliance information on pending issues, conducts compliance training seminars to provide hands on training to employees on technical aspects of the petroleum business.  The association's motto is "Virginia Neighbors Serving Neighbors".  VPCGA works closely with the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (www.pmaa.org) and the National Association of Convenience Stores (www.nacsonline.com) on Federal Issues

The Association office is located at 7275 Glen Forest Drive Suite 204 [[Richmond, Virginia]] 23226

==Education and career==
Nordhaus was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the son of Virginia (Riggs) and Robert J. Nordhaus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.abqjournal.com/obits/show/172069|title=Albuquerque Journal Obituaries|website=obits.abqjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who co-founded the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/us/brothers-work-different-angles-in-taking-on-climate-change.html|title=Brothers Battle Climate Change on Two Fronts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiapeak.com/index.php?page=history-technology|title=Sandia Peak Ski &amp; Tramway - History &amp; Technology|website=sandiapeak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Nordhaus was from a German Jewish family — his father Max Nordhaus (1865–1936) immigrated from [[Paderborn]] in 1883 and was a manager of The Charles Ilfeld Company branch in Albuquerque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/26/9753|title=Profile of William D.

Nordhaus graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] and subsequently received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1963 and 1973, respectively, where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]].&lt;ref name=NYT1964&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/william-dawbney-nordhaus-will-marry-barbara-feise.html|title=William Dawbney Nordhaus Will Marry Barbara Feise|access-date=October 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds a Certificat from the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques]] (1962) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1967).&lt;ref name="thesis-nordhaus-1967"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302275783/ |title=A theory of endogenous technological change |date=1967 |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Nordhaus |first=William Dawbney |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=24679365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1964/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale-page&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economics.yale.edu/people/william-d-nordhaus|title=William D.

Nordhaus lives in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], with his wife, Barbara, a social worker in the [[Yale Child Study Center]].&lt;ref name=Yale-page/&gt;

==Writing==
Nordhaus is the author or editor of over 20 books. He is the co-author of the textbook ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', the original editions of which were written by fellow [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Laureate]] [[Paul Samuelson]]. The book is currently in its 19th edition and has been translated into at least 17 other languages.

He has also written several books on [[global warming]] and [[climate change]], one of his primary areas of research.  Those books include ''Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change'' (1994), which won the 2006 Award for “Publication of Enduring Quality” from the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics. Another book, with Joseph Boyer, is ''Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming'' (2000). His most recent book is ''The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Nordhaus|title=The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRf7AAAAQBAJ|date=October 22, 2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-18977-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Nordhaus, along with fellow Yale economics professor [[James Tobin]], published  ''Is Growth Obsolete?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf |title=Is Growth Obsolete?  William Nordhaus and James Tobin, Yale University (Link) }}&lt;/ref&gt; an article that introduced the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) as the first model for economic [[sustainability]] assessment.

Nordhaus is also known for his critique on current measures of national income. He wrote, "If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of real incomes over the last century, we must somehow construct price indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile machine, of carbon paper with photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching television, and of brain surgery with magnetic resonance imaging" (1997, 30).&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, William D. 1997. "Do Real Output and Real Wage Measures Capture Reality? The History of Light Suggests Not." The Economics of New Goods. Edited by Robert J. Gordon and Timothy F. Bresnahan. University of Chicago Press for the National Bureau of Economic Research. 27-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palda summarizes the importance of Nordhaus' insight as follows: "The practical lesson to be drawn from this fascinating study of lighting is that the way we measure the consumer price index is severely flawed. Instead of putting goods and their prices directly into the index we should reduce all goods to their constituent characteristics. Then we should evaluate how these goods can best be combined to minimize the cost of consuming these characteristics. Such an approach would allow us to include new goods in the consumer price index without worrying about whether the index of today is comparable to that of ten years ago when the good did not exist. Such an approach would also allow governments to more precisely calculate the rate at which welfare and other forms of aid should be increased. At present such calculations tend to overestimate the cost of living because they do not take into account the manner in which increases in quality reduce the monetary cost of maintaining a certain standard of living."&lt;ref&gt;Palda, Filip (2013). The Apprentice Economist: Seven Steps to Mastery. Cooper-Wolfling Press. {{ISBN|978-0987788047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributions on economics of climate change ===
Nordhaus has written on the [[Economics of global warming|economics]] of [[global warming|climate change]]. He is the developer of the [[DICE model|DICE and RICE models]], [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment models]] of the interplay between economics, energy use, and climate change.

''A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies'' {{ISBN|978-0-300-13748-4}} was published by [[Yale University Press]] on June 24, 2008.

In ''Reflections on the Economics of Climate Change'' (1993), he states: "Mankind is playing dice with the natural environment through a multitude of interventions – injecting into the atmosphere trace gases like the greenhouse gases or [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] chemicals, engineering massive land-use changes such as deforestation, depleting multitudes of species in their natural habitats even while creating [[Transgenic organism|transgenic ones]] in the laboratory, and accumulating sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy human civilizations."&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, W. D. '"Reflections on the economics of climate change", ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' (1993); 7(4) 11–25 at p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[climate change]] models he has developed, in general those sectors of the economy that depend heavily on unmanaged [[ecosystems]] – that is, are heavily dependent upon naturally occurring rainfall, runoff, or temperatures – will be most sensitive to climate change. Agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation, and coastal activities fall in this category."&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, W. D. '"Reflections on the economics of climate change", ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' (1993); 7(4) 11–25 at p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Nordhaus takes seriously the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Nordhaus WD | title = An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]  |date=November 1992 | volume = 258 | issue = 5086 | pages = 1315–1319 | doi = 10.1126/science.258.5086.1315  | url = http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p08a/p0829.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordhaus, who has done several studies on the [[economics of global warming]], criticized the [[Stern Review]] for its use of a low [[Social discount rate|discount rate]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/Nordhaus_stern_jel.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change |last=Nordhaus |first= William |publisher=[[Yale University]] |date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Review’s unambiguous conclusions about the need for extreme immediate action will not survive the substitution of discounting assumptions that are consistent with today’s market place. So the central questions about global-warming policy – how much, how fast, and how costly – remain open. The Review informs but does not answer these fundamental questions.}}

In 2013, Nordhaus chaired a committee of the National Research Council that produced a report discounting the impact of fossil fuel subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Tax Code Has Minimal Effect on Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Report Says|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=18299|website=National Academies|accessdate=July 7, 2015|ref=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a December 2016 discussion paper for the [[Cowles Foundation]], his research using the updated [[DICE model]] ''...confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2°C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d20/d2057.pdf |title=Projections and uncertainties about climate change in an era of minimal climate policies |author=William Nordhaus |date= December 2016|website= |publisher=[[Cowles Foundation]] |accessdate= February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==
=== Scientific and engineering academies ===
Among many honors, he is a Member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] and an Elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Yale-page/&gt; He has been a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] since 1999.

=== American Economic Association ===
In 2004, Nordhaus was designated a Distinguished Fellow of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA), along with [[George P. Shultz]] and [[William A. Brock]].&lt;ref&gt;American Economic Association [http://www.aeaweb.org/honors_awards/disting_fellows.php "Distinguished Fellows".]&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying AEA statement referred to his "knack for asking large questions about the measurement of [[economic growth]] and [[well-being]], and addressing them with simple but creative insights," among them, his pioneering work on the [[Business cycle#Politically based business cycle|political business cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;• William D. Nordhaus, 1975. "The Political Business Cycle," ''[[The Review of Economic Studies]]'', 42(2), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2296528?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101641116423 169]-190.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____, 1989:2.

[http://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Nordhaus_bio.pdf  "William D. Nordhaus, Distinguished Fellow".]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Nordhaus became president-elect of the AEA, and served as the association's president between 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/AboutAEA/board.php|title=American Economic Association|website=www.aeaweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YaleNews"/&gt;

===  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics ===
Nordhaus was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2018. He shared the award with [[Paul Romer]].&lt;ref name="YaleNews"/&gt; In detailing its reasons for giving the prize to Nordhaus, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] specifically recognized his efforts to develop "an ''[[Integrated assessment modelling | integrated assessment model]]'', i.e. a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. His model integrates theories and empirical results from physics, chemistry and economics. Nordhaus’ model is now widely spread and is used to simulate how the economy and the climate co-evolve."&lt;ref name=nobelpressrelease&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the news outlets that reported on Nordhaus's prize noted that he was in the advance wave of economists who embraced a [[carbon tax]] as a preferred method of [[carbon pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Delphine | title = Economics Nobel recognises work on climate change and innovation: William Nordhaus and Paul Romer showed how to achieve sustained and sustainable growth | newspaper = Financial Times | date = October 8, 2018 | url = https://www.ft.com/content/b08807de-cae0-11e8-9fe5-24ad351828ab | quote = Mr Nordhaus was an early advocate of carbon taxes, but the committee noted that the models he developed also allowed policymakers to calculate quantitative paths for the best tax showing how they would depend on [assumptions regarding the values of disparate climate and economic variables].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Appelbaum | first = Binyamin | title = 2018 Nobel in Economics Awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 8, 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/business/economic-science-nobel-prize.html | quote = The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus has spent the better part of four decades trying to persuade governments to address climate change, preferably by imposing a tax on carbon emissions. His careful work has long since convinced most members of his own profession . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some climate scientists and commentators were disappointed with the Nobel Prize going to Nordhaus due to his embrace of substantially lower carbon taxes per ton than most scientists, along with his past history of minimal carbon taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-linden-nobel-economics-mistake-20181025-story.html|title=The economics Nobel went to a guy who enabled climate change denial and delay|last=Linden|first=Eugene|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great majority of [[wind turbine]]s around the world belong to individuals or corporations who use them to generate electric power or to perform mechanical work. As such, wind turbines are primarily designed to be working devices. However, the large size and height above surroundings of modern industrial wind turbines, combined with their moving rotors, often makes them among the most conspicuous objects in their areas. A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers on their bases, or with viewing areas farther away.&lt;ref name="wind_farm_tourism"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind turbines themselves are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education.
