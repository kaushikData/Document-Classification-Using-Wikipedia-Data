In [[mathematics]], '''Abhyankar's lemma''' (named after [[Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar]]) allows one to kill [[tame ramification]] by taking an extension of a base field. 

More precisely, Abhyankar's lemma states that if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' are [[local field]]s such that ''A'' and ''B'' are [[finite extension]]s of ''C'', with [[ramification index|ramification indices]] ''a'' and ''b'', and ''B'' is tamely ramified over ''C'' and ''b'' divides ''a'', then the [[compositum]]
''AB'' is an unramified extension of ''A''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7853">The '''actuarial present value''' ('''APV''') is the [[expected value]] of the [[present value]] of a contingent [[cash flow]] stream (i.e. a series of payments which may or may not be made). Actuarial present values are typically calculated for the benefit-payment or series of payments associated with [[life insurance]] and [[life annuity|life annuities]]. The probability of a future payment is based on assumptions about the person's future mortality which is typically estimated using a life table.

== Life insurance ==

[[Whole life insurance]] pays a pre-determined benefit either at or soon after the insured's death. The symbol ''(x)'' is used to denote "a life aged ''x''" where ''x'' is a non-random parameter that is assumed to be greater than zero. The actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance issued to ''(x)'' is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; in [[actuarial notation]]. Let ''G&gt;0'' (the "age at death") be the [[random variable]] that models the age at which an individual, such as ''(x)'', will die. And let ''T'' (the future lifetime random variable) be the time elapsed between age-''x'' and whatever age ''(x)'' is at the time the benefit is paid (even though ''(x)'' is most likely dead at that time). Since ''T'' is a function of G and x we will write ''T=T(G,x)''. Finally, let ''Z'' be the present value random variable of a whole life insurance benefit of 1 payable at time ''T''. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\,Z=v^T=(1+i)^{-T} = e^{-\delta T} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the effective annual interest rate and δ is the equivalent [[force of interest]].

To determine the actuarial present value of the benefit we need to calculate the [[expected value]] &lt;math&gt;\,E(Z)&lt;/math&gt; of this random variable ''Z''. Suppose the death benefit is payable at the end of year of death. Then ''T(G, x) := [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]](G - x)'' is the number of "whole years" (rounded upwards) lived by ''(x)'' beyond age ''x'', so that the actuarial present value of one unit of insurance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} A_x  &amp;=  E[Z]   =  E[v^T]  \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^{t}  Pr[T = t]  =  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1}  Pr[T(G, x) = t+1]   \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} Pr[t &lt; G - x \leq t+1 \mid G &gt; x] \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} \left(\frac{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}{Pr[G&gt;x]}\right)\left(\frac{Pr[x+t&lt;G\leq x+t+1]}{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}\right) \\ 
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} {}_t p_x \cdot q_{x+t}  \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}_t p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x)'' survives to age ''x+t'', and &lt;math&gt;\,q_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x+t)'' dies within one year.

If the benefit is payable at the moment of death, then ''T(G,x): = G - x'' and the actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x\! = E[v^T] = \int_0^\infty v^t f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty v^t\,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] of ''T'', &lt;math&gt;\,_tp_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; surviving to age &lt;math&gt;x + t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[force of mortality]] at time &lt;math&gt;x+t&lt;/math&gt; for a life aged &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

The actuarial present value of one unit of an ''n''-year term insurance policy payable at the moment of death can be found similarly by integrating from 0 to ''n''.

The actuarial present value of an n year pure [[Endowment policy|endowment]] insurance benefit of 1 payable after n years if alive, can be found as

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nE_x = Pr[G &gt; x + n]v^n = \,_np_xv^n &lt;/math&gt;

In practice the information available about the random variable ''G'' (and in turn ''T'') may be drawn from life tables, which give figures by year. For example, a three year term life insurance of $100,000 payable at the end of year of death has actuarial present value

:&lt;math&gt;

100,000 \,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 100,000 \sum_{t=1}^{3} v^{t} Pr[T(G,x) = t]

&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose that there is a 90% chance of an individual surviving any given year (i.e. ''T'' has a [[geometric distribution]] with parameter ''p = 0.9'' and the set ''{1, 2, 3, ...}'' for its support). Then

:&lt;math&gt;Pr[T(G,x)=1]=0.1, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=2]=0.9(0.1)=0.09, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=3]=0.9^2(0.1) = 0.081,&lt;/math&gt;

and at interest rate 6% the actuarial present value of one unit of the three year term insurance is

:&lt;math&gt;

\,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 0.1(1.06)^{-1} + 0.09(1.06)^{-2} + 0.081(1.06)^{-3} = 0.24244846,

&lt;/math&gt;

so the actuarial present value of the $100,000 insurance is $24,244.85.

In practice the benefit may be payable at the end of a shorter period than a year, which requires an adjustment of the formula.

== Life annuity ==

The actuarial present value of a [[life annuity]] of 1 per year paid continuously can be found in two ways:

'''Aggregate payment technique''' (taking the expected value of the total [[present value]]):

This is similar to the method for a life insurance policy. This time the random variable ''Y'' is the total present value random variable of an annuity of 1 per year, issued to a life aged ''x'', paid continuously as long as the person is alive, and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\overline{a}_{\overline{T(x)|}} = \frac{1-(1+i)^{-T}}{\delta} = \frac{1-v^T(x)}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T=T(x)'' is the future lifetime random variable for a person age ''x''. The expected value of ''Y'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} \,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Current payment technique''' (taking the total present value of the function of time representing the expected values of payments):

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x =\int_0^\infty v^{t} [1-F_T(t)]\,dt= \int_0^\infty v^{t} \,_tp_x\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''t'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the random variable ''T''.

The equivalence follows also from integration by parts.

In practice life annuities are not paid continuously. If the payments are made at the end of each period the actuarial present value is given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^t [1-F_T(t)] = \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^t \,_tp_x. &lt;/math&gt;

Keeping the total payment per year equal to 1, the longer the period, the smaller the present value is due to two effects:

*The payments are made on average half a period later than in the continuous case.
*There is no proportional payment for the time in the period of death, i.e. a "loss" of payment for on average half a period.

Conversely, for contracts costing an equal lumpsum and having the same [[internal rate of return]], the longer the period between payments, the larger the total payment per year.

== Life insurance as a function of the life annuity ==

The APV of whole-life insurance can be derived from the APV of a whole-life annuity-due this way:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-iv \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

This is also commonly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-d \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

In the continuous case,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x = 1-\delta \overline{a}_x.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the annuity and life insurance are not whole life, one should replace the insurance with an n-year endowment insurance (which can be expressed as the sum of an n-year term insurance and an n-year pure endowment), and the annuity with an n-year annuity due.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5770">[[Image:Bispherical coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of bispherical coordinates, which are obtained by rotating a two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis joining its two foci.  The foci are located at distance 1 from the vertical ''z''-axis.  The red self-intersecting torus is the σ=45° isosurface, the blue sphere is the τ=0.5 isosurface, and the yellow half-plane is the φ=60° isosurface.  The green half-plane marks the ''x''-''z'' plane, from which φ is measured.  The black point is located at the intersection of the red, blue and yellow isosurfaces, at Cartesian coordinates roughly (0.841, -1.456, 1.239).]]

'''Bispherical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis that connects the two foci.  Thus, the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in [[bipolar coordinates]] remain points (on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the axis of rotation) in the bispherical coordinate system.

==Definition==
The most common definition of bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the foci

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate surfaces===
Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to intersecting tori of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} +
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a \cot \sigma \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sin^2 \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the foci but are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting spheres of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( x^2 + y^2 \right) +
\left( z - a \coth \tau \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sinh^2 \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the foci. The centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; spheres lie along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, whereas the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; tori are centered in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane.

===Inverse formulae===

The formulae for the inverse transformation are:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \arccos\left(\dfrac{R^2-a^2}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \operatorname{arsinh}\left(\dfrac{2az}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \operatorname{atan}\left(\dfrac{y}{x}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q=\sqrt{(R^2+a^2)^2-(2 a z)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\phi = \frac{a \sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^3 \sin \sigma}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3}{a^2 \sin \sigma} 
&amp; \left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma}
\left( \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right) \right. \\[8pt]
&amp;{} \quad + \left.
\sin \sigma \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}
\left( \frac{1}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right) + 
\frac{1}{\sin \sigma \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of bispherical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]], for which bispherical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  However, the [[Helmholtz equation]] is not separable in bispherical coordinates. A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two conducting spheres of different radii.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42916">In mathematical physics, [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]] are the expansion coefficients of [[total angular momentum]] [[eigenstate]]s in an uncoupled [[tensor product]] basis. Mathematically, they specify the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations into a [[direct sum]] of irreducible representations, where the type and the multiplicities of these irreducible representations are known abstractly. The name derives from the German mathematicians [[Alfred Clebsch]] (1833–1872) and [[Paul Gordan]] (1837–1912), who encountered an equivalent problem in invariant theory.

Generalization to SU(3) of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients is useful because of their utility in characterizing [[Hadron|hadronic decays]], where a [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor-SU(3) symmetry]] exists (the [[Eightfold Way (physics)]]) that connects the three light  [[quarks]]: [[Up quark|up]], [[Down quark|down]], and [[Strange quark|strange]].

==Groups==
{{Main article|Group (mathematics)}}
A group is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form &lt;math&gt;(G,*))&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a set {{mvar|G}} and a [[binary operation]] (*) (often called a 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
# '''Closure''': For every pair of elements {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|G}}, the ''product'' &lt;math&gt;x*y&lt;/math&gt; is also in {{mvar|G}}  ( in symbols, for every two elements &lt;math&gt;x,y\in G,x*y&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;G.&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Associativity''': For every {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|G}}, both &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; result with the same element in {{mvar|G}} ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z \in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''Existence of identity''': There must be an element ( say {{mvar|e}} ) in {{mvar|G}} such that product any element of {{mvar|G}} with {{mvar|e}} make no change to the element ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;x*e=e*x= x&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''Existence of inverse''': For each element ({{mvar|x}} ) in {{mvar|G}}, there must be an element {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|G}} such that product of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is the identity element {{mvar|e}} ( in symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;y \in  G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x=e&lt;/math&gt; for every;&lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''Commutative''': In addition to the above four, if it so happens that &lt;math&gt;
\forall x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x&lt;/math&gt;, then the group is called an [[Abelian group]]. Otherwise it is called a non-Abelian group.

==Symmetry group==
{{Main article|Symmetry group}}
In abstract algebra, the symmetry group of an object (image, signal, etc.) is the group of all [[isometry|isometries]] under which the object is invariant with composition as the operation. It is a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the space concerned.&lt;ref&gt;''Group Theory and its Application to Physical Problems''-Morton Hammermesh, {{ISBN|978-0486661810}}, Chapter-2&lt;/ref&gt; In quantum mechanics, all transformations of a system that leave the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] unchanged comprise the ''symmetry group'' of the Hamiltonian. The group operation is a binary multiplication operator.

The symmetry operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, that is,
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{H'}=\hat{T}\hat{H}\hat{T}^{-1}=\hat{H},&lt;/math&gt; or,
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}\hat{H}=\hat{H}\hat{T},&lt;/math&gt; thus
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{T},\hat{H}]=0=[\hat{H},\hat{T}]&lt;/math&gt;

The set of all &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}&lt;/math&gt; comprises a group, with the identity element being &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}=\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; which corresponds to no transformation on the Hamiltonian. All transformations have an inverse. Thus, these form a group &lt;ref&gt;http://www.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~class/Group_theory/Chap%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The SU(3) group==
{{main article|Special unitary group}}
The [[special unitary group]] '''''SU''''' is the group of [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] whose determinant is equal to 1.&lt;ref&gt;P. Carruthers (1966) ''Introduction to Unitary symmetry'', Interscience. [https://books.google.com/books?id=t33soAEACAAJ online].&lt;/ref&gt;  This set is closed under matrix multiplication. All transformations characterized by the special unitary group leave norms unchanged. The  {{math|SU(3)}} symmetry appears in [[quantum chromodynamics]], and, as already indicated in the light quark flavour symmetry dubbed the [[Eightfold Way (physics)]]. The quarks possess colour quantum numbers and form the fundamental (triplet) representation of an {{math|SU(3)}} group.

The group {{math|SU(3)}} is a subgroup of group {{math|U(3)}}, the group of all 3×3 unitary matrices. The unitarity condition imposes nine constraint relations on the total 18 degrees of freedom of a 3×3 complex matrix. Thus, the dimension of the {{math|U(3)}} group is 9. Furthermore, multiplying a ''U'' by a phase, {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;''iφ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} leaves the norm invariant. Thus  {{math|U(3)}} can be decomposed into a direct product of {{math|U(1)⊗SU(3)}}. Because of this additional constraint,  {{math|SU(3)}} has dimension 8.

===Generators of the Lie algebra===
Every unitary matrix {{mvar|U}} can be written in the form
: &lt;math&gt;U=e^{iH} \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is [[Hermitian matrix|hermitian]]. The elements of  {{math|SU(3)}} can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;U=e^{i\sum{a_k\lambda_k}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; are the 8 linearly independent matrices forming the basis of the [[Lie algebra]] of  {{math|SU(3)}}, in the tripet representation. The unit determinant condition requires the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; matrices to be traceless, since
: &lt;math&gt;\det(e^A)=e^{\operatorname{tr} (A)}&lt;/math&gt;.

An explicit basis in the fundamental, '''3''', representation can be constructed in analogy to the Pauli matrix algebra of the spin operators. It consists of the [[Gell-Mann matrices]],
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &amp;  
\lambda_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i &amp; 0 \\ i &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &amp;
\lambda_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \\  \\
\lambda_4 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &amp; 
\lambda_5 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -i \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ i &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \\  \\
\lambda_6 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &amp; 
\lambda_7 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -i \\ 0 &amp; i &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &amp;
\lambda_8 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

These are the generators of the {{math|SU(3)}} group in the triplet representation, and they are normalized as
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\lambda_j\lambda_k)=2\delta_{jk} .&lt;/math&gt;

The Lie algebra structure constants of the group are given by the commutators of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\lambda_j,\lambda_k]=2if_{jkl}\lambda_l ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; are the structure constants completely  antisymmetric and are analogous to the Levi-Civita symbol &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; of {{math|SU(2)}}.  

In general, they vanish, unless they contain an odd number of indices from the set {2,5,7}, corresponding to the antisymmetric {{mvar|λ}}s. Note &lt;math&gt;f_{ljk}=\frac{-i}{2}\mathrm{tr}([\lambda_l , \lambda_j] \lambda_k) &lt;/math&gt;. 

Moreover,
: &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_j,\lambda_k\}=\frac{4}{3}\delta_{jk} +2d_{jkl}\lambda_l&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; are the completely symmetric coefficient constants. They vanish if the number of indices  from the set {2,5,7} is odd.

===Standard basis===
[[File:Root_system_A2_with_labels.png|thumb|300px|[[Root system]] of ''{''{{math|SU(3)}}. The 6 roots are mutually inclined by {{math|''π''/3}} to form a hexagonal lattice: {{mvar|α}} corresponds to isospin;   {{mvar|β}}   to U-spin; and {{math|''α''+''β''}} to V-spin.]]
A slightly differently normalized standard basis consists of the ''F-spin'' operators, which are defined as &lt;math&gt;\hat{F_i}=\frac{1}{2}\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; for the '''3''', and are utilized to apply to ''any representation of this algebra''.

The  '''Cartan&amp;ndash;Weyl''' basis of the Lie algebra of  {{math|SU(3)}}  is obtained by another change of basis, where one defines,&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Elementary Particles''- [[David J. Griffiths]], {{ISBN|978-3527406012}}, Chapter-1, Page33-38&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_{\pm}=\hat{F}_1\pm i\hat{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_3=\hat{F_3}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}_{\pm}=\hat{F}_4\pm i\hat{F}_5&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{U}_{\pm}=\hat{F}_6\pm i\hat{F}_7&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\hat{F}_8~.&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the factors of ''i'' in these formulas, this is technically a basis for the complexification of the su(3) Lie algebra, namely sl(3,'''C'''). The preceding basis is then essentially the same one used in Hall's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutation algebra of the generators===
The standard form of generators of the  {{math|SU(3)}} group satisfies the [[commutation relation]]s given below,
{{colbegin}}
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{Y},\hat{I}_3]=0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{Y},\hat{I}_\pm]=0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{Y},\hat{U}_\pm]=\pm \hat{U_\pm},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{Y},\hat{V}_\pm]=\pm \hat{V_\pm},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_3,\hat{I}_\pm]=\pm \hat{I_\pm},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_3,\hat{U}_\pm]=\mp\frac{1}{2}\hat{U_\pm},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_3,\hat{V}_\pm]=\pm \frac{1}{2}\hat{V_\pm},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_+,\hat{I}_-]= 2\hat I_3,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{U}_+,\hat{U}_-]= \frac{3}{2}\hat{Y}-\hat{I}_3,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{V}_+,\hat{V}_-]= \frac{3}{2}\hat{Y}+\hat{I}_3,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_+,\hat{V}_-]= -\hat U_-,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_+,\hat{U}_+]= \hat V_+,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{U}_+,\hat{V}_-]= \hat I_-,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_+,\hat{V}_+]= 0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_+,\hat{U}_-]= 0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{U}_+,\hat{V}_+]= 0.&lt;/math&gt;
{{colend}}
All other commutation relations follow from  hermitian conjugation of these operators.

These commutation relations can be used to construct the irreducible representations of the  {{math|SU(3)}}  group.

The representations of the group lie in the 2-dimensional  {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−''Y''}}  plane. Here, &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_3&lt;/math&gt; stands for the z-component of [[Isospin]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hypercharge]], and they comprise the (abelian) [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the full Lie algebra. The maximum number of mutually commuting generators of a Lie algebra is called its ''rank'':  {{math|SU(3)}} has rank 2. The remaining 6 generators, the ± ladder operators, correspond to the 6 [[root system|roots]] arranged on the 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice of the figure.

===Casimir operators ===
{{Main article|Casimir operator}}
The '''Casimir operator''' is an operator that commutes with all the generators of the Lie group. In the case of {{math|SU(2)}}, the quadratic operator {{math|'''''J'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the only independent such operator.

In the case of {{math|SU(3)}} group, by contrast, two independent Casimir operators can be constructed, a quadratic and a cubic: they are,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0029-5582(61)90253-X| title = Group theory of harmonic oscillators (II). The integrals of Motion for the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction| journal = Nuclear Physics| volume = 23| pages = 177| year = 1961| last1 = Bargmann | first1 = V.| last2 = Moshinsky | first2 = M.|bibcode = 1961NucPh..23..177B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{C_1}=\sum_k   \hat{F_k}   \hat{F_k} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{C_2}=\sum_{jkl}d_{jkl}    \hat{F_j} \hat{F_k} \hat{F_l}  ~.&lt;/math&gt;

These Casimir operators  serve to label the irreducible representations of the Lie group algebra {{math|SU(3)}}, because all states in a given representation assume the same value for each Casimir operator, which serves as the identity in a space with the dimension of that representation. This  is because states in a given representation are connected by the action of the generators of the Lie algebra, and all generators commute with the Casimir operators.

For example, for the triplet representation, {{math|''D''(1,0)}}, the eigenvalue of {{tmath|\hat{C}_1}} is 4/3, and of {{tmath|\hat{C}_2}}, 10/9.

More generally, from [[Freudenthal's formula]], for generic {{math|D(p,q)}}, the eigenvalue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.215| title = Dynamical Symmetry in Particle Physics| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 38| issue = 2| pages = 215| year = 1966| last1 = Pais | first1 = A.|bibcode = 1966RvMP...38..215P }}, (3.65)&lt;/ref&gt; of {{tmath|\hat{C}_1}} is &lt;math&gt;(p^2+q^2+3p+3q+pq)/3&lt;/math&gt;.

The eigenvalue ("anomaly coefficient") of {{tmath|\hat{C}_2}} is&lt;ref&gt;Pais, ibid. (3.66)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(p-q)(3+p+2q)(3+q+2p)/18 .&lt;/math&gt;
It is  an ''odd function'' under the interchange {{math|''p'' ↔ ''q''}}. Consequently, it  vanishes for real representations {{math|''p''{{=}}''q''}}, such as the adjoint,  {{math|''D''(1,1)}}, i.e. both {{tmath|\hat{C}_2}} and anomalies vanish for it.

==Representations of the SU(3) group==
{{see also|Lie algebra representation#The case of sl(3,C)}}
The irreducible representations of SU(3) are analyzed in various places, including Hall's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the SU(3) group is simply connected,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11&lt;/ref&gt; the representations are in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6&lt;/ref&gt; su(3), or the complexification&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; of its Lie algebra, sl(3,'''C'''). 

The representations are labeled as ''D''(p,q), with ''p'' and ''q'' being non-negative integers, where in physical terms, ''p'' is the number of quarks and ''q'' is the number of antiquarks. Mathematically, the representation ''D''(p,q) may be constructed by tensoring together ''p'' copies of the standard 3-dimensional representation and ''q'' copies of the dual of the standard representation, and then extracting an irreducible invariant subspace.&lt;ref&gt;See the proof of Proposition 6.17 in {{harvnb|Hall|2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;  (See also the section of Young tableaux below: {{mvar|p}} is the number of single-box columns and {{mvar|q}} the number of double-box columns). Still another way to think about the parameters ''p'' and ''q'' is as the maximum eigenvalues of the diagonal matrices
:&lt;math&gt;H_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad H_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
(The elements &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; are linear combinations of the elements &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, but normalized so that the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; are integers.)
This is to be compared to the [[representation theory of SU(2)]], where the irreducible representations are labeled by the maximum eigenvalue of a single element, ''h''.

The representations have  dimension&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 6.27 and Example 10.23&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Baryon-decuplet.svg|thumb|300px|The '''10''' representation ''D''(3,0) (spin 3/2 baryon decuplet)]]
: &lt;math&gt;d(p,q)=\frac{1}{2}(p+1)(q+1)(p+q+2).&lt;/math&gt;

An {{math|SU(3)}} multiplet may be completely specified by '''five''' labels, two of which, the eigenvalues of the two Casimirs, are common to all members of the multiplet. This  generalizes  the mere two labels for {{math|SU(2)}} multiplets, namely the eigenvalues of its quadratic Casimir and  of {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;[\hat{I}_3,\hat{Y}]=0&lt;/math&gt;, we can
label different states by the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt; operators, &lt;math&gt;|t,y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, for a given eigenvalue of the isospin Casimir. The action of operators on this states are,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Services/Class/PHYS480/qm_PDF/chp12.pdf  Senner &amp; Schulten]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_\pm|t,y\rangle=\alpha|t\pm\frac{1}{2},y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{U}_\pm|t,y\rangle=\beta|t\pm\frac{1}{2},y\pm1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}_\pm|t,y\rangle=\gamma|t\mp\frac{1}{2},y\pm1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
Here,
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{U}_0\equiv \frac{1}{2}[\hat{U}_+,\hat{U}_-]=\frac{3}{4}\hat{Y}-\frac{1}{2}\hat{I}_3&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}_0\equiv \frac{1}{2}[\hat{V}_+,\hat{V}_-]=\frac{3}{4}\hat{Y}+\frac{1}{2}\hat{I}_3.&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:A2example.pdf|thumb|300px|The 15-dimensional representation ''D''(2,1)]]
All the other states of the representation can be constructed by the successive application of the [[ladder operator]]s &lt;math&gt;\hat{I}_\pm, \hat{U}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; and by identifying the base states which are annihilated by the action of the lowering operators. These operators lie on the vertices and the center of a hexagon.

==Clebsch–Gordan coefficient for SU(3)==
The product representation of two [[irreducible representation]]s &lt;math&gt;D(p_1,q_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D(p_2,q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is generally reducible. Symbolically,
: &lt;math&gt;D(p_1,q_1)\otimes D(p_2,q_2)=\sum_{P,Q}\oplus\sigma(P,Q)D(P,Q)~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{tmath|\sigma(P,Q)}} is an integer.

For example, two octets (adjoints) compose to
: &lt;math&gt;D(1,1)\otimes D(1,1)= D(2,2)\oplus D(3,0)\oplus D(1,1) \oplus D(1,1)\oplus  D(0,3) \oplus D(0,0)  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
that is, their product reduces to an icosaseptet ('''27'''), decuplet, two octets, an antidecuplet, and a singlet,  64 states in all.

The right-hand series is called the Clebsch–Gordan series. It implies that the representation {{tmath|D(P,Q)}} appears {{tmath|\sigma(P,Q)}} times in the reduction of this direct product of &lt;math&gt;D(p_1,q_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;D(p_2,q_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now a complete set of operators is needed to specify uniquely the states of each irreducible representation inside  the one just reduced.
The [[Complete set of commuting observables|complete set of commuting operators]] (CSCO) in the case of the irreducible representation  {{tmath|D(P,Q)}} is
: &lt;math&gt;\{\hat{C}_1, \hat{C}_2, \hat{I}_3, \hat{I}^2, \hat{Y}\}~,&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;I^2\equiv{I_1}^2+{I_3}^2+{I_3}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The states of the above direct product representation are thus completely represented by the set of operators
: &lt;math&gt;\{\hat{C}_1(1), \hat{C}_2(1), \hat{I}_3(1), \hat{I}^2(1), \hat{Y}(1), \hat{C}_1(2), \hat{C}_2(2), \hat{I}_3(2), \hat{I}^2(2), \hat{Y}(2)\},&lt;/math&gt;
where the number in the parentheses designates the representation on which the operator acts.

An alternate set of commuting operators can be found for the direct product representation, if one considers the following set of operators,&lt;ref name="Cds" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbb{C}}_1&amp;=\hat{C}_1(1)+\hat{C}_1(2)\\
\hat{\mathbb{C}}_2&amp;=\hat{C}_2(1)+\hat{C}_2(2)\\
\hat{\mathbb{I}}^2&amp;=\hat{I}^2(1)+\hat{I}^2(2)\\
\hat{\mathbb{Y}}  &amp;=\hat{Y}(1)+\hat{Y}(2)\\
\hat{\mathbb{I}}_3&amp;=\hat{I}_3(1)+\hat{I}_3(2).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the set of commuting operators includes
: &lt;math&gt;\{\hat{\mathbb{C}}_1, \hat{\mathbb{C}}_2, \hat{\mathbb{Y}}, \hat{\mathbb{I}}_3, \hat{\mathbb{I}}^2, \hat{C}_1(1), \hat{C}_1(2), \hat{C}_2(1), \hat{C}_2(2)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a set of nine operators only. But the set must contain ten operators to define all the states of the direct product representation uniquely. To find the last operator {{mvar|&amp;Gamma;}}, one must look outside the group. It is necessary to distinguish different {{tmath|D(P,Q)}} for similar values of {{mvar|P}}  and {{mvar|Q}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cc|cc|cc|cc}
\text{Operator} &amp; \text{Eigenvalue} &amp; \text{Operator} &amp; \text{Eigenvalue} &amp; \text{Operator} &amp; \text{Eigenvalue} &amp; \text{Operator} &amp; \text{Eigenvalue}
\\
\hline
\hat{C}_1(1) &amp; {c^1}_1 &amp; \hat{C}_1(2) &amp; {c^1}_2 &amp; \hat{C}_2(1) &amp; {c^2}_1 &amp; \hat{C}_2(2) &amp; {c^2}_2
\\
\hat{\mathbb{I}}^2 &amp; {i^2} &amp; \hat{\mathbb{I}}_3 &amp; {i^z} &amp; \hat{\mathbb{Y}} &amp; {y} &amp; \hat{\Gamma} &amp; \gamma
\\
\hat{\mathbb{C}}_1 &amp; {c^1} &amp; \hat{\mathbb{C}}_2 &amp; {c^1} &amp; \hat{Y}_1 &amp; {y}_1 &amp; \hat{Y}_2 &amp; {y}_2
\\
\hat{I}^2(1) &amp; {i^2}_1 &amp; \hat{I}^2(2) &amp; {i^2}_2 &amp; \hat{I}_3(1) &amp; {i^z}_1 &amp; \hat{I}_3(2) &amp; {i^z}_2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, any state in the direct product representation can be represented by the ket,
: &lt;math&gt;|{c^1}_1, {c^1}_2, {c^2}_1, {c^2}_2, y_1, y_2, {i^2}_1, {i^2}_2, {i^z}_1, {i^z}_2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
also using the second complete set of commuting operator, we can define the states in the direct product representation as
: &lt;math&gt;|{c^1}_1, {c^1}_2, {c^2}_1, {c^2}_2, y, \gamma, {i^2}, {i^z}, c^1, c^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

We can drop the &lt;math&gt;{c^1}_1, {c^1}_2, {c^2}_1, {c^2}_2&lt;/math&gt; from the state and label the states as
: &lt;math&gt;|y_1, y_2, {i^2}_1, {i^2}_2, {i^z}_1, {i^z}_2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
using the operators from the first set, and,
: &lt;math&gt;|y, \gamma, {i^2}, {i^z}, c^1, c^2\rangle ~,&lt;/math&gt;
using the operators from the second set.

Both these states span the direct product representation and any states in the representation can be labeled by suitable choice of the eigenvalues.

Using the completeness relation,
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;|y, \gamma, {i^2}, {i^z}, c^1, c^2\rangle =\sum_{y_1, y_2}\sum_{{i^2}_1, {i^2}_2}\sum_{{i^z}_1, {i^z}_2}\langle y_1, y_2, {i^2}_1, {i^2}_2, {i^z}_1, {i^z}_2|y, \gamma, {i^2}, {i^z}, c^1, c^2\rangle |y_1, y_2, {i^2}_1, {i^2}_2, {i^z}_1, {i^z}_2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|border colour = #50C878

Here, the coefficients
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\langle y_1, y_2, {i^2}_1, {i^2}_2, {i^z}_1, {i^z}_2|y, \gamma, {i^2}, {i^z}, c^1, c^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

are the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients.

===A different notation===
To avoid confusion, the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;c^1, c^2&lt;/math&gt; can be simultaneously denoted by {{mvar|μ}} and the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;i^2, i^z, y&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneously denoted by {{mvar|ν}}. Then the eigenstate of the direct product representation {{tmath|D(P,Q)}} can be denoted by&lt;ref name="Cds"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.35.916| title = The Octet Model and its Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 35| issue = 4| pages = 916| year = 1963| last1 = De Swart | first1 = J.

: &lt;math&gt;\psi 
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
    &amp;   &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_1&lt;/math&gt; is the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;{c^1}_1, {c^2}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; is the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;{c^1}_2, {c^2}_2&lt;/math&gt; denoted simultaneously. Here, the quantity expressed by the parenthesis is the [[Wigner 3-j symbols|Wigner 3-j symbol]].

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;{\phi^{\mu_1}}_{\nu_1}&lt;/math&gt; are considered to be the basis states of &lt;math&gt;D(p_1,q_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\phi^{\mu_2}}_{\nu_2}&lt;/math&gt; are the basis states of &lt;math&gt;D(p_2,q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Also &lt;math&gt;{\phi^{\mu_1}}_{\nu_1},{\phi^{\mu_2}}_{\nu_2}&lt;/math&gt; are the basis states of the product representation. Here &lt;math&gt;\nu_1, \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; represents the combined eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;({i^2}_1, {i^z}_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;({i^2}_2, {i ^z}_2, y_2)&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Thus the unitary transformations that connects the two bases are
: &lt;math&gt;\psi 
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
    &amp;   &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}  
=\sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2}\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
{\phi^{\mu_1}}_{\nu_1}{\phi^{\mu_2}}_{\nu_2}
&lt;/math&gt;
This is a comparatively compact notation. Here,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
are the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients.

===Orthogonality relations===
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients form a real orthogonal matrix. Therefore,
: &lt;math&gt;{\phi^{\mu_1}}_{\nu_1}{\phi^{\mu_2}}_{\nu_2}=\sum_{\mu,\nu,\gamma}\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
\psi 
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
    &amp;   &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Also, they follow the following orthogonality relations,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2}\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma'\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu'
\end{pmatrix}=\delta_{\nu \nu'}\delta_{\gamma, \gamma'}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mu \nu \gamma}\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1' &amp; \nu_2' &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}=\delta_{\nu_1 \nu_1'}\delta_{\nu_2, \nu_2'}&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetry properties===
If an irreducible representation &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle{\mu}_{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; apperars in the Clebsch–Gordan series of &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle{\mu}_1\otimes{\mu}_2}&lt;/math&gt;, then it must appear in the Clebsch–Gordan series of &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle{\mu}_2\otimes{\mu}_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Which implies,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
=\xi_1\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_2 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_2 &amp; \nu_1 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\xi_1=\xi_1(\mu_1,\mu_2,\gamma)=\pm1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are all real, the following symmetry property can be deduced,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \gamma\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}=\xi_2\begin{pmatrix}
  {\mu_1}^* &amp; {\mu_2}^* &amp; {\gamma}^*\\
  \nu_1 &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \nu
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\xi_2=\xi_2(\mu_1, \mu_2, \gamma)=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetry group of the 3D oscillator Hamiltonian operator==
A three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the Hamiltonian
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2+z^2),&lt;/math&gt;
where the spring constant, the mass and Planck's constant have been absorbed into the definition of the variables, {{mvar|ħ}}={{mvar|m}}=1.

It is seen that this Hamiltonian is symmetric under coordinate transformations that preserve the value of &lt;math&gt;V=x^2+y^2+z^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, any operators in the group &lt;math&gt;SO(3)&lt;/math&gt; keep this Hamiltonian invariant.

More significantly, since the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, it further remains invariant under operation by elements of the much larger {{math|SU(3)}} group.

A symmetric (dyadic) tensor operator analogous to the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]] for the Kepler problem may be defined,
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}p_ip_j+\omega^2r_ir_j&lt;/math&gt;
which commutes with the Hamiltonian,
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A}_{ij},\hat{H}]=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Since it commutes with the Hamiltonian (its trace), it represents 6−1=5 constants of motion.

It has the following properties,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_j\hat{A}_{ij}\hat{L}_j=\sum_i\hat{L}_{i}\hat{A}_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_j\hat{A}_{ij}\hat{A}_{jk}=\hat{H}\hat{A}_{ik}+\frac{1}{4}\omega^2\{\hat{L}_i\hat{L}_k-\delta_{ik}\hat{L}^2+2[\hat{L}_i,\hat{L}_k]-2\hbar^2\delta_{ik}\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Tr[\hat{A}_{ij}]=\sum_i{\hat{A}_{ii}}=\hat{H}.&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from the tensorial trace of the operator&lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;, which is the Hamiltonian, the remaining 5 operators can be rearranged into their spherical component form as
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_0=\omega^{-1}(2\hat{A}_{33}-\hat{A}_{11}-\hat{A}_{22})&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_{\pm}=\mp\omega^{-1}(\hat{A}_{13}\pm i\hat{A}_{23})&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A'}_{\pm}=\omega^{-1}(\hat{A}_{11}-\hat{A}_{22}\pm 2i\hat{A}_{22})&lt;/math&gt;
Further, the angular momentum operators are written in spherical component form as
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}_3=\hat{L}_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}_{\pm}=(\hat{L}_1\pm i\hat{L}_2).&lt;/math&gt;

They obey the following commutation relations,
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{L}_{3},\hat{A}_{0}]=[\hat{A}_{0},\hat{A'}_{\pm}]=[\hat{A}_{\pm},\hat{A'}_{\pm}]=[\hat{L}_{\pm},\hat{A'}_{\pm}] =0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{L}_{\pm},\hat{L}_{\mp}]=-4[\hat{A}_{\pm},\hat{A}_{\mp}]=\frac{1}{2}[\hat{A'}_{\pm},\hat{A'}_{\mp}]=\pm2\hbar\hat{L}_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{L}_{\pm},\hat{A}_{\mp}]=\hbar\hat{A}_0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\pm[\hat{L}_{3},\hat{L}_{\pm}]=-\frac{2}{3}[\hat{A}_{0},\hat{A}_{\pm}]=[\hat{A}_{\mp},\hat{A'}_{\pm}]=\hbar\hat{L}_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\pm[\hat{L}_{3},\hat{A}_{\pm}]=-\frac{1}{6}[\hat{A}_{0},\hat{L}_{\pm}]=\frac{1}{4}[\hat{L}_{\mp},\hat{A'}_{\pm}]=\hbar\hat{A}_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\pm[\hat{L}_{3},\hat{A'}_{\pm}]=2[\hat{L}_{\pm},\hat{A}_{\pm}]=2\hbar\hat{A'}_{\pm}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eight operators (consisting of the 5 operators derived from the traceless symmetric tensor operator {{math|A&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the three independent components of the angular momentum vector) obey the same commutation relations as the infinitesimal generators of the {{math|SU(3)}} group, detailed above.

As such, the symmetry group of Hamiltonian for a linear isotropic 3D Harmonic oscillator is isomorphic to {{math|SU(3)}} group.
|}

More systematically, operators such as the [[Ladder operator]]s
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}\hat{a_i}=\hat{X_i}+i\hat{P_i}~~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~~\sqrt{2}\hat{a_i}^\dagger=\hat{X_i}+i\hat{P_i}&lt;/math&gt;
can be constructed which raise and lower the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator by 1.

The operators  {{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and  {{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; are not hermitian; but hermitian operators can be constructed from different combinations of them, 
:namely, &amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt;\hat{a_i}\hat{a_j}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;.
There are '''''nine such operators''''' for ''i,j''=1,2,3.

The nine hermitian operators formed by the bilinear forms {{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;{{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} are controlled by the fundamental commutators
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{a_i},\hat{a_j}^\dagger]=\delta_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\hat{a_i},\hat{a_j}]=[\hat{a_i}^\dagger,\hat{a_j}^\dagger]=0,&lt;/math&gt;
and seen to ''not'' commute among themselves. As a result, this complete set of operators don't share their eigenvectors in  common, and they cannot be diagonalized simultaneously. The group is thus non-Abelian and degeneracies may be present in the Hamiltonian, as indicated.

The Hamiltonian of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, when written in terms of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_i}=\hat{a_i}^\dagger \hat{a_i}&lt;/math&gt;  amounts to
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}=\omega\left[\frac{3}{2}+\hat{N_1}+\hat{N_2}+\hat{N_3}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
The Hamiltonian has 8-fold degeneracy. A successive application of  {{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and  {{math|a&amp;#770;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; on the left preserves the Hamiltonian invariant, since it increases {{math|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} by 1 and decrease {{math|N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}  by 1, thereby keeping the total
:&lt;math&gt;N=\sum{N_i}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; constant. (cf. [[quantum harmonic oscillator]])
{{see also|Jordan map}}

===The maximally commuting set of operators===
Since the operators belonging to the symmetry group of Hamiltonian do not always form an [[Abelian group]], a common eigenbasis cannot be found that diagonalizes all of them simultaneously. Instead, we take the maximally commuting set of operators from the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, and try to reduce the matrix representations of the group into irreducible representations.
{{see also|Complete set of commuting observables}}

===Hilbert space of two systems===
The Hilbert space of two particles is the '''tensor product''' of the two Hilbert spaces of the two individual particles,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{H}_1\otimes \mathbb{I}+\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{H}_2~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; are the Hilbert space of the first and second particles, respectively.

The operators in each of the Hilbert spaces have their own commutation relations, and an operator of one Hilbert space commutes with an operator from the other Hilbert space. Thus the symmetry group of the two particle Hamiltonian operator is the superset of the symmetry groups of the Hamiltonian operators of individual particles. If the individual Hilbert spaces are {{mvar|N}} dimensional, the combined Hilbert space is {{mvar|N}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dimensional.

===Clebsch–Gordan coefficient in this case===
The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is {{math|SU(3)}}. As a result, the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients can be found  by expanding the uncoupled basis vectors of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian into its coupled basis. The Clebsch–Gordan series is obtained by block-diagonalizing the Hamiltonian through the unitary transformation constructed from the eigenstates which diagonalizes the maximal set of commuting operators.

==Young tableaux==
{{Main article|Young tableau}}
A [[Young tableau]] (plural ''tableaux'') is a method for decomposing products of an SU(''N'') group representation into a sum of irreducible representations. It provides the dimension and symmetry types of the irreducible representations, which is known as the Clebsch–Gordan series. Each irreducible representation corresponds to a single-particle state and a product of more than one irreducible representation indicates a multiparticle state.

Since the particles are mostly indistinguishable in quantum mechanics, this approximately relates to several permutable particles.  The permutations of {{mvar|n}} identical particles constitute the [[Permutation group|symmetric group]] '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;. Every {{mvar|n}}-particle state of  '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; that is made up of single-particle states of the fundamental  {{mvar|N}}-dimensional SU(N) multiplet belongs to an irreducible SU(N) representation. Thus, it can be used to determine the Clebsch–Gordan series for any unitary group.&lt;ref name="Arfken"&gt;''Mathematical Methods for Physicists'' by George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber. Sixth edition- Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructing the states===
Any two particle wavefunction&lt;math&gt;\psi_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt;, where the indices 1,2 represents the state of particle 1 and 2, can be used to generate states of explicit symmetry using the symmetrizing and the anti-symmetrizing operators.&lt;ref name="Haywood"&gt;http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/Haywood/Group_Theory_Lectures/Lecture_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S_{12}}=\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{P_{12}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A_{12}}=\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{P_{12}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; are the operator that interchanges the particles (Exchange operator).

The following relation follows:&lt;ref name="Haywood" /&gt;-

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}P_{12}}=\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}S_{12}}=\mathbf{P_{12}}+\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{S_{12}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}A_{12}}=\mathbf{P_{12}}-\mathbf{I}=-\mathbf{A_{12}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}}\mathbf{S_{12}}\psi_{12}=+\mathbf{S_{12}}\psi_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

thus,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{12}}\mathbf{A_{12}}\psi_{12}=-\mathbf{A_{12}}\psi_{12}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Starting from a multipartice state, we can apply &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; repeatedly to construct states that are:&lt;ref name="Haywood" /&gt;-
# Symmetric with respect to all particles.
# Antisymmetric with respect to all particles.
# Mixed symmetries, i.e. symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to some particles.

===Constructing the tableaux===
Instead of using ''ψ'', in Young tableaux, we use square boxes (&lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt;) to denote particles and ''i'' to denote the state of the particles. [[File:Young tableaux 1.jpeg|thumb|350px|A sample Young tableau. The number inside the boxes represents the state of the particles]]

The complete set of &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; particles are denoted by arrangements of &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt;s, each with its own quantum number label (''i'').

The tableaux is formed by stacking boxes side by side by side and up-down such that the states symmetrised with respect to all particles are given ia a row and the states anti-symmetrised with respect to all particles lies in a single column. Following rules are followed while constructing the tableaux:&lt;ref name="Arfken" /&gt;
# A row must not be longer than the one before it.
# The quantum labels (numbers in the &lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt;) should not decrease while going left to right in a row.
# The quantum labels must strictly increase while going down in a column.

===Case for ''N'' = 3===
For ''N''=3 that is in the case of SU(3), the following situation arises. In SU(3) there are three labels, they are generally designated by (u,d,s) corresponding to up, down and strange quarks which follows the SU(3) algebra. They can also be designated generically as (1,2,3). For two particle system, we have the following six symmetry states:

:{|
|- style="vertical-align:top"
|&lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
1 &amp; 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
uu
}
&lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
1 &amp; 2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (ud+du)
}
&lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
1 &amp; 3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (us+su)
}
&lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
2 &amp; 2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
dd
}
&lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
2 &amp; 3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (ds+sd)
}
&lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
3 &amp; 3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
ss
}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and the following three antisymmetric states:

:&lt;math&gt;
{
\begin{array}{|c|}
\hline
1 \\ 
\hline
2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (ud-du)
}
\qquad
{
\begin{array}{|c|}
\hline
1 \\ 
\hline
3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (us-su)
}
\qquad
{
\begin{array}{|c|}
\hline
2 \\ 
\hline
3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\atop
\frac 1 \sqrt 2 (ds-sd)
}
&lt;/math&gt;
The 1-column, 3-row tableau is the singlet, and so all tableaux of nontrivial irreps of SU(3) cannot have more than two rows. The representation {{math|D(p,q)}} has
{{math|p+q}}  boxes on the top row and {{mvar|q}} boxes on the second row.

===Clebsch–Gordan series from the tableaux===
Clebsch–Gordan series is the expansion of the direct product of two irreducible representation into direct sum of irreducible representations.
&lt;math&gt;D(p_1,q_1)\otimes D(p_2,q_2)=\sum_{P,Q}\oplus D(P,Q)&lt;/math&gt;. This can be easily found out from the Young tableaux.
:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!'''Procedure to obtain the Clebsch–Gordan series from Young tableaux:'''
|-
|
The following steps are followed to construct the Clebsch–Gordan series from the Young tableaux:&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.unm.edu/Courses/Finley/p467/handouts/YoungTableauxSubs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107170523/http://physics.unm.edu/Courses/Finley/p467/handouts/YoungTableauxSubs.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Write down the two Young diagrams for the two irreps under consideration, such as in the following example. In the second figure insert a series of the letter a in the first row, the letter b in the second row, the letter c in the third row, etc. in order to keep track of them once they are included in the various resultant diagrams:
[[File:Young tableaux 11.jpeg|center]]
* Take the first box containing an '''a''' and appends it to the first Young diagram in all possible ways that follow the rules for creation of a Young diagram:
[[File:Young tableaux 12.jpeg|center]]
* Then take the next box containing an '''a''' and do the same thing with it, except that we are not allowed to put two '''a'''{{'}}s together in the same column.
[[File:Young tableaux 13.jpeg|center]]
The last diagram in the curly bracket contains two '''a''' in the same column thus the diagram must be deleted. Thereby giving:
[[File:Young tableaux 14.jpeg|center]]
* Append the last box to the diagram in curly bracket in all possible ways resulting in:
[[File:Young tableaux 15.jpeg|center]]
* In each rows while counting from right to left, if at any point the number of a particular alphabet encountered be more than the number of the previous alphabet, then the diagram must be deleted. Here the first and the third diagram should be deleted, resulting in:

===Example of Clebsch–Gordan series for SU(3)===
The tensor product of a triplet with an octet reducing to a deciquintuplet ('''15'''), an anti-sextet, and a triplet
: &lt;math&gt;D(1,0)\otimes D(1,1)= D(2,1)\oplus D(0,2) \oplus D(1,0)&lt;/math&gt;
appears diagrammatically as&lt;ref name="Finley" /&gt;-

[[File:Young tableaux 18.jpeg|center]]
a total of 24 states.
Using the same procedure, any direct product representation is easily reduced.

Discovering communities in a network, known as community detection/discovery, is a fundamental problem in [[network science]], which attracted much attention in the past several decades. In recent years, with the tremendous studies on [[big data]], there is another related but different problem, called '''community search''', which aims to find the most likely community that contains the query node, has attracted great attention from both academic and industry areas. It is a query-dependent variant of the community detection problem.
In recent years, there has been many interestings studies focusing on this novel research problem.&lt;ref name="KDD2010"&gt;Mauro Sozio and Aristides Gionis. 2010.

== Main advantages ==
As pointed by the first work on community search&lt;ref name="KDD2010" /&gt; published in SIGKDD'2010, many existing community detection/discovery methods consider the ''static'' community detection problem, where the graph needs to be partitioned a-priori with no reference to query nodes. While community search often focuses the most-likely communitie containing the query vertex. The main advantages of community search over community detection/discovery are listed as below:

 '''(1) More personalization.'''&lt;ref name="SIGMOD2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vldbFang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vldbFang2017" /&gt; Community detection/discovery often uses the same global criterion to decide whether a subgraph qualifies as a community. In other words, the criterion is fixed and predetermined. But in reality, communities for different vertices may have very different characteristics. Moreover, community search allows the query users to specify more personalized query conditions. In addition, the personalized query conditions enable the communities to be interpreted easily.

For example, a recent work,&lt;ref name="vldbFang" /&gt; which focuses on attributed graphs, where nodes are often associated with some attributes like keyword, and tries to find the communities, called attributed communities, which exhibit both strong structure and keyword cohesiveness. The query users are allowed to specify a query node and some other query conditions: (1) a value, k, the minimum degree for the expected communities; and (2) a set of keywords, which control the semantic of the expected communities. The communities returned can be easily interpreted by the keywords shared by all the community members. More details can be fround from.&lt;ref name="vldbFangHomepage"/&gt;

 '''(2) More efficient'''. With the striking booming of social networks in recent years, there are many real big graphs. For example, the numbers of users in Facebook and Twitter are often billions-scale. As community detection/discovery often finds all the communities from an entire social network, this can be very costly and also time-consuming. In contrast, community search often works on a sub-graph, which is much efficient. Moreover, detecting all the communities from an entire social network is often unnecessary. For real applications like recommendation and [[social media]] markets, people often focus on some communities that they are really interested in, rather than all the communities.

Some recent studies&lt;ref name="SIGMOD2014-cui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vldbFang" /&gt; have shown that, for million-scale graphs, community search often takes less than 1 second to find a well-defined community, which is generally much faster than many existing community detection/discovery methods. This also implies that, community search is more suitable for finding communities from big graphs.

 '''(3) Ease support for dynamically evolving graphs.'''&lt;ref name="SIGMOD2013" /&gt; Almost all the graphs in real life are often evolving over time.  Since community detection often uses the same global criterion to find communities, they are not very sensitive of the updates of nodes and edges in graphs. On the contrary, community search can handle this easily, as it usually works on a sub-graph.

== Measures for community search ==
Community search often uses some well-defined, fundamental measures of graphs. The commonly used measures are
minimum degree,&lt;ref name="KDD2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIGMOD2014-cui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VLDB2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DMKD2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vldbFang" /&gt; k-truss,&lt;ref name="SIGMOMD2014-huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vldbHuang" /&gt; k-edge-connected 
&lt;ref name="SIGMOD2015"&gt;Lijun Chang, Xuemin Lin, Lu Qin, Jeffrey Xu Yu, and Wenjie Zhang. "Index-based optimal algorithms for computing Steiner components with maximum connectivity." In Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 459-474. ACM, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, the minimum degree measure is also used for defining the k-core of a graph.
Among these measures, the minimum degree measure is the most popular one, and has been used in many recent studies.

In [[mathematics]], a '''diffeomorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] of [[smooth manifold]]s. It is an [[invertible function]] that [[Map (mathematics)|map]]s one [[differentiable manifold]] to another such that both the function and its inverse are [[Smooth function|smooth]].

[[File:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The image of a rectangular grid on a square under a diffeomorphism from the square onto itself.]]

== Definition ==

Given two [[manifolds]] ''M'' and ''N'', a [[Differentiable manifold#Differentiable functions|differentiable]] map ''f''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&amp;nbsp;→ ''N'' is called a '''diffeomorphism''' if it is a [[bijection]] and its inverse ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;: ''N''&amp;nbsp;→ ''M'' is differentiable as well. If these functions are ''r'' times continuously differentiable, ''f'' is called a '''''C&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''-diffeomorphism'''.

Two manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' are '''diffeomorphic''' (symbol usually being ≃) if there is a diffeomorphism ''f'' from ''M'' to ''N''. They are '''''C&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' diffeomorphic''' if there is an ''r'' times continuously differentiable bijective map between them whose inverse is also ''r'' times continuously differentiable.

== Diffeomorphisms of subsets of manifolds ==

Given a subset ''X'' of a manifold ''M'' and a subset ''Y'' of a manifold ''N'', a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;: ''X''&amp;nbsp;→ ''Y'' is said to be smooth if for all ''p'' in ''X'' there is a neighborhood ''U''&amp;nbsp;⊂ ''M'' of ''p'' and a smooth function ''g''&amp;nbsp;: ''U''&amp;nbsp;→ ''N'' such that the restrictions agree &lt;math&gt;g_{|U \cap X} = f_{|U \cap X}&lt;/math&gt; (note that ''g'' is an extension of ''f''). ''f'' is said to be a diffeomorphism if it is bijective, smooth and its inverse is smooth.

== Local description ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}

; Model example
If ''U'', ''V'' are connected open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''V'' is [[simply connected]], a [[Derivative|differentiable]] map ''f''&amp;nbsp;: ''U''&amp;nbsp;→ ''V'' is a '''diffeomorphism''' if it is [[Proper map|proper]] and if the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Bijection|bijective]] at each point ''x'' in ''U''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; First remark
It is essential for ''V'' to be [[simply connected]] for the function ''f'' to be globally invertible (under the sole condition that its derivative be a bijective map at each point). For example, consider the "realification" of the complex square function 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
f : \mathbf{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\} \to \mathbf{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\} \\
(x,y)\mapsto(x^2-y^2,2xy)
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 
Then ''f'' is surjective and it satisfies 
: &lt;math&gt;\det Df_x=4(x^2+y^2)\neq0&lt;/math&gt; 
Thus, though ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is bijective at each point, ''f'' is not invertible because it fails to be injective (e.g. ''f''(1,0)&amp;nbsp;= (1,0)&amp;nbsp;= ''f''(−1,0).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Second remark
Since the differential at a point (for a differentiable function) 
: &lt;math&gt;Df_x : T_xU \to T_{f(x)}V&lt;/math&gt; 
is a [[linear map]], it has a well-defined inverse if and only if ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a bijection. The matrix representation of ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''&amp;nbsp;× ''n'' matrix of first-order partial derivatives whose entry in the ''i''-th row and ''j''-th column is &lt;math&gt;\partial f_i / \partial x_j&lt;/math&gt;. This so-called [[Jacobian matrix]] is often used for explicit computations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Third remark
Diffeomorphisms are necessarily between manifolds of the same [[dimension]]. Imagine ''f'' going from dimension ''n'' to dimension ''k''. If ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''k'' then ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' could never be surjective; and if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''k'' then ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' could never be injective. In both cases, therefore, ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' fails to be a bijection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Fourth remark
If ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a bijection at ''x'' then ''f'' is said to be a [[local diffeomorphism]] (since, by continuity, ''Df&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' will also be bijective for all ''y'' sufficiently close to ''x'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Fifth remark
Given a smooth map from dimension ''n'' to dimension ''k'', if ''Df'' (or, locally, ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') is surjective, ''f'' is said to be a [[Submersion (mathematics)|submersion]] (or, locally, a "local submersion"); and if ''Df'' (or, locally, ''Df&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') is injective, ''f'' is said to be an [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] (or, locally, a "local immersion").
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Sixth remark
A differentiable bijection is ''not'' necessarily a diffeomorphism. ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, is not a diffeomorphism from '''R''' to itself because its derivative vanishes at 0 (and hence its inverse is not differentiable at 0). This is an example of a [[homeomorphism]] that is not a diffeomorphism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Seventh remark
When ''f'' is a map between ''differentiable'' manifolds, a diffeomorphic ''f'' is a stronger condition than a homeomorphic ''f''. For a diffeomorphism, ''f'' and its inverse need to be [[Differentiable manifold#Differentiable functions|differentiable]]; for a homeomorphism, ''f'' and its inverse need only be [[Continuous function|continuous]]. Every diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism, but not every homeomorphism is a diffeomorphism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''f''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&amp;nbsp;→ ''N'' is called a '''diffeomorphism''' if, in [[Manifold#Differentiable manifolds|coordinate charts]], it satisfies the definition above. More precisely: Pick any cover of ''M'' by compatible [[Manifold#Differentiable manifolds|coordinate charts]] and do the same for ''N''. Let φ and ψ be charts on, respectively, ''M'' and ''N'', with ''U'' and ''V'' as, respectively, the images of φ and ψ. The map ψ''f''φ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;: ''U''&amp;nbsp;→ ''V'' is then a diffeomorphism as in the definition above, whenever ''f''(φ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(U)) ⊂  ψ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(V).
&lt;!--Huh?: One has to check that for every pair of charts φ, ψ of two given [[Manifold#Differentiable manifolds|atlases]], but once checked, it will be true for any other compatible chart. Again we see that dimensions have to agree.--&gt;

== Examples ==

Since any manifold can be locally parametrised, we can consider some explicit maps from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

* Let 
:: &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \left (x^2 + y^3, x^2 - y^3 \right ).&lt;/math&gt; 
: We can calculate the Jacobian matrix:
:: &lt;math&gt; J_f = \begin{pmatrix} 2x &amp; 3y^2 \\ 2x &amp; -3y^2 \end{pmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
: The Jacobian matrix has zero determinant if, and only if ''xy'' = 0. We see that ''f'' could only be a diffeomorphism away from the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis. However, ''f'' is not bijective since ''f(x,y)=f(-x,y)'', and thus it cannot be a diffeomorphism.

* Let 
:: &lt;math&gt;g(x,y) = \left (a_0 + a_{1,0}x + a_{0,1}y + \cdots, \ b_0 + b_{1,0}x + b_{0,1}y + \cdots \right )&lt;/math&gt; 
: where the &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary real numbers, and the omitted terms are of degree at least two in ''x'' and ''y''. We can calculate the Jacobian matrix at '''0''':
:: &lt;math&gt; J_g(0,0) = \begin{pmatrix} a_{1,0} &amp; a_{0,1} \\ b_{1,0} &amp; b_{0,1} \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
: We see that ''g'' is a local diffeomorphism at '''0''' if, and only if, 
:: &lt;math&gt;a_{1,0}b_{0,1} - a_{0,1}b_{1,0} \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
: i.e. the linear terms in the components of ''g'' are linearly independent as polynomials.

* Let 
:: &lt;math&gt;h(x,y) = \left (\sin(x^2 + y^2), \cos(x^2 + y^2) \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
: We can calculate the Jacobian matrix:
:: &lt;math&gt; J_h = \begin{pmatrix} 2x\cos(x^2 + y^2) &amp; 2y\cos(x^2 + y^2) \\ -2x\sin(x^2+y^2) &amp; -2y\sin(x^2 + y^2) \end{pmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
: The Jacobian matrix has zero determinant everywhere! In fact we see that the image of ''h'' is the unit circle.

===Surface deformations===
In [[mechanics]], a stress-induced transformation is called a [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] and may be described by a diffeomorphism.
A diffeomorphism ''f'' : ''U'' → ''V'' between two [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s ''U'' and ''V'' has a Jacobian matrix ''Df'' that is an [[invertible matrix]]. In fact, it is required that for ''p'' in ''U'', there is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of ''p'' in which the Jacobian ''Df'' stays [[Invertible matrix|non-singular]]. Since the Jacobian is a 2 × 2 real matrix, Df can be read as [[2 × 2 real matrices#2 × 2 real matrices as complex numbers|one of three types of complex number]]: [[complex number|ordinary complex]], [[split complex number]], or [[dual number]]. Suppose that in a chart of the surface, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = (u,v).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[total differential]] of ''u'' is
:&lt;math&gt;du = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} dx +  \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} dy , &lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for ''v''.
Then the image &lt;math&gt; (du, dv) = (dx, dy) Df &lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear transformation]], fixing the origin, and expressible as the action of a complex number of a particular type. When (''dx, dy'' ) is also interpreted as that type of complex number, the action is of complex multiplication in the appropriate complex number plane. As such, there is a type of angle ([[angle|Euclidean]], [[hyperbolic angle|hyperbolic]], or [[slope]]) that is preserved in such a multiplication. Due to ''Df'' being invertible, the type of complex number is uniform over the surface. Consequently, a surface deformation or diffeomorphism of surfaces has the '''conformal property''' of preserving (the appropriate type of) angles.

== Diffeomorphism group ==

Let ''M'' be a differentiable manifold that is [[second-countable]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. The '''diffeomorphism group''' of ''M'' is the group of all ''C&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' diffeomorphisms of ''M'' to itself, denoted by Diff&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') or, when ''r'' is understood, Diff(''M''). This is a "large" group, in the sense that&amp;nbsp;– provided ''M'' is not zero-dimensional&amp;nbsp;– it is not locally compact.

===Topology===
The diffeomorphism group has two natural topologies: ''weak'' and ''strong'' {{harv|Hirsch|1997}}. When the manifold is compact, these two topologies agree.  The weak topology is always metrizable.  When the manifold is not compact, the strong topology captures the behavior of functions "at infinity" and is not metrizable.  It is, however, still [[Baire space|Baire]].

Fixing a [[Riemannian metric]] on ''M'', the weak topology is the topology induced by the family of metrics
: &lt;math&gt;d_K(f,g) = \sup\nolimits_{x\in K} d(f(x),g(x)) + \sum\nolimits_{1\le p\le r} \sup\nolimits_{x\in K} \left \|D^pf(x) - D^pg(x) \right \|&lt;/math&gt;
as ''K'' varies over compact subsets of ''M''.  Indeed, since ''M'' is σ-compact, there is a sequence of compact subsets ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; whose union is ''M''.  Then:
: &lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = \sum\nolimits_n 2^{-n}\frac{d_{K_n}(f,g)}{1+d_{K_n}(f,g)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The diffeomorphism group equipped with its weak topology is locally homeomorphic to the space of ''C&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' vector fields {{harv|Leslie|1967}}. Over a compact subset of ''M'', this follows by fixing a Riemannian metric on ''M'' and using the [[Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] for that metric. If ''r'' is finite and the manifold is compact, the space of vector fields is a [[Banach space]]. Moreover, the transition maps from one chart of this atlas to another are smooth, making the diffeomorphism group into a [[Banach manifold]] with smooth right translations; left translations and inversion are only continuous. If ''r''&amp;nbsp;= ∞,  the space of vector fields is a [[Fréchet space]]. Moreover, the transition maps are smooth, making the diffeomorphism group into a [[Fréchet manifold]] and even into a [[Convenient vector space#Regular Lie groups|regular Fréchet Lie group]]. If the manifold is σ-compact and not compact the full diffeomorphism group is not locally contractible for any of the two topologies. One has to restrict the group by controlling the deviation from the identity near infinity to obtain a diffeomorphism group which is a manifold; see {{harv|Michor|Mumford|2013}}.

===Lie algebra===
The [[Lie algebra]] of the diffeomorphism group of ''M'' consists of all [[vector field]]s on ''M'' equipped with the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]].  Somewhat formally, this is seen by making a small change to the coordinate x at each point in space:
: &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu} \to x^{\mu} + \varepsilon h^{\mu}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
so the infinitesimal generators are the vector fields
: &lt;math&gt; L_{h} = h^{\mu}(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===
* When ''M''&amp;nbsp;= ''G'' is a [[Lie group]], there is a natural inclusion of ''G'' in its own diffeomorphism group via left-translation. Let Diff(''G'') denote the diffeomorphism group of ''G'', then there is a splitting Diff(''G'')&amp;nbsp;≃ ''G''&amp;nbsp;× Diff(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''e''), where Diff(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''e'') is the subgroup of Diff(''G'') that fixes the identity element of the group.
* The diffeomorphism group of Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of two components, consisting of the orientation preserving and orientation reversing diffeomorphisms. In fact, the [[general linear group]] is a [[deformation retract]] of subgroup Diff('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;0) of diffeomorphisms fixing the origin under the map ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;{{mapsto}} ''f''(''tx'')/''t'', ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp; (0,1].  In particular, the general linear group is also a deformation retract of the full diffeomorphism group.
* For a finite set of points, the diffeomorphism group is simply the symmetric group. Similarly, if ''M'' is any manifold there is a group extension 0&amp;nbsp;→ Diff&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')&amp;nbsp;→ Diff(''M'')&amp;nbsp;→ Σ(π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')). Here Diff&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')is the subgroup of Diff(''M'') that preserves all the components of ''M'', and Σ(π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')) is the permutation group of the set π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') (the components of ''M''). Moreover, the image of the map Diff(''M'')&amp;nbsp;→ Σ(π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')) is the bijections of π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') that preserve diffeomorphism classes.

===Transitivity===
For a connected manifold ''M'', the diffeomorphism group acts transitively on ''M''. More generally, the diffeomorphism group acts transitively on the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;M''.  If ''M'' is at least two-dimensional, the diffeomorphism group acts transitively on the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;M'' and the action on ''M'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|multiply transitive]] {{harv|Banyaga|1997|p=29}}.

===Extensions of diffeomorphisms===
In 1926, [[Tibor Radó]] asked whether the [[Poisson integral|harmonic extension]] of any homeomorphism or diffeomorphism of the [[unit circle]] to the [[unit disc]] yields a diffeomorphism on the open disc. An elegant proof was provided shortly afterwards by [[Hellmuth Kneser]]. In 1945, [[Gustave Choquet]], apparently unaware of this result, produced a completely different proof.

The (orientation-preserving) diffeomorphism group of the circle is pathwise connected. This can be seen by noting that any such diffeomorphism can be lifted to a diffeomorphism ''f'' of the reals satisfying [''f''(''x''+1)&amp;nbsp;= ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+ 1]; this space is convex and hence path-connected. A smooth, eventually constant path to the identity gives a second more elementary way of extending a diffeomorphism from the circle to the open unit disc (a special case of the [[Alexander trick]]). Moreover, the diffeomorphism group of the circle has the homotopy-type of the [[orthogonal group]] O(2).

The corresponding extension problem for diffeomorphisms of higher-dimensional spheres '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; was much studied in the 1950s and 1960s, with notable contributions from [[René Thom]], [[John Milnor]] and [[Stephen Smale]]. An obstruction to such extensions is given by the finite [[abelian group]] Γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the "[[Exotic sphere#Twisted spheres|group of twisted spheres]]", defined as the [[Quotient group|quotient]] of the abelian [[component group]] of the diffeomorphism group by the subgroup of classes extending to diffeomorphisms of the ball ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Connectedness===
For manifolds, the diffeomorphism group is usually not connected. Its component group is called the [[mapping class group]]. In dimension 2 (i.e. [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s), the mapping class group is a [[finitely presented group]] generated by [[Dehn twist]]s ([[Max Dehn|Dehn]], [[W. B. R. Lickorish|Lickorish]], [[Allen Hatcher|Hatcher]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Max Dehn]] and [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]] showed that it can be identified with the [[outer automorphism group]] of the [[fundamental group]] of the surface.

[[William Thurston]] refined this analysis by [[Nielsen-Thurston classification|classifying elements of the mapping class group]] into three types: those equivalent to a [[Periodic function#Periodic mapping|periodic]] diffeomorphism; those equivalent to a diffeomorphism leaving a simple closed curve invariant; and those equivalent to [[Pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms]]. In the case of the [[torus]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;× '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the mapping class group is simply the [[modular group]] SL(2,&amp;nbsp;'''Z''') and the classification becomes classical in terms of [[Möbius transformation#Elliptic transforms|elliptic]], [[Möbius transformation#Parabolic transforms|parabolic]] and [[Möbius transformation#Hyperbolic transforms|hyperbolic]] matrices. Thurston accomplished his classification by observing that the mapping class group acted naturally on a [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of [[Teichmüller space]]; as this enlarged space was homeomorphic to a closed ball, the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] became applicable. Smale conjectured that if ''M'' is an oriented smooth closed manifold, the [[identity component]] of the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms is simple. This had first been proved for a product of circles by [[Michel Herman]]; it was proved in full generality by Thurston.

===Homotopy types===
* The diffeomorphism group of '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has the homotopy-type of the subgroup O(3). This was proven by Steve Smale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smale | first1 =  | year = 1959 | title = Diffeomorphisms of the 2-sphere | url = | journal = Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 621–626 | doi=10.1090/s0002-9939-1959-0112149-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The diffeomorphism group of the torus has the homotopy-type of its linear automorphisms: '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;× '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;× GL(2, '''Z''').
* The diffeomorphism groups of orientable surfaces of genus ''g''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 1 have the homotopy-type of their mapping class groups (i.e. the components are contractible).
* The homotopy-type of the diffeomorphism groups of 3-manifolds are fairly well understood via the work of Ivanov, Hatcher, Gabai and Rubinstein, although there are a few outstanding open cases (primarily 3-manifolds with finite fundamental groups).
* The homotopy-type of diffeomorphism groups of ''n''-manifolds for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 3 are poorly understood. For example, it is an open problem whether or not Diff('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) has more than two components. Via Milnor, Kahn and Antonelli, however, it is known that provided ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 6, Diff('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) does not have the homotopy-type of a finite CW-complex.

== Homeomorphism and diffeomorphism ==

Unlike non-diffeomorphic homeomorphisms, it is relatively difficult to find a pair of [[homeomorphic]] manifolds that are not diffeomorphic. In dimensions 1, 2, 3, any pair of homeomorphic smooth manifolds are diffeomorphic. In dimension 4 or greater, examples of homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic pairs have been found. The first such example was constructed by [[John Milnor]] in dimension 7. He constructed a smooth 7-dimensional manifold (called now [[Milnor's sphere]]) that is homeomorphic to the standard 7-sphere but not diffeomorphic to it. There are, in fact, 28 oriented diffeomorphism classes of manifolds homeomorphic to the 7-sphere (each of them is the total space of a [[fiber bundle]] over the 4-sphere with the [[3-sphere]] as the fiber).

More unusual phenomena occur for [[4-manifold]]s. In the early 1980s, a combination of results due to [[Simon Donaldson]] and [[Michael Freedman]] led to the discovery of [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;s]]: there are uncountably many pairwise non-diffeomorphic open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; each of which is homeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and also  there are  uncountably many pairwise non-diffeomorphic differentiable manifolds homeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; that do not embed smoothly in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[complex analysis]], the '''general difference polynomials''' are a [[polynomial sequence]], a certain subclass of the [[Sheffer polynomials]], which include the [[Newton polynomial]]s, '''Selberg's polynomials''', and the '''Stirling interpolation polynomials''' as special cases. 

==Definition==
The general difference polynomial sequence is given by

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(z)=\frac{z}{n} {{z-\beta n -1} \choose {n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{z \choose n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binomial coefficient]].  For &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, the generated polynomials &lt;math&gt;p_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; are the Newton polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(z)= {z \choose n} = \frac{z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The case of &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt; generates Selberg's polynomials, and the case of &lt;math&gt;\beta=-1/2&lt;/math&gt; generates Stirling's interpolation polynomials.

==Moving differences==
Given an [[analytic function]] &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt;, define the '''moving difference''' of ''f'' as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_n(f) = \Delta^n f (\beta n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[forward difference operator]]. Then, provided that ''f'' obeys certain summability conditions, then it may be represented in terms of these polynomials as

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(z) \mathcal{L}_n(f).&lt;/math&gt;

The conditions for summability (that is, convergence) for this sequence is a fairly complex topic; in general, one may say that a necessary condition is that the analytic function be of less than [[exponential type]]. Summability conditions are discussed in detail in Boas &amp; Buck.

==Generating function==
The [[generating function]] for the general difference polynomials is given by

:&lt;math&gt;e^{zt}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(z) 
\left[\left(e^t-1\right)e^{\beta t}\right]^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This generating function can be brought into the form of the [[generalized Appell representation]] 

:&lt;math&gt;K(z,w) = A(w)\Psi(zg(w)) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(z) w^n&lt;/math&gt;

by setting &lt;math&gt;A(w)=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x)=e^x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(w)=t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w=(e^t-1)e^{\beta t}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[discrete mathematics]], '''dominance order''' (synonyms: '''dominance ordering''', '''majorization order''', '''natural ordering''') is a [[partial order]] on the set of [[partition (number theory)|partitions]] of a positive integer ''n'' that plays an important role in [[algebraic combinatorics]] and [[representation theory]], especially in the context of [[symmetric function]]s and [[representation theory of the symmetric group]].

== Definition ==

If ''p'' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;) and ''q'' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;) are partitions of ''n'', with the parts arranged in the weakly decreasing order, then ''p'' precedes ''q'' in the dominance order if for any ''k'' ≥ 1, the sum of the ''k'' largest parts of ''p'' is less than or equal to the sum of the ''k'' largest parts of ''q'':

: &lt;math&gt; p\trianglelefteq q \text{ if and only if } p_1+\cdots+p_k \leq q_1+\cdots+q_k \text{ for all } k\geq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In this definition, partitions are extended by appending zero parts at the end as necessary.

== Properties of the dominance ordering ==

* Among the partitions of ''n'', (1,&amp;hellip;,1) is the smallest and (n) is the largest.
* The dominance ordering implies [[lexicographical ordering]], i.e. if ''p'' dominates ''q'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''q'', then for the smallest ''i'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; one has ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The poset of partitions of ''n'' is [[linearly ordered]] (and is equivalent to lexicographical ordering) if and only if ''n'' ≤ 5. It is [[graded poset|graded]] if and only if ''n'' ≤ 6. See image at right for an example. 
* A partition ''p'' [[Covering relation|cover]]s a partition ''q'' if and only if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + 1, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; 1, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''j'' &amp;ne; ''i'',''k'' and either (1) ''k'' = ''i'' + 1 or (2) ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (Brylawski, Prop. 2.3). Starting from the [[Young diagram]] of ''q'',  the Young diagram of ''p'' is obtained from it by first removing the last box of row ''k'' and then appending it either to the end of the immediately preceding row ''k'' &amp;minus; 1, or to the end of row ''i'' &lt; ''k'' if the rows ''i'' through ''k'' of the Young diagram of ''q'' all have the same length.
* Every partition ''p'' has a [[Partition (number theory)#Ferrers diagram|conjugate]] (or dual) partition ''p''&amp;prime;, whose Young diagram is the transpose of the Young diagram of ''p''. This operation reverses the dominance ordering:
:: &lt;math&gt;p\trianglelefteq q &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;q^{\prime}\trianglelefteq p^{\prime}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The dominance ordering determines the inclusions between the [[Zariski closure]]s of the conjugacy classes of [[nilpotent orbit#Poset structure|nilpotent matrices]].

== Lattice structure ==

Partitions of ''n'' form a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] under the dominance ordering, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the operation of conjugation is an [[Antihomomorphism|antiautomorphism]] of this lattice. To explicitly describe the lattice operations, for each partition ''p'' consider the '''associated (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple''':

: &lt;math&gt; \hat{p}=(0, p_1, p_1+p_2, \ldots, p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n). &lt;/math&gt;

The partition ''p'' can be recovered from its associated (''n''+1)-tuple by applying the step 1 [[finite difference|difference]], &lt;math&gt;p_i=\hat{p}_i-\hat{p}_{i-1}.&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, the (''n''+1)-tuples associated to partitions of ''n'' are characterized among all integer sequences of length ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 by the following three properties:

* Nondecreasing, &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_i\leq \hat{p}_{i+1};&lt;/math&gt;
* Concave, &lt;math&gt;2\hat{p}_i\geq \hat{p}_{i-1}+\hat{p}_{i+1};&lt;/math&gt;
* The initial term is 0 and the final term is ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_0=0, \hat{p}_n=n.&lt;/math&gt;

By the definition of the dominance ordering, partition ''p'' precedes partition ''q'' if and only if the associated (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple of ''p'' is term-by-term less than or equal to the associated (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple of ''q''. If ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' are partitions then &lt;math&gt;r\trianglelefteq p, r\trianglelefteq q&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\leq\hat{p}, \hat{r}\leq\hat{q}.&lt;/math&gt; The componentwise minimum of two nondecreasing concave integer sequences is also nondecreasing and concave. Therefore, for any two partitions of ''n'', ''p'' and ''q'', their [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] is the partition of ''n'' whose associated (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple has components &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{min}(\hat{p}_i,\hat{q}_i).&lt;/math&gt; The natural idea to use a similar formula for the [[join (mathematics)|join]] ''fails'', because the componentwise maximum of two concave sequences need not be concave. For example, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, the partitions [3,1,1,1] and [2,2,2] have associated sequences (0,3,4,5,6,6,6) and (0,2,4,6,6,6,6), whose componentwise maximum (0,3,4,6,6,6,6) does not correspond to any partition. To show that any two partitions of ''n'' have a join, one uses the conjugation antiautomorphism: the join of ''p'' and ''q'' is the conjugate partition of the meet of ''p''&amp;prime; and ''q''&amp;prime;:

: &lt;math&gt; p\lor q=(p^{\prime} \land q^{\prime})^{\prime}. &lt;/math&gt;

For the two partitions ''p'' and ''q'' in the preceding example, their conjugate partitions are [4,1,1] and [3,3] with meet [3,2,1], which is self-conjugate; therefore, the join of ''p'' and ''q'' is [3,2,1].

Thomas Brylawski has determined many invariants of the lattice ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, such as the minimal height and the maximal covering number, and classified the [[Partially ordered set#Interval|interval]]s of small length. While ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not [[distributive lattice|distributive]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;7, it shares some properties with distributive lattices: for example, its [[Möbius function (combinatorics)|Möbius function]] takes on only values 0, 1, &amp;minus;1.

== Generalizations ==
&lt;!-- These utility of these generalizations should be explained, or the section removed fro lack of notability --&gt;
[[File:Tableaux dominance.svg|thumb|right|200px| The dominance order on Young tableaux for the partition&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2]]
Partitions of ''n'' can be graphically represented by [[Young diagram]]s on ''n'' boxes.
Standard [[Young tableaux]] are certain ways to fill Young diagrams with numbers, and a partial order on them (sometimes called the ''dominance order on Young tableaux'') can be defined in terms of the dominance order on the Young diagrams. For a Young tableau ''T'' to dominate another Young tableau ''S'', the shape of ''T'' must dominate that of ''S'' as a partition, and moreover the same must hold whenever ''T'' and ''S'' are first truncated to their sub-tableaux containing entries up to a given value ''k'', for each choice of ''k''.

Similarly, there is a dominance order on the set of standard Young bitableaux, which plays a role in the theory of ''standard monomials''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">In [[commutative algebra]], a '''quasi-excellent ring''' is a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian commutative ring]] that behaves well with respect to the operation of completion, and is called an '''excellent ring''' if it is also [[universally catenary]]. Excellent rings are one answer to the problem of finding a natural class of "well-behaved" rings containing most of the rings that occur in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. At one time it seemed that the class of Noetherian rings might be an answer to this problem, but Nagata and others found several strange counterexamples showing that in general Noetherian rings need not be well behaved: for example, a normal Noetherian local ring need not be [[analytically normal]].  The class of excellent rings was defined by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (1965) as a candidate for such a class of well-behaved rings. Quasi-excellent rings are conjectured to be the base rings for which the problem of [[resolution of singularities]] can be solved; {{harvs|txt|last=Hironaka|first=Heisuke|authorlink=Heisuke Hironaka |year=1964}} showed this in characteristic 0, but the positive characteristic case is (as of 2016) still a major open problem. Essentially all Noetherian rings that occur naturally in algebraic geometry or number theory are excellent; in fact it is quite hard to construct examples of Noetherian rings that are not excellent.

==Definitions==
*A ring ''R'' containing a field ''k'' is called '''[[geometrically regular]]''' over ''k'' if for any finite extension ''K'' of ''k'' the ring ''R''⊗&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''K'' is [[regular ring|regular]]. 
*A homomorphism of rings from ''R'' to ''S'' is called '''regular''' if it is flat and for every ''p''∈Spec(''R'') the fiber ''S''⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''k''(''p'') is geometrically regular over the residue field ''k''(''p'') of ''p''. 
*A ring ''R'' is called a '''[[G-ring]]''' (or '''Grothendieck ring''') if it is Noetherian and its formal fibers  are geometrically regular; this means that for any ''p''∈Spec(''R''), the map from the local ring ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; to its completion is regular in the sense above. 
*A ring ''R'' is called a '''[[J-2 ring]]''' if for every finitely generated ''R''-algebra ''S'', the singular points of Spec(''S'') form a closed subset.
*A ring ''R'' is called '''quasi-excellent''' if it is a  ''G''-ring and a J-2 ring.
*A ring is called '''excellent''' if it is quasi-excellent and [[universally catenary]]. In practice almost all Noetherian rings are universally catenary, so there is little difference between excellent and quasi-excellent rings.
*A scheme is called excellent or quasi-excellent if it has a cover by open affine subschemes with the same property, which implies that every open affine subscheme has this property.

==Examples==

===Excellent rings===
Most naturally occurring commutative rings in number theory or algebraic geometry are excellent. In particular:
*All complete Noetherian local rings, for instance all fields and the ring '''Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' of p-adic integers, are excellent. 
*All Dedekind domains of characteristic 0 are excellent. In particular the ring '''Z''' of integers is excellent. Dedekind domains over fields of characteristic greater than 0 need not be excellent. 
*The rings of convergent power series in a finite number of variables over '''R''' or '''C''' are excellent.
*Any localization of an excellent ring is excellent.
*Any finitely generated algebra over an excellent ring is excellent.

===A J-2 ring that is not a G-ring===

Here is an example of a discrete valuation ring ''A'' of dimension 1 and characteristic ''p''&amp;gt;0 which is J-2 but not a G-ring and so is not quasi-excellent. If ''k'' is any field of characteristic ''p'' with [''k'':''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;] = ∞ and ''A'' is the ring of power series Σ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; such that [''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...):''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;] is finite then the formal fibers  of ''A'' are not all geometrically regular so ''A'' is not a G-ring. It is a J-2 ring as all Noetherian local rings of dimension at most 1 are J-2 rings. It is also universally catenary as it is a Dedekind domain. Here ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the image of ''k'' under the [[Frobenius morphism]] ''a''→''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===A G-ring that is not a J-2 ring===

Here is an example of a ring that is a G-ring but not a J-2 ring and so not quasi-excellent. If ''R'' is the subring of the polynomial ring ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...] in infinitely many generators generated by the squares and cubes of all generators, and ''S'' is obtained from ''R'' by adjoining inverses to all elements not in any of the ideals generated by some ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''S'' is a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain that is not a J-1 ring as ''S'' has a cusp singularity at every closed point, so the set of singular points is not closed, though it is a G-ring.
This ring is also universally catenary, as its localization at every prime ideal is a quotient of a regular ring.

===A quasi-excellent ring that is not excellent===

[[catenary ring|Nagata's example]] of a 2-dimensional Noetherian local ring that is catenary but not universally catenary is a G-ring, and is also a J-2 ring as any local G-ring is a J-2 ring {{harv|Matsumura|1980|loc=p.88, 260}}. So it is a quasi-excellent catenary local ring that is not excellent.

==Properties==

Any quasi-excellent ring is a [[Nagata ring]].

Any quasi-excellent reduced local ring is [[analytically reduced]].

Any quasi-excellent normal local ring is [[analytically normal]].

==Resolution of singularities==
Quasi-excellent rings are closely related to the problem of [[resolution of singularities]], and this seems to have been Grothendieck's motivation for defining them. Grothendieck (1965) observed that if it is possible to resolve singularities of all complete integral local Noetherian rings, then it is possible to resolve the singularities of all reduced quasi-excellent rings. Hironaka (1964) proved this for all complete integral Noetherian local rings over a field of characteristic 0, which implies his theorem that all singularities of excellent schemes over a field of characteristic 0 can be resolved. Conversely if it is possible to resolve all singularities of the spectra of all integral finite algebras over a Noetherian ring ''R'' then the ring ''R'' is quasi-excellent.

In [[geometry]], '''Fagnano's problem''' is an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem that was first stated by [[Giovanni Fagnano]] in 1775:

:''For a given [[acute triangle]] determine the inscribed triangle of minimal [[perimeter]]''.

==Solution==
The [[orthic triangle]], with vertices at the base points of the [[altitude (triangle)|altitudes]] of the given triangle, has the smallest perimeter of all  triangles inscribed into an acute triangle, hence it is the solution of Fagnano's problem. Fagnano's original proof used [[calculus]] methods and an intermediate result given by his father [[Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano]]. Later however several geometric proofs were discovered as well, amongst others by [[Hermann Schwarz]] and [[Lipót Fejér]]. These proofs use the geometrical properties of reflections to determine some minimal path representing the perimeter.

==Physical principles==
A solution from physics is found by imagining putting a rubber band that follows [[Hooke's Law]] around the three sides of a triangular frame &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt;, such that it could slide around smoothly. Then the rubber band would end up in a position that minimizes its elastic energy, and therefore minimize its total length. This position gives the minimal perimeter triangle.
The tension inside the rubber band is the same everywhere in the rubber band, so in its resting position, we have, by [[Lami's theorem]], &lt;math&gt;\angle bcA = \angle acB, \angle caB = \angle baC, \angle abC = \angle cbA&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Altitudes and orthic triangle SVG.svg|thumb|279px|Triangle ''abc'' is the orthic triangle of triangle ''ABC'']]
Therefore, this minimal triangle is the orthic triangle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''free loop''' is a variant of the mathematical notion of a [[Loop (topology)|loop]].  Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point.  Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  Then a free loop in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence class]] of [[continuous function]]s from the [[circle]] &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle.  That is, &lt;math&gt;f \sim g&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\psi : S^1 \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g = f\circ\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a free loop, as opposed to a based loop used in the definition of the [[fundamental group]], is a map from the circle to the space without the basepoint-preserving restriction.  Free homotopy classes of free loops correspond to [[conjugacy class]]es in the fundamental group.

Recently, interest in the space of all free loops &lt;math&gt;LX&lt;/math&gt; has grown with the advent of [[string topology]], i.e. the study of new algebraic structures on the [[singular homology|homology]] of the free loop space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">'''Geometric cryptography''' is an area of [[cryptology]] where [[message]]s and [[ciphertext]]s are represented by geometric quantities such as [[angle]]s or intervals and where [[computation]]s are performed by [[ruler and compass construction]]s.&lt;ref name=Shamir&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mike Burmester, Ronald L Rivest and Adi Shamir|title=Geometric Cryptography Identification by Angle Trisection|url=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/BurmesterRivestShamir-geometric.pdf|publisher=US Department of Energy, OSTI|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty  or impossibility of solving certain geometric problems like trisection of an angle using ruler and compass only is the basis for the various protocols in geometric cryptography. This field of study was suggested by Mike Burmester, [[Ronald L. Rivest]] and [[Adi Shamir]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=Shamir/&gt; Though the cryptographic methods based on geometry have practically no real life applications, they are of use as pedagogic tools for  the elucidation of other more complex cryptographic protocols.&lt;ref name=Shamir/&gt; 
==A geometric one-way function==
Some of the geometric cryptographic methods  are based on the [[Angle trisection#Proof_of_impossibility|impossibility of trisecting an angle]] using ruler and compass. Given an arbitrary angle, there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle. But there is no ruler and compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one-third of a given angle. Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle can be thought of as a [[one-way function]], the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions.

==A geometric identification protocol==
A geometric identification protocol has been suggested based on the one-way function indicated  above.  

Assume that Alice wishes to establish a means of proving her identity later to Bob.

'''Initialization''':  Alice publishes a copy of an angle Y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; which is constructed by Alice as the triple of an angle X&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; she has constructed at random.  Because trisecting an angle is impossible Alice is confident that she is the only one who knows X&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Identification Protocol''': Alice gives Bob a copy of an angle R which she has constructed as the triple of an angle K that she has selected at random.

#Bob flips a coin and tells Alice the result.
#If Bob says "heads" Alice gives Bob a copy of the angle K and Bob checks that 3*K = R.
#If Bob says "tails" Alice gives Bob a copy of the angle L = K + X&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and Bob checks that 3*L = R + Y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

The three steps are repeated ''t'' times independently. Bob accepts Alice's proof of identity only if all ''t'' checks are successful.

This protocol is an interactive proof of knowledge of the angle X&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the identity of Alice) with
error 2&lt;sup&gt;−''t''&lt;/sup&gt;. The protocol is also [[Zero-knowledge proof|zero-knowledge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''Golden–Thompson inequality''' is a [[Trace inequalities|trace inequality]] between [[Matrix_exponential|exponentials]] of matrices proved independently by {{harvtxt|Golden|1965}} and {{harvtxt|Thompson|1965}}. It has been developed in the context of [[statistical mechanics]], where it has come to have a particular significance.

== Introduction ==
If ''a'' and ''b'' are two real numbers, then the [[Exponential_function|exponential]] of ''a+b'' is the product of the exponential of ''a'' with the exponential of ''b'':
:&lt;math&gt; e^{a+b} = e^a e^b .&lt;/math&gt;
This relationship is '''not''' true if we replace ''a'' and ''b'' with square matrices ''A'' and ''B''. Golden and Thompson proved that, while the matrix given by &lt;math&gt;e^{A+B}&lt;/math&gt; is not always equal to the matrix given by &lt;math&gt;e^A e^B&lt;/math&gt;, their [[trace (linear algebra)|traces]] are related by the following inequality:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}\, e^{A+B} \le \operatorname{tr} \left(e^A e^B\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality is well defined as the expression on right hand side of the inequality is a positive real number, as can be seen by rewriting it as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\left(e^{\frac{A}{2}}e^B e^{\frac{A}{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (using the cyclic property of the trace).

If ''A'' and ''B'' [[Commuting matrices|commute]], then the equality &lt;math&gt; e^{A+B} = e^A e^B&lt;/math&gt; holds, just like in the case of real number. In this situation the Golden-Thompson inequality is actually an equality. {{harvtxt|Petz|1994}} proved that this is the only situation in which this happens: if ''A'' and ''B'' are two Hermitian matrices for which the Golden-Thomposon inequality is verified as an equality, then the two matrices commute.

== Generalizations ==
The inequality has been generalized to three matrices by {{harvtxt|Lieb|1973}} and furthermore to any arbitrary number of matrices by {{harvtxt|Sutter|Berta|Tomamichel|2016}}. For three matrices, it takes the following formulation:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}\, e^{A+B+C} \le \operatorname{tr} \left(e^A \mathcal{T}_{e^{-B}} e^C\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}_f&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of the matrix logarithm given by &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}_f(g) = \int_0^\infty \operatorname{d}t \, (f+t)^{-1} g (f+t)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; [[Commuting_matrices|commute]], then &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}_f(g) = gf^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the inequality for three matrices reduces to the original from Golden and Thompson.

{{harvs|txt|first=Bertram|last=Kostant|year=1973|authorlink=Bertram Kostant}} used the [[Kostant convexity theorem]] to generalize the Golden–Thompson inequality to all compact Lie groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">In algebraic geometry and [[complex geometry]], the '''Harder–Narasimhan stratification''' is any of a stratification of the [[moduli stack of principal bundles|moduli stack of principal ''G''-bundles]] by locally closed substacks in terms of "loci of instabilities". In the original form due to Harder and Narasimhan, ''G'' was the [[general linear group]]; i.e., the moduli stack was the [[moduli stack of vector bundles]], but, today, the term refers to any of generalizations. The scheme-theoretic version is due to Shatz and so the term "Shatz stratification" is also used synonymously. The general case is due to Behrend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Behrend|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/282ynotes/LectureIII-Cohomology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- == Definitions ==
Let ''X'' be a smooth projective curve over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; and ''G'' a smooth affine group scheme over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; whose fibers are connected and generic fiber is a semisimple group. Given a ''G''-bundle ''P'' on ''X'', the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;d(P): X(G) \to G&lt;/math&gt; that maps a character &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; to the degree of the line bundle &lt;math&gt;P \times_{G, \chi} \mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; is called the degree of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G&lt;/math&gt; be the [[moduli stack of principal bundles]] on ''X'', and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G^d&lt;/math&gt; locally closed substack consisting of bundles having degree &lt;math&gt;d: X(G) \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
If , then

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}^d_{G, \le m} \subset \operatorname{Bun}^d_G&lt;/math&gt; denote the substack of principal G-bundles of instability degree &lt;math&gt;\le m&lt;/math&gt;. It is an open substack of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}^d_G&lt;/math&gt; since the degree is upper semicontinuous. For example, those in the complement of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_{G, \le 0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[semi-stable bundle]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6877">An '''intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve''' is a mathematical function that relates the [[rainfall]] intensity with its [[time|duration]] and [[return period|frequency]] of occurrence.&lt;ref name=Koutsoyiannis&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koutsoyiannis|first=D.|last2=Kozonis|first2=D.|last3=Manetas|first3=A.|date=1998|title=A mathematical framework for studying rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationships|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=206|pages=118-135|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00097-3|bibcode=1998JHyd..206..118K}}&lt;/ref&gt; These curves are commonly used in [[Hydrological_modelling | hydrology]] for [[Flood#Flood_forecasting | flood forecasting]] and [[Civil_engineering#Water_resources_engineering | civil engineering]] for [[Urban_runoff| urban drainage]] design. However, the ''IDF curves'' are also analysed in [[hydrometeorology]] because of the interest in the ''time concentration'' or ''time-structure'' of the [[rainfall]].&lt;ref name=Monjo1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monjo|first=R.|date=2016|title=Measure of rainfall time structure using the dimensionless n-index |journal=Climate Research|volume=67|pages=71-86|doi=10.3354/cr01359|bibcode=2016ClRes..67...71M}} [http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr_oa/c067p071.pdf (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical approaches == 

The IDF curves can take different mathematical expressions, theoretical or empirically fitted to observed rainfall data. For each duration (e.g. 5, 10, 60, 120, 180 ... minutes), the [[ECDF]] or ''[[empirical distribution function]]'', and a determined frequency or [[return period]] is set. Therefore, the empirical IDF curve is given by the union of the points of equal frequency of occurrence and different duration and intensity&lt;ref&gt;Témez, J. (1978): Cálculo Hidrometeorológico de caudales máximos en pequeñas cuencas naturales. Dirección General de Carreteras. Madrid. España. 111p.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a theoretical or semi-empirical IDF curve is one whose mathematical expression is physically justified, but presents parameters that must be estimated by empirical fits.

=== Empirical approaches ===

There is a large number of empirical approaches that relate the intensity (''I''), the duration (''t'') and the return period (''p''), from fits to power laws such as:

* Sherman's formula,&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, C. (1931): ''Frequency and intensity of excessive rainfall at
Boston, Massachusetts'', Transactions, American Society of Civil Engineers, 95, 951–960.&lt;/ref&gt; with three parameters (''a'', ''c'' and ''n''), which are a function of the return period,&amp;nbsp;''p'':
:: &lt;math&gt;I(t)=\frac a {(t+c)^n}&lt;/math&gt;
* Chow's formula, &lt;ref&gt;Chow, V. T. (1962): ''Hydrologic determination of waterway areas for
drainage structures in small drainage basins'', Engrg. Experimental Station, Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, I11, Illinois, bulletin No.
462.&lt;/ref&gt;also with three parameters (''a'', ''c'' and ''n''), for a particular return period ''p'':
:: &lt;math&gt;I(t)= \frac a {t^n+c}&lt;/math&gt;
* Power law according to Aparicio (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Aparicio, F. (1997): Fundamentos de Hidrología de Superficie.
Balderas, México, Limusa. 303 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  with four parameters (''a'', ''c'', ''m'' and ''n''), already adjusted for all return periods of interest:  
:: &lt;math&gt;I(t,p)=a \cdot \frac{p^m}{(t+c)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[hydrometeorology]], the simple power law (taking &lt;math&gt;\ c = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is used according to Monjo (2016) as a measure of the time-structure of the rainfall:&lt;ref name="Monjo1" /&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;I(t)=\frac a {t^n} = I_o\left( \frac{t_o} t \right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ I_o&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a intensity of reference for a fixed time &lt;math&gt;\ t_o&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\ a=I_o t_o^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt; is a non-dimensional parameter known as '''''n''-index'''. In a rainfall event, the equivalent to the IDF curve is called ''Maximum Averaged Intensity'' (MAI) curve.&lt;ref name="eng.tethys_1"&gt;Moncho, R.; Belda. F; Caselles, V. (2010): ''Climatic study of the exponent “n” in IDF curves: application for the Iberian Peninsula''. Tethys, nº6: 3–14. DOI: 10.3369/tethys.2009.6.01 [http://eng.tethys.cat/files/6tethys-01-eng.pdf (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical approaches ===

To get an '''IDF curves''' from a [[probability distribution]], &lt;math&gt;\ F(x)&lt;/math&gt; it is necessary to mathematically isolate the precipitation&lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt;, which is directly related to the average intensity &lt;math&gt;\ I&lt;/math&gt;  and the duration &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt;, by the equation &lt;math&gt;\ x = It&lt;/math&gt;, and since the [[return period]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\ 1 - F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\ f(p)&lt;/math&gt; is found as the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\ F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, according to:

:: &lt;math&gt; I t =  f(p)   \quad  \Leftarrow \quad  p =  \frac{1}{1-F(I t)}&lt;/math&gt;

* Power law with the return period, derived from the [[Pareto distribution]], for a fixed duration &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt;:

:: &lt;math&gt;\ I(p) = kp^m \quad  \Leftarrow \quad  F(It) = 1 - \left( \frac{kt}{It} \right)^{1/m} = 1 - \frac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

::where the Pareto distribution constant has been redefined as&lt;math&gt;\ k' = k t&lt;/math&gt;, since it is a valid distribution for a specific duration of precipitation, &lt;math&gt;\ x &lt;/math&gt;, it has been taken as&lt;math&gt;\ x = It&lt;/math&gt;.

* Function derived from the [[Pareto distribution | generalized Pareto Distribution]], for a given duration &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt;:

The '''Inverse Symbolic Calculator''' is an online [[number checker]] established July 18, 1995 by [[Peter Benjamin Borwein]], [[Jonathan Michael Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]] of the Canadian Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (Burnaby, Canada). A user will input a number and the Calculator will use an algorithm to search for and calculate [[closed-form expression]]s or suitable functions that have roots near this number. Hence, the calculator is of great importance for those working in numerical areas of [[experimental mathematics]].

The ISC contains 54 million mathematical constants. [[Plouffe's Inverter]] (opened in 1998) contains 214 million. A newer version of the tables with 3.702 billion entries (as of June 19, 2010) exists.

In 2016, Plouffe released a portable version of Plouffe's Inverter containing 3 billion entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plouffe.fr/Simon%20Plouffe.htm |title=''Page maison de Simon Plouffe'' |publisher=plouffe.fr |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peletier, Jacques – De occulta parte numerorum, quam algebram vocant, 1560 – BEIC 4636870.jpg|thumb|left|''De occulta parte numerorum, quam algebram vocant'', 1560]]

'''Jacques Pelletier du Mans''', also spelled '''Peletier''' ({{lang-la|Iacobus Peletarius Cenomani}}, 1517–1582) was a [[Humanism|humanist]], [[poet]] and [[mathematician]] of the [[French Renaissance]].

Born in [[Le Mans]] into a bourgeois family, he studied at the [[Collège de Navarre]] in [[Paris]], where his brother Jean was a professor of mathematics and philosophy.  He subsequently studied law and medicine, frequented the literary circle around [[Marguerite de Navarre]] and from 1541 to 1543 he was secretary to René du Bellay.  In 1541 he published the first French translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars poetica]]'' and during this period he also published numerous scientific and mathematical treatises.

In 1547 he produced a funeral oration for [[Henry VIII of England]] and published his first poems (''Œuvres poétiques''), which included translations from the first two cantos of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the first book of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', twelve [[Petrarch]]ian [[sonnet]]s, three [[Horace|Horacian]] [[ode]]s and a [[Martial|Martial-like]] [[epigram]]; this poetry collection also included the first published poems of [[Joachim Du Bellay]] and [[Pierre de Ronsard]] (Ronsard would include Jacques Pelletier into his list of revolutionary contemporary poets ''[[La Pléiade]]'').  He then began to frequent a humanist circle around [[Théodore de Bèze]], Jean Martin, Denis Sauvage.

In the Renaissance, the French language had acquired many inconsistencies in spelling through a misguided attempt to model French words on their [[Latin]] roots (see [[Middle French]]). Jacques Pelletier tried to [[Reforms of French orthography|reform French spelling]] in a 1550 treatise advocating a phonetic-based spelling using new typographic signs which he would continue to use in all his published works. In this system he consistently spells his name with one "l": ''Peletier''.

Pelletier spent many years in [[Bordeaux]], [[Poitiers]], [[Piedmont]] (where he may have been the tutor of the son of [[Charles de Cossé, Count of Brissac|Maréchal de Brissac]]), and [[Lyon]] (where he frequented the poets and humanists [[Maurice Scève]], [[Louise Labé]], [[Olivier de Magny]] and [[Pontus de Tyard]]).  In 1555 he published a manual of poetic composition, ''Art poétique français'', a Latin oration calling for peace from [[Henry II of France]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Charles V]] and a new collection of poetry, ''L'Amour des amours'' (consisting of a [[sonnet cycle]] and a series of encyclopedic poems describing meteors, planets and the heavens) which would influence poets [[Guillaume du Bartas]] and [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]].

His last years were spent in travels to the [[duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], Germany, Switzerland, possibly Italy, and various regions in France, and in publishing numerous works in Latin on [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and mathematics, and medicine (including a refutation of [[Galen]], and a work on the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]]).  In 1572 he was briefly director of the [[College of Guienne|College of Aquitaine]] in Bordeaux, but, bored by the position, he resigned.  During this period he was friends with [[Michel de Montaigne]] and [[Pierre de Brach]].  In 1579 he returned to Paris and was named director of the College of Le Mans.  A final collection of poetry ''Louanges'' was published in 1581.

Pelletier died in Paris in July or August 1582.

==New naming convention for large numbers==
While maintaining the original system of the French mathematician [[Nicolas Chuquet]] (1484) for the names of large numbers, Jacques Pelletier promoted ''milliard'' for 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; which had been used earlier by [[Budaeus]]. In the late 17th century, ''milliard'' was subsequently reduced to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This convention is used widely in [[Long and short scales|long scale countries]].

'''Kenneth Ira Appel''' (October 8, 1932 – April 19, 2013) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] who in 1976, with colleague [[Wolfgang Haken]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], solved one of the most famous problems in [[mathematics]], the [[four-color theorem]]. They proved that any two-dimensional map, with certain limitations, can be filled in with four colors without any adjacent "countries" sharing the same color.

==Biography==

Appel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], on October 8, 1932, and he died in [[Dover, New Hampshire]], on April 19, 2013, after being diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] in October 2012. He grew up in [[Queens, New York]], and was the son of Irwin Appel and Lillian Sender Appel. He worked as an [[actuary]] for a brief time and then served in the [[U.S. Army]] for two years at Fort Benning, Georgia, and in [[Baumholder, Germany]]. In 1959, he finished his doctoral program at the [[University of Michigan]], and he also married Carole S. Stein in [[Philadelphia]]. The couple moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where Kenneth worked for the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] from 1959 to 1961. His main work at the Institute for Defense Analyses was doing research in [[cryptography]]. Toward the end of his life, in 2012, he was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;Obituary For: Kenneth I. Appel http://www.meaningfulfunerals.net/fh/obituaries/obituary.cfm?o_id=2069700&amp;fh_id=12298&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Appel was also the treasurer of the Strafford County Democratic Committee. He played tennis through his early 50s. He was a lifelong stamp collector, a player of the game of Go and a baker of bread.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} He and Carole had two sons, [[Andrew W. Appel]], a noted [[computer scientist]], and [[Peter H. Appel]], and a daughter, Laurel F. Appel, who died on March 4, 2013. He was also a member of the Dover school board from 2010 until his death.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Schooling and teaching==

Kenneth Appel received his bachelor's degree from [[Queens College]] in 1953.  After serving the army he attended the [[University of Michigan]] where he earned his M.A. in 1956, and then later his Ph.D. in 1959.  [[Roger Lyndon]], his doctoral advisor, was a mathematician whose main mathematical focus was in [[group theory]].

After working for the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], in 1961 Appel joined the Mathematics Department faculty at the [[University of Illinois]] as an Assistant Professor.  While there Kenneth researched in [[group theory]] and [[computability theory]].  In 1967 he became an [[Associate Professor]] and in 1977 was promoted to [[Professor]].  It was while he was at this university that he and [[Wolfgang Haken]] proved the four color theorem.  From their work and proof of this theorem they were later awarded the [[Delbert Ray Fulkerson]] prize, in 1979, by the [[American Mathematical Society]] and the [[Mathematical Programming Society]].&lt;ref name="Bookrags"&gt;World of Mathematics. N.p.: Thomson Corporation, 2005-2006. Kenneth I. Appel Biography | Bookrags.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the University of Illinois Kenneth took on five students during their doctoral program.  Each student helped contribute to the work cited on the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]].&lt;ref name="Genealogy Project"&gt;"Mathematics Genealogy Project." The Mathematics Genealogy Project - Kenneth Appel http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=5059&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Appel moved to [[New Hampshire]] as Chairman of the [[Mathematics]] Department at the [[University of New Hampshire]].  In 2003 he retired as [[professor emeritus]].  During his retirement he volunteered in mathematics enrichment programs in Dover and in southern Maine public schools.  He believed "that students should be afforded the opportunity to study mathematics at the level of their ability, even if it is well above their grade level."&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Contributions to mathematics==

===The four color theorem===

Kenneth Appel is known for his work in [[topology]], the branch of mathematics that explores certain properties of geometric figures.&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;"Kenneth I. Appel." Science and Its Times (2005–2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  His biggest accomplishment was proving the [[four color theorem]] in 1976 with [[Wolfgang Haken]].  The [[New York Times]] wrote in 1976: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now the four-color conjecture has been proved by two University of Illinois mathematicians, Kenneth Appel and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. They had an invaluable tool that earlier mathematicians lacked—modern computers. Their present proof rests in part on 1,200 hours of computer calculation during which about ten billion logical decisions had to be made. The proof of the four-color conjecture is unlikely to be of applied significance. Nevertheless, what has been accomplished is a major intellectual feat. It gives us an important new insight into the nature of two-dimensional space and of the ways in which such space can be broken into discrete portions.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At first, many mathematicians were unhappy with the fact that Appel and Haken were using computers, since this was new at the time, and even Appel said, "Most mathematicians, even as late as the 1970s, had no real interest in learning about computers. It was almost as if those of us who enjoyed playing with computers were doing something non-mathematical or suspect."&lt;ref name="Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brooks |first=David |title=Math Pioneers |work=UNH Magazine Online |url=http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp02/mathpioneers.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual proof was described in an article as long as a typical book titled ''Every Planar Map is Four Colorable'', Contemporary Mathematics, vol. 98, American Mathematical Society, 1989.&lt;ref name="Bookrags"/&gt;

The proof has been one of the most controversial of modern mathematics because of its heavy dependence on computer number-crunching to sort through possibilities, which drew criticism from many in the mathematical community for its inelegance: "a good mathematical proof is like a poem—this is a telephone directory!" Appel and Haken agreed in a 1977 interview that it was not "elegant, concise, and completely comprehensible by a human mathematical mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassrcalc3.wordpress.com/2006/10/19/the-four-color-map-problem-by-sharon-murray/ Four Color Map Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the proof was the start of a change in mathematicians' attitudes toward computers—which they had largely disdained as a tool for [[engineer]]s rather than for theoreticians—leading to the creation of what is sometimes called [[experimental mathematics]].

===Group theory===

Kenneth Appel's other publications include an article with P.E. Schupp titled ''Artin Groups and Infinite Coxeter Groups''. In this article Appel and [[Schupp]] introduced four theorems that are true about [[Coxeter groups]] and then proved them to be true for [[Artin group]]s. The proofs of these four theorems used the "results and methods of small cancellation theory."&lt;ref name="Artin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appel |first=Kenneth I. |first2=P. E. |last2=Schupp |title=Artin Groups and Infinite Coxeter Groups |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=201–220 |doi=10.1007/BF01389320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kripke semantics''' (also known as '''relational semantics''' or '''frame semantics''', and often confused with [[possible world semantics]]) is a formal [[semantics]] for [[non-classical logic]] systems created in the late 1950s and early 1960s by [[Saul Kripke]] and [[André Joyal]]. It was first conceived for [[modal logic]]s, and later adapted to [[intuitionistic logic]] and other non-classical systems. The development of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the theory of non-classical logics, because the [[model theory]] of such logics was almost non-existent before Kripke (algebraic semantics existed, but were considered 'syntax in disguise').

==Semantics of modal logic==
{{Main| Modal logic }}

The language of propositional  modal logic consists of a [[countable set|countably infinite set]] of [[propositional variable]]s, a set of truth-functional [[Logical connective|connectives]] (in this article &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;), and the modal operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; ("necessarily"). The modal operator &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; ("possibly") is (classically) the [[duality (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual]] of &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; and [[Classical modal logic|may be defined]] in terms of necessity like so: &lt;math&gt;\Diamond A := \neg\Box\neg A&lt;/math&gt; ("possibly A" is defined as equivalent to "not necessarily not A").&lt;ref name=Shoham&gt;{{cite book |last=Shoham |first=Yoav |first2=Kevin |last2=Leyton-Brown |title=Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521899435 |page=397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMR_qScakukC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic definitions===
 
A '''Kripke frame''' or '''modal frame''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is a (possibly empty) set, and ''R'' is a [[binary relation]] on ''W''. Elements
of ''W'' are called ''nodes'' or ''worlds'', and ''R'' is known as the [[accessibility relation]].&lt;ref name=Gasquet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gasquet|first1=Olivier|title=Kripke’s Worlds: An Introduction to Modal Logics via Tableaux|date=2013|publisher=Springer |isbn=3764385030|pages=14–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFS-BAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 December 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kripke model''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a Kripke frame, and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a relation between
nodes of ''W'' and modal formulas, such that:
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\neg A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w\; R\; u&lt;/math&gt;.
We read &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; as “''w'' satisfies
''A''”, “''A'' is satisfied in ''w''”, or
“''w'' forces ''A''”. The relation &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; is called the
''satisfaction relation'', ''evaluation'', or ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] relation''.
The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its
value on propositional variables.

A formula ''A'' is '''valid''' in:
* a model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; for all ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'',
* a frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if it is valid in &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all possible choices of &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;,
* a class ''C'' of frames or models, if it is valid in every member of ''C''.
We define Thm(''C'') to be the set of all formulas that are valid in
''C''.  Conversely, if ''X'' is a set of formulas, let Mod(''X'') be the
class of all frames which validate every formula from ''X''.

A modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) ''L'' is '''[[Soundness|sound]]''' with
respect to a class of frames ''C'', if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C''). ''L'' is
'''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]''' wrt ''C'' if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C'').

=== Correspondence and completeness ===
Semantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e. a [[Formal system|derivation system]]) only if the [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic consequence]] relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the ''[[Logical consequence#Syntactic consequence|syntactic consequence]]'' relation (''derivability'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giaquinto|first1=Marcus|title=The Search for Certainty : A Philosophical Account of Foundations of Mathematics: A Philosophical Account of Foundations of Mathematics|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019875244X|page=256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyNbrpYXzxoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and to determine also which class that is.

For any class ''C'' of Kripke frames, Thm(''C'') is a [[normal modal logic]] (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, ''K'', are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold in general: while most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions, 
Kripke incomplete normal modal logics do exist. A natural example of such a system is [[Japaridze's Polymodal Logic]].

A normal modal logic ''L'' '''corresponds''' to a class of frames ''C'', if ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Mod(''L''). In other words, ''C'' is the largest class of frames such that ''L'' is sound wrt ''C''. It follows that ''L'' is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.

Consider the schema '''T''' : &lt;math&gt;\Box A\to A&lt;/math&gt;.
'''T''' is valid in any [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: if
&lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt;
since ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w''. On the other hand, a frame which
validates '''T''' has to be reflexive: fix ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and
define satisfaction of a propositional variable ''p'' as follows:
&lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''u''. Then
&lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box p&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt;
by '''T''', which means ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w'' using the definition of
&lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;. '''T''' corresponds to the class of reflexive
Kripke frames.

It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of
''L'' than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a
guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show
''incompleteness'' of modal logics: suppose 
''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are normal modal logics that
correspond to the same class of frames, but ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not
prove all theorems of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is
Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema &lt;math&gt;\Box(A\leftrightarrow\Box
A)\to\Box A&lt;/math&gt; generates an incomplete logic, as it
corresponds to the same class of frames as '''GL''' (viz. transitive and
converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the '''GL'''-tautology &lt;math&gt;\Box
A\to\Box\Box A&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Common modal systems ====
{{:Normal modal logic}}

===Canonical models===

For any normal modal logic, ''L'', a Kripke model (called the '''canonical model''') can be constructed that refutes precisely the non-theorems of
''L'', by an adaptation of the standard technique of using [[maximal consistent set]]s as models. Canonical Kripke models play a 
role similar to the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]] construction in algebraic
semantics.

A set of formulas is ''L''-''consistent'' if no contradiction can be derived from it using the theorems of ''L'', and Modus Ponens. A ''maximal L-consistent set'' (an ''L''-''MCS''
for short) is an ''L''-consistent set that has no proper ''L''-consistent superset.

The '''canonical model''' of ''L'' is a Kripke model
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is the set of all ''L''-''MCS'',
and the relations ''R'' and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; are as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;X\;R\;Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\Box A\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A\in Y&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;X\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\in X&lt;/math&gt;.
The canonical model is a model of ''L'', as every ''L''-''MCS'' contains
all theorems of ''L''. By [[Zorn's lemma]], each ''L''-consistent set
is contained in an ''L''-''MCS'', in particular every formula
unprovable in ''L'' has a counterexample in the canonical model.

The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of '''K''' immediately imply completeness of '''K''' with respect to the class of all Kripke frames.
This argument does ''not'' work for arbitrary ''L'', because there is no guarantee that the underlying ''frame'' of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of ''L''.

We say that a formula or a set ''X'' of formulas is '''canonical'''
with respect to a property ''P'' of Kripke frames, if
* ''X'' is valid in every frame that satisfies ''P'',
* for any normal modal logic ''L'' that contains ''X'', the underlying frame of the canonical model of ''L'' satisfies ''P''.
A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical.
It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by
a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and
[[compactness theorem|compact]].

The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus
any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not
canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is
not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic '''S4.1''' (in
fact, even '''K4.1''') is canonical.

In general, it is [[decision problem|undecidable]] whether a given axiom is
canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: [[Henrik Sahlqvist]] identified a broad class of formulas (now called
[[Sahlqvist formula]]s) such that
* a Sahlqvist formula is canonical,
* the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is [[first-order logic|first-order]] definable,
* there is an algorithm that computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula.
This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms
listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas.

===Finite model property===

A logic has the '''[[finite model property]]''' (FMP) if it is complete
with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this
notion is the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] question: it
follows from
[[Post's theorem]] that a recursively axiomatized modal logic ''L''
which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given
finite frame is a model of ''L''. In particular, every finitely
axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.

There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic.
Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often
work, using tools such as [[#Model constructions|filtration]] or
[[#Model constructions|unravelling]]. As another possibility,
completeness proofs based on [[cut-elimination|cut-free]]
[[sequent calculus|sequent calculi]] usually produce finite models
directly.

Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed
above) have FMP.

In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic:
every normal modal logic is complete with respect to a class of
[[modal algebra]]s, and a ''finite'' modal algebra can be transformed
into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method
that every normal extension of '''S4.3''' has FMP, and is Kripke
complete.

===Multimodal logics===
{{See also|Multimodal logic}}

Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with
more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with
&lt;math&gt;\{\Box_i\mid\,i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of its necessity operators
consists of a non-empty set ''W'' equipped with binary relations
''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''. The definition of a
satisfaction relation is modified as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\,(w\;R_i\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for
polymodal [[provability logic]]s. A '''Carlson model''' is a structure
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\{D_i\}_{i\in I},\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
with a single accessibility relation ''R'', and subsets
''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''W'' for each modality. Satisfaction is
defined as

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\in D_i\,(w\;R\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual
polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal
logics which are Carlson incomplete.

==Semantics of intuitionistic logic==

Kripke semantics for the [[intuitionistic logic]] follows the same
principles as the semantics of modal logic, but it uses a different
definition of satisfaction.

An '''intuitionistic Kripke model''' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[preorder]]ed Kripke frame, and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following conditions:
* if ''p'' is a propositional variable, &lt;math&gt;w\le u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; (''persistency'' condition (cf. [[monotonicity]])),
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\land B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\lor B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot&lt;/math&gt;.

The negation of ''A'', ¬''A'', could be defined as an abbreviation for ''A'' → ⊥.  If for all ''u'' such that ''w'' ≤ ''u'', not ''u'' &lt;big&gt;⊩&lt;/big&gt; ''A'', then ''w'' &lt;big&gt;⊩&lt;/big&gt; ''A'' → ⊥ is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]], so ''w'' &lt;big&gt;⊩&lt;/big&gt; ¬''A''.

Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke
semantics, and it has the [[finite model property]].

===Intuitionistic first-order logic===

Let ''L'' be a [[first-order logic|first-order]] language. A Kripke
model of ''L'' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\{M_w\}_{w\in W}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a
(classical) ''L''-structure for each node ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and
the following compatibility conditions hold whenever ''u''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''v'':
* the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is included in the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* realizations of function symbols in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' agree on elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* for each ''n''-ary predicate ''P'' and elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'': if ''P''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', then it holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Given an evaluation ''e'' of variables by elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', we
define the satisfaction relation &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash P(t_1,\dots,t_n)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;P(t_1[e],\dots,t_n[e])&lt;/math&gt; holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\land B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\lor B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\to B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\exists x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists an &lt;math&gt;a\in M_w&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\forall x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;a\in M_u&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''e''(''x''→''a'') is the evaluation which gives ''x'' the
value ''a'', and otherwise agrees with ''e''.

===Kripke–Joyal semantics===

As part of the independent development of [[sheaf theory]], it was realised around 1965 that Kripke semantics was intimately related to the treatment of [[existential quantification]] in  [[topos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Goldblatt |first=Robert |last=Goldblatt |chapter=A  Kripke-Joyal  Semantics  for  Noncommutative  Logic  in  Quantales |chapterurl=http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~rob/papers/aiml11printed.pdf |format=PDF |editor-first=G.  |editor-last=Governatori  |editor2-first=I. |editor2-last=Hodkinson  |editor3-first=Y. |editor3-last=Venema |title=Advances in Modal  Logic |publisher=College Publications |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=1904987206 |pages=209–225 |volume=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the 'local' aspect of existence for sections of a sheaf was a kind of logic of the 'possible'. Though this development was the work of a number of people, the name '''Kripke–Joyal semantics''' is often used in this connection.

==Model constructions==

As in classical [[model theory]], there are methods for
constructing a new Kripke model from other models.

The natural [[homomorphism]]s in Kripke semantics are called
'''p-morphisms''' (which is short for ''pseudo-epimorphism'', but the
latter term is rarely used). A p-morphism of Kripke frames
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle W',R'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping
&lt;math&gt;f\colon W\to W'&lt;/math&gt; such that
* ''f'' preserves the accessibility relation, i.e., ''u&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;v'' implies ''f''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;''R’''&amp;nbsp;''f''(''v''),
* whenever ''f''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;''R’''&amp;nbsp;''v''’, there is a ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'' such that ''u&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;v'' and ''f''(''v'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''v''’.
A p-morphism of Kripke models &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a p-morphism of their
underlying frames &lt;math&gt;f\colon W\to W'&lt;/math&gt;, which
satisfies
: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(w)\Vdash'p&lt;/math&gt;, for any propositional variable ''p''.

P-morphisms are a special kind of [[bisimulation]]s. In general, a
'''bisimulation''' between frames &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\langle W',R'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a relation
''B&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;W’'', which satisfies
the following “zig-zag” property:
* if ''u&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;u’'' and ''u&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;v'', there exists ''v’''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W’'' such that ''v&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;v’'' and ''u’&amp;nbsp;R’&amp;nbsp;v’'',
* if ''u&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;u’'' and ''u’&amp;nbsp;R’&amp;nbsp;v’'', there exists ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'' such that ''v&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;v’'' and ''u&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;v''.
A bisimulation of models is additionally required to preserve forcing
of [[atomic formula]]s:
: if ''w&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;w’'', then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w'\Vdash'p&lt;/math&gt;, for any propositional variable ''p''.
The key property which follows from this definition is that
bisimulations (hence also p-morphisms) of models preserve the
satisfaction of ''all'' formulas, not only propositional variables.

We can transform a Kripke model into a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] using
'''unravelling'''. Given a model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and a fixed
node ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', we define a model
&lt;math&gt;\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W’'' is the
set of all finite sequences
&lt;math&gt;s=\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such
that ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;w&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all
''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', and &lt;math&gt;s\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
&lt;math&gt;w_n\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; for a propositional variable
''p''. The definition of the accessibility relation ''R’''
varies; in the simplest case we put
:&lt;math&gt;\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n\rangle\;R'\;\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n,w_{n+1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
but many applications need the reflexive and/or transitive closure of
this relation, or similar modifications.

'''Filtration''' is a useful construction which uses to prove [[Kripke semantics#Finite model property|FMP]] for many logics. Let ''X'' be a set of
formulas closed under taking subformulas. An ''X''-filtration of a
model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping ''f'' from ''W'' to a model
&lt;math&gt;\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that
* ''f'' is a [[surjection]],
* ''f'' preserves the accessibility relation, and (in both directions) satisfaction of variables ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'',
* if ''f''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;''R’''&amp;nbsp;''f''(''v'') and &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash\Box A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Box A\in X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;v\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt;.
It follows that ''f'' preserves satisfaction of all formulas from
''X''. In typical applications, we take ''f'' as the projection
onto the [[quotient set|quotient]] of ''W'' over the relation
: ''u&amp;nbsp;≡&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;v'' if and only if for all ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;v\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt;.
As in the case of unravelling, the definition of the accessibility
relation on the quotient varies.

==General frame semantics==
The main defect of Kripke semantics is the existence of Kripke incomplete logics, and logics which are complete but not compact. It can be remedied by equipping Kripke frames with extra structure which restricts the set of possible valuations, using ideas from algebraic semantics. This gives rise to the [[general frame]] semantics.

==Computer science applications==
{{main|Kripke structure|state transition system|model checking}}
Blackburn et al. (2001) point out that because a relational structure is simply a set together with a collection of relations on that set, it is unsurprising that relational structures are to be found just about everywhere. As an example from [[theoretical computer science]], they give [[labeled transition system]]s, which model [[computer program|program execution]]. Blackburn et al. thus claim because of this connection that modal languages are ideally suited in providing "internal, local perspective on relational structures." (p. xii)

==History and terminology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Similar work that predated Kripke's revolutionary semantic breakthroughs:
* [[Rudolf Carnap]] seems to have been the first to have the idea that one can give a '''possible world semantics''' for the modalities of necessity and possibility by means of giving the valuation function a parameter that ranges over Leibnizian possible worlds.  Bayart develops this idea further, but neither gave recursive definitions of satisfaction in the style introduced by Tarski;
* J.C.C. McKinsey and [[Alfred Tarski]] developed an approach to modeling modal logics that is still influential in modern research, namely the algebraic approach, in which Boolean algebras with operators are used as models. [[Bjarni Jónsson]] and Tarski established the representability of Boolean algebras with operators in terms of frames. If the two ideas had been put together, the result would have been precisely frame models, which is to say Kripke models, years before Kripke. But no one (not even Tarski) saw the connection at the time.
*[[Arthur Prior]], building on unpublished work of [[C. A. Meredith]], developed a translation of sentential modal logic into classical predicate logic that, if he had combined it with the usual model theory for the latter, would have produced a model theory equivalent to Kripke models for the former. But his approach was resolutely syntactic and anti-model-theoretic.
* [[Stig Kanger]] gave a rather more complex approach to the interpretation of modal logic, but one that contains many of the key ideas of Kripke's approach.  He first noted the relationship between conditions on accessibility relations and [[C.I. Lewis|Lewis]]-style axioms for modal logic.  Kanger failed, however, to give a completeness proof for his system;
* [[Jaakko Hintikka]] gave a semantics in his papers introducing epistemic logic that is a simple variation of Kripke's semantics, equivalent to the characterisation of valuations by means of maximal consistent sets.  He doesn't give inference rules for epistemic logic, and so cannot give a completeness proof;
* [[Richard Montague]] had many of the key ideas contained in Kripke's work, but he did not regard them as significant, because he had no completeness proof, and so did not publish until after Kripke's papers had created a sensation in the logic community;
* [[Evert Willem Beth]] presented a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on trees, which closely resembles Kripke semantics, except for using a more cumbersome definition of satisfaction.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace operator''' or '''Laplacian''' is a [[differential operator]] given by the [[divergence]] of the [[gradient]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on [[Euclidean space]]. It is usually denoted by the symbols {{math|∇·∇}}, {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, or {{math|Δ}}. The Laplacian {{math|Δ''f''(''p'')}} of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''p''}}, is (up to a factor) the rate at which the average value of {{math|''f''}} over spheres centered at {{math|''p''}} deviates from {{math|''f''(''p'')}} as the radius of the sphere grows. In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the Laplacian is given by the sum of second [[partial derivative]]s of the function with respect to each [[independent variable]]. In other [[coordinate systems]] such as [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical]] and [[spherical coordinates]], the Laplacian also has a useful form.

The Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of [[celestial mechanics]], where the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to a given [[gravitational potential]]. Solutions of the equation {{math|Δ''f'' {{=}} 0}}, now called [[Laplace's equation]], are the so-called [[harmonic function]]s, and represent the possible [[gravitational fields]] in [[free space]].

The Laplacian occurs in [[differential equations]] that describe many physical phenomena, such as [[electric potential|electric]] and [[gravitational potential]]s, the [[diffusion equation]] for [[heat equation|heat]] and [[fluid mechanics|fluid flow]], [[wave equation|wave propagation]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. The Laplacian represents the [[flux density]] of the [[gradient flow]] of a function. For instance, the net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from some point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at that point; expressed symbolically, the resulting equation is the diffusion equation. For these reasons, it is extensively used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena. The Laplacian is the simplest [[elliptic operator]], and is at the core of [[Hodge theory]] as well as the results of [[de Rham cohomology]]. In [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as [[blob detection|blob]] and [[edge detection]].

==Definition==
The Laplace operator is a second order differential operator in the ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], defined as the [[divergence]] ({{math|∇·}}) of the [[gradient]] ({{math|∇''f ''}}). Thus if {{math|''f''}} is a [[derivative|twice-differentiable]] [[real-valued function]], then the Laplacian of {{math|''f''}} is defined by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \nabla^2 f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f &lt;/math&gt;|{{EqRef|1}}}}

where the latter notations derive from formally writing
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \left ( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} , \ldots , \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, the Laplacian of {{math|''f''}} is the sum of all the ''unmixed'' second [[partial derivative]]s in the [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2_i}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EqRef|2}}}}

As a second-order differential operator, the Laplace operator maps {{math|[[continuously differentiable|''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'']]}} functions to {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions for {{math|''k'' ≥ 2}}. The expression {{EqNote|1}} (or equivalently {{EqNote|2}}) defines an operator {{math|Δ : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''−2&lt;/sup&gt;(ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, or more generally an operator {{math|Δ : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''−2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} for any [[open set]] {{math|Ω}}.

== Motivation ==

=== Diffusion ===
In the [[physics|physical]] theory of [[diffusion]], the Laplace operator (via [[Laplace's equation]]) arises naturally in the mathematical description of [[Diffusion equilibrium|equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1998|loc=§2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if {{math|''u''}} is the density at equilibrium of some quantity such as a chemical concentration, then the [[net flux]] of {{math|''u''}} through the boundary of any smooth region {{math|''V''}} is zero, provided there is no source or sink within {{math|''V''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial V} \nabla u \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''n'''}} is the outward [[unit normal]] to the boundary of {{math|''V''}}. By the [[divergence theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \operatorname{div} \nabla u\, dV = \int_{\partial V} \nabla u \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this holds for all smooth regions {{math|''V''}}, it can be shown that this implies
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} \nabla u = \Delta u = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The left-hand side of this equation is the Laplace operator. The Laplace operator itself has a physical interpretation for non-equilibrium diffusion as the extent to which a point represents a source or sink of chemical concentration, in a sense made precise by the [[diffusion equation]].

=== Density associated with a potential ===
If {{math|''φ''}} denotes the [[electrostatic potential]] associated to a [[charge distribution]] {{math|''q''}}, then the charge distribution itself is given by the negative of the Laplacian of {{math|''φ''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;q = -\varepsilon_0 \Delta\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]].

This is a consequence of [[Gauss's law]]. Indeed, if {{math|''V''}} is any smooth region, then by Gauss's law the flux of the electrostatic field {{math|'''E'''}} is proportional to the charge enclosed:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS = \int_V \operatorname{div}\mathbf{E}\,dV=\frac1{\varepsilon_0}\int_V q\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

where the first equality is due to the [[divergence theorem]]. Since the electrostatic field is the (negative) gradient of the potential, this now gives

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_V \operatorname{div}(\operatorname{grad}\varphi)\,dV = \frac1{\varepsilon_0} \int_V q\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

So, since this holds for all regions {{math|''V''}}, we must have

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{grad}\varphi) = -\frac 1 {\varepsilon_0}q&lt;/math&gt;

The same approach implies that the negative of the Laplacian of the [[gravitational potential]] is the [[mass distribution]]. Often the charge (or mass) distribution are given, and the associated potential is unknown. Finding the potential function subject to suitable boundary conditions is equivalent to solving [[Poisson's equation]].

=== Energy minimization ===
Another motivation for the Laplacian appearing in physics is that solutions to {{math|Δ''f'' {{=}} 0}} in a region {{math|''U''}} are functions that make the [[Dirichlet energy]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] [[stationary point|stationary]]:

: &lt;math&gt; E(f) = \frac{1}{2} \int_U \Vert \nabla f \Vert^2 \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, suppose {{math|''f'' : ''U'' → ℝ}} is a function, and {{math|''u'' : U → ℝ}} is a function that vanishes on the 
boundary of {{math|''U''}}. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\left. \frac{d}{d\varepsilon}\right|_{\varepsilon = 0} E(f+\varepsilon u) = \int_U \nabla f \cdot \nabla u \, dx = -\int_U u \, \Delta f\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows using [[Green's first identity]]. This calculation shows that if {{math|Δ''f'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''E''}} is stationary around {{math|''f''}}. Conversely, if {{math|''E''}} is stationary around {{math|''f''}}, then {{math|Δ''f'' {{=}} 0}} by the [[fundamental lemma of calculus of variations]].

== Coordinate expressions ==

=== Two dimensions ===
The Laplace operator in two dimensions is given by:

In '''[[Cartesian coordinates]]''',

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are the standard [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the {{math|''xy''}}-plane.

In '''[[polar coordinates]]''',

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \theta^2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''r''}} represents the radial distance and {{math|''θ''}} the angle.

===Three dimensions===
{{See also|Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates}}
In three dimensions, it is common to work with the Laplacian in a variety of different coordinate systems.

In '''[[Cartesian coordinates]]''',

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In '''[[cylindrical coordinates]]''',

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} \left(\rho \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} \right) + \frac{1}{\rho^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \varphi^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2 },&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ρ''}} represents the radial distance, {{math|''φ''}} the azimuth angle and {{math|''z''}} the height.

In '''[[spherical coordinates]]''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \varphi^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} (rf) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!---**********PLEASE SEE THE DISCUSSION PAGE BEFORE CHANGING THIS.**********--&gt;
where {{math|''φ''}} represents the [[azimuthal angle]] and {{math|''θ''}} the [[zenith angle]] or [[colatitude|co-latitude]].
&lt;!---**************************************************************--&gt;

In general '''[[curvilinear coordinates]]''' ({{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 = \nabla \xi^m \cdot \nabla \xi^n \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi^m \partial \xi^n} + \nabla^2 \xi^m \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^m } = g^{mn} \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\xi^m \partial\xi^n} - \Gamma^{l}_{mn}\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^l} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Einstein summation convention|summation over the repeated indices is implied]],
{{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the inverse [[metric tensor]] and  {{math|Γ''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the [[Christoffel symbols]] for the selected coordinates.

=== {{math|''N''}} dimensions ===
In arbitrary [[curvilinear coordinates]] in {{math|''N''}} dimensions ({{math|''ξ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,..., ''ξ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;''}}), we can write the Laplacian in terms of the inverse [[metric tensor]], &lt;math&gt; g^{ij} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 = \frac1{\sqrt{\det g}}\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^i} \left( \sqrt{\det g} g^{ij}  \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

from the [https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59087 Voss]-[[Hermann_Weyl| Weyl]] formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grinfeld| first1=Pavel| title=The Voss-Weyl Formula|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD2AiFk651E&amp;list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq&amp;index=23|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[divergence#General coordinates | divergence]].

In '''spherical coordinates in {{math|''N''}} dimensions''', with the parametrization {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''rθ'' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''r''}} representing a positive real radius and {{math|''θ''}} an element of the [[unit sphere]] {{math|[[N sphere|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;]]}},

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2} + \frac{N-1}{r} \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \Delta_{S^{N-1}} f&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] on the {{math|(''N'' − 1)}}-sphere, known as the spherical Laplacian. The two radial derivative terms can be equivalently rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r^{N-1}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{N-1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence, the spherical Laplacian of a function defined on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be computed as the ordinary Laplacian of the function extended to {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;\{0&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} so that it is constant along rays, i.e., [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree zero.

==Euclidean invariance==
The Laplacian is invariant under all [[Euclidean transformation]]s: [[rotation]]s and [[translation (mathematics)|translations]].  In two dimensions, for example, this means that

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta ( f(x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta + a, x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta + b)) = (\Delta f)(x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta + a, x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta + b)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &amp;theta;, ''a'', and ''b''.  In arbitrary dimensions,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta (f\circ\rho) =(\Delta f)\circ \rho&lt;/math&gt;
whenever &amp;rho; is a rotation, and likewise
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta (f\circ\tau) =(\Delta f)\circ \tau&lt;/math&gt;
whenever &amp;tau; is a translation.  (More generally, this remains true when &amp;rho; is an [[orthogonal transformation]] such as a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].)

In fact, the algebra of all scalar linear differential operators, with constant coefficients, that commute with all Euclidean transformations, is the polynomial algebra generated by the Laplace operator.

==Spectral theory==
{{see also|Hearing the shape of a drum|Dirichlet eigenvalue}}
The [[spectral theory|spectrum]] of the Laplace operator consists of all [[eigenvalue]]s {{math|''λ''}} for which there is a corresponding [[eigenfunction]] {{math|''f''}} with

:&lt;math&gt;-\Delta f = \lambda f.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the [[Helmholtz equation]].

If {{math|Ω}} is a bounded domain in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} then the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are an [[orthonormal basis]] for the [[Hilbert space]] {{math|[[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)]]}}. This result essentially follows from the [[spectral theorem]] on [[compact operator|compact]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s, applied to the inverse of the Laplacian (which is compact, by the [[Poincaré inequality]] and the [[Rellich–Kondrachov theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbarg|Trudinger|2001|loc=Theorem 8.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be shown that the eigenfunctions are [[infinitely differentiable]] functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbarg|Trudinger|2001|loc=Corollary 8.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, these results hold for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on any compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, or indeed for the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of any [[elliptic operator]] with smooth coefficients on a bounded domain. When {{math|Ω}} is the [[N-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]], the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are the well-known [[spherical harmonics]].

== Generalizations ==

=== Laplace–Beltrami operator ===
{{main article|Laplace–Beltrami operator}}

The Laplacian also can be generalized to an elliptic operator called the '''[[Laplace–Beltrami operator]]''' defined on a [[Riemannian manifold]]. The d'Alembert operator generalizes to a hyperbolic operator on [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s. The Laplace–Beltrami operator, when applied to a function, is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] ({{math|tr}}) of the function's [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = \operatorname{tr}\big(H(f)\big)&lt;/math&gt;

where the trace is taken with respect to the inverse of the [[metric tensor]]. The Laplace–Beltrami operator also can be generalized to an operator (also called the Laplace–Beltrami operator) which operates on [[tensor field]]s, by a similar formula.

Another generalization of the Laplace operator that is available on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds uses the [[exterior derivative]], in terms of which the “geometer's Laplacian" is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta f = \delta d f .&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''δ''}} is the [[codifferential]], which can also be expressed using the [[Hodge dual]]. Note that this operator differs in sign from the "analyst's Laplacian" defined above, a point which must always be kept in mind when reading papers in global analysis. More generally, the "Hodge" Laplacian is defined on [[differential form]]s {{math|''α''}} by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \alpha = \delta d \alpha + d \delta \alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the '''[[Laplace–Beltrami operator|Laplace–de Rham operator]]''', which is related to the Laplace–Beltrami operator by the [[Weitzenböck identity]].

===D'Alembertian===
The Laplacian can be generalized in certain ways to [[non-Euclidean]] spaces, where it may be [[elliptic operator|elliptic]], [[hyperbolic operator|hyperbolic]], or [[ultrahyperbolic operator|ultrahyperbolic]].

In the [[Minkowski space]] the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] becomes the [[D'Alembert operator]] {{math|⧠}} or D'Alembertian:

:&lt;math&gt;\square = \frac1{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is the generalisation of the Laplace operator in the sense that it is the differential operator which is invariant under the [[isometry group]] of the underlying space and it reduces to the Laplace operator if restricted to time-independent functions. Note that the overall sign of the metric here is chosen such that the spatial parts of the operator admit a negative sign, which is the usual convention in high energy [[particle physics]]. The D'Alembert operator is also known as the wave operator, because it is the differential operator appearing in the [[wave equation]]s and it is also part of the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], which reduces to the wave equation in the massless case.

The additional factor of {{math|''c''}} in the metric is needed in physics if space and time are measured in different units; a similar factor would be required if, for example, the {{math|''x''}} direction were measured in meters while the {{math|''y''}} direction were measured in centimeters. Indeed, theoretical physicists usually work in units such that [[natural units|{{math|''c'' {{=}} 1}}]] in order to simplify the equation.

'''Lars Valter Hörmander''' (24 January 1931&amp;nbsp;– 25 November 2012) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[mathematician]] who has been called "the foremost contributor to the modern theory of linear [[partial differential equations]]".{{ref|wolf}} He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1962, the [[Wolf Prize]] in 1988, and the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 2006. His ''Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators I&amp;ndash;IV'' is considered a standard work on the subject of linear partial differential operators.

Hörmander completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1955 at [[Lund University]]. Hörmander then worked at [[Stockholm University]], at [[Stanford University]], and at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He returned to Lund University as  professor from 1968 until 1996, when he retired with the title of [[professor emeritus]].

==Biography==

===Education===
Hörmander was born in [[Mjällby]], a village in [[Blekinge]] in southern Sweden where his father was a teacher. Like his older brothers and sisters before him, he attended the [[realskola]] (secondary school), in a nearby town to which he commuted by train, and the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (high school) in [[Lund]] from which he graduated in 1948.

At the time when he entered the gymnasium, the principal had instituted an experiment of reducing the period of the education from three to two years, and the daily activities to three hours. This freedom to work on his own, "[greater] than the universities offer in Sweden today", suited Hörmander "very well". He was also positively influenced by his enthusiastic mathematics teacher, a [[docent]] at [[Lund University]] who encouraged him to study university level mathematics.

After proceeding to receive a [[Master's degree]] from Lund University in 1950, Hörmander began his graduate studies under [[Marcel Riesz]] (who had also been the advisor for Hörmander's gymnasium teacher). He made his first research attempts in [[classical function theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]], which "did not amount to much" but were "an excellent preparation for working in the theory of partial differential equations." He turned to partial differential equations when Riesz retired and [[Lars Gårding]] who worked actively in that area was appointed professor.

Hörmander took a one-year break for [[military service]] from 1953 to 1954, but due to his position in [[defense research]] was able to proceed with his studies even during that time. His [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis ''On the theory of general partial differential operators'' was finished in 1955, inspired by the nearly concurrent Ph.D. work of Bernard Malgrange and techniques for [[hyperbolic differential operator]]s developed by [[Lars Gårding]] and [[Jean Leray]].

===Fields Medal and years in the U.S.===
Hörmander applied for professorship at [[Stockholm University]], but temporarily left for the [[United States]] while the request was examined. He spent quarters from winter to fall in respective order at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Kansas]], the [[University of Minnesota]], and finally at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] in [[New York City]]. These locations offered "much to learn" in partial differential equations, with the exception of Chicago of which he however notes the [[Antoni Zygmund]] seminar held by [[Elias Stein]] and [[Guido Weiss]] to have strengthened his familiarity with harmonic analysis.

In the theory of linear differential operators,  "many people have contributed but the deepest and most significant results are due to Hörmander", according to Hörmander's doctoral advisor, Lars Gårding.{{ref|garding}}

Hörmander was given a position as part-time professor at Stanford in 1963, but was soon thereafter offered a professorship at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey. He first wished not to leave Sweden, but attempts to find a research professorship in Sweden failed and "the opportunity to do research full time in a mathematically very active environment was hard to resist", so he accepted the offer and resigned from both Stanford and Stockholm and began at the Institute in the fall of 1964. Within two years of "hard work", he felt that the environment at the Institute was too demanding, and in 1967 decided to return to Lund after one year. He later noted that his best work at the Institute was done during the remaining year.

===Later years===
Hörmander mostly remained at [[Lund University]] as professor after 1968, but made several visits to the United States during the two next decades. He visited the Courant Institute in 1970, and also the Institute for Advanced Study in 1971 and during the academic year 1977–1978 when a special year in [[microlocal analysis]] was held. He also visited Stanford in 1971, 1977 and 1982, and the [[University of California, San Diego]] in the winter 1990. He was briefly director of the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] in Stockholm between 1984 and 1986, but only accepted a two-year appointment as he "suspected that the administrative duties would not agree well" with him, and found that "the hunch was right". He also served as vice president of the [[International Mathematical Union]] between 1987 and 1990. Hörmander retired [[professor emeritus|emeritus]] in Lund in January 1996. In 2006 he was honored with the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] from the [[American Mathematical Society]].

He was made a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1968. In 1970 he gave a plenary address (Linear Differential Operators) at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in [[Nice]].

He received the 1988 [[Wolf Prize]] "for fundamental work in modern analysis, in particular, the application of [[pseudo-differential operator|pseudo differential]] and [[Fourier integral]] operators to linear partial differential equations".{{ref|wolf2}}

In 2012 he was selected as a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]], but died on 25 November 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=6004 |title=In Memoriam of Lars Hörmander |publisher=University of Lund |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110084802/http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=6004 |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the list of fellows was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important publications==
His book ''Linear Partial Differential Operators'', which largely was the cause for his Fields Medal, has been described as "the first major account of this theory". It was published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] in 1963 as part of the ''[[Grundlehren]]'' series.

Hörmander devoted five years to compiling the four-volume [[monograph]], ''The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators'', first published between 1983 and 1985. A follow-up of his ''Linear Partial Differential Operators'', it "illustrate[d] the vast expansion of the subject"{{ref|auth}} over the past 20 years, and is considered the "standard of the field".{{ref|wolf3}} In addition to these works, he has written a recognised introduction to 
[[several complex variables]] based on his 1964 Stanford lectures, and wrote the entries on [[differential equation]]s in [[Nationalencyklopedin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6969">In mathematics, the '''Levi-Civita field''', named after [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], is a [[non-Archimedean ordered field]]; i.e., a system of numbers containing infinite and [[infinitesimal]] quantities. Each member &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as a formal series of the form

: &lt;math&gt;
 a = \sum_{q\in\mathbb{Q}} a_q\varepsilon^q ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_q&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is to be interpreted as a positive infinitesimal.  The [[support (mathematics)|support]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the set of indices of the nonvanishing coefficients &lt;math&gt;\{q\in\mathbb{Q}:a_q\neq 0\},&lt;/math&gt; must be a left-finite set: for any member of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, there are only finitely many members of the set less than it; this restriction is necessary in order to make multiplication and division well defined and unique. The ordering is defined according to the dictionary ordering of the list of coefficients, which is equivalent to the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal.

The [[real number]]s are embedded in this field as series in which all of the coefficients vanish except &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* &lt;math&gt;7\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal that is greater than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but less than every positive real number.
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2&lt;/math&gt; is less than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and is also less than &lt;math&gt;r\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any positive real &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; differs infinitesimally from 1.
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but still less than every positive real number.
* &lt;math&gt;1/\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is greater than any real number.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon+\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^2+\cdots+\frac{1}{n!}\varepsilon^n+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;e^\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon + 2\varepsilon^2 + \cdots + n!\varepsilon^n + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; is a valid member of the field, because the series is to be construed formally, without any consideration of [[convergent series|convergence]].

==Definition of the field operations and positive cone==

If &lt;math&gt;f=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}f_q \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}g_q \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt; are two Levi-Civita series, then 
* their sum &lt;math&gt;f+g&lt;/math&gt; is the pointwise sum &lt;math&gt;f+g:=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}(f_q+g_q) \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt;.
* their product &lt;math&gt;fg&lt;/math&gt; is the Cauchy product &lt;math&gt;fg:=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}\sum \limits_{a+b=q}(f_ag_b) \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt;.
(One can check that the support of this series is left-finite and that for each of its elements &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\{(a,b) \in \mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}: \ a+b=q \wedge f_a \neq 0 \wedge g_b \neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so the product is well defined.)
* the relation &lt;math&gt;0&lt;f&lt;/math&gt; holds if &lt;math&gt;f\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty support) and the least non-zero coefficient of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly positive.

Equipped with those operations and order, the Levi-Civita field is indeed an ordered field extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where the series &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a positive infinitesimal.

==Properties and applications==
The Levi-Civita field is [[real-closed field|real-closed]], meaning that it can be [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] by adjoining an [[imaginary unit]] (''i''), or by letting the coefficients be [[complex number|complex]]. It is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented using [[floating point]]. 
It is the basis of [[automatic differentiation]], a way to perform differentiation in cases that are intractable by symbolic differentiation or finite-difference methods.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, Martin Berz "[http://www2.physics.umanitoba.ca/u/khodr/Publications/RS-Overview-offprints.pdf Analysis on the Levi-Civita Field: A Brief Overview]", ''Contemporary Mathematics'', '''508''' pp 215-237 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Levi-Civita field is also [[Cauchy complete]], meaning that relativizing the &lt;math&gt;\forall \exists\forall&lt;/math&gt; definitions of Cauchy sequence and convergent sequence to sequences of Levi-Civita series, each Cauchy sequence in the field converges. Equivalently, it has no proper dense ordered field extension.

As an ordered field, it has a natural [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] given by the rational exponent corresponding to the first non zero coefficient of a Levi-Civita series. The valuation ring is that of series bounded by real numbers, the residue field is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and the value group is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Q},+)&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting valued field is [[Henselian]] (being real closed with a convex valuation ring) but not [[spherically complete]]. Indeed, the field of [[Hahn series]] with real coefficients and value group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Q},+)&lt;/math&gt; is a proper immediate extension, containing series such as &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon^{1/2}+\varepsilon^{2/3}+\varepsilon^{3/4}+\varepsilon^{4/5}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; which are not in the Levi-Civita field.

==Relations to other ordered fields==

The Levi-Civita field is the Cauchy-completion of the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Puiseux series]] over the field of real numbers, that is, it is a dense extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; without proper dense extension. Here is a list of some of its notable proper subfields and its proper ordered field extensions:

===Notable subfields===
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; of fractions of real polynomials with infinitesimal positive indeterminate &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}((\varepsilon))&lt;/math&gt; of [[Formal power series#Formal Laurent series|formal Laurent series]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; of Puiseux series over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Notable extensions===
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[[\varepsilon^{\mathbb{Q}}]]&lt;/math&gt; of Hahn series with real coefficients and rational exponents.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; of [[transseries|logarithmic-exponential transseries]].
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}(\varepsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt; of [[surreal numbers]] with birthdate below the first [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-number]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Fields of hyperreal numbers constructed as ultrapowers of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; modulo a free ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (although here the embeddings are not canonical).

In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''log-space reduction''' is a [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] computable by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] using [[logarithmic space]]. Conceptually, this means it can keep a constant number of pointers into the input, along with a logarithmic number of fixed-size integers.&lt;ref name=AB88&gt;Arora &amp; Barak (2009) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that such a machine may not have space to write down its own output, so the only requirement is that any given bit of the output be computable in log-space. Formally, this reduction is executed via a [[log-space transducer]].

Such a machine has polynomially-many configurations, so log-space reductions are also [[polynomial-time reduction]]s.  However, log-space reductions are probably weaker than polynomial-time reductions; while any non-empty, non-full language in [[P (complexity)|P]] is polynomial-time reducible to any other non-empty, non-full language in P, a log-space reduction between a language in [[NL (complexity)|NL]] and a language in [[L (complexity)|L]], both subsets of P, would imply the unlikely L = NL. It is an open question if the [[NP-complete]] problems are different with respect to log-space and polynomial-time reductions.

Log-space reductions are normally used on languages in P, in which case it usually does not matter whether [[many-one reduction]]s or [[Turing reduction]]s are used, since it has been verified that L, [[SL (complexity)|SL]], NL, and P are all closed under Turing reductions{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, meaning that Turing reductions can be used to show a problem is in any of these classes. However, other subclasses of P such as [[NC (complexity)|NC]] may not be closed under Turing reductions, and so many-one reductions must be used{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

Just as polynomial-time reductions are useless within P and its subclasses, log-space reductions are useless to distinguish problems in L and its subclasses; in particular, every non-empty, non-full problem in L is trivially L-[[Complete (complexity)|complete]] under log-space reductions. While even weaker reductions exist, they are not often used in practice, because complexity classes smaller than L (that is, strictly contained or thought to be strictly contained in L) receive relatively little attention.

The tools available to designers of log-space reductions have been greatly expanded by the result that L = SL; see [[SL (complexity)|SL]] for a list of some SL-complete problems that can now be used as subroutines in log-space reductions.

[[File:CAPM-SML.svg|thumb|274px|return versus beta]]
The '''low-volatility anomaly'''&lt;ref group=Note name=Note01/&gt; is the observation that portfolios of low-volatility stocks have higher risk-adjusted returns than portfolios with high-volatility stocks in most markets studied. The [[capital asset pricing model]] made some predictions of return versus beta. First, return should be a linear function of beta, and nothing else. Also, the return of a stock with average beta should be the average return of stocks (this is easy to show given the first assumption). Second, the intercept should be equal to the risk-free rate. Then the slope can be computed from these two points. Almost immediately these predictions were challenged on the grounds that they are empirically not true. Studies find that the correct slope is either less than predicted, not significantly different from zero, or even negative. Also, additional factors are predictive of return independent of beta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/BettingAgainstBeta.pdf|title=Betting Against Beta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black proposed a theory where there is a zero-beta return which is different from the risk-free return. This fits the data better since the zero-beta return is different from the risk-free return. It still presumes, on principle, that there is higher return for higher beta.

The low-volatility anomaly has now been found in the United States over an 85-year period and in global markets for at least the past 20 years.{{When|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepointfinancial.com/sites/sagepointfinancial.com/files/SPF-2-EC-0514-P.pdf|title=Low Risk, High Return? - May 2014 - SagePoint Financial|publisher=[[SagePoint Financial]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portfolioist.com/2011/07/12/why-low-beta-stocks-are-worth-a-look/|title=Why Low Beta Stocks Are Worth a Look &amp;#124; Portfolio Investing Blog: Portfolioist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investingdaily.com/11369/the-greatest-anomaly-in-finance-low-beta-stocks-outperform/|title=The Greatest Anomaly in Finance: Low-Beta Stocks Outperform|publisher=[[Investing Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research challenging CAPM's underlying assumptions about risk has been mounting for decades.&lt;ref name="Foot01"/&gt;  One challenge was in 1972, when [[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen]], [[Fischer Black|Black]] and [[Myron Scholes|Scholes]] published a study showing what CAPM would look like if one could not borrow at a risk-free rate. Their results indicated that the relationship between beta and realized return was flatter than predicted by CAPM.&lt;ref name="Foot02"/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name=Note02/&gt;

Shortly after, [[Robert Haugen]] and A. James Heins produced a working paper titled “On the Evidence Supporting the Existence of Risk Premiums in the Capital Market”.&lt;ref group=Note name=Note03/&gt;  Studying the period from 1926 to 1971, they concluded that "over the long run stock portfolios with lesser variance in monthly returns have experienced greater average returns than their ‘riskier’ counterparts".&lt;ref name="Foot03"/&gt;

The evidence of the anomaly has been mounting due to numerous studies by both academics and practitioners which confirm the presence of the anomaly throughout the forty years since its initial discovery.&lt;ref group=Note name=Note04/&gt;  Examples include Baker and Haugen (1991),&lt;ref name="Foot04"/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name=Note05/&gt; Chan, Karceski and Lakonishok (1999),&lt;ref name="Foot05"/&gt;  Jangannathan and Ma (2003),&lt;ref name="Foot06"/&gt; Clarke De Silva and Thorley, (2006)&lt;ref name="Foot07"/&gt; and Baker, Bradley and Wurgler (2011).&lt;ref name="Foot08"/&gt;

For a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], a '''maximum cut'''  is a [[cut (graph theory)|cut]] whose size is at least the size of any other cut. The problem of finding a maximum cut in a graph is known as the '''Max-Cut Problem.'''

The problem can be stated simply as follows.  One wants a subset ''S'' of the vertex set such that the number of edges between ''S'' and the complementary subset is as large as possible.

There is a more general version of the problem called '''weighted Max-Cut'''.  In this version each edge has a real number, its '''weight''', and the objective is to maximize not the number of edges but the total weight of the edges between ''S'' and its complement.  The weighted Max-Cut problem is often, but not always, restricted to non-negative weights, because negative weights can change the nature of the problem.

==Computational complexity==

The following [[decision problem]] related to maximum cuts has been studied widely in [[theoretical computer science]]:

:Given a graph ''G'' and an integer ''k'', determine whether there is a cut of size at least ''k'' in ''G''.

This problem is known to be [[NP-complete]]. It is easy to see that the problem is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]: a ''yes'' answer is easy to prove by presenting a large enough cut. The NP-completeness of the problem can be shown, for example, by a reduction from [[maximum 2-satisfiability]] (a restriction of the [[maximum satisfiability problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garey|Johnson|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The weighted version of the decision problem was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Karp|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Karp showed the NP-completeness by a reduction from the [[partition problem]].

The canonical [[optimization problem|optimization variant]] of the above decision problem is usually known as the ''Maximum-Cut Problem'' or ''Max-Cut'' and is defined as:

:Given a graph ''G'', find a maximum cut.

==Polynomial-time algorithms==

As the Max-Cut Problem is NP-hard, no polynomial-time algorithms for Max-Cut in general graphs are known.

However, in [[planar graph]]s, the Maximum-Cut Problem is dual to the [[route inspection problem]] (the problem of finding a shortest tour that visits each edge of a graph at least once), in the sense that the edges that do not belong to a maximum cut-set of a graph ''G'' are the duals of the edges that are doubled in an optimal inspection tour of the [[dual graph]] of ''G''. The optimal inspection tour forms a self-intersecting curve that separates the plane into two subsets, the subset of points for which the [[winding number]] of the curve is even and the subset for which the winding number is odd; these two subsets form a cut that includes all of the edges whose duals appear an odd number of times in the tour. The route inspection problem may be solved in polynomial time, and this duality allows the maximum cut problem to also be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hadlock|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maximum-Bisection problem is known however to be NP-hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jansen|Karpinski|Lingas|Seidel|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximation algorithms==
The Max-Cut Problem is [[Constant-factor approximation algorithm|APX-hard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|Yannakakis|1991}} prove [[MaxSNP]]-completeness.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), arbitrarily close to the optimal solution, for it, unless P = NP. Thus, every polynomial-time approximation algorithm achieves an [[approximation ratio]] strictly less than one.

There is a simple [[Randomized algorithm|randomized]] 0.5-[[approximation algorithm]]: for each vertex flip a coin to decide to which half of the partition to assign it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mitzenmacher|Upfal|2005}}, Sect. 6.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Motwani|Raghavan|1995}}, Sect. 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In expectation, half of the edges are cut edges. This algorithm can be [[derandomization|derandomized]] with the [[method of conditional probabilities]]; therefore there is a simple deterministic polynomial-time 0.5-approximation algorithm as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mitzenmacher|Upfal|2005}}, Sect. 6.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khuller|Raghavachari|Young|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One such algorithm starts with an arbitrary partition of the vertices of the given graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; and repeatedly moves one vertex at a time from one side of the partition to the other, improving the solution at each step, until no more improvements of this type can be made. The number of iterations is at most &lt;math&gt;|E|&lt;/math&gt; because the algorithm improves the cut by at least one edge at each step. When the algorithm terminates, at least half of the edges incident to every vertex belong to the cut, for otherwise moving the vertex would improve the cut. Therefore, the cut includes at least &lt;math&gt;|E|/2&lt;/math&gt; edges.

The polynomial-time approximation algorithm for Max-Cut with the best known approximation ratio is a method by Goemans and Williamson using [[semidefinite programming]] and [[randomized rounding]] that achieves an approximation ratio &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx 0.878&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \tfrac{2}{\pi} \min_{0 \le \theta \le \pi} \tfrac{\theta}{1 - \cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gaur|Krishnamurti|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ausiello|Crescenzi|Gambosi|Kann|2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[unique games conjecture]] is true, this is the best possible approximation ratio for maximum cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Khot|Kindler|Mossel|O'Donnell|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Without such unproven assumptions, it has been proven to be NP-hard to approximate the max-cut value with an approximation ratio better than &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{16}{17} \approx 0.941&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Håstad|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Trevisan|Sorkin|Sudan|Williamson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assessment and treatment algorithm for overweight and obesity.png|thumb|450px|A medical algorithm for assessment and treatment of [[overweight]] and [[obesity]].]]
A '''medical algorithm''' is any [[computation]], [[formula]], [[statistical survey]], [[nomogram]], or [[look-up table]], useful in [[healthcare]].  [[Medical]] [[algorithm]]s include [[decision tree]] approaches to healthcare treatment (e.g., if [[symptom]]s A, B, and C are evident, then use treatment X) and also less clear-cut tools aimed at reducing or defining uncertainty.

==Scope==
Medical algorithms are part of a broader field which is usually fit under the aims of [[medical informatics]] and medical [[decision-making]]. Medical decisions occur in several areas of medical activity including medical test selection, [[diagnosis]], therapy and [[prognosis]], and [[automatic control]] of [[medical equipment]].

In relation to [[logic]]-based and [[artificial neural network]]-based [[clinical decision support system|clinical decision support systems]], which are also computer applications used in the medical decision-making field, algorithms are less complex in architecture, data structure and user interface. Medical algorithms are not necessarily implemented using digital computers. In fact, many of them can be represented on paper, in the form of diagrams, nomographs, etc.

==Examples==
A wealth of medical information exists in the form of published medical algorithms.  These algorithms range from simple [[calculation]]s to complex outcome [[prediction]]s.  Most [[clinician]]s use only a small subset routinely.

Examples of medical algorithms are:
* [[Calculators]], e.g. an on-line or stand-alone calculator for [[body mass index]] (BMI) when stature and body weight are given;
* [[Flowcharts]], e.g. a binary [[decision tree]] for deciding what is the [[etiology]] of [[chest pain]]
* [[Look-up table]]s, e.g. for looking up [[food energy]] and nutritional contents of foodstuffs
* [[Nomogram]]s, e.g. a moving circular slide to calculate body surface area or drug dosages.

A common class of algorithms are embedded in guidelines on the choice of treatments produced by many national, state, financial and local healthcare organisations and provided as knowledge resources for day to day use and for induction of new physicians. A field which has gained particular attention is the choice of medications for psychiatric conditions. In the United Kingdom, guidelines or algorithms for this have been produced by most of the circa 500 primary care trusts, substantially all of the circa 100 secondary care psychiatric units and many of the circa 10 000 general practices. In the US, there is a national (federal) initiative to provide them for all states, and by 2005 six states were adapting the approach of the [[Texas Medication Algorithm Project]] or otherwise working on their production.

A grammar—the [[Arden syntax]]—exists for describing algorithms in terms of [[medical logic module]]s. An approach such as this should allow exchange of MLMs between doctors and establishments, and enrichment of the common stock of tools.

==Purpose==
The intended purpose of medical algorithms is to improve and standardize decisions made in the delivery of [[medical care]]. Medical algorithms assist in standardizing selection and application of treatment regimens, with algorithm [[automation]] intended to reduce potential introduction of errors.  Some attempt to predict the outcome, for example [[ICU scoring systems|critical care scoring systems]].

Computerized health diagnostics algorithms can provide timely clinical decision support, improve adherence to [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]], and be a resource for education and research. 

Medical algorithms based on best practice can assist everyone involved in delivery of standardized treatment via a wide range of clinical care providers. Many are presented as [[Clinical trial protocol|protocol]]s and it is a key task in training to ensure people step outside the protocol when necessary.  In our present state of knowledge, generating hints and producing guidelines may be less satisfying to the authors, but more appropriate.

==Cautions==
In common with most science and medicine, algorithms whose contents are not wholly available for scrutiny and open to improvement should be regarded with suspicion.  

[[Computation]]s obtained from medical algorithms should be compared with, and tempered by, clinical knowledge and [[physician]] judgment.

{{Calculus}}

'''Multivariable calculus''' (also known as '''multivariate calculus''') is the extension of [[calculus]] in one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] to calculus with [[function of several variables|functions of several variables]]: the [[Differential calculus|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]] of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Courant|author2=Fritz John|title=Introduction to Calculus and Analysis Volume II/2|date=14 December 1999|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-66570-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical operations==

===Limits and continuity===
A study of [[limit of a function|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]] in multivariable calculus yields many counter-intuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|19–22}}  For example, there are scalar functions of two variables with points in their domain which give different limits when approached along different paths. E.g., the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
approaches zero, whenever the point {{math|(0,0)}} is approached along lines through the origin {{math|(''y'' {{=}} ''kx'').}}  However, when the origin is approached along a [[parabola]] &lt;math&gt;y=\pm x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the function value has a limit of &lt;math&gt;\pm 0.5&lt;/math&gt;.  Since taking different paths toward the same point yields different limit values, a general limit does not exist there.

Continuity in each argument not being sufficient for '''multivariate continuity''' can also be seen from the following example.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–19}} In particular, for a real-valued function with two real-valued parameters, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for fixed &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not imply continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x,y)=
\begin{cases}
\frac{y}{x}-y &amp; \text{if}\quad 0 \leq y &lt; x \leq 1 \\
\frac{x}{y}-x &amp; \text{if}\quad 0 \leq x &lt; y \leq 1 \\
1-x &amp; \text{if}\quad 0 &lt; x=y \\
0 &amp; \text{everywhere else}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to verify that this function is zero by definition on the boundary and outside of the quadrangle &lt;math&gt;(0,1)\times (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the functions defined for constant {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and &lt;math&gt;\;0 \le a \le 1\;&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;g_a(x) = f(x,a)\quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad h_a(y) = f(a,y)\quad&lt;/math&gt;
are continuous. Specifically,
:&lt;math&gt;g_0(x) = f(x,0) = h_0(0,y) = f(0,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y.}}

However, the sequence &lt;math&gt;f \left(\tfrac{1}{n},\tfrac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (for natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) converges to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}f \left(\tfrac{1}{n},\tfrac{1}{n}\right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, rendering the function as discontinuous at &lt;math&gt;(0,0).&lt;/math&gt; Approaching the origin not along parallels to the ''x''- and ''y''-axis reveals this discontinuity.

===Partial differentiation===
{{main article|Partial derivative}}

The partial derivative generalizes the notion of the derivative to higher dimensions.  A partial derivative of a multivariable function is a derivative with respect to one variable with all other variables held constant.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|26ff}}

Partial derivatives may be combined in interesting ways to create more complicated expressions of the derivative.  In [[vector calculus]], the [[del]] operator (&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;) is used to define the concepts of [[gradient]], [[divergence]], and [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] in terms of partial derivatives.  A matrix of partial derivatives, the '''[[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]''' matrix, may be used to represent the derivative of a function between two spaces of arbitrary dimension.  The derivative can thus be understood as a [[linear transformation]] which directly varies from point to point in the domain of the function.

[[Differential equations]] containing partial derivatives are called [[partial differential equations]] or PDEs.  These equations are generally more difficult to solve than [[ordinary differential equations]], which contain derivatives with respect to only one variable.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|654ff}}

===Multiple integration===
{{main article|Multiple integral}}
The multiple integral expands the concept of the integral to functions of any number of variables. Double and triple integrals may be used to calculate areas and volumes of regions in the plane and in space.  [[Fubini's theorem]] guarantees that a multiple integral may be evaluated as a ''repeated integral'' or ''iterated integral'' as long as the integrand is continuous throughout the domain of integration.&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|367ff}}

The [[surface integral]] and the [[line integral]] are used to integrate over curved [[manifold]]s such as [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s and [[curve]]s.

===Fundamental theorem of calculus in multiple dimensions===
In single-variable calculus, the fundamental theorem of calculus establishes a link between the derivative and the integral.  The link between the derivative and the integral in multivariable calculus is embodied by the integral theorems of vector calculus:&lt;ref name="CourantJohn1999"/&gt;{{rp|543ff}}
* [[Gradient theorem]]
* [[Stokes' theorem#Special cases|Stokes' theorem]]
* [[Divergence theorem]]
* [[Green's theorem]].

In a more advanced study of multivariable calculus, it is seen that these four theorems are specific incarnations of a more general theorem, the generalized [[Stokes' theorem]], which applies to the integration of [[differential forms]] over [[Differentiable manifold|manifolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/SpivakM.CalculusOnManifolds_201703|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=Michael|publisher=W. A. Benjamin, Inc.|year=1965|isbn=9780805390216|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multivariable calculus can be applied to analyze [[deterministic system]]s that have multiple [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]].  Functions with [[independent variable]]s corresponding to each of the degrees of freedom are often used to model these systems, and multivariable calculus provides tools for characterizing the [[system dynamics]].

Multivariate calculus is used in the [[optimal control]] of [[continuous time]] [[dynamic systems]]. It is used in [[regression analysis]] to derive formulas for estimating relationships among various sets of [[empirical data]].

Multivariable calculus is used in many fields of [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]] and [[engineering]] to model and study high-dimensional systems that exhibit deterministic behavior.  In [[economics]], for example, [[consumer choice]] over a variety of goods, and [[profit maximization|producer choice]] over various inputs to use and outputs to produce, are modeled with multivariate calculus. [[Quantitative analyst]]s in [[finance]] also often use multivariate calculus to predict future trends in the [[stock market]].

Non-deterministic, or [[stochastic process|stochastic]] systems can be studied using a different kind of mathematics, such as [[stochastic calculus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">In [[computability theory]] a '''numbering''' is the assignment of [[natural number]]s to a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of objects such as functions, [[rational number]]s, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, or words in some [[language]]. A numbering can be used to transfer the idea of computability and related concepts, which are originally defined on the natural numbers using [[computable function]]s, to these different types of objects.

Common examples of numberings include [[Gödel numbering]]s in [[first-order logic]] and [[admissible numbering]]s of the set of partial computable functions.

== Definition and examples ==
A '''numbering''' of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surjective function|surjective]] [[partial function]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to ''S'' (Ershov 1999:477). The value of a numbering &amp;nu; at a number ''i'' (if defined) is often written &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; instead of the usual &lt;math&gt;\nu(i) \!&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of numberings include:
* The set of all finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a numbering &amp;gamma;, defined so that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and so that, for each finite nonempty set &lt;math&gt;A = \{a_0, \ldots, a_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n_A) = A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n_A = \sum_{i \leq k} 2^{a_i}&lt;/math&gt; (Ershov 1999:477).  This numbering is a bijection. 
* A fixed Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; of the computable partial functions can be used to define a numbering ''W'' of the [[recursively enumerable set]]s, by letting by ''W''(''i'') be the domain of &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This numbering will be surjective (like all numberings) but not injective: there will be distinct numbers that map to the same recursively enumerable set under ''W''.

== Types of numberings ==

A numbering is '''total''' if it is a total function. If the [[domain (function)|domain]] of a partial numbering is [[recursively enumerable]] then there always exists an equivalent total numbering (equivalence of numberings is defined below).

A numbering &amp;eta; is '''decidable''' if the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) : \eta(x) = \eta(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; is a decidable set.

A numbering &amp;eta; is '''single-valued''' if &amp;eta;(''x'') = &amp;eta;(''y'') if and only if ''x''=''y''; in other words if &amp;eta; is an injective function. A single-valued numbering of the set of partial computable functions is called a [[Friedberg numbering]].

== Comparison of numberings ==

There is a [[partial ordering]] on the set of all numberings. Let &lt;math&gt;\nu_1: \subseteq \mathbb{N} \to S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_2: \subseteq \mathbb{N} \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; be two numberings. Then &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''reducible''' to &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2&lt;/math&gt;, 
if 
:&lt;math&gt;\exists f \in \mathbf{P}^{(1)} \, \forall i \in \mathrm{Domain}(\nu_1) : \nu_1(i) = \nu_2 \circ f(i).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \ge \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; then  &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''equivalent''' to &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;; this is written &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \equiv \nu_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Computable numberings ==

When the objects of the set ''S'' are sufficiently "constructive", it is common to look at numberings that can be effectively decoded (Ershov 1999:486). For example, if ''S'' consists of recursively enumerable sets, the numbering &amp;eta; is '''computable''' if the set of pairs (''x'',''y'') where ''y''&amp;isin;&amp;eta;(''x'') is recursively enumerable.  Similarly, a numbering ''g'' of partial functions is computable if the relation ''R''(''x'',''y'',''z'') = "[''g''(''x'')](''y'') = ''z''" is partial recursive (Ershov 1999:487).

A computable numbering is called '''principal''' if every computable numbering of the same set is reducible to it. Both the set of all r.e. subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and the set of all partial computable functions have principle numberings (Ershov 1999:487). A principle numbering of the set of partial recursive functions is known as an [[admissible numbering]] in the literature.

'''Pace count beads''' or '''ranger beads''' is a manual counting tool used to keep track of distance traveled through a [[Pace (unit)|pace count]]. It is used in [[Land navigation (military)|military land navigation]] or [[orienteering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://therucksack.tripod.com/landnav.htm#pacecounting| website=The Rucksack|title = Pace counting with Army Ranger pace counting beads
| first =Michael A| last =Neiger| accessdate = 2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The tool is usually constructed using a set of 13 [[bead]]s on a length of cord. The beads are divided into two sections, separated by a knot. Nine beads are used in the lower section, and four or more beads are used in the upper section. There is often a loop in the upper end, making it possible to attach the tool to the user's gear with a simple [[Larks head]] hitch.

==How to use==
There are two ways to use the beads.  One is to represent the paces the user has walked, while the other is to represent the distance walked. Both methods requires the user to know the relationship between the paces walked and the distance travelled.

===Counting paces===
As users walk, they typically slide one bead on the cord for every ten paces taken. On the tenth pace, the user slides a bead in the lower section towards the knot. After the 90th pace, all nine beads are against the knot. On the 100th pace, all nine beads in the lower section are returned away from the knot, and a bead from the upper section is slid upwards, away from the knot.

In this manner, the user calculates distance traveled by keeping track of paces taken. To use this method, the user must know the length of his pace to accurately calculate distance traveled. Also, the number of paces to be walked must be precalculated (example: 2,112 paces= one mile, based on 30 inch pace) and then the distance traveled has to be calculated from the walked paces.

=== Distance walked ===
For every 100 meters the user walks, one of the lower beads is pulled down. When the ninth of the lower beads is pulled, the user has walked 900 meters. When the user has walked 1000 meters, one of the upper beads is pulled down, and all the lower beads are pulled back up.

Using this method the user must know the number of paces walked in 100 meters. An experienced user can also adapt the pace count for each hundred meters depending on the terrain. When using this method the user does not have to calculate distance from number of paces.

This method can of course be used for non-metric distances as well, though with the beads arranged in a different manner.

'''Privilege revocation''' is the act of an [[entity]] giving up some, or all of, the [[privilege (computing)|privileges]] they possess, or some [[authority]] taking those (privileged) rights away.

== Information theory ==
Honoring the [[Principle of least privilege]] at a granularity provided by the base system such as [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]]ing of (to that point successful) attacks to an unprivileged user account helps in [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of computing services provided by the system. As the chances of restarting such a process are better, and other services on the same machine aren't affected (or at least probably not as much as in the alternative case: i.e. a privileged process gone haywire instead).

== Computer security ==
In [[computing security]] ''privilege revocation'' is a measure taken by a [[Computer program|program]] to protect the [[System software|system]] against misuse of itself.

Privilege revocation is a variant of [[privilege separation]] whereby the program terminates the privileged part immediately after it has served its purpose. If a program doesn't revoke privileges, it risks the [[privilege escalation|escalation of privileges]].

Revocation of privileges is a technique of [[defensive programming]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3576">In [[coding theory]], the '''repetition code''' is one of the most basic [[error-correcting code]]s. In order to transmit a message over a noisy channel that may corrupt the transmission in a few places, the idea of the repetition code is to just repeat the message several times. The hope is that the channel corrupts only a minority of these repetitions. This way the receiver will notice that a transmission error occurred since the received data stream is not the repetition of a single message, and moreover, the receiver can recover the original message by looking at the received message in the data stream that occurs most often.

Because of the bad error correcting performance and the low ratio between information symbols and actually transmitted symbols, other [[Error correcting codes|error correction codes]] are preferred in most cases. The chief attraction of the repetition code is the ease of implementation.

==Code parameters==
In the case of a binary repetition code, there exist two code words - all ones and all zeros - which have a length of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the minimum [[Hamming distance]] of the code equals its length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the repetition code an error correcting capacity of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. it will correct up to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; errors in any code word).

If the length of a binary repetition code is odd, then it's a [[perfect code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Channel Coding for Telecommunications|last=Bossert|first=Martin|publisher=Wiley|year=1999|isbn=9780471982777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The binary repetition code of length 3 is equivalent to the (3,1)-[[Hamming code]].

==Example==
Let's consider a binary repetition code of length 3. The user wants to transmit the information bits &lt;code&gt;101&lt;/code&gt;. Then the encoding maps each bit either to the all ones or all zeros code word, so we get the &lt;code&gt;111 000 111&lt;/code&gt;, which will be transmitted.

Let's say three errors corrupt the transmitted bits and the received sequence is &lt;code&gt;111 010 100&lt;/code&gt;. Decoding is usually done by a simple [[Majority logic decoding|majority decision]] for each code word. That lead us to &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; as the decoded information bits, because in the first and second code word occurred less than two errors, so the majority of the bits are correct. But in the third code word two bits are corrupted, which results in an erroneous information bit, since two errors lie above the error correcting capacity.

==Applications==
Despite their poor performance as stand-alone codes, use in [[Turbo code]]-like iteratively decoded [[concatenated error correction codes|concatenated coding]] schemes, such as [[repeat-accumulate code|repeat-accumulate]] (RA) and accumulate-repeat-accumulate (ARA) codes, allows for surprisingly good error correction performance.

Repetition codes are one of the few known codes whose [[code rate]] can be automatically adjusted to varying [[channel capacity]], by sending more or less parity information as required to overcome the channel noise, and it is the only such code known for non-[[binary erasure channel|erasure channel]]s. Practical adaptive codes for erasure channels have been invented only recently, and are known as [[fountain code]]s.

Some [[UART]]s, such as the ones used in the [[FlexRay]] protocol, use a majority filter to ignore brief noise spikes. This spike-rejection filter can be seen as a kind of repetition decoder.

'''Rounding''' a [[numerical value]] means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation; for example, replacing ${{formatnum:23.4476}} with ${{formatnum:23.45}}, or the fraction 312/941 with 1/3, or the expression {{radic|2}} with {{formatnum:1.414}}.

Rounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to [[report]] and [[communicate]] than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid [[overprecision|misleadingly precise]] reporting of a computed number, [[measurement]] or [[estimate]]; for example, a quantity that was computed as {{formatnum:123456}} but is known to be [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about {{formatnum:123500}}".

On the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some [[round-off error]] in the reported result.  Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations – especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or [[fixed-point arithmetic]]; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] representation with a fixed number of [[significant digit]]s.  In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally [[Propagation of uncertainty|accumulate]], and in certain [[ill-conditioned]] cases they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "[[#Table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]".

Rounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s.

A wavy [[equals sign]] (&lt;big&gt;'''[[≈]]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;!-- unicode U+2248 --&gt;: ''approximately equal to'') is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 0.75 ≈ 1. This sign was introduced by [[Alfred George Greenhill]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Lankham, [[Bruno Nachtergaele]], [[Anne Schilling]]: ''Linear Algebra as an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics.'' World Scientific, Singapur 2016, {{ISBN|978-981-4730-35-8}}, S. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideal characteristics of rounding methods include:

# Rounding should be done by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.
# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.
#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].
# To be considered rounding, the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] will be a subset of the [[Domain of a function|domain]]. Additionally, the range will have [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt;or less. The classical range is the integers, '''[[Integer|Z]]'''
# Rounding should preserve [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] domain) this translates to removing [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].
# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.

But, because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many methods exist.

As a general rule, rounding is [[Idempotence|idempotent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulisch|first1=Ulrich|date=July 1977|title=Mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=C-26|pages=610–621|doi=10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., once a number has been rounded, rounding it again will not change its value. In practice, rounding functions are also [[Monotonic function|monotonic]].

== Rounding to integer ==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument "round()" procedure. These are true functions with the exception of those that are random-based.

=== Directed rounding to an integer ===
These four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number {{var|x}} to the rounded value {{var|y}} are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[Extended real number line|+∞]], or −∞). Directed rounding is used in [[Interval arithmetic]] and is often required in financial calculations.

If {{var|x}} is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero.  If {{var|x}} is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if {{var|x}} is integer, {{var|y}} is just {{var|x}}.

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]] in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author=Nicholas J. Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0-89871-521-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the examples below, {{math|sgn(''x'')}} refers to the [[sign function]] applied to the original number, {{math|''x''}}.

==== Rounding down ====
* '''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the largest integer that does not exceed {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{floor}(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding up ====
* '''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''',  or '''round towards plus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the smallest integer that is not less than {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{ceil}(x) = \left\lceil x \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding towards zero ====
* '''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the integer part of {{var|x}}, without its fraction digits.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{truncate}(x) = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding away from zero ====
* '''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is {{var|x}}; else {{var|y}} is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that {{var|x}} is between 0 and {{var|y}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rounding to the nearest integer===
Rounding a number {{var|x}} to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when {{var|x}} is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5.

If it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down by the same amount.

When rounding a large set of [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] numbers with [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]] fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the [[expectation (mathematics)|expected]] (average) value of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when we remove numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set. 

In practice [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] numbers are typically used which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.

==== Round half up ====
The following tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards positive infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines.{{citation needed|reason=This is surprising. A confusion with ''round half away from zero''?|date=June 2017}} That is, half-way values of {{var|x}} are always rounded up.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lfloor x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x - 0.5 \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{\lfloor 2x \rfloor}{2} \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

For example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

However, some programming languages (such as Java, Python) define their ''half up'' as ''[[#Round half away from zero|round half away from zero]]'' here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=java.math.RoundingMode|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP|publisher=Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=decimal — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes|publisher=Python Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in [[2's complement]] and similar representations.

==== Round half down ====
One may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards negative infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lceil x - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{\lceil 2x \rceil}{2} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

==== Round half towards zero ====
One may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the conventional ''round half away from zero''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|y}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias towards zero.

==== Round half away from zero ====
The other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This can be more efficient on binary computers because only the first omitted bit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up (on a 1) or down (on a 0). This is one method used when rounding to [[significant figures]] due to its simplicity.

This method, also known as '''commercial rounding''',  treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

==== Round half to even ====
A tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias ''and'' without bias toward/away from zero is '''round half to even'''.   By this convention, if the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the even integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, as does +24.5; while −23.5 becomes −24, as does −24.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', '''odd–even rounding''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603082624/http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf Engineering Drafting Standards Manual] (NASA), X-673-64-1F, p90&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bankers' rounding'''.

This is the default rounding mode used in [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] computing functions and operators (see also [[Nearest integer function]]), and the more sophisticated mode used when rounding to significant figures.

By eliminating bias, repeated rounded addition or subtraction of independent numbers will give a result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly. See [[Random walk#One-dimensional random walk|random walk]] for more.

However, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.

==== Round half to odd ====
A similar tie-breaking rule is '''round half to odd'''.  In this approach, if the fraction of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the odd integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, as does +22.5; while −23.5 becomes −23, as does −22.5.

This method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero.

This variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With ''round half to even'', a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small {{em|denormal}} value would round to a normal non-zero value.  Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for even-based number systems (such as binary and decimal).{{clarify|reason=The ''problem'' would be avoided only for halfway numbers. So, how can this be useful in practice? Any practical example?|post-text=(see [[Talk:Rounding#Round half to odd|talk]])|date=September 2017}}

=== Random-based rounding of an integer ===
==== Alternating tie-breaking ====
One method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

* Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; and so on. (Alternatively the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a [[random seed]].)

If occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence "counting" then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.

==== Random tie-breaking ====

* If the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, choose {{var|y}} randomly among {{nowrap|{{var|x}} + 0.5}} and {{nowrap|{{var|x}} − 0.5}}, with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

Like round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd {{var|y}} values. The advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on 0.5 fractional part does not have to be "remembered".
==== Stochastic rounding ====
Rounding as follows to one of the closest straddling integers with a probability dependent on the proximity is called [[stochastic]] rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.&lt;ref name=stochastic&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision|arxiv=1502.02551 |first1=Suyog|last1=Gupta |first2=Ankur|last2=Angrawl |first3=Kailash|last3=Gopalakrishnan |first4=Pritish|last4=Narayanan |page=3 |date=9 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Round} (x) = \begin{cases}
 \lfloor x \rfloor &amp; \text { with probability } 1 - (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) \\
 \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 &amp; \text { with probability } {x - \lfloor x \rfloor}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.

Stochastic rounding is accurate in a way that a rounding [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can never be. For example, say you started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in [[machine learning]] where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively.&lt;ref name=stochastic /&gt; Stochastic rounding is a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.

== Rounding to other values ==
=== Rounding to a specified multiple ===
The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc.

In general, rounding a number {{var|x}} to a multiple of some specified positive value {{var|m}} entails the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToMultiple}(x, m) = \mathrm{round}(x/m) \times m&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rounding {{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing 2.1784/0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;217.84, then rounding that to 218, and finally computing 218&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.18.

When rounding to a predetermined number of [[significant figure|significant digits]], the increment {{var|m}} depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment {{var|m}} is normally a finite fraction in whatever [[number system]] is used to represent the numbers.  For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal number|decimal number system]] (that is, {{var|m}} is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary number system]] ({{var|m}} is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument "round()" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument "roundToMultiple()" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value {{var|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

=== Logarithmic rounding ===
==== Rounding to a specified power ====
Rounding to a specified ''power'' is very different from rounding to a specified ''multiple''; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2.  The steps, in general, to round a positive number {{var|x}} to a power of some specified integer {{var|b}} greater than 1, are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToPower}(x, b) = b^{\mathrm{round}(\log_b x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Many of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.

==== Scaled rounding ====
This type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified power|rounding to a specified power]]. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.

For example, resistors are supplied with [[preferred number]]s on a logarithmic scale. For example, for resistors with 10% accuracy they are supplied with nominal values 100,  121,  147,  178,  215 etc. If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then log(147)=2.167, log(165)=2.217 and log(178)=2.250. The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 178 therefore a 178 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.

Whether a value {{math|''x'' ∈ (''a'', ''b'')}} rounds to {{var|a}} or {{var|b}} depends upon whether the squared value {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is greater than or less than the product {{math|''ab''}}.  The value 165 rounds to 178 in the resistors example because {{math|1=165&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 27225}} is greater than {{math|1=147 × 178 = 26166}}.

=== Floating-point rounding ===
In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value {{var|x}} into a value {{var|y}} with a specified number of {{em|significant}} digits.  In other words, {{var|y}} should be a multiple of a number {{var|m}} that depends on the magnitude of {{var|x}}.  The number {{var|m}} is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor {{var|s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and an integer base {{var|b}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when "rounding away from zero", or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if {{var|x}} is negative), when "rounding towards zero". The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to nearest'' is always the appropriate infinity.

=== Rounding to a simple fraction ===
In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number {{var|x}} to a "neat" fraction — that is, the nearest fraction {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|m}}/{{var|n}} whose numerator {{var|m}} and denominator {{var|n}} do not exceed a given maximum.  This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit {{var|m}}.  This problem is related to [[Farey sequence]]s, the [[Stern–Brocot tree]], and [[Continued fraction#Best rational approximations|continued fractions]].

=== Rounding to an available value ===
Finished [[lumber]], writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then "round" to some standard size using phrases such as "round down to nearest standard value", "round up to nearest standard value", or "round to nearest standard value".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf "Zener Diode Voltage Regulators"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/tester-3.html "Build a Mirror Tester"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a set of [[preferred value]]s is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest [[preferred value]] to any given value can be seen as a form of [[#Scaled rounding|scaled rounding]]. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trump, Christine Schneider.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rounding in other contexts ==
=== Dithering and error diffusion ===
When digitizing [[continuous signal]]s, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, [[dithering]], and a related technique, [[error diffusion]], are normally used. A related technique called [[pulse-width modulation]] is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.

Error diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.

As a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|0.9204}}, {{math|0.7451}}, and {{math|0.3091}} occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}.  In this case the cumulative sums, {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|1=1.8881 = 0.9677 + 0.9204}}, {{math|1=2.6332 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451}}, and {{math|1=2.9423 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451 + 0.3091}}, are each rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1.89}}, {{math|2.63}}, and {{math|2.94}}.  The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1=0.92 = 1.89 − 0.97}}, {{math|1=0.74 = 2.63 − 1.89}}, and {{math|1=0.31 = 2.94 − 2.63}}.

=== Monte Carlo arithmetic ===
Monte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in [[Monte Carlo method]]s where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate how stable the computation is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/mca/CSD-970014.ps.gz|title=Monte Carlo Arithmetic: a framework for the statistical analysis of roundoff errors|last1=Parker|first1=D Stott|last2=Eggert|first2=Paul R.|date=28 March 2000|publisher=IEEE Computation in Science and Engineering|last3=Pierce|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exact computation with rounded arithmetic ===
It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with integer domain and range.  For example, if we know that an integer {{var|n}} is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting {{var|n}} to a floating-point value {{var|z}}, computing the approximate square root {{var|x}} of {{var|z}} with floating point, and then rounding {{var|x}} to the nearest integer {{var|y}}.  If {{var|n}} is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in {{var|x}} will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value {{var|y}} will be the exact square root of {{var|n}}.  This is essentially why [[Slide rule|slide rules]] could be used for exact arithmetic.
=== Double rounding ===
{{Anchor|Sticky rounding|Rounding to odd}}
Rounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding.&lt;ref&gt;Another case where double rounding always leads to the same value as directly rounding to the final precision is when the radix is odd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borman|first1=Phil|last2=Chatfield|first2=Marion|title=Avoid the perils of using rounded data|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|date=10 November 2015|volume=115|pages=506–507|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2015.07.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708515300753}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.

In ''Martinez v. Allstate'' and ''Sendejo v. Farmers'', litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain |author=Deborah R. Hensler |pages=255–293 | isbn=0-8330-2601-1 |publisher=RAND| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computer languages and the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard dictate that in straightforward calculations the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with [[x87]] floating point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a [[strictfp]] qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.

In some algorithms, an intermediate result is computed and rounded and then, after more computation, must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding error can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding precision for the intermediate computation and/or by using a proven rounding method for intermediate and final rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=J Strother|last2=Lynch|first2=Tom|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Matt|date=1996|title=A mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the kernel of the AMD5K86 floating-point division algorithm|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/divide_paper.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=47|citeseerx=10.1.1.43.3309|doi=10.1109/12.713311|accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00080427v2/document |title=Emulation of a FMA and correctly-rounded sums: proved algorithms using rounding to odd |last1=Boldo |first1=Sylvie |last2=Melquiond |first2=Guillaume |date=2008 |website=HAL - Inria |format=PDF |doi=10.1109/TC.2007.70819 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21718#c25|title=21718 – real.c rounding not perfect|author=|date=|website=gcc.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Table-maker's dilemma ===
[[William Kahan]] coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} correctly rounded for {{em|every}} two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary [[transcendental function]]s mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it {{em|correctly}} to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kahan |first=William |title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[IEEE 754|IEEE floating-point standard]] guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, [[fused multiply–add]], square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.

Using the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] and [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |id={{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print) --&gt; |chapter=Chapter 12: Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programming packages offer correct rounding. The [[MPFR|GNU MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in double precision:
* [[IBM]]'s libultim, in rounding to nearest only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libultim.3|title=libultim – ultimate correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sun Microsystems]]'s libmcr, in the 4 rounding modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libmcr.3|title=libmcr – correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CRlibm, written in the old Arénaire team (LIP, [[ENS Lyon]]). It supports the 4 rounding modes and is proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027224938/http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm|archivedate=2016-10-27|title=CRlibm – Correctly Rounded mathematical library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist [[computable number]]s for which a rounded value can never be determined no matter how many digits are calculated. Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the [[halting problem]]. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but [[unprovable]], then the result of rounding the following value up to the next integer cannot be determined: 10&lt;sup&gt;−{{var|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; where {{var|n}} is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0 if there is no such number. The result is 1 if such a number exists and 0 if no such number exists. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

=== Interaction with string searches ===
Rounding can adversely affect a string search for a number.  For example, {{math|''π''}} rounded to four digits is "3.1416" but a simple search for this string will not discover "3.14159" or any other value of {{math|''π''}} rounded to more than four digits.  In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for "3.1415", which is {{math|''π''}} truncated to four digits, will discover values of {{math|''π''}} truncated to more than four digits.

== History ==
The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division.  Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. "YBC 7289 clay tablet". 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rounded approximations to [[pi|π]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient—see [[base 60#Examples|base 60 examples]].

The ''round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940.  The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory.  In the 1906 fourth edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=05170001&amp;view=50&amp;frames=0&amp;seq=48|title=Probability and theory of errors|author=|date=|website=historical.library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Simpson Woodward]] called this "the computer's rule" indicating that it was then in common use by [[human computer]]s who calculated mathematical tables. [[Churchill Eisenhart]] indicated the practice was already "well established" in data analysis by the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Production and Management Engineering|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=187–223|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedtechniqu00colu|author=Churchill Eisenhart|editors=Eisenhart, Hastay and Wallis|accessdate=30 January 2014|chapter=Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the term ''bankers' rounding'' remains more obscure.  If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find.  To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts''&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that "half-way" amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of [[interval arithmetic]].

Currently, tendency to round around 5 or 2 is used in the number of research. To be more precise [[age heaping]] was used in the number of studies by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]], to evaluate the numeracy level of the ancient populations. He came up with [[ABCC index]], which enables the comparison of the [[numeracy]] among regions possible without any historical sources where the population [[literacy]] was measured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capita |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=2009 |volume=69 |pages=783-808}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Rounding functions in programming languages ==
Most [[programming language]]s provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways.  The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero).  This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an [[integer (computing)|integer]] [[variable (programming)|variable]], or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array data type|array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard [[library (computing)|libraries]] of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and towards zero).  The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer.  Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[Double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary.  This approach may avoid spurious [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]] since floating-point types have a larger range than integer types.  Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300.  In addition, many languages provide a [[printf]] or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision'').  On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

On the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and in their [[Interface description language|IDL]] interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[JavaScript]] or [[ECMAScript]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification|author=|date=|website=ecma-international.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; interface bindings).

== Other rounding standards ==
Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

===US weather observations===
In a guideline issued in mid-1966,&lt;ref&gt;OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm |date=1999-04-20 }}, Washington, DC., 104 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the "round half up" tie-breaking rule.  For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1.  Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was "round half away from zero".

=== Negative zero in meteorology ===
{{main|Signed zero#Scientific uses}}

Some [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write "&amp;minus;0" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and &amp;minus;0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer.  This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the [[Celsius]] scale, where below zero indicates freezing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== byte values ===
Because digital information is stored in binary format, computer memory is usually produced in sizes which are a power of 2.  So a common size is 1024 bytes (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), and this can be referred to as 1 [[kilobyte]].  Similarly, {{formatnum:1048576}} (2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) can be referred to as 1 [[megabyte]].  This may or may not be considered rounding.  More information on the different representations is on the entry for [[kilobyte]].

'''''Seances''''' is a 2016 interactive project by filmmaker and installation artist [[Guy Maddin]], co-creators Evan and Galen Johnson, and the [[National Film Board of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/press-room/press-releases-media-kits/?idpres=21002&lt;/ref&gt; combining Maddin's recreations of [[lost film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with an algorithmic film generator that allows for multiple storytelling permutations.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/seances-guy-maddins-film-generator-is-an-endless-cinematic-experience/article29825665/|title=Seances: Guy Maddin’s film generator is an endless cinematic experience|last=Green|first=Robert-Everett|date=2 May 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phi-centre.com/en/events/id/Seances|title=Seances Guy Maddin|date=2013|publisher=''PHI''|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddin began the project in 2012 in Paris, France, shooting footage for 18 films at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (this installation was titled ''Spiritismes'', the French word for “seances,” leading to press confusion about the project title)&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonathanball.com/guy-maddin-on-the-forbidden-room-and-writing-melodrama/|title=Guy Maddin on The Forbidden Room and Writing Melodrama |date=2014-12-05|last=ball|first=Jonathan|work=Dr. Jonathan Ball: Writing the Wrong Way (interview with Guy Maddin)|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued shooting footage for an additional 12 films at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"/&gt; The Paris and Montreal shoots each took three weeks, with Maddin completing one short film of approximately 15-20 minutes each day.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/97888-guy-maddin-on-the-saddest-music-in-the-world-and-his-interactive-seances/#.VxfCKPkrLq4|title=Guy Maddin on The Saddest Music in The World and His Interactive Seances (interview)|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|date=29 March 2016|work=Filmmaker Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoots were also presented as art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a “séance” during which Maddin "invite[d] the spirit of a lost photoplay to possess them."&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy"/&gt;

==Production history==

''Seances'' grew out of Maddin’s ''Hauntings'' project. Noah Cowan, a former director of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], told Maddin “he didn’t think it was possible to make art on the Internet,” which “reminded [Maddin] of what people said about cinema when it was starting out, when the moviolas and kinetoscopes were considered artless novelties.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin began with the idea of “shooting adaptations of lost films” and originally conceived the project as making “title-for-title remakes of specific lost films” but altered this plan in favour of producing original material as the project developed. Maddin completed 11 films to show as installation loops for Noah Cowan and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]’s Bell Lightbox theatre for this 2010 ''Hauntings'' project.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

At the [[SXSW]] 2012 festival, Maddin announced that he had begun production on the ''Seances'' project, for which he would shoot one hundred short films within a hundred-day span, at locations in Canada, France, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sxsw-12-interview-guy-maddin-talks-making-100-short-films-in-100-days-in-four-countries-with-current-project-spiritismes|title=SXSW '12 Interview: Guy Maddin Talks Making 100 Short Films In 100 Days In Four Countries With Current Project 'Spiritismes'|date=2012-03-16|work=Interview|publisher=''The Playlist''|accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maddin abandoned this approach to the project to focus more fully on original script creation, partnering with writers [[Evan Johnson]] and [[Robert Kotyk]], with additional writing by Maddin’s wife [[Kim Morgan]] and American poet [[John Ashbery]].&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin and Johnson also co-directed and shot, concurrently, a feature film titled ''[[The Forbidden Room (2015 film)|The Forbidden Room]]'', with the same writers. Although often misreported as the same project, ''The Forbidden Room'' “is a feature film with its own separate story and stars” while “''Seances'' will be an interactive Internet project.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt; Many of the actors in ''Seances'' also appear in ''The Forbidden Room''.

==Algorithmic storytelling==
Each viewer sees a unique film. Software designed by Halifax-based Nickel Media utilizes an [[algorithmic art|algorithm]] to create the narrative from scenes shot by Maddin, to form a 10- to 13-minute film, each with a unique title.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; The number of films ensures "hundreds of billions of unique permutations."&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Allan|title=Guy Maddin’s performance art installation Seances begins filming in Montreal|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2013/07/04/guy_maddins_performance_art_installation_seances_begins_filming_in_montreal.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan"&gt;Romney, Jonathan. "A Canadian in Paris." ''Sight &amp; Sound'' (May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
''Seances'' was launched on April 14, online and as part of [[Tribeca Film Festival]]’s Storyscapes program.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; 

==List of "resurrected" films==
In addition to reimagining lost films, Maddin is also "resurrecting" projects that were planned but never filmed. Maddin has stated that he will not be parodying or otherwise mimicking the approach of the directors whose films he is reenvisioning, but rather tried to capture the imagined "spirits of the films, rather than of their directors."&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan" /&gt; Films will not be shown in their entirety, but rather, offered as fragments in order to be recombined online.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

'''Shmuel Safra''' ({{lang-he|שמואל ספרא}}) is an Israeli computer scientist. He is a Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Israel]]. He was born in [[Jerusalem]].

Safra's research areas include [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[automata theory]]. His work in Complexity Theory includes the classification of approximation problems—showing them [[NP-hard]] even for weak factors of approximation—and the theory of [[PCP (complexity)|probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP)]] and the [[PCP theorem]], which gives stronger characterizations of the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], via a membership proof that can be verified reading only a constant number of its bits.

His work on automata theory investigates determinization and complementation of [[Finite state machine|finite automata]] over infinite strings, in particular, the complexity of such translation for [[Büchi automaton|Büchi automata]], [[Streett automaton|Streett automata]] and [[Rabin automaton|Rabin automata]].

In 2001, Safra won the [[Gödel Prize]] in theoretical computer science for his papers "Interactive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques" and "Probabilistic Checking of Proofs: A New Characterization of NP".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">In [[mathematical analysis]], a '''strong measure zero set'''&lt;ref name=Borel/&gt; is a subset ''A'' of the [[real line]] with the following property:
:for every sequence (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of positive reals there exists a sequence (''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') of [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s such that |''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' and ''A'' is contained in the union of the ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
(Here |''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| denotes the length of the interval ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.)

Every [[countable set]] is a strong measure zero set, and so is every union of countably many strong measure zero sets. Every strong measure zero set has [[Lebesgue measure]] 0. The [[Cantor set]] is an example of an uncountable set of Lebesgue measure 0 which is not of strong measure zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Set Theory: The Third Millennium Edition, Revised and Expanded |first=Thomas |last= Jech |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTAl997XDb4C&amp;pg=PA539&amp;dq=cantor+set+strong+measure+zero&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b03EVN7BEIuayQTB54KYDw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cantor%20set%20strong%20measure%20zero&amp;f=false |page=539 |isbn=3540440852 |edition=3rd |series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Émile Borel|Borel's]] conjecture'''&lt;ref name=Borel&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Borel |title=Sur la classification des ensembles de mesure nulle |journal=Bull. Soc. Math. France |volume=47 |issue= |pages=97–125 |year=1919 |doi= |url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/BSMF_1919__47__97_0.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that every strong measure zero set is countable. It is now known that this statement is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC]] (the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory, which is the standard axiom system assumed in mathematics). This means that Borel's conjecture can neither be proven nor disproven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is [[consistent]]).
[[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved in 1928 that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (which is now also known to be independent of ZFC) implies the existence of uncountable strong measure zero sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Sierpiński |title=Sur un ensemble non denombrable, dont toute image continue est de mesure nulle |journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=302–4 |year=1928 |format=PDF |url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm11/fm11136.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 [[Richard Laver|Laver]] used a method of [[forcing (set theory)|forcing]] to construct a model of ZFC in which Borel's conjecture holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Laver |title=On the consistency of Borel's conjecture |journal=Acta Math. |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=151–169 |year=1976 |doi=10.1007/BF02392416 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02392416}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two results together establish the independence of Borel's conjecture.

The following characterization of strong measure zero sets was proved in 1973:
:A set ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' has strong measure zero if and only if ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' for every meagre set ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Galvin |first2=J. |last2=Mycielski |first3=R.M. |last3=Solovay |title=Strong measure zero sets |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |volume=26 |issue= |pages= |year=1973 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This result establishes a connection to the notion of '''strongly meagre set''', defined as follows: 
:A set ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is strongly meagre if and only if ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' for every set ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' of Lebesgue measure zero.
The '''dual Borel conjecture''' states that every strongly meagre set is countable. This statement is also independent of ZFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Timothy J. |last=Carlson |title=Strong measure zero and strongly meager sets |journal=Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=577–586 |year=1993 |jstor=2160341 |doi=10.1090/s0002-9939-1993-1139474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In [[constructive mathematics]], a collection is '''subcountable''' if there exists a [[partial function|partial]] [[surjection]] from the [[natural numbers]] onto it. The name derives from the intuitive sense that such a collection is "no bigger" than the counting numbers. The concept is trivial in classical [[set theory]], where a set is subcountable if and only if it is [[Finite set|finite]] or [[countably infinite]]. Constructively it is consistent to assert the subcountability of some uncountable collections such as the [[real numbers]]. Indeed, there are models of the [[constructive set theory]] CZF in which ''all'' sets are subcountable&lt;ref&gt;Rathjen, M. "[http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/acend.pdf Choice principles in constructive and classical set theories]", Proceedings of the Logic Colloquium, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and models of IZF in which all sets with [[apartness relation]]s are subcountable.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, J. "[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093636613 Subcountability under realizability]", Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, Vol 27 no 2 April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

For example [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] establishes that the real numbers can not be countable but in the constructive interpretation they may still be subcountable.

'''Telelogic AB''' was a [[software]] business headquartered in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]]. Telelogic was founded in 1983 as a research and development arm of [[Televerket (Sweden)|Televerket]], the Swedish department of telecom (now part of [[TeliaSonera]]).  It was later acquired by [[IBM]] Rational, and exists under the IBM software group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=IBM Completes Acquisition of Telelogic AB |publisher=IBM |accessdate=2009-05-29 |date=2008-04-03 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23792.wss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telelogic had operations in 22 countries and had been publicly traded since 1999.  On June 11, 2007, [[IBM]] announced that it had made a cash offer to acquire Telelogic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Telelogic’s Board of Directors recommends the offer from IBM |publisher=Telelogic AB |date=2007-06-11 |url=http://wpy.observer.se/wpyfs/00/00/00/00/00/0A/0A/0D/wkr0010.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 2007, the [[European Union]] opened an investigation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/mergers/cases/index/m94.html#m_4747 |title=EUROPA - Competition - Cases from 4700 to 4749 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the acquisition. On March 5, 2008, European regulators approved the acquisition of Telelogic by the Swedish [[IBM]] subsidiary Watchtower AB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Rapid - Press Releases - EUROPA |publisher=EUROPA |date=2008-05-03 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/387 |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 28, 2008, IBM completed its purchase of Telelogic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IBM Acquires Telelogic |url=http://www.cxotoday.com/India/News/IBM_Acquires_Telelogic/551-88862-908.html |work=CXO Today |publisher=ITNation India Pvt.

'''Underwood Dudley''' (born January 6, 1937) is a [[mathematician]], formerly of [[DePauw University]], who has written a number of research works and textbooks but is best known for his popular writing. Most notable are several books describing [[Crank (person)|crank]] mathematics by people who think they have [[squaring the circle|squared the circle]] or done other impossible things. 
These books, which alternate between appreciation and exasperation, include ''The Trisectors'' (MAA 1996, {{ISBN|0-88385-514-3}}), ''Mathematical Cranks'' (MAA 1992, {{ISBN|0-88385-507-0}}), and ''Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought'' (MAA 1997, {{ISBN|0-88385-524-0}}). They helped him win the [[Trevor Evans Award]] for expository writing from the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) in 1996.

Dudley has also written and edited straightforward mathematical works such as ''Readings for Calculus'' (MAA 1993, {{ISBN|0-88385-087-7}}) and ''Elementary Number Theory'' (W.H. Freeman 1978, {{ISBN|0-7167-0076-X}}). He is the discoverer of the [[Dudley triangle]].

Dudley is a native of [[New York City]].  He received [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree|master's]] degrees from the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Michigan]].  His academic career consisted of two years at [[Ohio State University]] followed by thirty-seven at DePauw University, from which he retired in 2004.  He has edited the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' and the ''Pi Mu Epsilon Journal'', and was a Polya Lecturer for the MAA for two years.

== Lawsuit ==

In 1995, Dudley was one of several people sued by William Dilworth for [[defamation]] because ''Mathematical Cranks'' included an analysis of Dilworth's "A correction in set theory",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Dilworth|first = William|title = A correction in Set Theory|journal = Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters|volume = 62|pages = 205–216|year = 1974|url = http://images.library.wisc.edu/WI/EFacs/transactions/WT1974/reference/wi.wt1974.wdilworth.pdf|accessdate = June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempted refutation of [[Cantor's diagonal argument|Cantor's diagonal method]]. The suit was dismissed in 1996 due to failure to state a claim.

The dismissal was upheld on appeal in a decision written by [[Richard Posner]]. From the decision:  "A [[Crank (person)|crank]] is a person inexplicably obsessed by an obviously unsound idea—a person with a bee in his bonnet. To call a person a crank is to say that because of some quirk of temperament he is wasting his time pursuing a line of thought that is plainly without merit or promise&amp;nbsp;... To call a person a crank is basically just a colorful and insulting way of expressing disagreement with his master idea, and it therefore belongs to the language of controversy rather than to the language of defamation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1343297.html Caselaw: United States Court of Appeals,Seventh Circuit, ruling on Dillworth vs. Dudley, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''virtual finite state machine''' ('''VFSM''') is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[#Virtual Environment|Virtual Environment]]. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input '''control properties''' and of output '''actions'''.

The VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates  the idea of an '''executable specification'''. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation and telecommunication applications.

== Why ==
The major problem by implementing of a state machine is the generation of logical conditions (State transition conditions and Action conditions). In the hardware environment, where state machines have found their original use, this problem does not exist: all signals are Boolean. In contrary the state machines specified and implemented in the software require logical conditions that are per se multivalued ones.

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
-	Temperature can be at least Low , OK, High&lt;br&gt;
-	Commands may have several values: Init, Start, Stop, Break, Continue&lt;br&gt;
-	In a (hierarchical) system of state machines the Slaves state machines have many states that are used in conditions of a Master state machine.&lt;br&gt;
In addition many input signals can be not known due for instance to a broken cable which means that even a digital input signals (considered as classical Boolean values) are in fact 3 values signals: Low, High, Unknown. The Temperature example needs probably also the value Unknown.

A Positive Logical Algebra solves this problem by creating a Virtual Environment which allows specification of state machines for software using multivalued variables.

== Control Properties ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may have one or more values which are relevant for the control &amp;ndash; in such a case it is an input variable. Those values are the control properties of this variable. Control properties are not necessarily specific data values but are rather certain states of the variable. For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED, RUNNING etc...

== Actions ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions - in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be  triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.

== Virtual Environment ==
The virtual environment characterises the environment in which a VFSM operates. It is defined by three sets of names:
*'''input names''' represent the control properties of all available variables
*'''output names''' represent the available actions on the variables
*'''state names''', as defined  for each of the states of the  FSM.
The input names  build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the '''[[positive logic algebra]]'''. The output names  trigger actions (entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions).

A '''virtual finite state machine''' is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[virtual environment]]. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input '''control properties''' and of output '''actions'''.

The VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates  the idea of an '''executable specification'''. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation and telecommunication applications.

== Control Properties ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may have one or more values which are relevant for the control &amp;ndash; in such a case it is an input variable. Those values are the control properties of this variable. Control properties are not necessarily specific data values but are rather certain states of the variable. For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED, RUNNING etc...

== Actions ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions - in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be  triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.

== Virtual Environment ==
The virtual environment characterises the environment in which a VFSM operates. It is defined by three sets of names:
*'''input names''' represent the control properties of all available variables
*'''output names''' represent the available actions on the variables
*'''state names''', as defined  for each of the states of the  FSM.
The input names  build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the '''[[positive logic algebra]]'''. The output names  trigger actions (entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions).

== Positive Logic Algebra ==
The rules to build a virtual condition are as follows:

=== Input Names and Virtual Input ===
A state of an input is described by Input Names which create a set.

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
- for the input A: Anames = {''A1'', ''A2'', ''A3''}&lt;br&gt;
- for the input B: Bnames = {''B1'', ''B2''}&lt;br&gt;
- for the input C: Cnames = {''C1'', ''C2'', ''C3'', ''C4'', ''C5''}&lt;br&gt;
etc.

Virtual Input VI is a set of mutually exclusive elements of input names. A VI contains always the element always.

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always''}&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always'', ''A1''}&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always'', ''A1'', ''B2'', ''C4''}

=== Logical operations on Input Names ===
'''&amp;''' (AND) operation is a set of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
	''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' &amp; ''C2''= &gt; {''A1'', ''B3'', ''C2''}

'''|''' (OR) operation is a table of sets of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' &amp; ''C2'' =&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; B3 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; C2 &amp; \} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''~''' (Complement) is a compliment of a set of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
	 ~''A2'' = {''A1'', ''A3''}

=== Logical expression ===
A logical expression is an OR-table of AND-sets (corresponds to disjunctive form of a boolean expression).

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' | ''A1'' &amp; ''B2'' &amp; ''C4'' | ''C2''  =&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; B3 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; B2 &amp; C4 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; C2 &amp; \} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Logical expressions are used to express any logical function.

=== Evaluation of a logical expression ===
The logical value (true, false) of a logical expression is calculated by testing whether any of the AND-sets in the OR-table is a subset of VI.

=== Output Names and Virtual Output ===
A state of an output is described by Output Names which create a set.

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
for an output Xnames = {''X1'', ''X2''}&lt;br&gt;
for an output Ynames = {''Y1'', ''Y2'', ''Y3''}&lt;br&gt;
Virtual output VO is a set of mutually exclusive elements of output names.

=== Virtual Environment===
The Virtual Name and Virtual Output completed by State Names create a Virtual Environment VE where the behavior is specified.

== VFSM Execution Model ==
[[Image:Virtual finite state machine executor flow chart.gif|thumbnail|Figure 2: VFSM Executor Flow Chart]]
A subset of all defined input names, which can exist only in a certain situation, is called virtual input (VI). For instance temperature can be either "too low", "good" or "too high". Although there are three input names defined, only one of them can exist in a real situation. This one builds the VI.

A subset of all defined output names, which can  exist only in a certain situation is called virtual output (VO). VO is built by the current action(s) of the VFSM.

The behaviour specification is built by a state table which describes all details of all states of the VFSM.

The VFSM executor is triggered by VI and the current state of the VFSM. In consideration of the  behaviour specification of the current state, the VO is set.

Figure 2 shows one possible implementation of a VFSM executor. Based on this implementation a typical behaviour characteristics must be considered.

== State Table ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finite state machine]] --&gt;
:''main page: [[state transition table]].''
A ''state table'' defines all details of the behaviour of a state of a VFSM. It consists of three columns: in the first column state names are used, in the second the virtual conditions built out of input names using the positive logic algebra are placed and in the third column the output names appear:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! State Name
! Condition(s)
! Actions(s)
|-
| rowspan=4 valign="top" | Current state || Entry action || Output name(s)
|-
| Exit action || Output name(s)
|-
| Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| ... || ...
|-
| Next state name || Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| Next state name || Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| ... || ... || ...
|-
|}

Read the table as following: the first two lines define the entry and exit actions of the current state. The following lines which do not provide the next state represent the input actions. Finally the lines providing the next state represent the state transition conditions and transition actions. All fields are optional. A pure combinatorial VFSM is possible in case only where input actions are used, but no state transitions are defined. The transition action can be replaced by the proper use of other actions.

The '''Z notation''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɛ|d}} is a [[Formal specification|formal]] [[specification language]] used for describing and modelling computing systems. It is targeted at the clear specification of [[computer program]]s and computer-based systems in general.

==History==
In 1974, [[Jean-Raymond Abrial]] published "Data Semantics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Jean-Raymond Abrial | first = Jean-Raymond | last = Abrial | contribution = Data Semantics | editor1-last = Klimbie | editor1-first = J. W. | editor2-last = Koffeman | editor2-first = K. L. | title = Proceedings of the [[IFIP]] Working Conference on Data Base Management | publisher = [[North-Holland Publishing Company|North-Holland]] | pages = 1–59 | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used a notation that would later be taught in the [[University of Grenoble]] until the end of the 1980s.  While at EDF ([[Électricité de France]]), Abrial wrote internal notes on Z.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The Z notation is used in the 1980 book ''Méthodes de programmation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Bertrand Meyer | first1 = Bertrand | last1 = Meyer | first2 = Claude | last2 = Baudoin | title = Méthodes de programmation | publisher = [[Eyrolles]] | year = 1980 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Z was originally proposed by Abrial in 1977 with the help of Steve Schuman and [[Bertrand Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Jean-Raymond | last1 = Abrial | first2 = Stephen A | last2 = Schuman | first3 = Bertrand | last3 = Meyer | contribution = A Specification Language | title = On the Construction of Programs | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | editor1-first = A. M. | editor1-last = Macnaghten | editor2-first = R. M. | editor2-last = McKeag | year = 1980 | ISBN = 0-521-23090-X}} (describes early version of the language).&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed further at the [[Programming Research Group]] at [[Oxford University]], where Abrial worked in the early 1980s, having arrived at Oxford in September 1979.

Abrial has said that Z is so named "Because it is the ultimate language!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
 url=http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~hoogeboomhj/praatjes/formalmethods/formalmethods.pdf |
 title=Formal Methods in Software Engineering | first=Hendrik Jan | last=Hoogeboom | publisher=[[University of Leiden]] | location=The Netherland | accessdate=14 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the name "[[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]]" is also associated with the Z notation through its use of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].

==Usage and notation==
Z is based on the standard mathematical notation used in [[axiomatic set theory]], [[lambda calculus]], and [[first-order predicate logic]]. All expressions in Z notation are [[Type (model theory)|typed]], thereby avoiding some of the [[Naive set theory#Paradoxes|paradoxes of naive set theory]]. Z contains a standardized catalogue (called the ''mathematical toolkit'') of commonly used mathematical functions and predicates, defined using Z itself.

Although Z notation (just like the [[APL (programming language)|APL language]], long before it) uses many non-[[ASCII]] symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in [[ASCII]] and in [[LaTeX]]. There are also [[Unicode]] encodings for all standard Z symbols.

==Standards==
[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] completed a Z standardization effort in 2002. This standard&lt;ref name = "Standard"&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Technology — Z Formal Specification Notation — Syntax, Type System and Semantics | chapter-url = http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=21573 | chapter = ISO/IEC 13568:2002 | date = 2002-07-01 | publisher = ISO | url = http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c021573_ISO_IEC_13568_2002(E).zip | format = [[Zip (file format)|Zip]]ped [[PDF]]}}  196 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and a technical corrigendum&lt;ref name = "Corrigendum"&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Technology — Z Formal Specification Notation — Syntax, Type System and Semantics — Technical corrigendum 1 | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=46112 | chapter = ISO/IEC 13568:2002/Cor.1:2007 | publisher = ISO | date = 2007-07-15 | format = PDF}}  12 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; are available from ISO for free:
